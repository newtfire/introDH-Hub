The coffee break is being re-defined . <p> Some of the things that can be seen these days happening at Gwinnett coffeehouses include a doctoral student cranking out her dissertation , city fathers in Bermuda shorts hashing out their town 's future , a faith-filled artist turning a shop 's walls into a fine art gallery , movie buffs enjoying classic films and moms sipping lattes while their kids sit enthralled on their mats in a back room listening to stories . <p> Within the long-established suburban trend of proliferating places offering $4 coffee drinks , there is a subtrend of coffeehouses that see themselves as something more . Their approaches differ , but a common theme is a whole lot of mocha-flavored creativity . <p> These are Gwinnett 's interpretation of " third places , " a term coined in 1989 by urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg . Third places  --  where people gather after homes and offices  --  are crucial to building a sense of community , according to Oldenburg , because they allow people to relax , socialize and enrich each other socially and culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees his Northern Star Coffeehouse as " a hub for the community . " He makes his space in Norcross ' downtown available for groups that otherwise might be meeting in offices , homes , City Hall or the library . <p> While some customers quietly talk or work on their laptops in the front of Northern Star on some mornings , a dozen or so civic leaders push a few tables together and meet in the rear , and a like number of preschoolers listen to the adventures of Amelia Bedelia under a back-patio awning . " We can allow for a lot of things to go on simultaneously , " Luebben said . " It all shows there is intelligent life beyond the Perimeter . " <p> In Suwanee , Leigh Snodgrass seeks nothing less than a revival of the Renaissance at her coffeehouse Firenze ( Italian for Florence , the historical birthplace of the movement ) . <p> " In Europe , the coffeehouses were where the leading artists , musicians and politicians sat and debated the issues of the day , " Snodgrass said . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the outside , looks like just another unit of strip-mall commerce . <p> Inside , however , Firenze is all arches , columns , black leather armchairs and faux plaster walls covered with original abstract art . <p> The downtown areas of Lawrenceville and Buford have similar coffeehouses . In Lilburn , a unit of the Starbucks chain fits the third places definition because of its lakeside location , complete with an outdoor dock and tables at the water 's edge . Lilburn author Hal Runkel used the contemplative atmosphere of that space on Lake Lucerne to write much of his book , " Scream-Free Parenting . " <p> The fine-arts motif at Firenze is due in large part to the artworks of Steve Hickok . He had established himself professionally in the West , showing his work in galleries in Santa Fe , N.M ; Sedona , Ariz. ; and Boulder , Colo . But Hickok said he wanted something deeper and different , so he put aside his painting temporarily and concentrated on his spiritual life . <p> He moved to Atlanta more than a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bridge , a church that meets at Peachtree Ridge High School . He is a friend of Snodgrass , who is the church 's choral director . So when she opened Firenze last March , he allowed her to display his works on her walls . <p> " I was enchanted by the concept of trying something grass roots , bringing gallery-level art to a coffeehouse , " Hickok said . " I have a passion to bring art back to places where it 's not usually seen , " he said . <p> The prices of the works range from $1,500 to $8,500  --  out of the range of the typical coffeehouse patron , but that 's not what 's most important to Hickok . " I want to bring hope back to a world where there 's so much stress and chaos , " he said . <p> The transition from chaos to hope is the theme of " Crimson Journey , " Hickok 's most personal painting displayed at Firenze . It depicts his teenage daughter 's near-fatal car wreck and her miraculous recovery , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toddler respite and to work on her doctoral dissertation without having to commute to her offices at the University of Georgia in Athens . <p> " Sometimes I just need a change of scenery , " Brunell said . " Besides , it 's beautiful here . " <p> Brunell usually ensconces herself in Firenze 's conference room , where she compiles research for her dissertation , tentatively titled " Self Determination Theory and Sexual Motivation in Relationships . " So far , she said , her studies of couples who are dating indicates that the couples " make out " on the average of nine times every two weeks . <p> The Wednesday-morning scene at Northern Star might be called miraculous , in that it 's chaotic yet quiet . <p> This is when the businessmen , elected officials and civic activists who make up the Progressive Development Committee of Norcross push some tables together and hold their regular meeting . <p> Charlie Riehm , a member of the Norcross City Council and assistant chairman of the PDC , said the meetings are " a way to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The group discusses serious issues , such as the state of local schools , politics and historical preservation , but everything 's informal . <p> They come to the coffeehouse because it 's " a neutral environment , " PDC member Pierre Levy said . <p> About the time the PDC starts to scoot the tables back to their original positions , a group of mothers , many of them chasing toddlers while holding onto infants , scurries past to the covered back porch of the coffeehouse . <p> The kids get stories and crafts , and the moms get a break . <p> " It 's really great for Sean , " Maureen McNamara said , referring to her 2 1/2-year-old son . " And Sean 's mom gets to sit and have a latte and visit with the other moms . Everybody 's happy . " <p> Story Hour at Northern Star has become " the highlight of our week , " she said . <p> Luebben said making Northern Star into a heavily used third place is precisely his business strategy . In addition to the Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coffeehouse hosts events such as wine tastings that benefit local charities and sells T-shirts designed by children to raise money for arts programs in local schools . <p> Snodgrass plans to expand the third places menu at Firenze . Currently , she makes a walled-off conference room in the shop available to her customers at no charge . It 's used , for example , by executives who need a quick retreat for an outside-the-office meeting , Snodgrass said . <p> In the future , the walls of the conference room will come down on weekend nights , and the room with be converted to a stage for live entertainment , she said . <p> Firenze 's early success is a testament to the accuracy of the third places philosophy , she said . <p> " Our homes have become little citadels , " Snodgrass said . " We do n't have company over like we used to do . There 's a huge need for spaces where we can just be for a little while .
