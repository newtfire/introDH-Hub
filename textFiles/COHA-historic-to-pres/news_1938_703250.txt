Distribution of more than $6,500 , - 000 in State unemployment insurance to 200,000 jobless persons in this city has reduced the city 's home-relief burden by less than 3 per cent , it was learned last night . In the two months since the payment of insurance benefits began , 3,500 cases have left the relief rolls of the Department of Welfare to derive their full support from the weekly checks of $7 to $15 sent to them by the division of placement and unemployment insurance of the State Labor Department . Fifteen hundred other relief recipients have found their checks from the State inadequate to meet minimum family needs and are receiving supplementary allowances from the Home Relief Bureau . Welfare authorities fear that virtually all of the 3,500 cases dropped from the relief rolls will return when their benefit rights are exhausted in three to sixteen weeks and that in most cases the period of absence will be less than two months . The cases dropped represent about the number of new cases added to home relief each week . No slackening in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the year , but officials acknowledged that the ability of tens of thousands of unemployed workers to claim insurance might have had the effect of warding off a precipitous rise in applications for public assistance . If unemployment insurance has helped many needy persons to defer their initial application for relief , the exhaustion of their right to further benefits will force these persons to turn to relief in a relatively short period unless the State Employment Service or independent effort enables them to find jobs , welfare officers believe . With 183,000 cases now receiving home relief , the dropping of 3,500 cases and the reduction in the relief budgets of 1,500 others seemed likely to cut less than $250,000 from the city 's monthly home relief outlay of $9,700,000 . " Up to this time , " one official said , " unemployment insurance is having very little effect on relief rolls here and that apparently is the experience of the country as a whole .

Many relief recipients had no employment last year and others , working , irregularly at low wages , failed to earn enough to become eligible for insurance . Some critics of the present State law , notably Abraham Epstein , executive secretary of the American Association for Social Security , complain that , by graduating benefits in terms of past wages , the law tends to give greatest protection to those who need it least and to offer little or no aid to those who need it most . Those of this belief contend that unemployment insurance benefits should be determined by the size of a worker 's family and that the insurance and relief systems should be integrated to provide continuing protection through a single agency for those in. need when the benefits to which they are entitled as a matter of right have yin out .

The division of placement and unemployment insurance of the State Labor Department announced yesterday that the 1,000,000th benefit check had been mailed Friday to an unemployed worker in this State . Total payments are above $11,600,000 , with about 60 per cent of the money going to persons in New York City .
