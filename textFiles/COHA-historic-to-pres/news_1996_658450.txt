In a shabby middle-school auditorium , John Updike , America 's preeminent man of letters , is reading aloud so that local library patrons can have chairs . <p> Blade-slim and wearing a blue jacket , Updike has a face of jutting angles that sometimes beams a gleeful smile . Mr. Updike announces deadpan that he does n't do readings often : " I believe that writers should be read and not seen . " <p> But he has a soft spot for libraries . He spent a lot of time in the one in Reading , Penn. , where he spent his childhood . " You can measure the health of a community by the health of its library , " he says . <p> And while the library here in a northern suburb of Boston has just undergone a major renovation , it seems that the money ran out right after the tables were purchased . Updike is one of several local writer-celebrities wooed to help raise money for the chairs . <p> Out of his 40 years of poetry and fiction , Updike chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to steer clear of the steamier stuff . ( This is , after all , the author who scandalized the nation in the late 1960s with his novel , " Couples , " which delved into suburban adultery . ) <p> Starting with poetry , he reads about seagulls , his daughter 's graduation , dour clammers in hip boots , New England history , its obdurate climate , houses , marshes , rock outcroppings , summer people , and church records in " spidery brown ink . " <p> Updike plops nuggets of personal details among the poems . He attributes his early start in writing to his mother , a would-be writer . He went to Harvard College , worked for the New Yorker magazine for a few years , has been married twice , and is a father . He does n't say , but he has written 17 novels , 11 books of short stories , six books of poetry , five children 's books , four collections of essays , a book of art criticism , and a memoir . <p> He spent time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk . One time , looking at a seagull , he felt a poem coming on but did n't have anything to write with . So he found a bit of charcoal from a bonfire and a piece of driftwood , and wrote the first stanza on that . " Then I had to carry it home . " <p> He says writing fiction set in a certain location takes assimilation and acculturation . " You can write a poem about a place almost the night when you get there , " he says . " But ... it was many years before I actually wrote much about New England in the form of fiction . I moved here in 1957 , and " Couples " first jumped into the icy blue water of New England narrative in 1966 . " He launches into the novel 's opening scene . <p> Woven into the reading were his thoughts on writing . " Begin with a thing , not a thought . Or as William Carlos Williams said , ' No thought but in things .

It was an experiment that confirmed my professional opinion that it was not for me . I felt that it uses the same part of your brain that writing does . Thinking about someone else 's stuff , you 're not too apt to go into your own with the requisite innocence and naivete . My father was a teacher , and it took a lot out of him . I was afraid it would take a lot out of me . " <p> On what to read to be a good writer . <p> " Read the classics until you are excited by them , then your first efforts are apt to be an emulation of what excited you . The basic teaching tool writers must use are other people 's books ; the classics . <p> " I read Proust ; Kiekegaard spoke to me urgently . You have to pay attention to Shakespeare - what he 's done no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheever . " <p> " This is an easy question : How do you see yourself in terms of 18th- and 19th-century writers , and how do you want to be seen ? " <p> " That 's not an easy question ! <p> " You have to ask yourself , ' What can I do that these gentlemen - or ladies - have not done . ' As far as ranking yourself with Austin or Dickens , try your best , recognizing that you can not quite write as they did , no matter how excellent and impeccable and masterly their work still is . The social context is gone , and for better or worse , you must write out of today 's truth . In some sense , literature is assured of renewing itself because no two generations are quite exactly alike in history . " <p> Do you use notes or a journal ? <p> " Not much . My theory is that it should be so simple that you can carry it in your head . <p> " Quite often I begin with a fairly dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the character wants to appear that he or she will appear . " <p> Have you ever written yourself into a corner so tight that you had to throw out work ? <p> " I had to abandon a couple of longish books . One was about high school . I knew about high schools from two angles : I went to one , and my father taught in one . I loved the smell of wax and chalk . To me it was home in a funny way . Yet I could n't ... The book just gathered pages , but did n't gather momentum or meaning . I was reading it to my wife , and I said , ' This is pretty bad , is n't it ? ' And she could n't deny it . <p> " I 'm in a kind of corner now , and do n't know how I 'll get out . In general , you avoid these corners if you wait to begin until you have a picture of the whole arc of the book . Most books have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the coronation of a new couple .

I thought if I worked three hours a day and completed three pages a day at least , that should move matters along , and so it 's been .
