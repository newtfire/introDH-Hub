ARTICLE 1. - GOVERNMENT BY PARTY . IT . THE PARTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION . THE South accepted the results of the war it had provoked as men of courage always accept the inevitable , with uncomplaining and entire submission . It could not with dignity have done otherwise . The appeal to arms is the ultima ratio of peoples as much as of any king . To have revived at the polls , where it was admitted only by the magnanimity of its conquerors , the issues it had risked and lost on the battle-field , would have been a violation of its parole of honor . In any case , whatever aggressiveness of temper was left to it must have yielded in the reaction of an exhausting effort and the lassitude that belongs to lost causes . So the constituency which had dictated the policy of the State for forty years disappeared for the time from the political arena , to give place to the new one of enfranchised slaves , who , counted before as the brute basis of Southern representation , were now counted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the northern wing of the Democracy was a good deal more complicated without being practically different . // In spite of the open disloyalty of some of its leaders and the disaffection of many more , it had furnished its full portion of the host which saved the country ; in other words , the Democrats joined the Republicans for all the purposes which made the Republican party what it was . Discredited by ancient complicities , mutilated by the war , excluded from the possibility of speedy return to power , and destitute of any principles of its own applicable to the state *of affairs , it still kept its footing everywhere with a bold front and in some constituencies its old supremacy ; a signal proof of the persistence of political feelings and habit , and the almost indestructible quality of party organization among a free people . But in all national affairs its policy like that of the South , was distinctly one of acquiesceuce , abstention , and expectancy . This left the Republican party in undivided and unobstructed possession of the power of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective opposition . The only constraint put upon it was the necessities and logic of the situation ; the strength of its own convictions , the inevitable consequences of a triumphant policy . In these circumstances the 13th Amenduient to the Constitution was submitted for ratification on the 1st of February , 1864 , the 14th on the 16th of June , 1866 , and the ratification of the 15th and last was published on the 30th of March , 1870 . With the exception of the first clause of Art . XIV . these great instruments , like the Decalogue , are a series of prohibitions . They declare all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens thereof , but they do not directly confer freedom , or the suffrage , or the right to equal representation , upon any man . They say simply that there shall be no slavery , no unequal representation by which any State profits , and no abridgment of the right to vote on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the greatest achievement of political construction in the annals of any people . And they are the work of the Republican party . In ten years it had taken the government , conquered , and reclaimed a revolted population , extinguished slavery , and given its final form to the constituency ; that is , it had completed // the definitions of the first great era of our history , had brought out into the light of day and assured for all time the fundamental and sovereign principle of our polity . With performance of this magnificent description behind it , with the resolute majority , the organization , the discipline and the momentum it brought out of the war and the years that wound up the work of the war , the Republican party entered the new era of tranquil politics with what looked like an overwhelming superiority and an inalienable possession of power . It did not seem possible that any inattention of the masses , any perversity or blundering of the leaders , could wear out its capital or put the government within reach of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissive . Who could have foreseen that in this very discomfiture and acquiescence lay the real peril ; that no reverse at the polls or mere ejection from office could be more fatal to the ruling majority than the conversion of the minority to its way of thinking , the practical agreement of all men upon the ideas which , while in dispute , had given it distinctive character and reason of being . Absurd as it would have sounded at the time to say so , the very victory which seemed to secure its hold upon power was the signal that its mandate was exhausted and its mission fulfilled . There was nothing more left for it to do for there were now none of its requisitions which anybody resisted , no part of its doctrine not incorporated in the constitution of the State and the common property of the people . Its theoretical and moral identity had vanished in universal assents . It followed that what we may call the psychological condition of the party , rather than its prestige or its power , became the controlling factor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any distinctive principle of its own , it was left without any motive of action ; convinced that it had nothing more to do , it relinquished all purpose of doing anything . There still remained to it the party organization and the possession of the government . But the integrating principle , the powerful unanimity which had held it together , was gone . The structure stood for years apparently as animate and vigorous as ever ; in spite of recent reverses is still standing ; only // the functional unity was wanting , and when it went , the counterevolution , that is  --  the long process of dissolution-set in . Men who have been held for years by intense convictions and stern purpose will be held long after by sheer reminiscence and the force of habit , but the bonds are looser and lighter and daily become more so . The vitality of the whole organism was fatally impaired , its tone lowered , its cohesion relaxed . Within the precincts of the party itself an abundance of material was set free for indefinite dispersion or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leaders tightened the girths and plied the astringents of party discipline ; in the absence of any constraining motive the laxity was incurable and progressive . Decomposition of old tissue , absorption of the material into other organisms , this had been the fate of the Whig and Federal parties , it had nearly been that of the Democracy , when left without an available policy by hopeless defeats . It is the impending fate of the Republican party , whose policy has gone out of its keeping on the flood-tide of victory , unless it finds another worth believing in and fighting for . At the same time , as the parties and sections of parties went out of politics one after the other , the victors and the vanquished alike , men everywhere returned by a common impulse to the long neglected field of private affairs and business enterprise , where party distinctions disappear and a people finds its real meeting-ground and reunion . It was perfectly right as it was of urgent necessity that they should do . Politics , that is the doings of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper business of any civilized community ; they are the art of providing the conditions which enable business to be transacted . We can not spend our lives in wrangling at the polls or puttiug one another to death to get the opportunity of living . The State is there precisely for the purpose of getting it for us ; it is intolerable that its inefficiency or disorders should impose the very burdens it was meant to remove and get in the way of the very interests it was meant to promote . Mr. Bagehot has noticed the reproach against us as a nation , that we are not " specially addicted to politics , " but not the explanation , that we are addicted to the thousand higher ends for which politics furnish , or are intended to furnish , the com // mon means . We are capable of putting the entire resources of the conntry into them when any public emergency requires it , but not of leaving them there when the emergency has passed . So while the South betook itself to the desolate task of clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dislocated society , the North , elated with the consciousness of victorious and inexhaustible power , with that indefinable sense of " massed combination " which is the support and inspiration of all private enterprise , beat its swords into ploughshares and its spears into pruning-hooks all over the land . It has had its reverses and made its blunders as in the precipitations of the war , and for much the same reason that it was taken unawares by the surprises of a situation it had itself created ; but on the whole nothing has been more admirable in its history than the way it went about its work . It has even floated on the rising tide of its prosperity the stranded craft of the South , and we may say that the United States is to-day the greatest producing power in the world , as in 1865 it was the first of destructive powers . The misfortune was that this immense development of industrial en*ergies , along with the cessation of all hearty political activity , brought about a rapid and general decline of political intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose the American people has never done so little real thinking in matters of public concern , or shown so little real capacity to think as since the first administration of Grant . We went unheedingly , as for that matter all great populations are apt to go , out of one phase of social evolution into another . To this day we have hardly begun to realize that the settlement of the questions as to the political relations of persons and of classes which had divided us from the foundation of the State and which still obstruct the progress of all other civilized societies , was an historical event of the first rank , whose effect was to unmask the nation in its genuine character as an industrial community and to set it free for its proper work . No one saw at the time , or saw clearly and fully , that the very conditions of life had been changed for 50,000,000 of people , or that the revolution in their affairs created a new situation and raised a new problem in politics , // full of false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toughest materials of party organization . At the moment when everybody was absorbed in his own share of inflowing prosperity , a thousand rival enterprises clamoring for immunities or support at the hands of the State , drew men together from the opposite poles of party allegiance into the strangest alliances . To the political apathy left by the war was added without warning the disarray , the confusion worse confounded , brought by the myriad distractions of returning peace . Thus everything contributed to faire le vide around the government on the eve of new emergencies ; to give it over to whatever employment of public power its own interest and its unexpected opportunities suggested . Down to the close of the war it had been held to its appointed work , as in a vice , between two opposing forces , the nurelaxing pressure of the popular will behind it and the military power of the rebellion . Whatever personal cupidities or ambitions the newly elected representatives had taken into office with them  --  and how many they were appeared in the scandalous fortunes and ruined reputations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the governing class against the people , by the tremendous constraints of the situation . The only policy possible to it was one of disinterested concern for the safety of the commonwealth , the only object for which power could be used the overthrow of the enemy . But when one upon the other the rebellion collapsed and the supporting party fell away , when all aggressive opposition ceased around it , all impulsion died out within , and the intermingling people went back in mass to the absorbing pursuits of peace , the government escaped into the open like an elastic body freed from compression . The instincts natural to men everywhere who are entrusted with an unguarded power , flowed together and came to the front . What the effect was upon the governing body itself we shall have occasion to consider farther on . What first concerns us in the nature of the power abandoned in this way to its keeping , and exactly how far it was available for interested purposes in the new situation of affairs . // Now public power , the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people to its agents to be used for the benefit of the people . This is the abstract general theory expressed in the constitution of all political societies , but like other notions of the sort it acquires practical efficiency only upon reduction to distinct definitions which determine exactly how the power is to be furnished to the government , and how having been furnished it is to be employed . Thus to say that it is to be furnished by the people amounts to saying that it is to be furnished by the whole people and not by a particular part of it ; but this is a barren truism until methods of collecting the power have been adopted which secure every part from contributing more or less than the uniform proportion for all . In the absence of such binding definitions and fixed methods the government may easily impose the heaviest burdens and confer the most desirable privileges , it may punish its adversaries , reward its friends and strengthen its position , by drawing more than the quota from one portion of the constituents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truism that the power must be used for the common benefit of the people , comes to nothing practically until the method and specific object of using it have been precisely settled ; for it may be as easily applied to the benefit or injury of a class , as created at the expense of one . All the abuses of government may be summed up as discriminations and inequalities either in the creation or in the employment of power ; all the progress of political society as the better definition of the way in which power is to be created or employed . So far as the definitions in force are inadequate or inexact there will be a residnum of power , and remaining opportunities for the use of it , available to the government for its own purposes . As has been sufficiently shown , this process of political evolution had gone farther with the American people than with any other . For a hundred years it had been coming into agreements which imposed definitions of the most restrictive character upon the power of the State , until in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituents , so that no man 's life , or liberty , or toil could be taken , no man 's franchises invaded , rather than another 's ; or favored with larger // immunities and privileges than another 's . So far as the person of the constituent and the extent of the constituency were concerned , all possibility of discriminations profitable to the government had ceased ; it could no longer strengthen its position by helping or hnrting anybody because upon all these points the people had fully made up its mind . To take the obvious illustrations first , it could not multiply and reward its friends by admission to the ranks of an aristocracy ; nor could it reduce its enemies to slavery as any old tyrant would have done , or drive them into exile as Louis XIV . did or disfranchise them , as for a moment it was itself tempted to do at the close of the Rebellion . Certain necessary precautions of the sort were actually taken , of which curious traces still survive in the law , but all as temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbarisms like these , whether in the creation or the use of power , are far behind us , and to that extent the government is less free to act in its own behalf than it was before . What is more pertinent and interesting is that a whole set of instrumentalities still in full play in other communities is not available here . Thus , unlike a British ministry , the administration can not overcome a hostile majority in the upper House by creating new senators , for the right of equal representation is secured to all the States ; or , what is still closer to the purpose , overcome one in the lower House by creating new constituencies , for the constituency is complete . English statesmen of our time are perhaps as great a race of public men as the world has seen , but a very large part of the power they dispose of in their party strifes arises from some inequality in the constituency , the presence of a great body of subjects degraded below their fellows by exclusion from the suffrage , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure for them the right of voting . In this way the liberties of Englishmen have regularly grown for fifty years as an incident of parliamentary debate , every new Reform Bill representing a strait of one or other of the rival parties . But an American ministry has no power to increase its majority and intimidate its enemies by enfranchising anybody , because everybody , except the women , has got the franchise . The Republicans shot the last bolt in the 15th Amendment to the Constitution . // Of all the powers of the State therefore , there remains but one imperfectly defined and available for partizan or personal uses , namely the money power . There are clustered all the surviving abnses of our system , there alone is the necessity for reforms , that is , for further definitions of public power . But now to appreciate the immense latitude and the opportunities for interested action still left to our representatives , we must never forget that money has come to be the equivalent and substitute for most other things , and that in a society like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of money . We no longer send up , as in ruder times we should have had to do , a portion of our number or of our substance to fill the armies and offices of the government , to build its forts , and navies , and palaces , to fight its battles and do its work ; we contribute the equivalent of all these things , and with this equivalent the government hires or buys in the open market the men , the labor , and the material it requires . There are a thousand advantages about this . Money as the common medium of exchange admits of the most varied uses and the widest distribution both when the people pays it in and when the government pays it out . If we were to make direct contribution of power in the form in which it is to be finally used , say 100,000 men , or so much labor , or so much building material , nearly the whole burden would take effect where it fell ; but the equivalent of these things may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his proportional part of the whole . Or were the government obliged to handle men , labor and material without an equivalent , it could in no way adjust its requisitions to prospective necessities or actual expenditure to specific cases . Whatever was lacking could not be promptly provided , whatever was left over would be wasted or lost . We may say that absolutely the only form in which power can be created at the cost , and ap . plied for the benefit , of the whole people , is the form of money . But the very properties which fit money for these nice and varied uses , its persistent uniformity of substance and value , its divisibility and portability , facilitate the careless or unscrupulous employment of it . There is no material or form of // force admitting of such easy manipulation and of so many disguises as the common medium which may be converted at will into them all . A requisition for 100,000 men can not be made in the dark , or its effects , whether in raising them or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be plain at once where the burden of providing them falls and who is benefitted or hurt by the work they are set to do . But a requisition for $100,000,000 can be divided up among the contributors so minutely and in so many ways , it can be exchanged for such a multitude of other things , that the most acute observer may be puzzled about it and the attention of the public completely disconcerted . This however is far from being the whole of the matter . Money as the equivalent and substitute for other things has been in use among peoples of all degrees of civilization . In later times we have brought to perfection a wonderful substitute for money itself , the promise to pay money by and by . In this way any one of us in the measure of his credit is able to add to the purchasing power of the wealth he actually possesses that of the wealth he is expected to acquire later on ; while the government , which has a continuous identity and a long credit , is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a single transaction it can amass an immense purchasing power at a given moment and at the same time distribute the burden of it , not only in space but in time , not only among the contemporary population which is directly concerned and may be supposed to have its eyes open , but among its successors who ca n't help themselves and for whom nobody cares . Granted to the government , what in fact is never wanting , an ample credit , it is difficult to imagine power in a shape more unprotected and unhampered , easier of creation , freer from all strictness of accountability , than this . And this is the shape , which wherever it comes from or whithersoever it goes , sooner or later it must assume . Thus at that very point of transition where it most needs watching , and by virtue of those very conditions which perfect its processes and increase its efficiency , public power has grown diffuse , evasive and occult . As the scope and the magnitude of its transactions increase , as greater drafts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work done , it retires from the public gaze to operate mysteriously in a fog of endless and unintelligible detaiL When we say therefore that none of the powers of the State are now left to the discretion of its trustees and agents but the power to raise and to expend money , we must add at the same time that this last has gone far to absorb all the others in its inscrutable functions , and that the government has at once a more potent instrument and a larger immunity for mischief than it had before . lit can store up unsuspected reserves of power , and liberate its reserves for unsuspected purposes , in silence and the dark , with nobody perhaps very much the wiser for it . This description applies to the functions of all civilized States of our time . Whatever the collective strength of the community may be it becomes available for public purposes only upon conversion into the universal medium of exchange , and is actually availed of only upon conversion over again into the requisite forms of material force ; so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abstruseness of financing upon its largest scale . But the description does not cover the quite extraordinary conditions in which this power was abandoned to the safe keeping of our government at the close of the civil war .
