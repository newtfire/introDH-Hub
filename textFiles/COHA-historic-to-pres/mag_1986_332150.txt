; The storm had been gathering around Party Chief Babrak Karmal for months . In February , at the 27th Communist Party congress in Moscow , the Afghan leader , who first came to power when Soviet troops stormed Kabul in December 1979 , was denied a private audience by Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev . The following month Karmal abruptly disappeared from view , even failing to show up at his country 's Revolutionary Day parade  --  the equivalent , noted a Western diplomat in Islamabad , of " staying away from one 's own birthday party . " Meanwhile , the Soviet newspaper Pravda ran a front-page story attacking Karmal 's failure to build a stable base of support for his Communist regime . Rumors had it that the Afghan chieftain was visiting the Soviet Union for treatment of a lung problem or leukemia . But many observers suspected that his problems were more than medical . <P> Three days after he returned from Moscow , their suspicions proved correct : Radio Kabul announced that Karmal was stepping down to assume the ceremonial position of President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 39 , a doctor known for his hard-line fidelity to Moscow and his ruthless efficiency for the past five years as head of Khad , the dread Afghan secret police . Although the transition was managed peacefully  --  the previous three Afghan leaders had been killed during transfers of power  --  Soviet tanks took up positions in the hills outside Kabul , and armored units patrolled the city to prevent a violent backlash from Karmal loyalists . The leadership change seems to have been timed to highlight a major Soviet military offensive in the eastern part of the country and coincide with the opening of the seventh and last round of the Afghan-Pakistani peace talks in Geneva . <P> Some Western analysts were inclined to downplay the shift . As one Washington official joked , " The puppeteer now has a new puppet . " Certainly Najibullah , a loyal protege of Karmal 's , seems unlikely to lead his country in any radically new directions . However , having built the secret police into a disciplined , KGB-style network of 60,000 agents , the major general may bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Najibullah is , says a European diplomat in Islamabad , " an efficient killer . " <P> Unlike Karmal , who is a member of the small , Dari-speaking elite , Najibullah has the advantage of belonging to the country 's dominant Pushtu tribe . The new leader is therefore well placed to get fellow Pushtuns in Pakistan to cut guerrilla supply lines and unify the ranks of a regime so sharply divided that it is sometimes referred to as an example of " two-party Communism . " If Najibullah can consolidate a solid and loyal Soviet-style government , Moscow may feel secure enough to withdraw its 120,000 troops from Afghanistan .
