" What started out as a tale of female independence veers into romance . Leo awakens Anna to feelings she has never known before : " I became with him , finally , a passionate person . " Besotted with her new lover , Anna does not notice that her daughter is being exposed to some unfamiliar experiences . When Leo stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . On one occasion , the child comes to their bed while they are making love . On another , when Anna is away at work , Molly watches Leo take a shower ; what follows is either a brief , innocent mistake or an instance of child molesting , depending on who makes the judgment . Molly 's father , hearing his little daughter talk of this event , goes understandably bananas and instigates legal proceedings to wrest custody of the child from her mother .
