wards . But a varied list of feminine names appears . There is the robust Mary Owens , with whom his courtship seems mainly to have consisted in en ? deavors to persuade her that she would do better not to marry him . There is a more shadowy Sarah Rickard . And there is Matilda Edwards , sister-in-law of the lady with whom her own sister , Mary Todd , was also staying . But the substantial charms of Mary , and her decided habit of getting what she wanted , in the end fixed the rather wandering lover , and in 1840 they were definitely engaged . Here we strike one of the most de ? bated points in Mrs. Lincoln 's life , and in dealing with the course of this en ? gagement we are at once confronted with the question of Herndon 's veracity . It seems to me that his essential tone and attitude in general must be regarded as satisfactory . At the same time , after the industrious researches of Miss Tarbell , it is difficult to accept in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coln 's love affair . According to Hern ? don , the day for the wedding was actu ? ally fixed , the supper ' was ordered , the bride arrayed , the parson present ? and the bridegroom failed to appear , tor ? mented by doubts and hesitations ap ? proaching mental derangement . The disturbance was so great that Lincoln 's friends for a time feared suicide . Without pronouncing positively on the more highly colored features of this nar ? rative , we may regard the indisputable facts as curious enough . It is certain that the crigagnnent was broken , certain that Lincoln a year later referred to the " fatal first of January , 1841 " ? the day which , according to Herndon , was set for the wedding . Also we have the re ? markable series of letters to Speed , a near friend who was wooing and marry ? ing at the same time , in which Lincoln uncovers his tormented soul ? a soul clearly well-versed in all the tortures of self-analysis , self-criticism , and self-reproach . In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his engage-merit " he should have been entirely happy but for the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy whom have contributed to make so . That kills my soul . I can not but reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise . " Then Speed marries and likes it , which impresses Lincoln , and somehow or other Mary regains her control , and on the fourth of November , 1842 , the two are married very simply and quietly . In a letter of Lincoln 's only quite recently published there is this admirable phrase , turned with a delicate significance which Lamb or Touchstone might have envied , " Nothing new here , except my marry ? ing , which to me is matter of profound wonder . " It is matter of profound wonder to most of us , and we endeavor , without much success , to find out how it hap ? pened . To begin with , what was Mary 's motive ? why did a woman so proud as she seek to retain a lover who appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic . He asserts that Mary 's pride was so bitterly wounded that she married Lincoln simply to make his life miserable , purely for revenge . Even put in more rational fashion , with the idea that she was a person who per ? sisted relentlessly in getting what she had once wanted , the explanation is scanty . There is also the theory that Mary was ambitious and that she fore ? saw Lincoln 's future , even preferring him in this regard to so promising a candidate as Douglas . Something there may be in this : she was a keen-sighted woman and she is said to have prognosti ? cated her husband 's success from the start . But I think we must add that she loved him , felt instinctively the charm which so many men felt , the almost inexplicable charm which went with that strange , ungainly figure of whom an early friend could say , " he was the ungodliest figure I ever saw . " In the same way I feel that probably something in her fascinated Lincoln . His conscience forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say others . Both may have contributed . He was mor ? bidly sensitive . He was indolent and in some ways easily led . Yet I have no doubt he loved her ; and that quick , narrow , masterful spirit gained and kept a hold over his vaguer and more fluid one . I imagine that the love on both sides persisted to the end . Herndon insists that there was no love at all . To Mr. Rankin the whole affair apparently seems a sweet idyl of uninterrupted bliss . It was probably just an average earthly marriage , with an increasing bond of association overcoming all sorts of wear and tear and pulling and haul ? ing . Lincoln could never have been a comfortable husband for any wife . His casual ways , his irregular habits , his utter disregard of the conventions and small proprieties of life would have worn on a far more tranquil patience than Mary Todd 's . And her patience was not tranquil at all ? in fact , existed only very slightly . Her violent out ? bursts of temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to put aside altogether the scenes of furious , disgraceful public jealousy de ? scribed by Badeau and confirmed by General Sherman . Lincoln took it all quietly , though it must have wrung his heart ; smiled , patted her on the shoul ? der , called her his child-wife , and she was ashamed of herself ? and did it again . But what has afforded infinite enter ? tainment to the inquiring biographer , and what I think must be equally enter ? taining to the sympathetic reader , is the violent contrast with which the same simple facts may be stated according to the prejudice of the person who states them . Take the two extremes , Herndon and Mr. Rankin : their analysis of Lin ? coln 's married life can not but be in ? structive as well as diverting . First , there is Lincoln 's absence from home . He left on every excuse , Hern ? don says . He lived in his office . Where other lawyers returned from their workto the comfortable fireside , he lingered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that daily tor ? mented him . All a mistake , says Mr. Rankin . He was a great deal from home , attending to necessary business , and why ? Because he had such a cora ? pctent , careful , devoted wife that his presence at home was entirely unneces ? sary . Take clothing . Mrs. Lincoln was always fussing about her husband 's dress . Again , explains the unfailing Mr. Rankin , this was all a matter of health . He was threatened with con ? sumption and her loving care in seeing that he was properly clothed may have saved his life . It was the same with food and regularity at meals . Innumer ? able stories are told of her sending arbi ? trarily , at the most inconvenient times , to insist upon his attendance ; and even appearing herself , with some indulgence of shrewish tongue . Wrong , wrong , urges Mr. Rankin . She may have spoken quickly , but affectionate anxiety about his health was at the bottom of it all . The best is the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon Lincoln 's reluctance when even the bona fide wedding day arrived . Speed 's little boy , says Hern ? don , seeing the bridegroom so finely dressed , inquired where he was going . " To hell , I suppose , " was the gloomy rejoinder . Oh , cries Mr. Rankin , cruel , cruel , even to imagine that he could have uttered such a word ! There was the wedding-ring ? did not Lincoln have engraved in it the tender sentiment " Love is eternal " ? Innocent Mr. Rankin ! he apparently does not re ? member Jaques 's remark to Orlando , " You are full of pretty answers . Have you not been acquainted with gold ? smith 's wives and conned them out of rings ? " I will not suggest that the sentiment may have emanated from Mary herself , though there have been such instances . But alas , we all know how many rings with similar mottoes European voyage , I felt in my heart in ? clined to sigh that poverty was my por ? tion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined my next husband shall be rich " ? which of course was agreeable for him . But the most pitiable exhibition in regard to Mrs. Lincoln 's finances is Mrs. Keckley 's story of the debts incurred from real or supposed ne ? cessities of dress to keep up the presiden ? tial dignity . The maddening pressure of these doubled the wife 's anxiety as to the chances of the second election in 1864 . It must not he supposed that Mrs. Keckley 's record of conversations which took place is verbally exact , but it is surely close to reality in its general tone . She says to Mrs. Lincoln , " And Mr. Lincoln does not even suspect how much you owe ? " And the answer is " God , no This was a favorite expres ? sion of hers . ' And I would not have him suspect . If he knew that his wife was involved to the extent that she is , the knowledge would drive him mad . He does not know a thing about my debts , and I value his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to allow him to know anything . ' " Such are the domestic tragedies of money . It is with her children that Mrs. Lin ? coln is most attractive . Both she and Lincoln were devoted to them : he in his gentle , humorous , abstracted fashion , she with no doubt erratic but effusive and genuine demonstrations of tender ? ness . She was interested in their educa ? tion , in their health , in their mental and moral development . But fate was as cruel to her in the maternal as in the conjugal relation , and she lived to bury three of her four sons . The eldest died in the early days in Springfield . The youngest , Tad ? who was her chief con ? solation after her husband 's death , so that she wrote , " Only my darling Taddie prevents my taking my life " ? was snatched away in 1871 . But the death of Willie , in the midst of the at once anguished and triumphant days in the White House , was the bitterest blow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led her into fantastic ecstasies of passion till the crisis came in the strange scene so vividly related by Mrs. Keckley when Lincoln took his wife by the arm and led her to the window . " With a stately , solemn gesture , he pointed to the lunatic asylum , ' Mother , do you see that large white building on the hill yonder ? Try to control your grief or it will drive you mad , and we may have to send you there . " ' Yet , with the curious perversity of fortune which attended so much of Mrs. Lincoln 's life , even her sorrow as a mother , which would seem as if it ought to have won her public respect , and doubtless did so , was turned by her inborn tactlessness into an element of unpopularity . The military band had been in the habit of playing in the square near the White House . But Mrs. Lincoln 's reminiscent grief could not endure the music and she insisted upon its being stopped for months , till the people became so indignant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but sympathize with Mrs. Keck ? ley 's exclamation , even if it is a little exaggerated , " I never in my life saw a more peculiarly constituted woman . Search the world over , and you will not find her counterpart . " And she was married to a man as strange as herself and as strangely different . Now , having established Mrs. Lin ? coln 's general character as far as it is possible to do so , we come to the pro ? foundly curious and interesting study of her relation with her husband , and this should begin with the history of their marriage . In early life Lincoln seems to have had a susceptible imagination in regard to women ? the more susceptible , perhaps , because he had so little to do with them . His profound affection in his twenties for Ann Rutledge , which has been em ? broidered by so many story-tellers , and her melancholy death , almost unhinged him for the time and Herndon insists that he never really loved anyone after accepting the governorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Rankin ; because she did not want to go off into the woods , say Nicolay and Hay . And in other cases she exerted a pressure which was strong and perhaps effective . But as in army matters , so in politics it was the human side that interested her , and she criticized Seward and Chase just as savagely as she criticized Grant . Also she was much inclined to work on human agents where it was possible . Russell complains that she was open to flattery and filled her parlors with " men who would not be received in any re ? spectable private house in New York . " Her own explanation of this procedure ? in the dialogue with Mrs. Keckley , bear ? ing on the election of 1864 ? is pro ? foundly interesting : " In a political can ? vass it is policy to cultivate every ele ? ment of strength . These men have in ? fluence , and we require influence to re ? elect Mr. Lincoln . I will be clever to them until after the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , I will drop every one of them , and let them know very plainly that I only made tools of them . They are an unprincipled set , and I do n't mind a little double-dealing with them . " When Mrs. Keck-ley inquires if Mr. Lincoln knows , the answer is , " God , no ! be would never sanction such a proceeding , so I keep him in the dark , and will not tell him till all is over . " Somehow in these po ? litical concerns Mrs. Lincoln reminds one at times of Mr. Strachey 's Victoria . There is the same dignified yet dumpy figure ; the same round , hard , positive , dominating face . And one can not but think of the remark of an Englishman to , Mrs. Fields , which Mr. Strachey would enjoy , " We call her ' Her Un ? gracious Majesty . ' " It is clear enough that back of Mrs. Lincoln 's political interest , and indeed back of all her life , there was a tremen ? dous driving force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more am ? bition or he . They were different in this as in everything . His ambition was vague , dreamy , fitful , mystical . Hers was narrower , more concrete ; but it never rested and went straight at its ends . How much we are to believe of the apparently well-authenticated stories of her aiming at the White House almost from infancy is a question . Any girl may aim at the White House , I suppose . No doubt some millions do who never get there . Perhaps the most impressive anecdote on the subject is Lamon 's ac ? count of his first talk with her , in 1847 . It is a little hard to accept , but striking if you do accept it . " Yes , " she said , " he is a great favorite everywhere . He is to be President of the United States some day ; if I had not thought so , I never would have married him , for you can see he is not pretty . But look at him ! Does n't he look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That a woman should speak thus of her hus ? band in her first interview with a stranger is extraordinarily significant , if you can believe it . And Lamon 's re ? peated emphasis of the word " magnifi ? cent " gives the story somewhat greater credibility . At any rate she got to the White House and reigned there through four of the greatest years in the history of the country . I wish I had a little more authority for the seemingly sane and not unfavorable account of her White House life given by Mr. Willis Steell ? the immense effort for popularity and social success and supremacy , ending in satiety and disappointment : " The ' court ' she set up had turned into a mock bubble , shining in iridescent colors only in her imagination ; created from sordid materials , and wholly empty . " Then the triumphant election of 1864 set the crown upon it all , if crown there was . In April , 1865 , the war was over . On the afternoon of the fourteenth Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , so much so that Mary 's ill-divining soul presaged the woe to come . He talked to her of well-earned rest , of Lincoln 's soul " inhabited the obvious . " The remote , gloomy , mysterious spirit ? ual regions haunted by him , whether he was smiling or praying , were hardly likely to be visited by her . Thousands of pages have been written about Lin ? coln 's religion : he still smiles and re ? mains impenetrable . Yet it is curious that , after all , the practical , everyday , unmystical wife should have : given us what is perhaps the very best summary on this point ( italics mine ) : " Mr. Lin ? coln had no faith and no hope in the usual acceptation of those words . He never joined a church ; but still , as I believe , he was a religious man by nature . . . . But it was a kind of poetry in his nature , and he was never a techni ? cal Christian . " Excellent example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is wholly linable to appreciate . And with Mrs. Lincoln we come across this at every turn . In dealing with Mrs. Lincoln 's exter ? nal life we are on somewhat surer ground , though not much , for still the cloud of intangible gossip is likely to mislead us . Socially , it is evident that she was ambi ? tious and eager for success . On the whole , it can not be said that she achieved it . Her appearance was by no means against her . Her face , in the photo ? graphs , is to me totally without charm . It is a positive , aggressive face , without a ray of sensitiveness in it . But she had a certain formal beauty and dignity , both of face and figure ( stout as she was ) , and could bear herself well . It would seem that she dressed with taste , though at times too ostentatiously , and Lincoln objected to her extreme low necks . There are pleasant accounts of the Lincoln hospitality in Springfield . As to what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it must be remem ? bered that few hostesses have been sub ? jected to such cruel criticism as Mrs. Lincoln had to meet . Those who watched her impartially , like W. H. Russell , Ban ? croft , and Laugel , report in the main favorably , though it is noticeable that they are inclined to speak of her as better than they expected . The truth is , her ardent and impulsive temper made her tactless and uncertain . The basis of her social zeal was rather an intense ambi ? tion than a broad human sympathy ; and for the widest popularity and success the latter is indispensable . Then it must always be remembered that she had that strange , incalculable , most undomestic and unparlorable figure of Lincoln to carry with her , which would have been a terrible handicap to any woman . His dress was strange , his manners were strange , his talk was strange . He would not lay himself out to please his wife 's callers . So , if the poor lady failed , it must be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeping and domestic ar ? rangements she seems to have been ex ? cellent . Her table is highly spoken of and she was an exact and careful man ? ager as to neatness and punctuality . Here again her husband was far from being a help to her . He was quite indif ? ferent to what he ate , and it was impos ? sible to make him systematic about meals or hours generally . The remote world in which he lived was but imper ? fectly accessible to the tinkle of the dinner-bell . As regards the most essential element of domestic happiness , money , he was unsystematic also . In his legal business he could not be kept to exact account ? ing , had no commercial or speculative instinct whatever . But he was no spender , had few needs and no costly tastes , and above all he abhorred debt , though circumstances sometimes forced him into it . Mrs. Lincoln no doubt did her best . In the early days she made her own dresses and always she had mo ? ments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay were far different from her husband 's . We have her own written words ? and it is such a comfort when we do have them ? on this subject . " When I saw the large steamers at the New York landing , ready for the
