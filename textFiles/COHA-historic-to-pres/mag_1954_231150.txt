When Physicist K. G. Jansky of Bell laboratories discovered in 1932 that he could pick up radio waves from objects in space , he founded the exciting science of radio astronomy . As the sailors of antiquity had made the most of ancient astronomical findings , the U.S. Navy began studying radio astronomy to see whether a celestial radio signal might be something to steer by . Recently , the Naval Research Laboratory , working with the Collins Radio Co. of Cedar Rapids , Iowa , revealed some details of a radio sextant that can navigate ships by radio waves from space . <P> The " eye " of the radio sextant , according to Radio-Astronomer Fred Haddock of NRL , is a dish-shaped antenna only three feet in diameter . When the receiver is switched on , it readily picks up the radio waves that come from the sun , and automatically turns to a point in the sun 's direction . Then it " locks on , " tracking the sun as long as it is above the horizon . The ship 's navigator can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun through an ordinary optical sextant . No cloudy weather gets in the way of the radio sextant , nor can an enemy jam the radio impluses ( as is possible with other radio aids to navigation , such as Loran ) . <P> The sun , of course , is not around at night , but Haddock believes that mariners may eventually be able to steer by the mysterious " radio stars " that shine only in radio frequencies ( TIME , June 21 ) . Their waves are much weaker than the sun 's , so a bigger antenna will probably be necessary . If navigation equipment can , indeed , be devised to track the radio stars , a ship will never again need be lost in a stormy night .
