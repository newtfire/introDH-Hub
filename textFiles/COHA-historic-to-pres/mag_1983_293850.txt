A close call for the MX ; censure for Studds and Crane <P> Its first test flight in June , from California to the South Pacific , was impressively smooth . But the MX missile 's voyage through Congress last week was a rough one , and the Administration needed all its considerable lobbying skills to save the funding for the beleaguered weapon . Shortly before the House voted 220 to 207 to authorize $2.5 billion to build 27 missiles , the President and Vice President were still calling wavering Congressmen . " Those two are dynamite when it comes to lobbying , " said an admiring White House aide after the narrow victory . <P> It was a crucial win for the Administration , which plans to deploy the 96-ton , ten-warhead missiles in modified Minuteman silos in 1986 . " We need the MX , " President Reagan urged Congress in a letter , " not only for force modernization but to keep the Soviets moving at the negotiation tables . " Expected Senate approval of the funding was held up by a filibuster by Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambasted the missile as a " vulnerable , destabilizing , first-strike weapon . " <P> The close vote in the House reflected a significant shift in sentiment . In May , 91 Democrats voted to restore research and development money for the MX . But last week , only 73 Democrats voted to authorize production money . The defectors , including Majority Leader Jim Wright , were under intense pressure from the Democratic caucus and nuclear-freeze groups . Many Democrats question whether the Administration is sincere about bargaining for arms reductions . " The President himself has shown some flexibility , but it has n't trickled down to his advisers , " said Democratic Congressman Dan Glickman of Kansas . <P> A provision was added reducing the first batch of missiles to 21 . The MX will face another tough test in the fall , when the 1984 defense appropriations bill comes before Congress . Said <P> Tennessee Congressman Albert Gore Jr. : " There has got to be some movement on the negotiations . " <P> Another legislative battle on the Administration 's agenda has been sidestepped . Illinois Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , revealed that Congress would not try to pass a major tax bill this year to offset the projected $200 billion federal deficit . He said there was no point in drafting such a bill , since the Administration is no longer pushing its plan to propose contingency tax measures that would go into effect in late 1985 if needed to reduce the burgeoning deficit . The gathering economic recovery reduces the need for new taxes . Even so , dropping the contingency tax will increase the projected 1986 deficit from $154.6 billion to $196.2 billion . <P> In other action last week , the House was grim as it formally censured Republican Daniel Crane of Illinois and Democrat Gerry Studds of Massachusetts for sexual misconduct with 17-year-old congressional pages . The House Ethics Committee had recommended that the two be given only reprimands , the lightest possible punishment . But prodded by conservative Congressmen , the full House opted for a harsher penalty . Under censure , a lawmaker is stripped of any committee chairmanship ; Studds lost his position as head of the subcommittee on the Coast Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
