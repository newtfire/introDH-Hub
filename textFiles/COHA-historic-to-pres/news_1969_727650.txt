It is the fashion now to protest . Everybody seems to be doing it . For this day we choose to follow the fashion . We protest the . attention , concern , and indulgence that have been accorded to student protesters on university campuses all over the world . We think that they have generated news out of all proportion to their numbers and importance . As a demonstration of our protest we are refraining from printing any news about protesting students today . Tomorrow we shall go back to reporting this . story . It is our responsibility to print the news whether we find it pleasing or repugnant . The students ' violent protests are a puzzling paradox . The campus militants have attacked the traditional , citadels of liberal thought ? the universities . By liberal we mean the pursuit of excellence with that open , active , inquiring , generous , and humane intellectual attitude which has been characteristic of the greatest teachers and scholars . We do not mean the mental attitudes of fanatic devotees to single causes who choose violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our moratorium . To campus radicals we recommend a moratorium and a slogan that is a varient of one of their own : " Make peace , not war . "
