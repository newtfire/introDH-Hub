Harold LeClair Ickes lived in Winnetka , a leafy lake-side suburb of Chicago , for 17 years before Franklin Roosevelt made a national character of him as Secretary of the Interior . If Professor Charles E. Merriam of the University of Chicago were less absentminded , he might have advised his friend Mr. Ickes months ago to change his residence to Chicago , in time for a court to certify him as eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago . In that event , a lot of work might have been saved the Draft-Ickes-for-Mayor Committee headed by Professor Merriam 's colleague , Professor Paul Douglas ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) . <P> Said Mr. Ickes last week : " After consultation with many , including the President , I am convinced that I can do more to help continue the New Deal by staying in harness where I am than by going into this contest in Chicago . " Two days later Honest Harold Ickes visited Chicago , expressed his regrets to his would-be drafters ( " I know you would n't want to kill me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago PWA-financed subway , ran out to Winnetka to inaugurate a grade-crossing project . <P> Mr. Ickes , a onetime Bull Mooser , was to have run , of course , as a New Deal Democrat . His back-out left the field to Mayor Edward J. Kelly and ambitious State 's Attorney Tom Courtney . Mayor Kelly visited Washington to see what his chances were for Jim Farley 's support . <P> Onto the stage of Chicago 's Medinah Temple , bag-jowled , loud-mouthed William Hale Thompson , thrice Mayor of Chicago and ready to try once more at 69 , last week threw his ten-gallon campaign sombrero while friends yowled : <P> Happy times are here again ! <P> Big Bill will be our Mayor again ! <P> To oppose Mr. Thompson for the Republican nomination , respectable citizens drafted Dwight H. Green , former U. S. District Attorney who put Gangster " Scarface Al " Capone behind bars in 1932.
