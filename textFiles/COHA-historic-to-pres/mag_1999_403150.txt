Can people of middle-class means design and build a knockout house on a moderate budget ? That was the plan . First in a series Photograph THE MONEY PIT ? Refusing to settle for just another vinyl-sided cookiecutter , Daniel Akst and Louise Dewhirst decided to build their own house . // THE PAGES ARRIVED without fanfare or warning , sliding almost furtively out of our fax machine . Yet here they were : the first drawings of what will ultimately become our family 's new house . + If you 'll pardon the expression , we were floored . As far as we could tell , our house was to be a pair of trailerlike objects connected by a long , narrow core containing all the wet stuff : bathrooms , laundry room , plumbing and so forth . It seemed so-dinky . Was this really all our effort and expense would come to ? But when we looked closer , we started to see the glory of the thing , for these were no ordinary trailers . Thirteen feet high and 80 feet long-counting the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with high windows everywhere , the place quickly began to seem awesome . One of the trailers was a giant loftlike space with a wall of towering fenestration . The other big unit , sheltering five private rooms , was segregated from the large public space by the long utility core , whose walls were to be of masonry . We 'd be able to entertain 100 people while our boys slept undisturbed in their beds . Best of all , we hoped the simplicity of the design would give us just what we wanted : modernist splendor on a budget , drama on the cheap , a knockout house for the price of the typical pretentious suburban sprawler . As we were to learn in the months ahead , it was not going to be that easy . The simplicity of the initial design masked some aspects that made it much more expensive than we 'd hoped , and we went through quite a struggle wrestling the costs down to something manageable . We learned that there are powerful financial incentives to build boring , shoddy houses , and bucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 've got to be determined . In the end , we hope , it will all be worth it . Photograph The Akst design is similar to one used by the architects for a house ( above ) in Mississippi . // Lots of people like to fantasize about houses , but what most never dream of , as far as I can tell , is building a really cool architect-designed home from scratch . That 's understandable ; the whole enterprise sounds ungodly expensive , and besides , everyone knows that architects are snooty aesthetes who wear funny glasses and pay no attention to how people actually live . As with many stereotypes , there is a grain of truth in this one , but little more . My wife and I hope to become living proof that people of middle-class means can build such a home on a moderate budget . If we succeed , we hope that , perhaps , some others will be emboldened to take a stand against the sea of mediocrity out there and build something a little better . And although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our circumstances are more typical . In fact , the house we 're building-2,300 square feet for about $350,000-is n't terribly far from the average these days , allowing for regional differences ( the Northeast is expensive ) and our unusually large lot . Paradoxically , we 're not among those who are forever longing to build their " dream " house . We just wanted to move to the country . But when we went looking for a home in New York 's Hudson Valley , we saw two kinds of places in our price range : weather-beaten , 200year-old wrecks clinging stubbornly to busy roadways , and 10-year-old vinylsided monstrosities surrounded by similar faux manor houses in pretentious little developments . The old places were drafty , warrenlike money pits . The new ones seemed built of cardboard . A lot of the dreck we saw reminded us of a comment by the outspoken architect Robert A.M. Stern , who said that most people " buy the house they hate the least . " The whole thing was dispiriting . A home is the thing Americans work for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment and the first thing we buy when we amass the scratch , so much so that an amazing two-thirds of U.S. households own their own homes . We commit to 30-year mortgages and make the payments even before we put food on the table . So why do we settle for low ceilings sprayed with cottage cheese ? Houses whose primary aesthetic feature is a pair of giant garage doors ? Porch-free tract homes whose residents end up sitting in the driveway on a summer 's day ? My wife Louise and I wanted something more than the least objectionable house , and given the small community we had chosen , the signs pointed toward building . We were squeamish at first , but the idea of bespoke housing quickly grew on us . At six feet , four inches and 200 pounds , I was sick and tired of bending over to wash my hands . I wanted high sinks and a shelf that can hold size 15 shoes . And I never want to wash another dish , so the plans had to include two dishwashers . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , so we ransacked libraries , scoured the Internet , talked to builders , architects , friends and others , and began to get a sense of our options . We also read tons of shelter magazines , a genteel form of pornography that we began lusting for every time we came across a newsstand . The first thing , we decided , was to clarify what we were after . We agreed that we wanted to live someplace where our kids would n't be captives of the automobile and we would n't spend our lives as chauffeurs . Yet we wanted privacy as well . Good schools were essential , and wherever it was had to be within two hours of Manhattan . All these factors helped us zero in on a village in upper Dutchess County where we found a 4.2acre lot with more than 400 feet of stream frontage for $52,500 . It 's a short walk to the local main street , yet secluded , and it was a bargain in a couple of ways . There was no real estate agent involved , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10% is standard on vacant land ) into the price . And municipal water and sewage services were available , saving us as much as $20,000 for a well and a septic system . Next we tried to figure out how to get a design for our house . At first we sought a good " stock plan . " These readymade designs are offered in magazines , books , on CD-ROM and via the Internet , and usually cost just a few hundred dollars . Some house-plan companies will even customize their designs a bit at little or no charge . When the Cary Grant comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House was released in 1948 , stock plans of the house used as a set were sold by the studio . More than 70 versions were built all across America . Unfortunately , most of these plans are for the same banal kind of home we were trying to avoid . Even if you choose one , chances are you 'll still need some design work for mechanical systems , for properly siting the house on your lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more interesting houses often cost a lot more to build . Photograph Architects come surprisingly cheap : They can be had for 10% to to 15% of construction costs . THE ARCHITECT At first , the author feared that Walter Chatham , right , and his associate , Evans Simpson , left , would ignore his budget and sneer at his taste . // The costliest way to get blueprints for a house is to hire an architect , and even though I am a skinflint , this is precisely what we did . The reason is simple : Architects are cheap . One way you can tell this is from the houses they build for themselves-usually small places that make clever use of standard windows and other materials . And they 're surprisingly affordable . If you 're a desirable client and negotiate , figure 10% to 15% of construction costs . That may sound like a lot , but on a house such as ours it comes to perhaps $25,000 , a small sum for the amount of workand creativity-it can buy . Good architects , we discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one should be able to add value that shows at resale . If your architect also functions as your interior designer , you may be able to get as much as 40% off any high-end furniture you buy . That makes architects seem even more affordable . Two Guys in a Shabby Room The important thing to understand about architects is that , like writers , they choose their line of work for love rather than money , and there is no more powerful architectural pheromone than the chance to design a new home . Even more attractive is designing a home for someone who does n't say , " I want it to have Gone With the Wind columns in front , a thatched roof and an onion dome over the garage . " Louise and I insisted on indoor plumbing and not much else . The result , to our stupefaction , was that long before this article was contemplated , several renowned architects were champing at the bit to design our piddling house . When I asked one of these guys who his clients were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale School of Architecture . An excellent firm in Seattle was so eager that two of its architects read my last book . Architects in Berkeley and Los Angeles also wanted the job . We seriously considered all of these western firms , having learned early on that the most interesting residential architecture in America today is happening in the West . And we wanted interesting . But we settled on an architect in New York City , Walter E Chatham , about whom we worried a great deal at first . His clients , after all , have included Martha Stewart and tony businesses such as Henri Bendel . He 's designed several houses in prestigious Seaside , Fla. , and his work appears frequently in magazines . We felt certain a guy like this would n't give us the time of day , could n't stick to a budget , would sneer at our tastes and would generally shunt our humble tepee to the back burner whenever one of his high-society clients blew into town . After a visit to his office , we stopped worrying . The firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moderately shabby room in SoHo . No secretaries , no flunkies , no expensive paneling , no silly accents . Chatham and his associate , Evans Simpson , do almost nothing to market themselves and ca n't even lay their hands on photos of their work . The word cheap does n't scare them : Chatham designed a gorgeously spartan house for a relative in North Carolina that cost just $36,000 to build-including a swimming pool . We also spent a lot of time choosing a contractor . Reynolds Tate and John Harrison Jr. , the local builders we chose , had stellar reputations and seemed to charge fair prices , so we made the unorthodox decision not to put the house out to bid . By giving them the job up front , we hoped to avoid missing the clement weather ( good builders in the Northeast are often booked up months in advance ) and get valuable input from the people who would actually be wielding a hammer on the site . As it turned out , we missed most of the good weather anyway , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building : It will take longer than you think . The other rule is almost the same , except it involves the word " costs . " The $4,000 Window The design process did not begin auspiciously . On the day we had agreed to rendezvous at the site , the Hudson Valley lay brooding under darkened skies , and halfway to our destination the heavens opened up . My wife and I , the builders , the architects and the seller of the land ( by now a friend ) walked the site through a haze of freezing rain , Louise and I each sheltering one of our twins against our chest . The ground was covered with snow and the temperature seemed to be in the low 20s . For this we were leaving Los Angeles ? Fortunately , everyone agreed the property was grand , and the architects soon set to work . To our surprise , they treated our budget as gospel , declaring almost immediately that they would jettison the second floor , most of the basement and as many corridors as possible . Why spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? The foundation and rooflines had to be exceedingly simple , yet the architects were determined not to sacrifice high ceilings and square footage . Not that they were always teetotalers when it came to spending . We noticed that our suggestions were sometimes deflected with solen references to the tight budget , yet one day Simpson said his boss felt strongly that what we needed were plywood walls throughout the house . I pointed out that finish-grade plywood costs five to 10 times as much as Sheetrock and , guessing we 'd need 200 sheets of one or the other , figured that all-plywood interiors might cost an extra $10,000 . " Well , you would save on all the mudding and taping that goes with drywall , " Simpson suggested feebly ( he later insisted that the design at that point called for some interior plywood for strengthened walls , so he was merely trying to kill two birds with one stone ) . But plywood needs finishing too . Besides , we just did n't feel we wanted to live in a humidor . Photograph After hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE BUDGET In a last-ditch effort to reign in construction costs , Akst and his wife scrapped the basement . // Working with an architect also means heightened tension between aesthetics and practicality The initial plans , for instance , contained a basement only under the central core of the house-a basement some 50 feet long but less than seven feet wide . This looks great in drawings of a transverse section of the building , where the slabs on both sides make for fearful symmetry . But as we would soon find out , it made no sense from a financial standpoint . Being involved with an architect also means you feel sheepish about going down to Sears and ordering a bunch of Kenmore appliances , even if the brand typically gets high marks in Consumer Reports . Judging from shelter magazines , the " professional appliance " disease is spreading like athlete 's foot in a low-rent gym . Architectural Digest showed playwright Wendy Wasserstein in her Central Park West apartment , which has a stainless-steel Viking range that must have cost thousands . But she admits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatham ultimately produced draws on a variety of sources , from the rural sheds common in the Hudson Valley to the work of Australian architect Glenn Murcutt , and whimsically suggests the stainless-steel subway cars I used to ride growing up in Brooklyn . The architects did a dramatic house in a similar vein-what Simpson calls utilitarian vernacular-in Mississippi , a house so appealing it was one of the reasons we hired them . Their design for us was a model of simplicity , with wonderful features such as radiant heat embedded in concrete floors ( which we decided to cover with wood because they would be too hard for kids ) . But its greatest strength was practicality : It was all on one level , which is ideal for a family like ours , and since we dispensed with stairways and most corridors , it had more usable space than comparably sized conventional houses . Unfortunately , the design was not as simple as it looked , and our builder , accustomed to standard houses , took more than a month to develop an estimate . When he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that it was almost double what we had hoped : $329,000 for construction and site work , compared with our original budget of $175,000 . Why so high ? There were lots of reasons , including the foundation design , the costly radiant heating system , the outsize doors and windows , a masonry core containing the bathrooms made up of some 2,000 concrete blocks , poor communication between architect and builder , and a roof design so seemingly perverse that the builder refused to warranty it-except to guarantee that it would leak . A single corner window-a neat detail , we thought-would cost $4,400 . Louise and I were depressed . Maybe we would have to put up one of those nondescript builder 's colonials after all . In retrospect , a lot of the problems we were having at this point were related to the age-old gulf between builders and architects . The former tend to be conservative , practical and too busy building to spend a lot of time on the phone . Often they dislike working with architects , and some jobs degenerate into open warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles was being remodeled , the crew actually hanged his architect in effigy . Some of this animosity is understandable : Architects enjoy the patina of a college education and dispense orders from cushy offices . Builders are the ones who have to do the hard labor involved in following these directions , even though the person issuing them usually knows less about construction . Also , the builder knows he 's the one I 'll call if the roof is leaking a year from now , so this is n't just theory for him . Like many good builders , ours was hugely in demand , and for weeks on end we could n't get hold of him . At one point I offered to buy him a cellular phone , only to learn that the one he already had was of limited use in his rural area . Finally I resorted to sending faxes to his home . Honey , Where 's the Basement ? When we finally did manage to get the builder involved , tens of thousands of dollars in costs melted away . Ever practical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water more effectively , and showed us that we could have a capacious full basement for $10,000 less than the cost of the complex foundation in the original design . A prefabricated fireplace saved another $15,000 , and forced-air heat saved so many thousands more that we were able to add central air conditioning basically for free . The masonry core was scrapped in favor of conventional framing . The architects readily incorporated these money-saving suggestions but staunchly defended the essential aesthetics of their design . When the builders repriced the house ( an arduous process that seemed to take weeks ) , it was still tens of thousands too high , so this time we attacked the plans with a machete . We made various additional cuts , two of which mattered most : We eliminated the basement altogether , and we lowered the height of the entire structure by about a foot and a half . These two moves had a ripple effect on costs , lowering expenses throughout the project and saving more than $40,000 . We had given up some grandeur , but the house was buildable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are off-the-shelf components and ease of assembly ( time really is money in the construction trades ) . And the trick to affordable elegance is using common , lowcost materials-often borrowed from nonresidential designin ways that are n't hopelessly tacky . The house 's corrugated metal skin , which is cheap , sexy and strong ( and does n't need painting ) , is a good example . Another is the commercial-grade carpet we chose for the bedrooms . Tightly woven and virtually bulletproof , it can be had for $1 a square foot , including installation . Conversely , it 's important to know where to spend a little extra . In higher-traffic areas , we opted for hardwood floors , which will outlast all of us . And for added strength and water resistance , the frame will be sheathed in plywood , rather than a cheaper pressed-wood product . Only 10 Weeks Behind Schedule Although so far we 've had none of the hysteria people warned us was certain in building a house , the triangle of architect , builder and homeowner-to-be is inevitably stressful . Since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a truckload of paperwork for a construction loan ( see " How Exactly Do We Pay for This ? " on page 111 ) , and we had to find a landlord-from 3,000 miles away-who would rent to a family with two toddlers and three cats . We had to sell a house , make a living , care for our kids , relocate and get our new place going more or less simultaneously This kind of thing does get hairy at times . But we did it . By October we had disposed of our old house , moved across the country , found me an office to work in , dealt with lawyers , insurance and so forth , and were ready to break ground-only 10 weeks behind schedule and perilously close to what we feared would be a bad winter . Still , by the time we broke ground we had cut our projected cost of construction to $250,000-a lot more than we had hoped to spend but relatively little for all the house we would be getting . Of course , this was all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as the heavy equipment sweeps onto your land , digging the hole that , planted with part of your life savings and a bunch of money from a bank , will eventually hold your house .

Start Out Right IF YOU 'RE THINKING of building a house and want something special , the first thing to do is homework . Building is fraught with financial , emotional and other perils , so start by reading Tracy Kidder 's book House , a nonfiction account of a single building project that illuminates the stresses and strains with novelistic insight . If that does n't scare you off , start thinking more seriously about design . Educating Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concise Guide by John Milnes Baker , The Visual Dictionary of American Domestic Architecture by Rachel Carley and A Field Guide to American Houses by Virginia and Lee McAlester . Getting a sense of what 's come before will help you decide what should come next while avoiding unfortunate fads . The best and worst of these are on display in the annual " Record Houses " issues of Architectural Record magazine , some of which have been collected into a book , Modem American Houses : Four Decades of Award-Winning Design . Setting Your Limits Bear in mind that anything you do out of the ordinary will cost , so think carefully about how much you can afford to spend . And be prepared for delaysand delays and more delays . if you really want an architect 's input but need to save , consider hiring one to prepare conceptual design drawings ( builders often know a young architect who can translate these into final plans ) . Look into readymade plans to see if any can be customized to suit you ; these plans are available in books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picking an Architect Before you hire an architect , ask to see a portfolio . One efficient way to look at many such portfolios is to contact the local office of the American Institute of Architects . Often they keep members ' portfolios on file . When you 've narrowed the list , call some previous clients . Was the architect accessible ? Imperious ? A good listener ? How well did he or she get along with the builder ? Picking a Builder Take equal care in hiring a builder . You can find potential candidates by asking local real estate agents , friends , coworkers and others for recommendations . if there is a house you admire , ask the owners who built it . In talking to builders , inquire about their experience , particularly in working with architects . Also ask-as nicely as you can-whether they have been sued , have filed for bankruptcy or have been in any trouble with the law . if your state licenses general contractors , see if any complaints or suspensions are on file . Consider running credit or other checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it can make good sense to ask several builders to submit bids based on the finished plans , we chose to work with a single contractor . The former approach helps you get the best fixed price ; the latter gets you more builder input and more time to build a relationship . Sidebar How Exactly Do We Pay for This ? IF YOU BUY A HOUSE , getting a mortgage is fairly straightforward . But how do you go about getting a mortgage where there is no house ? Financing the construction of a new home is more complicated and expensive than arranging a conventional mortgage for a preexisting home . You 'll also find that your choices are sharply limited , compared with the hordes ready to lend on a conventional home purchase . Our experience was fairly typical . We paid cash for the land and then went mortgage shopping , assuming our new acreage would provide sufficient equity . We were soon disabused of that notion . Getting a Loan The first thing we discovered was that all those mortgage brokers boasting 800 numbers and rock-bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turned to local financial institutions in the Hudson Valley , where we planned to build . What we needed was a construction loan . This is a special kind of mortgage issued by a bank to finance a new home . When the house is finished , this loan usually can be converted relatively smoothly into a conventional mortgage at the same financial institution . A home mortgage is the best kind of debt : The interest is usually low , it 's tax deductible and it finances a durable asset . But while a construction loan has some of the same virtues , it 's considerably less appealing . For one thing , the interest rate is higher ( usually about 1% ) . Also , we found that construction loans typically require payment of an additional point-lolo of the loan-up front and some other fees . Other Headaches Then there was the matter of the size of the loan . Our bank would lend only up to 80% of the appraised value or acquisition cost , whichever was lower . That meant we 'd have to put 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And appraising a home that aspires to a little architectural individuality is a tricky business . In our case , there was nothing comparable in the area . The result was a lowball appraisal and a loan for quite a bit less than we hoped the house would be worth . There are other headaches too . You 'll need a surveyor , so the bank can be sure the foundation is on your land ( figure on perhaps $1,500 ) . And you 've got to tell the bank of any changes you make to the plans , lest the finished house end up being worth less than was expected . Builder 's Risk In keeping with all this complication , we also had trouble getting a " builder 's risk " insurance policy , perhaps because our agent did n't seem to understand what one is . ( It 's a policy that pays if , for instance , our halffinished house were to burn to the ground . ) Like the construction loan that changes into a mortgage , this policy turns into regular homeowners insurance when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
