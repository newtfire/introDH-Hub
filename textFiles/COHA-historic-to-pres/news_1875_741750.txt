The Montreal authorities probably feel confident that there never was a more annoying corpse than that of the late Mr. GUIBORD . Since the mob barricaded the cemetery and drove away the funeral procession , a few weeks since , the authorities have not renewed the attempt at burial , but have apparently waited , in hopes that some one would succeed in stealing the corpse , and thus extricate them from their . unpleasant dilemma . No such fortunate theft having been committed , and . public Protestant sentiment in Montreal continuing to demand GUIBORD 'S burial , we are now told that troops have finally been summoned , and that in a day or two GUIBORD 'S body will bo forcibly buried , whatever may be the consequences . There is , however , a new feature which promises to add to the interest of the burial . The Institut Canadien is understood to have determined to plant percussion shells in GUIBORD 'S grave . This is certainly a new way in which to give a man Christian burial . Of course , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bombs wit ( materially increase the business of the Montreal undertakers , but at the same time it will prevent any possibility of another Guibord funeral . GUIBORD 'S bones , after having been blown all over the cemetery , and inextricably mixed up with those of the violators of his grave , will be of no further value to any one . It would be quite impossible to identify them , and even if the Institut Cauadien should pitch upon a few vertebra , or a rib or two , and have some more Guibord funerals over them , the chances would be that the Institut would really be burying Catholic vertebra or Ultramontane ribs . The same difficulty would , of course , confront those who might desire to bury the exploded Catholic zealots , and they would have to run the risk of burying more or less of GUIBORD , by mistake . Thus , instead of merely having , as at present , one corpse which it is difficult to bury , the explosion would throw upon the hands of the community half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be willing to bury . The Institut Canadien had better think twice before laying GUIBORD to rest in company with bombs , and thus entailing such unpleasant consequences . Moreover , it is just possible that a mob with an abnormal sense of humor might seize upon two or three members of the Institut and compel them to do the work of exhuming the body , rust as rebel prisoners during the civil war were occasionally made to dig up the torpedoes which their comrades had planted . The members so employed would probably agree , as they soared into the air in company with spades and fragmentary bones , that their friends would do well to bury them without percussion shells . Very possibly , however , the whole affair of the burial will be peaceably settled in accordance with the proposal of the astute ecclesiastical guardian of the cemetery . This ingenious person has announced that if GUIBORD is buried , he will curse that part of the cemetery in which the bones are laid . Why should not this plan satisfy everybody t GUIBORD 'S friends could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery if they actually bury him in his chosen plot . On the other hand , after his grave had been duly cursed , and the curse kept from permeating the rest of the ceme- tery by a strong picket fence , the Catholics could feel that they have gained a virtual victory . To be sure , GUIBORD 'S friends would baturallyprefer that his grave should be left uncursed , but then there is obviously no way in which a priest supplied with SD inexhaustible quantity of ecclesiastical curses can be prevented from using them if he chooses to do so . After all , it is a question whether it is not better to be buried with a curse than to be buried with bombs . The former can not prevent the grass from growing over the grave , while the latter may at any time be exploded by some investigating mole , and thus place the corpse in the humiliating position of being hoist with its own petard .                    @
