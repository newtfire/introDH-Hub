The B. F. Goodrich Co. is now manufacturing close to 11,000 automobile-tires a day . This rate of manufacture has been maintained since early in the year and means a ' 50% increase over the ' output of the first five months of 1914 . Other departments of the Goodrich Co. are also showing a considerable increase in business , compared with last year . The mechanical goods department , which had been exceedingly slack for over a year 's time , is now taking on additional men to handle orders that are coming in from the railroads . The present buying by the railroads is the first real buying in the last 12 to 15 months . Reverting to its tire business , the Goodrich Co. at the moment is unable to take care of orders . In fact , the company has been running far behind orders for some time . In a company the size of the Goodrich concern , it is customary to carry a ? stock at all times in the neighborhood , of 250.000 tires . Last fall the officials hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the expected large demand this spring . The embargo on rubber by Great Britain as well as other conditions over which the company had no control , prevented the manufacture during the dull season of this extra 500,000 tires . Indications are now that it will be a considerable period before orders-are caught up with . The foot wear department , of which the Goodrich Co. has had little to say in the past , promises to become one of the real features of the company 's business . In order to take care of increased business a new building for the manufacture of hoots and shoes is now in the course of erection . The early spring has seen a big boom to the Goodrich Co . Automobiles that a year ago were kept in winter storage until Tune were brought out this year in March . Demand for cars abroad by the Allies has been another favorable factor in Goodrich development this year . It is too early as yet , directors of the company say , to give any idea as to the earnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering operations from Jan. 1 to June 30 was sent to stockholders . This year the same course will probably be followed . Operating officials express the belief that it will be impossible to give any idea of net earnings before late in July for this six months-period . There is no doubt , however . but that the earnings will run considerably ahead of the 1914 net . For the full year 1914 net applicable to common stock was 5.0% . Earnings of the last half of 1914 were considerably ahead of the first six months despite operation under war conditions . The gain of the closing half of last year over the first half has been continued into 1915 , only at an increased rate . The B. F. Goodrich Co. did a gross business of about $42,000,000 in 1914 . In making any estimate of gross for this year it should be taken into consideration that early last year a 15% cut in tire prices was made . Assuming that half of the business of the Goodrich Co. is tire business this 15% cut would mean a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the $20 , - 000,000 mark . This statement is made only for comparison , as tire sales of last year were probably over 50% of total sales . Directors of the company are still reticent as to the possibility of an early resumption of dividends on the common shares . In fact , they state that the dividend question has not been discussed . Some of their friends have ventured the opinion that the common dividends will start this year on a 5% basis . but these statements are not founded upon any expression of opinion by the directors themselves . The Goodrich Co. is in a very strong financial position . The company is carrying forward a large amount of cash and owes nothing . A director of the company in talking ? recently to a representative of The Wall Street Journal , said that the unanimous opinion has prevailed among the board over since the discontinuance of dividends on the common stock that no resumption should be attempted until there was every reasonable certainty that the rate could he maintained , and to this end a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus is now a reality and present rate of business would indicate that dividends are at least a possibility this year .
