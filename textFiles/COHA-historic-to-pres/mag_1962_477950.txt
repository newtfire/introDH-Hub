STUDENTS of primitive societies are a good deal concerned these days with the phenomenon they call detribalization ? the collapse of traditional ways of living together based upon biological relationships , and their replacement by forms of social organization in which the links , if any , are more public and abstract than consanguinity . But the change , though it may well be more abrupt among primitive societies , is by no means limited to them . The daily newspaper provides abundant evidence that it is world-wide : the care of the aged becomes a public problem when families can not or will not any longer provide for their older members ; the behavior of young people becomes a public problem when they live in a no man 's land between dependence on parents and absorption into adult occupations and their own families ; countless products , from electronic organs to soft drinks , are advertised with the promise , implied or blatant , that they will restore family solidarity . Doubtless the advertiser 's picture of the family group raising their voices or their bottles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in reality . INDIAN SUMMER OF THE TRIBE NICCOLO TIJCCT 'S novel Before My Time ( Simon and Schuster , 17.50 ) is a wonder . fully full picture of family life in what may have been its last golden moment in the West : the first decade of the present century . Part memoir , part novel , the book is based on Tucci 's own relatives ? his Russian grandmother , a woman of great wealth and boundless ego ; his mother , the old lady 's most devoted retainer and the most sedulous student of her exercise of power ; his father , a young and poor South Italian doctor no less familial in his loyalties but with a Latin sense of the primacy of the male ; and an endless array of relatives , servants , friends , and hangers-on of every variety . The scene is a series of hotels and villas , chiefly in Italy and Switzerland , through which the old lady troops with her daughter , her possessions , and her staff in search of the happiness that always eludes her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an almost Tolstoyan power to depict the moment-by-moment shifts in feeling and relationship that his characters undergo , their inexhaustible supply of self-deception , the hopeless tangle of possessiveness and love , of greed and generosity , of selfishness and altruism , of intelligence and folly in which they are caught . The world of his characters is a world of mirrors ; a characteristic scene is one in which a man and woman who think they are playing out a grand passion address their lofty remarks not to each other but to their own images reflected in mirrors on opposite sides of the room . The cloying , claustrophobic atmosphere pervades the book . With insignificant exceptions , the action takes place in overfurnished and overheated rooms , each very much like the other no matter where in Europe it may be located . The characters are brilliantly differentiated , but since more or less disguised sell-aggrandizement is almost universally their motive , their struggles have a fundamental similarity . Yet it is a fascinating and absorbing novel . When the old lady 's death happens to coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader can almost share her daughter 's sense of appropriateness , her feeling that the departure of so remarkable a person ought to be accompanied by the convulsion of the earth . As the story unfolds , it seems to be going nowhere , to have no perceptible pattern , but in retrospect it all falls into shape , because it is all concerned with that crucial moment in any power system , the moment of succession . Like all dictators , the old lady has predicated her rule on her own indispensability , and therefore can not provide for the succession , but the member of the next generation who knows how to behave as impossibly as the old woman is of course her true heir , in conformity to the rule that a family is a group of relatives dominated by its most neurotic member . Possibly one period of history differs from another in the kind of emotions it chooses to call love , or ( to put it another way ) in the kind of hypocrisy that it can permit itself to indulge in innocently . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain period ; in our post-Freudian times they would be somewhat differern , but his reading of the underlying motives is not disqualified by the shift . Before My Time is a remarkable book , very European in its skepticism , its irony , its profound and witty pessimism . If it is true that Americans want to believe that experience is emancipatingand educational , they will he disturbed by the psychological treadmill that the characters pace , and they may be even more disturbed by the uneasy conviction that their own lives are not very different . All this may give a misleading impression that the novel is dreary . Nothing is further from the truth . It is almost always entertaining and frequently very funny . If life is a comedy to the man who thinks and a tragedy to the man who feels , then it must be something of both to the man who sees , and Tucci appears to be such a man . JEWISH FAMILIES IN TRANSITION IN the past few weeks several novels depicting the contemporary stresses on Jewish family solidarity have appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other group in Western society , for their sense of family , these books hold a certain sociological interest apart from whatever literary merit they may have . Diamond by Brian Blanville ( Farrar , Straus and Cudahy , $5.50 ) is the story of an Irish-Jewish family in London from she late 1920s to the present . The character for whom the book is named is Dr. Jack Diamond , a member of a family of physicians who have emigrated from Cork in his late adolescence . Ile a man of wit and charm , sociable and generous , at times an almost compulsive gambler and always a hard worker , sacrificing his ambition to become a surgeon by grinding away in general practice to support his wife and two children . But though the book bears Jack 's name , the main character , at least from some points of view , is his wife . born Dully Rosen of a Polish-Jewish family . Her gradual evolution from a shy , gentle , loving girl of almost impoverished background to a dominating , demanding wife and mother , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things her husband can provide for her , is the central line of development of the book . Her absorption of her husband is almost complete ; for her he gives up his ambition , his synagogue , his friends , and most of his family , and does so gladly , because he never ceases to love her . Yet Dolly in the end is an embittered woman . Her strategy in life is essentially an attempt to translate into a more favored economic sphere her mother 's undisputed matriarchy , and she fails . She bends her husband to her will , but her children escape her . Her son survives the anti-Semitism of various select schools to end upmore English than Jewish , and by becoming an artist breaks with everything his mother can understand . Her daughter , in spite of promising beginnings , somehow fails to become the polished , handsome young woman her mother demands ; at the end of the novel she and her gentile working-class husband are studying medicine at a provincial university . Diamond is rather old-fashioned in technique . It consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolidly reported . A good deal of it might have been written by a less gifted contemporary of Arnold Bennett . Yet it is solidly imagined and unpretentiously presented , and its picture of prosperous middle-class Jewish life in England in the last thirty years is not to be matched by any other novel I know . THE title of Jerome Weidman 's new book ? The Sound of Bow Bells ( Random House , $5.95 ) ? may sound as if it too were set in London , but the scene is in fact New York , and the title , very freely translated , means that you can take the boy out of the Lower East Side , but you can not take the bower East Side out of the boy , as the Cockney who grew up within the sound of Bow Bells will continue to hear them all his life . The main character in Weidman 's book , one Sam Silver , a Jew and an extremely successful writer , is more than anything else the creation of a poor and illiterate immigrant mother with immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave of his first success as a writer , Silver has withdrawn from his mother 's domination by marrying a girl of his own sort of background but with a good deal more contempt for it . Where the mother has seen the move " uptown " as a fulfillment of her son 's Jewishness , his wife sees it as a denial , and her sudden death leaves him paralyzed between the world of his past and the world of his ambitions . As a man he can not bring himself to remarry , though he realizes that the woman who loves him is far superior to his first wife : as a writer he can not bring himself to break with the formulas that have brought him success in ! he slick magazines , though he knows that they do not honestly represent his own experience of the world ; and as a Jew he can not bring himself to acknowledge his place among Jews by having a bar mitzvah for his son . The action of the novel , of course , consists of the working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to say that the resolution consists of a return to Sam Silver 's values , including the religion and Family , of his youth . Like some others among Weidman's. recent books , The Sound of Bow Bells has to be criticized in two layers ? the layer of recollection , which concerns Sam Silver 's years as a boy in the slums and his parents and other early associates , all of which is excellent ; and the layer of his subsequent adventures among the rich and powerful with whom his success enables him to move , all of which is pure bilge . It is possible to draw a line between those scenes that are informed by past experience and those that have nothing behind them but journalistic contrivance . The scene that ends the main character 's marital difficulties , for example , is simply preposterous ; even if it were believable , as it emphatically is not , it would not take care of the situation that it is supposed to re-solve . As if he were aware of the extreme discrepancy in quality between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story chronologically by having it begin very late in the action and then picking up the earlier episodes in innumerable flashbacks . This has the commendable effect of spreading the good scenes ? the scenes from the youthful years ? more or less evenly through the novel , but it also tiresomely and monotonously overworks what is rarely more than a very flimsy device . Like Youngblood Hawke , only more Flagrantly , The Sound of Bow Bells is for the most part a slick commercial novel allegedly concerned with the horrors of slick commercialism . Weidman can do better . OF the three novels of Jewish life here under review , James Yaffe 's Mister Margolies ( Random House , $3.95 ) is most centrally concerned with the conflict between family loyalties and other considerations . His main character , the Mr. Margolies of the title , is a middle-aged nonentity who for many years has held a sinecure ; he is vice-president in charge of public relations in Fishbein 's Fashion Footwear , a job for which he has no qualifications whatever except that he is the brother-in-law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margolies has been permitted to jog along in innocent self-deception as to his economic usefulness until his nephew Lester , fresh from the Army and the Harvard Business School , returns to work with his father . It is Lester 's firm conviction ( and Lester is a very firm young man ) that business is a rational rather than a sentimental enterprise , arid he begins a quietly ruthlesscampaign to expose his uncle 's incompetence . His father can not believe that a successful business has no room for family feeling , but he has lived his Life in expectation of the day when Lester would come into the business , and so he reluctantly lends his support to the systematic demolition of Mr. Margolies ' self-esteem . Yaffe dedicates his book to Jerome Weidman , but the Jewish society he depicts ? the society of rich " uptown " families another generation or more away from immigration and the slums ? is at least superficially quite different from Weidman 's . Yaffe again demonstrates his brilliance in depicting that society : the parents who remember what it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavers of assimilation apparent when Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Siegel announce " the engagement of their daughter Marilyn to Dr. Law-ranee D. Gleeson , son of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Glixon , and grandson of the late department-store executive Sigmund K. Glickstein . " But the potential excellence of the book and the brilliance of its observations are seriously marred by the fact that Yaffe has made his situation so extreme . Mr. Margolies is such a fool that it is difficult to take him seriously , even at times to believe that he could exist ; almost no business could afford to employ such a man . Moral choices become dramatic when the basis for choice is narrower . If Mr. Margolies were only a little less incompetent , if he were only a little less successful in his self-deception , the story would have greater dramatic interest and more poignancy . Two Brothers , by the well-known Italian novelist Vasco Pratolini ( Orion , 53.95 ) , is not a new book , but it has just been translated for the first time , and it has a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor of Florence . This novel , like much of Pratolini 's work , appears to be autobiographical , and indeed contains a stern notice to the effect that it is . The whole book ( it is not very long ) consists of the author 's address to his younger brother , who is now dead . In life the brothers had been separated most of the time . Theirmother died at the birth of the younger , and he was reared as the ward of a more affluent family . Then in his teens , his sponsors failed him and he was thrown back into the poverty in which his older brother has grown up , though without preparation in the means poor people use to stay alive . The struggle to keep afloat in a world of savage deprivation proves to be too much for him , and his body slowly gives in to the afflictions of the poor . But in his last years , his older brother , who has always felt the distance between them created by the younger 's more privileged upbringing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the love that unites them . Two Brothers touchingly supports the notion that family solidarity is both strongest and most in jeopardy among the poor ? strongest perhaps because they have so little else to fall hack on , most in jeopardy because they have the least protection against the accidents of life that separate relatives . The book is unadorned , even na ? ve in style , in keeping with the sparseness of the life it describes . Though the constant use of the second person is a little awkward , especially in the opening sections , a certain rough eloquence is achieved , and the book 's freedom from contrivance , its trust in the long pure line of feeling it describes , gives it dignity . OTHER COMMUNITIES S the family becomes less pervasively the form of social organization , people tend to group themselves according to their common intellectual or economic or political interests , with the result that writers too turn their talents to other kinds of communities ? to the world of academia or the Army , bohemia or business , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , from a toy factory to a sports-car race , finds its laureate . Elizabeth Sewell 's Now Bless Thyself ( Doubleday , $3.95 ) is yet another novel of American academic life , but it has the distinction ( I think ) of being the first to be written by a writer who is not American . Miss Sewell is an English poet and critic who in recent years has spent roughly every other year teaching in one American college or another . The scene of Now Bless Thyself is a large Midwestern state university located in a town she calls Aubera name that owes something to Poe and something perhaps to Ann Arbor . Adjoining its campus is the small Catholic College of the Holy Ghost , which gives Miss Sewell ( who is a Catholic ) an opportunity to contrast two kinds of American higher education , as well as a chance to indulge in some rather fuzzy symbolism . in almost every way in which the book attempts to be a novel it is a failure . It begins with some highly dramatic events in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevance to what follows . Certain proper names occur so frequently that they must be meant to designate characters , but with very few exceptions the characters achieve no recognizable identity . There are occasional passages of earnest undergraduate conversation that Miss Sewell seems to take at face value , and long quotations from the speeches of a campus liberal and a visiting conservative ( presumably William Buckley ) . which sound genuine enough but are hardly worth putting in a book . In addition , tifiss Sewell has trouble with American speech ? one of her undergraduates , for instance , speaks of some tickets as " not too dear , " though no young American I know of uses the word " dear " in the sense of " expensive . " Fortunately , however , a good deal of the time Miss Sewell forgets that she is writing a novel , and for long stretches her book is simply a record of her impressions of American college life . Since she is an acute observer and a fine descriptive writer , these passages make the book eminently worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she has seen enough of her subject to write with something like authority . In-Laws and Outlaws , by C. North-cote Parkinson ( Houghton Mifflin , 34 ) , is not a novel , though with its array of characters and passages of dialogue it might easily have become one . As it stands it is a collection of humorous essays on how to succeed in business . It seems to be American business that Parkinson has chiefly in mind , but since the vocabulary he uses is sometimes American and sometimes British , it is hard to say . For my taste , Parkinson 's manner is a little too cute ; he is extremely fond of inventing jocose names and setting up the paraphernalia of mock scholarship ? with a slightly tiring burlesque of pomposity he establishes categories and sub-categories , charts and tests . He is at his best when least afflicted by this somewhat muscle-bound puckishness , when , in other words , he is most straightforward . Then he shows himself to have a good eye and to be an excellent teacher . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will recognize and appreciate the account of the various devices by which a chairman gets his own way with a committee , the description of sex differences in institutions and the ways to tell a good boss from a poor one . ( The poor one deplores the situation ; the good one says what to do next . ) In general Parkinson 's prescription for success can be reduced to two words : be ruthless . IN AFRICA The Lonely African , by Colin M. Turnbull ( Simon and Schuster , $4.50 ) , is a direct confrontation of the problem of detribalization in one part of the world where it is at present particularly rampant . Turn-bug , an English anthropologist now on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , has extensive firsthand experience of Africa , and his book is made up of a series of autobiographies of more or less detribalized Africans in the eastern part of the Congo Republic . The autobiographies appear to have been taken down from dictation , though they may have been edited to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti they are interspersed by chapters of commentary and interpretation by the author . Probably no other literary vehicle matches the autobiography in effectiveness when it comes to conveying what it means to people to be wrenched away from their accustomed relationships and ways of in madness that he recognized but could not curb , he had nonetheless a darting , flamelike splendor in his mountain fastness that makes the vast bumbling British expeditionary force sent against him look ridiculous . Even in his death he showed his gift for gesture : after the British victory , he committed suicide with a pistol that , as the silver plate inserted in it said , had been sent to him by Queen Victoria , in thanks " for his kindness to her servant Plow-den . " ( A Book-of-the-Month Club selection . ) A GREAT TRIAL . RETRIED ANOTHER fine new work of non-fiction is Tragedy in Dedham by Francis Russell ( McGraw-11ill , $7.95 ) . Russell has not yet achieved anything like the reputation of Moorehead , but he too has been developing , in a series of modest but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines personal recollection with social history . This book is the first he has published in America , but in it he shows himself a painstaking and accomplished writer with the ability to tell a good story well . The subject is the great legal event of Russell 's Boston boyhood , the Sacco-Vanzetti case . He brings to the case not only his own memories of the time , but an exhaustive study of the record , an acute sense of the structure of Boston society then and now , recent visits to whatever participants in the trial still survive , and some new evidence from ballistics which , because of the peculiar disposal of the exhibits in the trial , has become available only lately ( and only through Russell 's efforts , as I understand his account ) . In a general way Russell sees the trial as he saw it when he was a boy and as writers over the years have tended to see it : as a situation in which people behaved according to their birth and background , a triumph of tribal loyalties over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bishop Lawrence and President Lowell , with the less suave assistance of those who were , as they hoped , in process of assimilation to old Boston , like Governor Fuller and Judge Thayer , in the end held out for the majesty of the Common-wealth against a couple of immigrant anarchists , an Italian shoemaker and an Italian fish peddler . Russell shows how other elements in society less reprehensible for respectability , especially the Communists , also used the trial for their purposes . In one respect Russell breaks with most earlier writers on the trial . Contrary to his conviction when he started to study the case , he has reluctantly come to the conclusion that Sacco was probably guilty . He comes to this conclusion partly because of the implausibility of the other standard explanation of the crime , which blames it on the Morelli gang from Providence ; partly because several people who were deeply committed to the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti , including the chief trial lawyer , later expressed doubt of their innocence ; and partly because the new evidence from ballistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of the bullets that proved fatal in the South Braintree payroll robbery came from the gun that Sacco was carrying when he was arrested . Not everyone will agree with these conclusions , but anyone who reads Tragedy in Dedham ( the trial was held in the Dedham courthouse ) is likely to agree that it is one of the best books of American social history to appear in some time .
