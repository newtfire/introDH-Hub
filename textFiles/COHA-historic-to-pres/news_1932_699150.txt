Clothing and Other Things Needed . To the Editor of The New York Times : What may seem old to your readers will be nearly new to men , women and children who need clothing of all kinds  --  dresses , shoes and underwear . Household articles that have served the purposes of their present owners and are no longer needed by them ? such as draperies , china , books and even toys  --  will be of value to the Nearly New Shop , 913 Eighth Avenue , maintained by the Alice Chapin Adoption Nursery , Berkshire Industrial Farm , Cribside Committee of Babies ' Hospital , Masters School Day Nursery , New York Diet Kitchen Association and Winfield Day Nursery . These organizations will gladly receive such articles and dispose of them at minimum prices , the proceeds to be devoted to the above charities . Those who make contributions may designate to which institution they desire the financial proceeds to be given . If necessary , we will collect the bundles or packages . Mrs. ROBERT E. LIVINGSTON .
