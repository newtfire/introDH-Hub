STRIKE THROUGH THE MASK ! ( 70 pp. ) - Peter Viereck-Scribner ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> To most people , says Poet Peter Viereck , modern poetry is a hopelessly obscure " snore and an allusion . " Viereck ( rhymes with lyric ) is out to change that ; he writes for the " intelligent general reader who has been scared away from poetry but who might return if addressed straightforwardly . . . " <P> <P> More middlebrows than highbrows have applauded Viereck 's efforts , but Terror and Decorum , his first book of more-or-less straightforward verse , won him a Pulitzer Prize last year . Strike Through the Mask ! , his second , is as motley a product as Viereck 's prizewinner , ranges from collegiate cacklings to fine and often funny flights of fancy . Conservative , not to say eclectic in form , it has more zest than grace . <P> The son of German propagandist George Sylvester Viereck , * Peter disowned his father 's politics while still at Harvard , spent the war years as a sergeant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flowing tie , 33-year-old Poet Peter becomes Peter Robert Edwin Viereck , Ph.D. , a brilliant , right-of-center political theorist ( Metapolitics ; Conservatism Revisited ) and associate professor of history at Mount Holyoke . <P> Of the 24 poems in Strike Through the <P> Mask ! , at least a dozen strike out . But even when he fans , Viereck is refreshingly flamboyant ; popping with energy and imagination , he gives every verse the old college try . Occasionally , as when he impersonates a pine tree singing its pitchy heart out to a pining rose , he can fall flat on his face . In the better works , wit gives weight to his wobbly lyricism . Viereck is at his typical best in a poem inspired by a newspaper headline : GLACIER ACCIDENT KILLS SKI PARTY ; ONE BODY STILL MISSING . Impersonating the lost , icebound skier , he wrote : <P> Outside , my bodiless sisters frisk and <P> dive . I 'd show them speed , could I but get <P> away , <P> Alas , alas , the snows that froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay , <P> The only ghost on earth who is n't gay . When I consider all that waits ahead ( Years , years of boredom in my icy bed , No books to read and not one game to <P> play ) , <P> Sometimes I almost wish I were alive . <P> <P> * Who drew a one-to-five-year sentence for failure to register all his activities as a German agent , was released for good behavior after serving 3years ( TIME , July 7 , 1947 ) .
