A great California fortune came to San Francisco 's late Senator James Duval Phelan when he was 21 . When he died in 1930 , aged 69 , he left $20,000 to Tennist Helen Wills Moody , $20,000 to Author Gertrude Atherton , scores of other bequests to natives whose brain or brawn had reflected credit on his beloved state. * Last week another of the Senator 's benefactions posthumously bore fruit when the San Francisco Art Association awarded the first $2,000 Phelan Traveling Scholarship to Helen Elizabeth Phillips , a young sculptor who in all her 23 years has never been outside the Golden Bear State . <P> Blue-eyed , honey-haired Helen Elizabeth Phillips is a graduate of Redwood City 's Sequoia High School , served apprenticeship in the stoneyards of the California School of Fine Arts under the sympathetic eye of Sculptor Ralph Stackpole . When Helen Phillips later entered the school , she found Sculptor Stackpole 's vigorous , massive modernism much to her liking . Working directly on the stone like her tutor , Sculptor Phillips completed and exhibited two determined , crisply defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sturdy Young Woman ( see cut ) . Her scholarship money will enable Sculptor Phillips to observe U. S. and German modern architecture , Mexico 's Mayan pyramids and Toltec temples , the standard art spectacles of Italy and France . <P> According to the terms of the Phelan will , Miss Phillips ' $2,000 traveling purse might just as easily have gone into an art gallery . It represents income from $100,000 which Senator Phelan wished either to be spent for " exhibition rooms in the School of Fine Arts , " or for scholarships if the rooms were not fitted out in three years . Well satisfied with their fine new Art Museum in the Civic Center , the Association 's trustees accordingly elected to use the money to send promising California artists abroad . <P> The money back of such generous art patronage was made by James Duval Phelan 's father , who came to the U. S. from Queen 's County , Ireland , sailed for California in the Gold Rush of ' 49 , accumulated $10,000,000 as merchant , banker , real estate tycoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of San Francisco 's first citizens . At the height of the 1906 Fire , intrepid James Phelan filled his snorting , blunt-snouted Mercedes with dynamite , gallantly chugged out to the Potrero district , blasted a path that halted the fire at Van Ness Avenue .
