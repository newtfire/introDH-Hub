THERE are five groups interested in literary criticism : publishers of books , authors , publishers of reviews , critics , and , finally , the reading public . An obvious interest of all the groups but the last is financial . For the publisher of books , although he may have his pride , criticism is primarily an advertisement : he hopes that his books will be so praised as to commend them to buyers . For the publisher of book-reviews , although he also may have his pride , criticism is primarily an attraction for advertisements : he hopes that his reviews will lead publishers of books to advertise in his columns . For the critic , whatever his ideals , criticism is , in whole or in part , his livelihood . For the author , no matter how disinterested , criticism is reputation ? perhaps a reputation that can be coined . In respect of this financial interest , all four are opposed to the public , which wants nothing but competent service , ? a guide to agreeable reading , an adviser in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giver of intellectual delight . All five groups are discontented with the present condition of American criticism . Publishers of books complain that reviews do not help sales . Publishers of magazines lament that readers do not care for articles on literary subjects . Publishers of newspapers frankly doubt the interest of book-notices . The critic confesses that his occupation is ill-considered and ill-paid . ' Phe author wrathfully exclaims ? but what he exclaims can not be summarized , so various is it . Thus , the whole commercial interest is unsatisfied . The public , on the other hand , finds book-reviews of little service and reads them , if at all , with indifference , with distrust , or with exasperation . That part of the public which appreciates criticism as an art maintains an eloquent silence and reads French . Obviously , what frets the commercial interest is the public indifference to book-review s . What is the cause of that ? In critical writing , what is the base of interest , the indispensable foundation in comparison with which all else is superstructure ? I mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns from America to France for what it craves . Our sympathies respond to the call of our own national life , and may not be satisfied by Frenchmen ; if we turn to them , we do so for some attraction which compensates for the absence of intimate relation to our needs . What is it ? Of course , French mastery of form accounts in part for our intellectual absenteeism ; but it does not account for it wholly , not , I think , even in the main . Consider the two schools of French criticism typified by Brunetiere and Anatole France . Men like Brunetiere seem to believe that what they say is important , not merely to fellow dilettanti or to fellow scholars , but to the public and to the mass of the pub- I lie ; they seem to write , not to display their attainments , but to use their attainments to accomplish their end ; they put their whole strength , intellectual and moral , into their argument ; they seek to make converts , to crush enemies . They I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office with high seriousness . They seem to think that the soul and the character of the people are as important as its economic comfort . The problem of a contemporary , popular author ? even if contemporary , even if popular ? is to them an important question ; the intellectual , moral , and resthetic ideals which he is spreading through the coun- try are to be tested rigorously , then applauded or fought . They seek to be clear because they wish to interest , they wish to interest because they wish to convince , they wish to convince because they have convictions which they believe should prevail . The men like Anatole France ? if there are any others like Anatole France ? have a different philosophy of life . They are doubtful of endeavor , doubtful of progress , doubtful of new schools of art , doubtful of new solutions whether in philosophy or economics ; but they have a quick sensitiveness to beauty and a profound sympathy with suffering man . ' Not only do they face their doubts , but , they make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not conceal ; they flatter no conventions and no prejudices ; they are sincere . Giving themselves without reserve , they do not speak what they think will please you , but rather try with ' all their art to please you with what they think . In the French critics of both types ? the men like Brunetiere , the men like Anatole France ? there is this common , this invaluable characteristic , ? I mean intellectual candor . That is their great attraction ; that is the foundation of interest . Intellectual candor does not mark American criticism . The fault is primarily the publisher 's . It lies in the fundamental mistake that he makes in the matter of publicity . Each publisher , that is , treats each new book as if it were the only one that he had ever published , were publishing , or ever should publish . He gives all his efforts to seeing that it is praised . He repeats these exertions with some success for each book that he prints . Meanwhile , every other publisher is doing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural result follows ? a monotony of praise which permits no books to stand out , and which , however plausible in the particular instance , is , in the mass , incredible . But how is it that the publisher 's fiat produces praise ? The answer is implicit in the fact that criticism is supported , not by the public , but by the publisher . Upon the money which the publisher of books is ready to spend for advertising depends the publisher of book-reviews ; upon him in turn depends the critic . Between the publisher of books anxious for favorable reviews and willing to spend money , and the publisher of a newspaper anxious for advertisements and supporting a dependent critic , the chance to trade is perfect . Nothing sordid need be said or indeed perceived ; all may be left to the workings of human nature . Favorable reviews are printed , advertisements are received ; and no one , not even the principals , need be certain that the reviews are not favorable because the books are good , or that the advertisements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , the Silent Bargain has been decorously struck . Once reached , it tends of itself to become ever more close , intimate , and inclusive . The publisher of books is continuously tempted to push his advantage with the complaisant publisher of a newspaper ; the publisher of a newspaper is continuously tempted to pitch ever higher and still higher the note of praise . But the Silent Bargain is not made with newspapers only . Obviously , critics can say nothing without the consent of some publisher ; obviously , their alternatives are silence or submission . They who write for the magazines are wooed to constant surrender ; they must , or they think that they must , be tender of all authors who have commercial relations with the house that publishes the periodical to which they are contributing . Even they who write books are not exempt : they must , or they feel that they must , deal gently with reputations commercially dear to their publisher . If the critic is timid , or amiable , or intriguing , or struck with poverty , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soften , to omit whatever he fears may displease Honest Literary Criticism ? the publisher on whom he depends . Selfish considerations thus tend ever to emasculate criticism , criticism thus tends ever to assume more and more nearly the most dishonest and exasperating form of advertisement , that of the " reading notice " which presents itself as sincere , spontaneous testimony . Disingenuous criticism tends in its turn to puzzle and disgust the public ? and to hurt the publisher . The puff is a boomerang . Its return blow is serious ; it would be fatal , could readers turn away wholly from criticism . What saves the publisher is that they can not . They have continuous , practical need of books , and must know about them . The multitudinous paths of reading stretch away at every angle , and the traveling crowd must gather and guess and wonder about the guide-post criticism , even if each finger , contradicting every other , points to its own road as that " To Excellence . " Wayfarers in like predicament would question one another . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their best advertising flows from this private talk . They all agree that , whereas reviews sell nothing , the gossip of readers sells much . Curiously , I say ; for this gossip is not under their control ; it is as often adverse as favorable ; it kills as much as it sells . Moreover , when it kills , it kills in secret : it leaves the bewildered publisher without a clue to the culprit or his motive . How , then , can it be superior to the controlled , considerate flattery of the public press ? It is odd that publishers never seriously ask themselves this question , for the answer , if I have it , is instructive . The dictum of the schoolgirl that a novel is " perfectly lovely " or " perfectly horrid , " comes from the heart . The comment of society women at afternoon tea , the talk of business men at the club , if seldom of much critical value , is sincere . In circles in which literature is loved , the ) witty things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fear neither of God nor of man . In publisher . For his own sake he should do what he can to make the public regard the critic , not as a mere megaphone for his advertisements , but as an honest man who speaks his honest mind . To this end , he should deny his foolish taste for praise , and , even to the hurt of individual ventures , use his influence to foster independence in the critic . In the way of negative help , he should cease to tempt lazy and indifferent reviewers with ready-made notices , the perfunctory and insincere work of some minor employee ; he should stop sending out , as " literary " notes , thinly disguised advertisements and irrelevant personalities ; he should no longer supply photographs of his authors in affected poses that display their vanity much and their talent not at all . That vulgarity he should leave to those who have soubrettes to exploit ; Ile should not treat his authors as if they were variety artists ? unless , indeed , they are just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a low vaudeville house . These cheap devices lower his dignity as a publisher , they are a positive hurt to the reputation of his authors , they make less valuable to him the periodical that prints them , and they are an irritation and an insult to the critic , for one and all they are attempts to insinuate advertising into his honest columns . Frankly , they are modes of corruption , and degrade the whole business of writing . In the way of positive help , he should relieve of every commercial preoccupation not only the editors and contributors of any magazines that he may control , but also those authors of criticism and critical biography whose volumes he may print . Having cleaned his own house , he should steadily demand of the publications in which he advertises a higher grade of critical writing , and select the periodicals to which to send his books for notice according , not to the partiality , but to the ability of their reviews . Thus he would do much to make others follow his own good example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publisher , of course , has no absolute rights , not even that of having his books noticed at all . His interests only have been in question , and , in the long run and in the mass , these will not he harmed , but benefited , by criticism honestly adverse . He has in his writers a hundred talents , and if his selection is shrewd most of them bring profit . Frank criticism will but help the task of judi- ' cious culling . But all that has been said assumes the cheerful sacrifice of the particular author who must stake his all upon his single talent . Does his comparative helplessness give him any right to tender treatment ? It does not : in respect of rights his , precisely , is the predicament of the publisher . If an author puts forth a book for sale , he obviously can be accorded no privilege incompatible with the right of the public to know its value . Ile can not ask to have the public fooled for his benefit ; he can not ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic must neglect to inform his readers . That is rudimentary . Nor may the author argue more subtly that , until criticism is a science and truth unmistakable , he should be given the benefit of the doubt . This was the proposition behind the plea , strongly urged not so long ago , that all criticism should be " sympathetic ; " that ts , that the particular critic is qualified to judge those writers only whom on the whole he likes . Love , it was declared , is ' the only key to understanding . The obvious value of the theory to the Silent Bargain accounts for its popularity with the commercial interests . Now , no one can quarrel with the criticism of appreciation ? it is full of charm and service ; but to pretend that it should be the only criticism is impertinent and vain . To detect the frivolity of such a pretension , one has only to apply it to public affairs : imagine a political campaign in which the candidates were criticised only by their friends ! No : the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite as likely to be right when he does so as when he applauds what he thinks is good . In a task wherein the interest of the public is the one that every time and all the time should be served , mercy to the author is practically always a betrayal . To the public , neither the vanity aor the purse of the author is of the slightest consequence . Indeed , a criticism powerful enough to curb the conceit of some authors , and to make writing wholly unprofitable to others would be an advantage to the public , to really meritorious authors , and to the publisher . And the publisher ? to consider his interests again for a moment ? would gain not merely by fhe suppression of useless , but by the discipline of spoiled , writers . For the Silent Bargain so works as to give to many an author an exaggerated idea of his importance . It leads the publisher himself ? what with his complaisant reviewers , his literary notes , his personal paragraphs , his widely distributed photographs ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Sometimes he succeeds . When the spoiled writer , taking all this au grand s &ieux,; asks why sales are not larger , then how hard is the publisher pressed for an answer ! If the author chooses to believe , not the private but the public statement of his merit , and bases upon it either a criticism of his publisher 's energy or a demand for further publishing favors , ? increase of advertising , higher royalties , what not , ? the publisher is in a ridiculous and rather troublesome quandary . None but the initiated know what lie has occasionally to endure from the arrogance of certain writers . Here fearless criticism should help him much . But if the conceit of some authors offends , the sensitiveness of others awakens sympathy . The author does his work in solitude ; his material is his own soul ; has anxiety about a commercial venture is complicated with the apprehension of the recluse who comes forth into the market-place with his heart upon his sleeve . Instinctively he knows that , as his book is himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is truly criticism of him , not of his intellectual ability merely , but of his essential character , his real value as a man . Let no one laugh until he has heard and survived the most intimate , the least friendly comment upon his own gifts and traits made in public for the delectation of his friends and acquaintances and of the world at large . Forgivably enough , the author is of all persons the one most likely to be unjust to critics and to criticism . In all ages he has made bitter counter-charges , and flayed the critics as they have flayed him . His principal complaints are three : first , that all critics are disappointed authors ; second , that many are young anci incompetent , or simply incompetent ; third , that they do not agree . Let us consider them in turn . Although various critics write with success other things than criticism , the first complaint is based , I believe , upon what is generally a fact . It carries two implications : the first , that one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform himself ; the second , that the disappointed author is blinded by jealousy . As to the first , no writer ever refrained out of deference to it from criticising , or even discharging , his cook . As to the second , jealousy does not always blind , sometimes it gives keenness of vision . The disappointed author turned critic may indeed be incompetent ; but , if he is so , it is for reasons that his disappointment does not supply . If he is able , his disappointment will , on the contrary , help his criticism . He will have a wholesome contempt for facile success ; he will measure by exacting standards . Moreover , the thoughts of a talented man about an art for the attainment of which he has striven to the point of despair are certain to be valuable ; his study of the masters has been intense , his study of his contemporaries has had the keenness of an ambitious search for the key to success . His criticism , even if saturated with envy , will have value . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hatred and malice may give as much insight into character as love . SainteBeuve was a disappointed author , jealous of the success of others . But ability is necessary . Envy and malice , not reinforced by talent , can win themselves small satisfaction , and do no more than transient harm ; for then they work at random and make wild and senseless charges . To be dangerous to the author , to be valuable to the public , to give pleasure to their possessor , they must be backed by acuteness to perceive and judgment to proclaim real flaws only . The disappointed critic of ability knows that the truth is what stings , and if he seeks disagreeable truth , at least he seeks truth . He knows also that continual vituperation is as dull as continual praise ; if only to give relief to his censure , he will note what is good . He will mix honey with the gall . So long as he speaks truth , he does a useful work , and his motives are of no consequence to any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughness , the author can not legitimately complain . Did he suppose that he was sending his book into a world of gentlemen only ? Truth is truth , and a boor may have it . That the standard of courtesy is sometimes hard to square with that of perfect sincerity is the dilemma of the critic ; but the author can quarrel with the fact no more than with the circumstance that in a noisy world he can write best where there is quiet . If he suffers , let him sift criticism through his family ; consoling himself , meanwhile , with the reflection that there is criticism of criticism and that any important critic will ultimately know his pains . Leslie Stephen was so sensitive that he rarely read reviews of his critical writings . After all , the critic is also an author . The second complaint of writers , that criticism is largely young and incompetent , ? or merely incompetent , ? is well founded . The reason lies in the general preference of publishers for criticism that is laudatory even if absurd . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-reviews , realizing that any fool can praise a book , is apt to increase his profits by lowering the wage of his critic . At its extreme point , his thrift requires a reviewer of small brains and less moral courage : such a man costs less and is unlikely ever to speak with offensive frankness . Thus it happens that , commonly in the newspapers and frequently in periodicals of some literary pretension , the writers of reviews are shiftless literary hacks , shallow , sentimental women , or crude young persons full of indiscriminate enthusiasm for all printed matter . I spoke of the magazines . When their editors say that literary papers are not popular , do they consider what writers they admit to the work , with what payment they tempt the really competent , what limitations they impose upon sincerity ? Do they not really mean that the amiable in manner or the remote in subject , which alone they consider expedient , is not popular ? Do they really believe that a brilliant writer , neither a dilettante nor a Germanized scholar , uttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest the public ? Do they doubt that such a writer could be found , if sought ? The reviews which they do print are not popular ; but that proves nothing in respect of better reviews . Whatever the apparent limitations of criticism , it actually takes the universe for its province . In subject it is as protean as life itself ; in manner , it may be what you will . To say , then , that neither American writers nor American readers can be found for it is to accuse the nation of a poverty of intellect so great as to be incredible . No ; commercial timidity , aiming always to produce a magazine so inoffensive as to insinuate itself into universal tolerance , is the fundamental cause of the unpopularity of the average critical article ; how can the public fail to be indifferent to what lacks life , appositeness to daily needs , conviction , intellectual and moral candor ? At least one reason why we have no Brunetiere is that there is almost no periodical in which such a man may write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our criticism there is , in the lower ranks , a lack of skill , of seriousness , of reasonable competence , and a cynical acceptance of the dishonest role they are expected to play ; in the higher ranks , there is a lack of any vital message , a desire rather to win , without offending the publisher , the approval of the ultra-literary and the scholarly , than really to reach and teach the public . It is this degradation , this lack of earnestness , and not lack of inherent interest in the general topic , which makes our critical work unpopular , and deprives the whole literary industry of that quickening and increase of public interest from which alone can spring a vigorous and healthy growth . This feebleness will begin to vanish the moment that the publishers of books , I ho support criticism , say peremptorily that reviews that interest , not reviews that puff , arewant . When they say this , that is the kind of reviews they will get . If that criticism indeed prove interesting , it will then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , and it will be supported where it should be ? not by the publisher but by the people . It is said in excuse that , as a city has the government , so the public has the criticism , which it deserves . That is debatable ; hut , even so , to whose interest is it that the taste of the public should be improved ? Honest criticism addressed to the public , by writers who study how to interest it rather than how to flatter the producers of books , would educate . The education of readers , always the soundest investment of the publisher , can never be given by servile reviewers feebly echoing his own interested advertisements . They are of no value ? either to the public , the publisher , or the author . The publisher of a newspaper of which reviews are an incident need not , bow-ever , wait for the signal . If , acting on the assumption that his duty is not to the publisher but to the public , he will summon competent and earnest reviewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will infallibly increase the vivacity and intermit of his articles and the pleasure and confidence of his readers . He will not have any permanent loss of advertising . Whenever he establishes his periodical as one read by lovers of literature , he has the publishers at his mercy . But suppose that his advertising decreases ? Let him not make the common mistake of measuring the value of a department by the amount of related advertising that it attracts . The general excellence of his paper as an advertising medium ? supposing he has no aim beyond profit ? is what he should seek . The public which reads and enjoys books is worth attracting , even if the publisher does not follow , for it buys other things than books . If , however , his newspaper is not one that can please people of literary tastes , he will get book-advertising only in negligible quantities no matter how much he may praise the volumes sent him . Of what use are puffs which fall not under the right eyes ? If , again , his periodical seems an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him profit , let him consider the parts of it unrelated to literature : he will find there matter which pleases readers of intelligence , and he may be sure that this , quite as much as his praise , is what brings the publishers ' advertisements ; he may be sure that , should he substitute sincere criticism , the advertisements would increase . The third complaint of the author ? from whom I have wandered ? is that critics do not agree . To argue that whenever two critics hold different opinions , the criticism of one of them must be valueless , is absurd . The immediate question is , valueless to whom ? to the public or to the author ? If the author is meant , the argument 186 Honest ' literary Criticism assumes that criticism is written for the instruction of the author , which is not true . Grammar and facts a critic can indeed correct ; but he never expects to change an author 's style or make his talent other than it is . Though he may lash the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with psychology , the critic knows that a mature writer does not change and can not change : his character is made , his gifts , such as they are , are what they are . On the contrary , the critic writes to influence the public , ? to inform the old , to train the young . He knows that his chief chance is with plastic youth ; he hopes to form the future writer , still more he hopes to form the future reader . He knows that the effect of good reviewing stops not with the books reviewed , but influences the reader 's choice among thousands of volumes as yet undreamed of by any publisher . If , on the other hand , the public is meant , the argument assumes that one man 's meat is not another man 's poison . The bird prefers seed , and the dog a bone , and there is no standard animal food . Nor , likewise , is there any standard intellectual food : both critics , however they disagree , may be right . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism . If there is any certainty about critics , it is that they will not think alike . The sum of x ( a certain book ) plus y ( a certain critic ) can never be the same as x ( the same book ) plus z ( a different critic ) . A given book can not affect a man of a particular ability , temperament , training , as it affects one of a different ability , temperament , and training . A book is never complete without a reader , and the value of the combination is all that can be found out . For the value of a book is varying : it varies with the period , with the nationality , with the character of the reader . Shakespeare had one value for the Elizabethans , he has a different value for us , and still another for the Frenchman ; he has a special value for the play goer , and a special value for the student in his closet . In respect of literary art , pragmatism is right : there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing there is a new truth born with each new reader . Therein lies the unending fascination of books , the temptation to infinite discussion . To awaken an immortal curiosity is the glory of genius . From all this it follows that critics are representative : each one stands for a group of people whose spokesman he has become because he has , on the whole , their training , birth from their class , the prejudices of their community and of their special group in that community , and therefore expresses their ideals . Once let publisher and author grasp this idea , and criticism , however divergent , will come to have a vital meaning for them . The publisher can learn from the judgment of the critic what the judgment of his group in the community is likely to be , and from a succession of such judgments through a term of years , he can gain valuable information as to the needs , the tastes , the ideals of the public or of the group of publics which he may wish to serve . Accurate information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not too often repeat , is worth more to him than any amount of obsequious praise . That precisely is what he can not get until all critics arc what they should be ? lawyers whose only clients are their own convictions . The author also gains . Although he is always liable to the disappointment of finding that his book has failed to accomplish his aim , he nevertheless can draw the sting from much adverse criticism if he will regard not its face value , but its representative value . He is writing for a certain audience ; the criticism of that audience only , then , need count . If he has his own public with him , he is as safe as a man on an island viewing a storm ttt sea , no matter how critics representing other publics may rage . Not all the adverse comment in this country upon E. P. Roe , in England on Ouida , in France on Georges Ohnet ever cost them a single reader . Their audience heard it not ; it did not count . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if these writers had a tragedy , it lay in their not winning the audience of their choice . But this does not disturb the statement as to the vanity of adverse criticism for an author who hears objurgations from people whom he did not seek to please . Sometimes , indeed , such objurgations flatter . If , for example , the author has written a novel which is in effect an attempt to batter down ancient prejudice , nothing should please him more than to hear the angry protests of the conservative ? they may be the shrieks of the dying , as was the case , for instance , when Dr. Holmes wrote the Autocrat ; they show , at any rate , that the.book has hit . Now , each in its degree , every work of art is controversial and can not help being so until men are turned out , like lead soldiers , from a common mould . Every novel , for example , even when not written " with a purpose , " has many theories behind it ? a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proper content , a theory of life . Every one is a legitimate object of attack , and in public or private is certain to be attacked . Does the author prefer to be fought in the open or stabbed in the dark ? ? that is really his only choice . The author of a novel , a poem , an essay , or a play should think of it as a new idea , or a new embodiment of an idea , which is bound to hurtle against others dear to their possessors . He should remember that a book that arouses no discussion is/ a poor , dead thing . Let him cultivate the power of analysis , and seek from his critics , not praise , but knowledge of what , precisely , he has done . If he has sought to please , he can learn what social groups he has charmed , what groups he has failed to interest , and why , and may make a new effort with a better chance of success . If he has sought to prevail , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is more important , upon whom . In either case , to know the nature of his general task , he must learn three things : whom his book has affected , how much it has affected them , and in what way it has affected them . Only through honest , widespread , really representative criticism , can the author know these things . Whatever their individual hurts , the publisher of books , the publisher of book-reviews , and the author should recognize that the entire sincerity of criticism , which is the condition of its value to the public , is also the condition of its value to them . It is a friend whose wounds are faithful . The lesson that they must learn is this : an honest man giving an honest opinion is a respectable person , and if he has any literary gift at all , a forcible writer . What he says is read , and what is more it is trusted . If he has cultivation enough to maintain himself as a critic , ? as many of those now writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? he acquires a following upon whom his influence is deep and real , and upon whom , in the measure of his capacity , he exerts an educational force . If to honesty he adds real scholarship , sound taste , and vivacity as a writer , he becomes a leading critic , and his influence for good is proportionally enlarged . If there were honest critics with ability enough to satisfy the particular readers they served on every periodical now printing literary criticism , public interest in reviews , and consequently in books , would greatly increase . And public interest and confidence once won , the standing and with it the profit of the four groups commercially interested in literature would infallibly rise . This is the condition which all four should work to create . Would it arrive if the publisher of books should repudiate the Silent Bargain ? If he should send with the book for review , not the usual ready-made puff but a card requesting only the favor of a sincere opinion ; if , furthermore , he showed his good faith by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literary Criticism reviewing was best , would the critical millennium come ? It would not . I have made the convenient assumption that the critic needs only perniission to be sincere . Inevitable victim of the Silent Bargain he may be , but he is human and will not be good simply because he has the chance . But he would be better than he is ? if for no other reason than because many of his temptations would be removed . The new conditions would at once and automatically change the direction of his personal interests . He and his publisher would need to interest the public . Public service would be the condi. tion of his continuing critic , at all . He would become the agent , not of the publisher to the public , but of the public to the publisher . And although then , as now in criticism of political affairs , insincere men would sacrifice their standards to their popularity , they would still reflect public opinion . To know what really is popular opinion is the first step toward making it better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for publisher and author , of the first public importance for the effective leaders of public opinion . This new goal of criticism ? the desire to attract the public ? would have other advantages . It would diminish the amount of criticism . One of the worst effects of the Silent Bargain is the obligation of the reviewer to notice every book that is sent him ? not because it interests him , not because it will interest his public , but to satisfy the publisher . Thus it happens that many a newspaper spreads before its readers scores upon scores of perfunctory reviews in which are hopelessly concealed those few written with pleasure , those few which would be welcome to its public . Tired by the mere sight , readers turn hopelessly away . Now , many books lack interest for any one ; of those that remain , many lack interest for readers of a particular publication . Suppose a reviewer , preoccupied , not with the publisher , but with his own public , confronted by the annual mass of books : ask yourself what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , those books only in which he thought that he could interest his readers ? He would warn his public against books which would disappoint them , he would take pleasure in praising books which would please them . The glow of personal interest would be in what he wrote , and partly for this reason , partly because the reviews would be few , his public would read them . Herein , again , the publisher would gain : conspicuous notices of the right books would go to the right people . An automatic sifting and sorting of his publications , like that done by the machines which grade fruit , sending each size into its appropriate pocket , would take place . But the greatest gain to criticism remains to be pointed out . The critics who have chosen silence , rather than submission to the Silent Bargain , would have a chance to write . They are the best critics , and when they resume the pen , the whole industry of writing will gain . But the critic , though liberated , has many hard questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the question of his motives , which I said are of no consequence to the author or to the public so long as what he speaks is truth ; but which , I must now add , are of great consequence to him . If he feels envy and malice , he must not cherish them as passions to be gratified , but use them , if at all , as dangerous tools . He must be sure that his ruling passion is love of good work ? a love strong enough to make him proclaim it , though done by his worst enemy . There is the question again of his own limitations : he must be on his guard lest they lead him into injustice , and yet never so timid that he fails to say what be thinks , for fear it may be wrong . I speak of these things from the point of view of the critic 's duty to himself ; but they are a part also of his duty towards his neighbor , the author . What that duty may precisely be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plain . He ought to say as much against a friend as against an enemy , as much against a publisher whom he knows as against a publisher of England or France . He must dare to give pain . He must make his own the ideals of Sarcey . " I love the theatre , " he wrote to Zola , " with so absolute a devotion that I sacrifice everything , even my particular friends , even , what is much more difficult , my particular enemies , to the pleasure of pushing the public towards the ? play which I consider good , and of keeping it away from the play which I consider bad . " That perhaps was comparatively easy for Sarcey with his clear ideal of the well-made piece ; it is perhaps easy in the simple , straightforward appraisal of the ordinary book ; but the critic may be excused if he feels compunctions and timidities when the task grows more complex , when , arming himself more and more with the weapons of psychology , he seeks his explanations of a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passions , the brains , the very disorders of the author . flow far in this path may he go ? Unquestionably , he may go far , very far with the not too recent dead ; but with the living how far may he go , how daring may he make his guess ? For guess it will be , since his knowledge , if not his competence , will be incomplete until memoirs , letters , diaries , reminiscences bring him their enlightenment . One thinks first what the author may suffer when violent hands are laid upon his soul , and one recoils ; but what of the public ? Must the public , then , not know its contemporaries just as far as it can ? these contemporaries whose strong influence for good or evil it is bound to undergo ? These have full license to play upon the public ; shall not the public , in its turn , be free to scrutinize to any , the most intimate extent , the human stuff from which emanates the strong influence which it feels ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify vivisection ? Is literature an amusement only , or is it a living force which on public grounds the critic has every right in all ways to measure ? Doubtless his right in the particular case may be tested by the importance of the answer to the people , yet the grave delicacy of this test ? which the critic must apply himself ? is equaled only by the ticklishness of the task . Yet there lies the path of truth , serviceable , ever honorable truth . The critic is , in fact , confronted by two standards . Now and again he must make the choice between admirable conduct and admirable criticisms % are not the same . II-776Mus that what is outrageous conduct may be admirable criticism , that what is admirable conduct may be inferior , shuffling criticism . Which should he choose ? If we make duty to the public the test , logic seems to require that he should abate no jot of his critical message . It certainly seems hard that he should be held to a double ( and contradictory ) standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held excused . The priest is upheld in not revealing the secrets of the confessional , the lawyer for not betraying the secret guilt of his client , although as a citizen each should prefer the public to the individual ; whereas the critic who , reversing the case , sacrifices the individual to the public , is condemned . The public should recognize , I think , his right to a special code ? like that accorded the priest , the lawyer , the soldier , the physician . He should be relieved of certain social penalties , fear of which may cramp his freedom and so lessen his value . Who can not easily see that a critic may write from the highest sense of duty words which would make him the " no gentleman " that Cousin said Sainte-Beuve was ? But the whole question is thorny ; that writer will do an excellent service to letters who shall speak an authoritative word upon the ethics of criticism . At present , there is nothing ? except the law of libel . The question is raised here merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the greatest freedom help rather than hurt the cause of literature ? Is not the double standard too dangerous a weapon to be allowed to remain in the hands of the upholders of the Silent Bargain ? Meanwhile ? until the problem is solved ? the critic must be an explorer of untraveled ethical paths . Let him be bold ? whether he is a critic of the deeds of the man of action , or of those subtler but no less real deeds , the words of an author ! For , the necessary qualifications made , all that has been said of literary criticism applies to all criticism ? everywhere there is a Silent Bargain to be fought , everywhere honest opinion has powerful foes . The thing to do for each author of words or of deeds , each critic of one or the other  --  is to bring his own pebble of conviction ? however rough and sharp-cornered ? and throw it into that stream of discussion which will roll and grind it against others , and finally make of it and of them that powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men will raise the crop called truth .
