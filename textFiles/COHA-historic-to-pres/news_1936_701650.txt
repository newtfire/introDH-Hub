A Question of Ethics . THE TIMES was never more correct than in its editorial on the news photographers and their methods . Long years ago newspaper writers saw fit to establish a code of ethics , and stand by it . These men chose to be gentlemen , and it is a matter of record that there have been remarkably few lapses from their code . Can the youngish profession of camera men do as much ? Will they ? Can this profession afford to reject the standards of gentlemanly conduct , long since adopted voluntarily by its compeers ? Or must it be forced into a code that calls for little more than decent conduct ? The issue seems to be clearly drawn . It can not be long ignored . The next move seems to be up to the camera men themselves . Will they make it ? EDWARD HUNGERFORD . New York , Dec. 27 , 1935.
