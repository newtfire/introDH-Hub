A TIME poll shows Chappaquiddick is a fading issue <P> Chappaquiddick . It is supposed to be the big hurdle between Ted Kennedy and the presidency . But a new TIME poll shows that 79% of American voters think that the time has come to put aside the incident and judge the Senator on what he has done in the nine years since then . More than 75% state flatly that Chappaquiddick would not be enough to sway their vote against him if they felt that he were the best man . Despite Kennedy 's denials , a majority of the voters think he will run for President . Moreover , Democrats currently favor him over Jimmy Carter by a huge margin for their party 's nomination in 1980 . <P> These are the findings of a national telephone sampling of 1,004 registered voters conducted for TIME on Aug. 2 and 3 by the opinion research firm of Yankelovich , Skelly and White , Inc . The poll shows that if Democrats were given a choice now , 58% would pick Kennedy and 30% Carter as their nominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included California Governor Jerry Brown . The outcome , as indicated by the poll : Kennedy 49% , Carter 21% , Brown 19% . The support for Kennedy ranges broadly among all types of Democratic voters . <P> Kennedy , the poll shows , would handily beat Gerald Ford in an election today by 47% to 41% , but Carter would lose to Ford by 44% to 35% . Kennedy would carry the South ; Carter would not . Of those who voted for Carter two years ago , only 60% say they would do so now , but 70% of them would vote for Kennedy . <P> Kennedy 's strength reflects a sharp decline in voter concern over the incident on the Martha 's Vineyard bridge that many thought would ruin his career . Public sentiment could change , of course , if Kennedy became a candidate for President and Chappaquiddick were raised as an issue . But , at this point , only 11% of those surveyed are bothered a lot by the fact that he was at a party with a group of single women on that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by his having gone off alone with Mary Jo Kopechne . The greatest concern , expressed by about 40% of those polled , is that he waited until morning to report the accident to police and did not immediately tell the whole story about it to the public . But the people questioned believe , by 42% to 35% ( with 22% not sure ) , that he did eventually report it truthfully . <P> People say by 56% to 33% that the Chappaquiddick incident does not reveal a basic flaw in Kennedy 's character . More think that Kennedy would be better in times of crisis than Carter would be . The low degree of concern about the incident reflects the arrival of a post-Chappaquiddick generation of voters : the youngest people polled are the least concerned . <P> Kennedy has been an outstanding Senator , say 84% of the Democrats and 75% of all voters ; he is also a loyal party man , say 87% of the Democrats and 83% of all voters . Only 29% of the Democrats and 38% of all voters characterize him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with his wife raises questions about his fitness for the presidency , and 60% fear that if he were elected he would be assassinated .
