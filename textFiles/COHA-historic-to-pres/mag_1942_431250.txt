In the latter part of the nineteenth century many middle-aged and elderly people all over the world became optimistic about the disappearance of war from this planet . In America such people had known sharp anxieties during our war with Mexico and had suffered hard throughout our four years of Civil War . Sympathetic , their hearts had been wrung for other nations fighting in the Crimea and in Bohemia , in Italy and in Turkey , and in the distraught and conquered France of 1870 . So they and many other gentlehearted people everywhere , well understanding the agonies of war and believing confidently in man 's capacity for intelligence , said : " It is enough ! The world at last has learned its lesson and now will proceed to become civilized . There never will be another war . " Then presently came our Spanish War , the Boer War , the RussianJapanese War , and quite a number of wars in the Balkans . The surviving optimists who 'd thought war extinct had to bear the shock of discovering the world to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when Genseric ravaged Africa . Youth , though nowadays generally opposed to war , does the actual fighting . The young people read books and take lecture courses on politics , economics , and psychology , mainly learning new words for old things , and they wonder crossly why their grandfathers were too stupid to make the world perfect . Then youth grows into maturity and performs most of Grandfather 's failures all over again . Boys and girls " read history , " but do not live it until their turn comes . The individual learns by experience only ; thus a generation of individuals has no more than its own experience as its actual guide . From 1914 into 1918 some millions of German youths suffered death or anguish or both , whipped up by their emperor 's slogan , " Germany must have a Place in the Sun , " and most of them would n't have done it again ; but the next generation of young Germans fell easy victims to a substitute emperor and his substitute slogan , " Germany must have Lebensraum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word for the same old thing , and both " Lebensraum " and " a Place in the Sun " mean conquest ? that is , seizing other people 's property and killing enough of its defenders to be able to enslave the rest . This is an ancient process . When all the world was either savage or barbaric , nothing was more dangerous for any tribe than to become prosperous peacefully through its industry and thrift . The moment its warriors were plowmen it perished , because the covetous tribe next door came raiding with sling and ax and torch , destroyed the men , took the women and cattle and land . " The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold , " and in a world of wolves there 's not much longevity for fat sheep . Those nineteenth-century optimists who thought there 'd be no more war did n't realize that in the world existed nations still susceptible to the ancient tribal impulses , still capable of being whipped up to be conquerors . The optimists were not alone in their ignorance ; whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of devoting themselves entirely to the arts of peace . One thoroughly warlike , powerful tribe can destroy a thousand unready peaceful ones : one wolf in the flock can finish all the sheep . Thus , because there still are tribal nations , the world still is what it was in the days of Genseric or Genghis Khan or Attila ; for all the rest of us must turn warrior to stop the raids before they reach our pastures . In the fifth decade of the twentieth century after Jesus Christ we all must train ourselves to kill men who will kill us or enslave us if we do n't kill them . W e do n't like this state of things . We know that it 's neither modern nor sensible ; but we have no choice . For the second time in this still-young century the world is compelled to devote its whole power to the destruction of human beings and their products , because a few of its nations have reverted to tribalism . What hope is there that mankind can escape from a sequence ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent progress ? so that this century shall not be known in later history as the period of the Wars against World Enslave-ment ? All of us are sufferingly aware just now that three such wars would be too many ; and that if we can not avert the third for our children , then our grandchildren probably wo n't be able to avoid the fourth and fifth . How then can we avert the third , we who have failed to avert the second ? We 're not much helped by the knowledge that in the reverted nations there were certain people who had modern consciences . They did not avoid the reversion of their nations into tribalism ; and in practice all members of a tribe must bear the consequences of its be-havior @#  | as a whole , its actions in obedience to the chieftains to whom it submits the conduct of its life . Tragic as this fact is , all Germany is responsible for Rotterdam , all Japan for Pearl Harbor . To avert a third world war we can not rely upon the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read history wrong or unless its pattern since the last Caesar goes awry , the warrior tribes will presently be checked ; but how long afterward can the rest of us hold them in check ? Not forever , not thirty years probably ; for the mild individuals among them will not overcome the tribal impulse that has led the Axis nations to their bloody endeavors . Only one thing can prevail against the mighty power of the tribal impulse , and that is the wane and disappearance of the impulse itself .  | Can we hope for such a miracle ? For the answer history speaks : the future is always the creation of the past and can be read only by what light is shed from the past . A hundred years before the German legions tramped into helpless Belgium in 1914 , another nation had gone tribal under a conqueror-complexed chieftain , a substitute king-emperor , the " Corsican Ogre , " Bonaparte . For twenty years he 'd trampled the whole of Europe underfoot ; he 'd carried war into Egypt and had taken Moscow ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Spain , a. : the allies held him within a ring , tigi --  - ened it and took its center , Paris , frc - him . Law and order were restored ? Europe ; that is to say , civilization v : restored . There was a flare-up for Wate -- loo ; but 1814 was really the end of twenty-year orgy of French tribalis ? And why was this true ? It was exhaus-. : because the nation it had animated v : ; exhausted . Napoleon himself would have fou- to the last French boy of twelve , because conqueror-complexed creatures can quit till they 're killed or caged ; but w remained of Napoleon 's armies had . stomach for more fighting , and the peop of France were sick of war " glor : They 'd been overfed with victories and their hero ; they found both too costly 4 blood . The French had lost so much ! their own blood , indeed , that they v longer had any will to shed the bi. ? + of others . Thus the tribal impulse : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe was over . Europe has a peace not again to be broken by a Fra-.s on the warpath for " la Gloire " and r bery by force . AT THE end of 1918 the tribal imp r in Germany for " a Place in the S was checked ; but the tribe had n't shausted itself to the point reached . , , I. France in 1814 . So the substitute empc : Hitler , with his war cry for " Lebo : - raum , " was able to prepare the t -- . again for the bloody raids , sharpen. : -c the spears and arrowheads by night in secret places ; and then , when all ready , he sent forth the ardent yo. : warriors to destroy and enslave or -- the words he himself loves ? to " arr hilate " and " exterminate . " The arhilators and exterminators , however . - being faced manfully , and , when t s themselves have suffered sufficient nihilation and extermination , German : tribal impulse will be checked again More than mere checking is necess . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and for Germans children . That is to say , the tribal nat : : can learn the lesson only through town exhaustion and the discovery themselves that in the modern we . tribalism does n't pay . All the energies of the United Nati. now are devoted to the task of help . Germany and Japan to exhaust the selves . If we persist until the exhaus- : of the two nations is sufficient , t : . predatory tribalism need n't be feared our children and grandchildren . &i; country will not falter in the tremense persistence that is needed . When has American spirit faltered before the to terest task ? It will not do so now in great hour , not even if that hour nt stretch into years . We are living a dying for a future that will be clean. of barbarism.
