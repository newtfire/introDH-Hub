The demand for the repeal of the present Bankrupt law , which has been growing in emphasis for the last four years and more , and which has at length carried , by an overwhelming vote , the more conservative branch of the National Legislature , has arisen from the alarming frequency of fraudulent failures . . While the law was primarily intended to check the tendency to avoidable insolvency , to prevent discrimination among creditors on the part of those who are unable to meet all their obligations , and to secure an equitable distribution of all the available assets of a bankrupt estate among those having valid claims upon it , in point of fact it has operated to encourage unnecessary bankruptcy , and to promote fraud . This has been the fault of the provisions of this law , and not of the general principle underlying enactments intended to effect a definitive settlement of insolvent estates . The fact of fraudulent failures is notorious , and shows a prevailing lack of mercantile morality that is simply plorable , and has much to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzes the hands of enterprise . It is so common a thing for men who find them selves , for the time , financially embarrassed to suspend payment and propose to compromise with their creditors , and to effect a composition which leaves them a surplus of capital for a new start , that it scarcely attracts notice any longer . It is done every week , and the men who have thus defrauded their creditors out of a large percentage of their dues proceed in business with their ill-gotten savings , holding high their heads and appearing unconscious of guilt or dishonor . They do not lose standing among decent men , and , strange as it may appear , they hardly seem to suffer in credit , but continue to be trusted by the very persons whom they have swindled . It is not ! difficult to see how this state of things has been promoted , though it could not have been entirely produced by the operation of the Bankrupt law , especially since the mischievous amendments of 1S74 . The law as then modified allows a voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which two-thirds of his creditors consent and on payment of 30 per cent . of his liabilities , and affords ample opportunity for escape with whatever excess above 30 per cent . there may be . On the other hand , it makes it impossible for less than onefourth of the creditors in number , or onethird in amount of claims , to put any person into involuntary bankruptcy , and enables the bankrupt even then to make preferences almost without hindrance , and filially to obtain a discharge without payment of anything at all or the consent of any of his creditors , provided he can succeed in making away with his property or making it appear that he has none left , for which nothing but unscrupulous skill is necessary . Not only do bankruptcy proceedings under the law give great opportunities for fraud , and invite unnecessary insolvency on the part of those dishonest enough to take advantage of these opportunities , but they involve so much delay and vexation for the creditors , and such an exhaustion of the assets by costs and fees , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own terms . It is only necessary for him to threaten or to show a disposition to go into bankruptcy , and the ' creditors will take alarm and accept whatever they can get amicably arid peaceably , knowing full well that if the threat is carried out they will stand a chance , after months of delay and annoyance , of having to put up with still less . The fees of registers , clerks , counsel , and marshals , and the costs of the court , are sure to leave little of the assets , and it will be fortunate if the debtor has not placed the residue , by some hod'us-poeus , into friendly hands where he can get it again after hid discharge has been duly executed . Thus the working of the law drives creditors to make the best terms they ' can and emboldens dishonest debtors to resort to insolvency to get rid of their embarrassments without giving up more than a fraction of their property . Such a condition of things is alike disgraceful to our legislators and to our business wen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up and enforce a high standard of mercantile morality . That must come from the character of business men and the force of opinion that prevails among them . If they will be cheats and swiadlers and tolerate swindling practices in their dealings , there is probably no power in laws wIrllJy to prevent it , but they will find in the long run that the demoralization and lack of confidence which their own behavior has produced will interfere seriously with eiteir prosperity . But the law can furnish checks and restraints upon the practical effects of dishonesty and turpitude . It eau preveni , at least in a great majority of cases , the succ assful execution of sinister purposes and can compel men to a substantial fulfillment of their obligations . A Bankrupt law may be so framed as to make it a serious thing to be insolvent , to prevent a fraudulent escape from valid obligations , and to effect a fair distribution among creditors of all the assets of a broken ? concern . It should not make bankruptcy easy , but when it does occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
