FOOD &; DRINK <P> Not long ago , the average American thought that people who drank wine with their meals were either oddballs or foreigners-or both . The wine drinker , in short , was assumed to be either a recent immigrant who had not yet adjusted to the American way of life or a rich sybarite with exotic tastes . Exotic , because wine naturally meant French wine . <P> But in the last decade , more and more ordinary Americans have been discovering that a taste for wine is both respectable and rewarding . Where once a bottle of wine was reserved for special occasions , it is now often no more unusual on the table than a pitcher of milk . What 's more , 95% of the wine that Americans drink is made in the U.S. <P> With the notable exception of champagne ( largely produced in upper New York State ) , nearly all U.S. wines come from the 22,000 vineyards of California . Americans have discovered that many California wines are often better than European vins ordinaires , and that a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ) French wines . <P> The Count . The founding father of the California wine industry was a wandering Hungarian named Agostin Haraszthy , who appeared in San Diego one day in 1849 . California wine was then largely made from the sweet , heavy purple grape brought from Spain by the Franciscan monks . " The Count , ' ' as Haraszthy was called , did not like it . He persuaded the legislature that the state 's wine needed improvement , and in 1861 , he took off for Europe , returned with 200,000 cuttings of Europe 's finest vines-a favor that California later returned. * <P> In the next decades , winemaking became a tidy local industry . But when Prohibition came , the vintners either ground out tons of grape juice or sadly closed down their presses and let their plump grapes wrinkle up into raisins . After repeal , the vineyards recovered only slowly , did not begin to produce wine they could be proud of till the late 1930s . <P> The man who has since done most to popularize wine in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; J. Gallo Winery Corp . in Modesto . Until recently , United Vintners , run by Gallo 's rival Louis Petri , was the biggest producer of cheap wines in the nation , but Gallo has been coming up fast and this year he hopes to peddle 40 million gallons to make himself undisputed top bottle in the business . His methods shock the traditional winemakers . His stainless-steel vats and presses are by far the most technologically advanced in the world ( " You wo n't find a stick of wood in our winery " ) ; he pumps his wine by the millions of gallons through canvas hoses from tank to tank . He has taken to radio and television to advertise his wares with singing commercials ( " Ripple-the wine with that ring-a-ding flavor . . . Oh-oh , that ring-a-ding taste ! ' ' ; " Everybody gooes , for Gypsy Ro-ose ! " ) . <P> Sneaky Pete . Gallo has no use for his premium-wine competitors , who are chiefly concentrated in the Napa Valley . " The reason people think Napa Valley wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it costs more . The wine snobs like it because it costs more . The so-called fine wineries ' audience is composed of wine snobs . Well , let ' em have each other . "
