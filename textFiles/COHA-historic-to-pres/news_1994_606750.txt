Candidate Bush pounds a few backs and shakes a few hands as he makes his way to the lectern at the juvenile justice center in Corpus Christi , Tex . " We 've got to lock these people up , " he tells the crowd . " These children must be punished . " <p> A thousand miles away , Candidate Bush grabs a few shoulders and shakes a few hands as he squeezes past tables full of supporters in a gaudy Gay Nineties ballroom in Orlando , Fla . " It 's time to put these people away , " he says . " Juvenile criminals must know they will be punished . " <p> Has the political consultant 's dream finally come true  --  cloned candidates , a political franchise operation ? Or are the voters of Texas and Florida witnessing a political dynasty in the making ? <p> " I 'm not running because I 'm the son of George and Barbara Bush , but because I 'm the father of children 's names here , " brothers George W. Bush and Jeb Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors . <p> Come Nov. 8 , the Bush boys  --  derided by their opponents as " Shrubs , " " Bush Lite " and " Daddy 's Boys "  --  could capture the governor 's mansion in two of the country 's four largest states . <p> There 's a bumper sticker that has appeared in both Texas and Florida : " I did n't vote for his Daddy either . " <p> In Florida , Jeb , 41 , has pulled ahead of the enervated Democratic incumbent , Lawton Chiles , mainly on the strength of Jeb 's promises to fry more murderers , put prisoners to work and require voter approval of all tax hikes . <p> Jeb is perhaps the first Bush who has had to deal with the charge that he is too " radical " to hold office  --  an accusation made by his Republican primary opponents in an unprecedented joint attack ad . <p> In Texas , George W. , 48 , faces a tougher task than his brother , but the oldest Bush child is running about even with the popular Democratic incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away even if there are no jails . " Tents , " he says . " That 's the answer . " When someone says tents are problematic because someone might burn them down , Bush responds , " Hey , put the arsonists in asbestos tents . " <p> Kinder and gentler was Dad 's gambit . <p> What 's curious about the Bush sons is not their loyalty to their father  --  although both defend him vociferously  --  but their quest to tap into the same popular anger that turned George Herbert Walker Bush into a one-term president . <p> George W. and Jeb have adopted a conservative populism not of pork rinds and country music , but of cowboy boots and plaid shirts , boot camps and the death penalty . When the former president stooped to conquer  --  running his Willie Horton ads , hammering Michael Dukakis on the Pledge of Allegiance or questioning Bill Clinton 's war record  --  it somehow seemed out of character , a result of Bush 's patrician bearing , curious diction and apparent basic decency . <p> But the sons can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , sometimes surly  --  sticks to them . In this year of the outsider , when any connection to the political system can be poisonous , the Bushes are deftly transforming themselves into a new species of candidate : the insider 's outsider . <p> Ever since the Adams family , rich , patrician types have attempted to create American political dynasties . Taft , Roosevelt , Rockefeller , Kennedy  --  families that own compounds rather than houses keep trying to meld the aristocratic tradition with the populism of the ornery American electorate . <p> But the later generations of these political families have weak track records . The Roosevelt grandkids keep losing bids for minor office . The young Kennedys are n't wowing voters . Now comes the third generation of Bushes , clinging to their parents ' fame even as they claim that their lineage is purely incidental . <p> The men who seek to start a third Bush generation in American politics ( after their father and his father , the late senator from Connecticut , Prescott Bush ) can not escape the dynasty stories . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunbelt Bluebloods . <p> Their opponents paint them as dilettantes who have coasted through privileged lives . " That young Bush boy , " says a Richards attack ad . " He talks a good game , but has he ever done anything ? Seems like he always gets to start at the top . " <p> ( This line of attack is familiar to Texas voters . It was former Texas politician Jim Hightower who once said of Bush the father , " He was born on third base and thought he hit a triple . " ) <p> The brothers , Chiles and Richards say , are toy boys , dabblers who own 1.8 percent of the Texas Rangers baseball club ( George ) and 1 percent of the Jacksonville Jaguars football team ( Jeb ) . Actually , Jeb and George each managed to make millions in fields where political pedigree won them entree , but not necessarily success . <p> Still , neither brother has shied away from taking advantage of his parents ' celebrity to add millions to his campaign war chest at fat cat fund-raisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elder Bushes have raised more than $ 4.5 million . <p> On an autumn afternoon in Orlando , the daily thunderstorm threatens to wash away the bright bunting and billowing banners ( Bush for Governor , they say , with " Jeb " highlighted in red so you know which state you 're in ) . The candidate , tall , thin , with the earnest affect of a young preacher , energetically introduces his mother and father , the nation 's number one best-selling author and the former president of the United States . <p> Barbara Bush praises " this honest , decent , hard-working man we are proud to call son . " George Bush announces that " the baton has been passed . Elect our son governor of this state , " says the former president , generically . <p> No eyebrows are raised when Jeb is introduced to a crowd as " a principled conservative in the tradition of Jefferson , Madison and Hamilton . " Jeb 's speeches wo n't make it into Bartlett 's anytime soon . He is given to Limbaughisms such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live there . " And : " The age of relativism is over . There is absolute truth . You are responsible for your actions . " <p> Jeb opens his stump speech with the story of a Pinellas County woman who presented him with a gift of a pen set . " She said , ' Jeb , use it . Sign the death warrant for the man who killed my daughter . ' " Bush promises to wield that pen , to put prisoners to work and to " build a prison system big enough to put people away long enough so our fears can subside . " <p> Asked about his tough talk , Jeb bristles and says , angrily , " My rhetoric is n't macho . I 'm derided for being macho and demagogic and I 'm derided for not being macho . I 'm the cerebral one , remember ? " <p> Baby-faced and lanky , Jeb remains painfully defensive about comparisons with his brother or questions about his parents , even after 18 months of full-time campaigning . <p> At Jeb 's fund-raisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd with one-liners and sign the occasional autograph . Jeb introduces his parents and sits down . The second son seems little more than a sideshow . <p> At every appearance , Jeb defends his methods with this quip : " I think it would be a little weird if my mom and dad did n't come to campaign for me . I 'll make a deal with Lawton Chiles . If he promises to send down Hillary big laugh , or better yet , Joycelyn Elders huge cheers , I 'll promise that my mom and dad wo n't come back . " <p> Alike , but Not the Same <p> Number one son also invited his parents to come and raise money , but George W. laid down the law : Mom and Dad sit in the audience and remain mute . George W. does the talking . At one Texas fund-raiser , the Houston Chronicle said , the former president " sat at the head table like a mute centerpiece . " <p> George is the classic first child , glad-handing and jocular where Jeb is earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George is confident  --  or is it cocky ?  --  enough to take days off ; stop in at the Texas Rangers ballpark , where he is the managing partner ; fritter away nine hours chatting with reporters . <p> George has gotten used to the " Daddy 's Boy " ribbing and patiently answers all the predictable questions about his brother and parents . " When your name is George Bush and you 're involved in baseball , people show up to your rallies , " he says , just like that . <p> Jeb fits the second son stereotype : He cedes more authority to his parents , and surrounds himself with veterans of Dad 's campaigns , even as he angrily bats away questions about his heritage . " It 's not important , " he insists , even if his campaign has collected contributions from all 50 states . ( The Austin American-Statesman counted 1,400 contributors who have given to both Bush campaigns . ) <p> He 's nervous and careful around reporters , but he can get as excited as a kid , bounding over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's Sam Donaldson ? Is he really here ? " <p> Politically , both brothers have gone out of their way to get themselves a vision thing . Both proudly bear the conservative label . And that 's not the only similarity between George and Barbara 's first and second sons . Both candidates do interviews in Spanish . Both threaten to cut off welfare payments after two years or if the recipient continues to bear children . Both use words like " thugs " and " these people " to describe a criminal class whose terrifying acts may help the Bushes get elected . Both propose to build tens of thousands of jail cells to lock up crooks and throw away the keys . <p> George : " Government should not be the moral compass . Government can not make you love one another . Government telling you how to run your business is a bad thing . But government putting people in jail is a good thing . " <p> Jeb : " Government by its nature is not good . This campaign is about clubbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that George and Jeb consciously contrast themselves with their father so much as a realization that given their backgrounds  --  you know , the best schools  --  they have to get down and show they 're comfortable going to fish fries and grip ' n ' grins , " says J.M. " Mac " Stipanovich , a veteran of several Bush family campaigns . <p> The wags keep coming up with cute ways to tell the two Bushes apart . George is a ringer for his father ; Jeb takes more after Mom . George is the brawn ; Jeb the brains . George has a Texas twang ; Jeb speaks Spanish with a Cuban accent . George hunts ; Jeb plays golf . <p> Truth is , these are not peas in a pod . The brothers , seven years apart and never close , barely know each other anymore . They see each other only at the occasional Christmas gathering . They have not spoken during the campaign , except when Jeb let it be known that he was miffed because George stole one of his lines ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents ) . <p> Ask the brothers about each other , and they resort to the stereotypes they read in the magazines . Jeb on George : " He 's the feistiest , the most visceral . " George on Jeb : " He 's the smartest of us . " <p> Jeb : Man With a Mission <p> Jeb went out of his way to break the family mold after Andover , going to the University of Texas , marrying a Mexican woman , moving to Miami to enter the real estate business , even converting to Catholicism . <p> Born John Ellis Bush , Jeb did not come to his sense of mission until recently . Of his prep school years , he once told a reporter , " I was a cynical little turd in a cynical school . " In college during Vietnam , he was a longhair who considered filing for conscientious objector status , but lucked out when he drew a high draft number . <p> In Miami in the mid- ' 80s , Jeb occasionally lent friends the benefit of his Washington connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jeb called a Medicare official to ask that a Miami HMO in trouble with regulators get a " fair hearing . " The man who ran the HMO , Miguel Recarey , was later indicted on unrelated bribery charges and fled the country . <p> The people around Jeb are the post-Reagan GOP crowd  --  kids in their twenties with very short hair and very little tolerance for liberals , incumbents , Democrats , Washington and a host of other such evils . <p> They like Jeb because he 's a hard-working nice guy , a family man and a hard-liner of the Gingrich School . In one of his TV ads , Jeb appears in his trademark plaid shirt and khaki pants , and says over rising applause , " Prisoners ought to be working . They ought to be in work crews out on the highways and byways . Work is a virtue . ... Everybody in this room has to do it . Why should n't prisoners have to ? " <p> Florida 's Corrections Department says all prisoners do work , and nonviolent offenders do jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Petersburg Times called the ad " shameless pandering . " <p> " Oh , yeah , " Jeb says , " they call me right-wing , extremist , opportunist , sexist , trading on my name . Well , you 've got to be an exhibitionist to be in this . " He laughs . " No , having achieved financial security for my family , making a bunch of money did n't excite me . Politics is a contact sport , it 's ugly . But I think I can do something . My father saw politics as service . You can be far more effective if you view it as a mission , like a religion . " <p> George : Man With a Cause <p> That 's too highfalutin , too contemplative for George W. He likes to talk about change , action , freeing people from government restraints . His father 's notion of service seems too patrician , his brother 's concept of mission too theological . George W. fancies himself the practical one . <p> Perhaps that 's because the family yoke weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , it 's eerie : the same squint when he 's straining to make a point . The same bobbing eyebrows , prominent jaw and adenoidal voice . And listen , he 's even got a touch of that good old Bush syntax : " Need to see the report on that , " he says . " Hey , I knew what I was getting into with this race . But feel great . " <p> Flying from a radio appearance in Houston to a meeting with gang experts in Corpus Christi , George Walker Bush 's manner is a Texas knock-off of the man he calls " George H.W. " The oldest son was chief cheerleader in prep school and president of his fraternity in college . He does n't do introspective . He 's polite as can be . He upholds the family tradition of penning thank-you notes by the dozen . And despite his cowboy boots and other Texas trappings , he has the preppy 's ability to walk through flames without seeming to notice . <p> " I 'm trying to put civility back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his way to announce his respect for his opponent at most campaign stops . Of course , this is the same man who filled the role of enforcer during his father 's campaigns and administration , taking credit for the sacking of White House Chief of Staff John Sununu . <p> George was a carefree nomad through most of his early adult years ; he studiously avoided the student council president routine , drank too much , married late . Still , George is the one who followed his father to Andover , Yale , Skull and Bones , the jet pilot 's seat , the oil industry , and now politics . <p> " I was raised in Midland , Texas , and Dad was raised in Greenwich , Connecticut , " George W. offers by way of explanation . " Jeb and I bring a great set of values to this work , but my grandfather would have never dreamed we 'd live in a society with a 30 percent illegitimacy rate . I do n't care what your politics are . If you have children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this society . This is a generational difference . My dad ca n't think this way . " <p> No , the elder George Bush probably would n't feel right stumping for son George 's plan to treat 14-year-old criminals as adults or to house tens of thousands of thugs in tents or barracks . But in this year of super-heated rhetoric , George W. is a rare Republican whose vocabulary includes the word " expand , " which is what he proposes to do with family health clinics , Head Start and the state 's education efforts . <p> At George 's Houston headquarters , Republicans look as they did back in the days of Henry Cabot Lodge , Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney . Lots of noblesse , a fair measure of oblige , and more pearls than you can count . <p> " We 're old-fashioned Republicans here , " says Katy Plotkin , manning the phone bank for George the younger . " The old moderate types , not these new radicals . We like George and hope he follows his father 's footsteps . Anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fraternal differences : " I 'm more pragmatic , less ideological than Jeb , " he says . " And Jeb 's taking a more active role with Mother and Dad . " <p> Sibling Rivalry <p> Ah , a little dig at the little brother . There 's a lot of this in the Bush clan . Competition is at the heart of the family ethic , going back to the Ranking Committee , a mythical institution that issued rulings in the various athletic rivalries and other disputes among the Bush siblings . ( Neil , 39 , was disgraced by the savings and loan scandal and remains involved in various business ventures in Texas ; Marvin , 37 , is a partner in a series of Boston Chicken franchises in the Washington area ; Dorothy , known as " Doro , " 35 , was recently married to a Washington lobbyist . ) <p> George H.W. Bush drove his boys hard . In the only interview he has given in this campaign , the former president told Tom Fiedler , political editor of the Miami Herald , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could dive in the water and swim to the raft first . We 'd hit tennis balls into the air and see who could win the most dimes for catching them . " <p> Number one son is a marathon runner . Number two calls himself a " gladiator " ; his favorite TV show is " American Gladiators . " Jeb is the Bush son who once sequestered himself in a steam bath for an hour to win $ 5 from brother Neil , and then nearly beat the daylights out of him when his kid brother would n't cough up the cash . <p> When George hears that Jeb has n't had a drink since January , he cocks his chin and says , " I 'll show him . Have n't had a drink in eight years . " ( Unlike his opponent , Richards , George does not say he was ever an alcoholic , but he does say he gave up drinking because " it competes with your energy and you have to be focused and disciplined to do this . " ) <p> Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had indeed inhaled , he had been loyal to his wife , who was , he boasted , the only woman with whom he had ever slept . <p> Now , George hears the quotation and nearly leaps from his seat . " Jeb said that ? Oh , boy . No comment . I mean , Jeb 's setting a tough standard for the rest of us in that generation . Boy . I mean . I 'm not getting into that one . Jeb is a very different guy . He really said that ? "
