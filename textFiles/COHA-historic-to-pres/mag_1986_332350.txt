The defendant , said Federal Prosecutor John Douglass , was nothing short of a walking " gold mine " of U.S. intelligence capabilities . He knew how the U.S. was able to intercept the Soviet Union 's " command and control " communications , which contained military instructions from " the highest level " of the Kremlin to the next echelon of authority , according to the defendant 's former supervisor . He was familiar with a top-secret program for processing encoded Soviet messages and aware that it was being given an " upgraded capability " that would maintain its usefulness into the 1990s . He was the author of a 60-page " encyclopedia " on Soviet communication signals that set forth which ones were to receive top U.S. decoding priority and how quickly each had to be analyzed . <P> All of these data , said Douglass , were passed to the Soviet Union by Ronald W. Pelton , 44 , a former middle-level analyst for the super secret National Security Agency , which specializes in gathering electronic intelligence . Pelton 's espionage trial opened last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude this week . Observers were amazed by the Government 's willingness to discuss publicly the various means used by the U.S. to intercept and analyze Soviet communications , spy-craft capabilities that had never been openly acknowledged .

" <P> For weeks the Administration has forcefully been pressuring the press to withhold information strikingly similar to what was being openly disclosed in the Baltimore court . As the trial got under way , NSA Director William Odom and CIA Director William Casey issued an extraordinary statement admonishing / that the information revealed at the trial should not be a pretext for further disclosures about intelligence methods . Citing the " competing interests " of prosecutorial revelations and the need to protect the national security , the two intelligence chiefs warned reporters against " speculation and reporting details beyond the information actually released at trial .

" <P> While the amount of detail presented at the Pelton trial was unusual , it was far from complete . Federal prosecutors charged that Pelton sold the Soviets information about five U.S. communication " projects , " but they were identified merely as A through E and the way they functioned was described only cryptically . Hubert Atwater , a former co-worker at NSA , testified that Project A involved equipment that intercepted " a particular Soviet communications link . " The Post reported that the operation used U.S. submarines operating in the Sea of Okhotsk , off the Soviet eastern coast . Another ex-colleague identified Project B as an " ongoing operation " to upgrade equipment used in collecting and analyzing Soviet communications . An FBI agent , David Faulkner , who questioned Pelton before his arrest , testified that Pelton said Projects A and B were the only ones that appeared to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
