Henry J. Kaiser 's chief worries as a steelmaker have been over iron ore for his plant at Fontana , Calif . This week Kaiser felt that these worries were ended . After more than two years of haggling he had acquired mining rights to famed Eagle Mountain , best source of ore in the West . <P> Kaiser has been hauling most of his ore 185 miles from low-grade diggings at Kelso , Calif. , the rest 500 miles from Cedar City , Utah . Eagle Mountain , rising naked on the edge of the Mojave Desert , is only 153 miles from Fontana , is rich enough to supply Kaiser with low-cost , high-grade ore for at least 50 years . <P> In 1943 Kaiser bought title to Eagle Mountain from the Southern Pacific railroad for $1,000,000 . But it was encumbered by a lease on the iron deposits held by Edward T. Foley , closemouthed , hard-driving contractor who does a world-wide construction business from a side-street office in Pasadena . <P> To get ore , Kaiser had to buy it from Foley . Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally forced Kaiser to pay " in excess of $1,000,000 " for the lease . <P> The cash comes from Kaiser 's shipbuilding and Fontana earnings , with an O.K. from the Reconstruction Finance Corp . RFC figured that better earning prospects for Fontana meant a better prospect for repayment of the $115 million RFC loan on it . <P> Fontana 's production record is excellent on quantity , bad on cost . Example : In 1944 pig iron cost Fontana $24.50 a ton v. $17.42 for the government-owned Geneva plant . Since then Kaiser has lowered his costs . With Eagle Mountain , Kaiser expects to quote steel-hungry Pacific Coast industries new low steel prices , but steelmen will wait &; see . The mine wo n't be in full production for at least six months , and even then ore will have to be trucked 50 miles to the Southern Pacific tracks at Indio.
