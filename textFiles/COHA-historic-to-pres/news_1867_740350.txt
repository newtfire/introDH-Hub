The readers of the TIAIES are already well aware that no city in the South has accepted more fully the material duties of reconstruction than Adana . The energy with which the waste of war has been repaired ; the enterprise with which new fields i have been and are being opened to industry and trade , find their witness and reward in the loaded trains of the four railroads which centre in Atlanta , and the air of active business , almost Northern in its vitality , which pervades the city . Commerce and politics are too intimately connected to allow a people so wide awake In the one department to snore and dream in the other . Consequently you will find much common sense and little cant in 1 the political atmosphere of Atlanta . All parties tako things quietly , and even the rival newspapers prefer harmless " local " blackguarding to heated political discussion . " Items , " of the New Era , calls the Intelli11 gencer the " Daily Cuttle-fish , " and the retort courteous follows in the epithet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectators of which ( if there are any ) are not likely to become highly excited . THADDEUS STEVENS ' proclamations are looked upon with indifference by all parties . I fancy the Radicals dislike them most , because they are most likely to bear the odium of sympathy with the stern author . The only effect seriously fearsd in the South is the effect upon the black citizens , who in Bono places are led to expect an agrarian millenium . The freedmen of . Atlauta are too intelligent to be thus deceived , and their conduct indicates that they are fully aware that thrift will result from industry only . The rate at which they are advancing in intelligence , by the help of the admirable schools of the American Missionary Association , is marvelous indeed . The Southerners persist in doubting or flatly denying the capacity of the race , and the great mass even of otherwise sensible peopl3 refuse to visit the schools of the Association , or satisfy themselves of the good motives , good methods and good success of the Norththem teachers . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Atlanta is full of " select schools , " kept by decayed ladies , who disdain or are unable to do their own housework , and save their gentility by " taking pupils , " so as to hire a domestic . Alas I their teaching is in inverse ratio of quantity and quality with their pride . These teachers from necessity are no great help to education . We found that out in the North , long ago ; and forthwith began to examine , and finally to train with care those who aspired to this high responsibility . Now it is no derogation from the native abilities of Southern women to say that the education of our normal schools will beat them out of sight in the thoroughness and economy of time with , which they train scholars . There is a mighty difference in teachers , and nowhere is it more distinctly felt than in the first rudiments of learning , If I must cnoose , let my children have the best teachers while they learn to read and write and cipher ; then , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started right , they can better beat inferior instruction . The amount of which disquisition is , that the blacks , in this race of races , have the advantage of better teachers ; and this advantage will go far to counterbalance any presumed difference in native capacity . In a word , the negro may be naturally in. ferior to the white man ; but these negroes will speedily take the shine out of these white men , unless the latter look to their laurels , hitherto so Cheaply won . In matters of labor , there is a deference paid to facts . I notice that when blacksmiths are working together , the best workman is very apt to give peremptory orders to the rest ; and I have seen a black man , under such circumstances , indubitably " bossing a job . " But blacksmiths get their faces so dirty that they lose all distinctions of color . In Northern Georgia the mass of laboring men are white . Wages are $1 per day , and sometimes less : and a great many can not get work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation has been experienced anywhere in the State ? ( I donot undertake to speak for other districts . ) Many can not get meat , some are out of meal , but potatoes and other . garden stuff are abundant ; and vegetarianism , however unpleasant , ( save to the philesopher , 1 is still fir from famine . The corn sent to this district has all . been eaten by somebody ; and has done some good , no doubt , and relieved suffering . There has been i no end of applicants , so long a3 there was bounty to distribute ; burl do not regret that the bounty was I no greater . This experience is forcing men to work , and the more bitter it is the more brief it will be , ! and the better its lessons will lie learned . Poverty 1 covers the land , but it is uo disgrace to be poor , but i to stay poor , and that no one need do , even in barren " Cherokee . " " Cherokee " is that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was afterwards ceded by the United States to this State .. It was divided by lottery in several drawings , among the citizens of the State . At that time the land was thought nearly worthless ; now it Is found to contain some of the best gold mines in tho State . The limits of this letter will not allow me to enter into a description of the auriferous deposits of Georgia , and the means now being employed for their development . An extremely interesting and widely-copied article iu the TIMES last Spring , from a correspondent in this State , spoke of the " great variety of fissure veins " in our Georgia formations , a statement which surprised me , until , by study of the context , I discovered that the compositor had evidently mistaken rarity for variety ; at all events , the correction being made , the only error or confusion In the article was resolved in accordance with the facts . Unfortunately that widelycirculated article has done much to make the " fissure veins " of Georgia famous . 1. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? letters to capitalists . Well , what 's the odds ? Gold we have , as we will soon show you . In and about Dahlonega , several companies are doing well , and developments in Cobb County and near Etowah are encouraging . The " Glade " has been soldIfor $52 , - 000 cash , and is to be worked , Pray Heaven there be no patent crusher , new amalgamator , or other invention of the devil introduced to plague us . One or two determined men , who will erect substantial machinery on the California plan , and eschew all " notions , " will make one or two mines successful , and save us from much disaster . In this view I rejoice to know that a New-York Company ( the Adelberg Gold . Company ) is erecting near Acworth a fine stamp-mill , with copper plates and blankets , tailrace , sluices , and what not , Complete . I have been on the ground and inspected the machinery , as well as the " rich panninge " of the ore , It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Company , is superintending the work in person , The Company evidently knows what it is about , which is a matter of importance and infrequency in gold mining . But I will not weary you , as I have no claim upon your column ' , except that of an old and long forgotten contributor . You will have noticed that I speak as though I were from the North , in one part of this letter , and as from the South in another . Well , so I am . In days before the war , when there was some fun as well as risk in being an Abolitionist , I was quorum vars , ? " one of ' em ; " and now I count my . self , in the new , turn of affairs , a student of things , with now and then an itching to get in my shillelagh ,
