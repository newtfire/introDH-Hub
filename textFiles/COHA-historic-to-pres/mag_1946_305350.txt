To the religious groups with which the Russian Government is playing footie-Arabs , Orthodox , Jews , assorted small groups from Moscow to Khabarovsk-Joseph Stalin added another : the Baptists , U.S.A. <P> The Rev. Louie De Votie Newton , 54 , president of the Southern Baptist Convention , a native , resident and leader in the South , might be expected to be somewhat anti-Soviet . But last week when he came home to Atlanta from a whirlwind trip through the U.S.S.R. he was brimming with enthusiasm for what he had seen and been told . In 25 short days , the Russians had made Dr. Louie Newton a booster . <P> He went to Russia at Government invitation to investigate the status of its 2,000,000 Baptists . For the visit the Russians rolled out the Red carpet . The visitor had two nice visits with onetime seminarian Joseph Stalin , to whom he gave a leather-bound copy of the New Testament and two pipes . He also got permission to preach hellfire- &-damnation; sermons in churches in nine cities , from Moscow to Stalingrad . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol-hating Baptist to try a sip of vodka .

Their biggest boost came during the revolution , when the Reds used them to undermine Orthodoxy . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there are many Russian young people to whom " the Baptist sense of freedom appeals . " Already , he says , their churches are open seven days a week , carrying on highly active programs of religious instruction , culture and recreation . <P> Field for Freedom . They also cooperate with the Government in social services , such as caring for war orphans and promoting health . Rationalized Newton : " The Baptists stand for the same thing as the Russian Government-renouncement of , and resistance to , coercion in matters of belief . " <P> Newton 's overall conclusion will surprise most churchmen . Said he : the future of religion is as bright in Russia as anywhere in the world . " Religiously , we should regard Russia as our great ally . It is a virgin field for freedom . . . because Russia never knew freedom of religion until the present regime . When the U.S.S.R. was first formed , religion was contraband , but now the Government has discovered that religion can not be destroyed , so it has invited the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
