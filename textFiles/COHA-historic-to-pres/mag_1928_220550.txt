Authorities at the American Museum of Natural History , last week , candidly stated that in one particular they had been wrong , and the late William Jennings Bryan and his Fundamentalist disciples right . The particular was an old tooth , found five years ago by Paleontologist Harold Cook , in an ancient Nebraska river bed . <P> President Henry Fairfield Osborn and other specialists at the museum examined the tooth with naked eye , microscope and x-rays . It belonged , they decided , to a manlike beast and seemed the first indication that such animals had once existed in what is now the U. S. They called the specimen Hesperopithecus ( " evening ape " ) haroldcookii . Fundamentalists scoffed at this as at all other evolutionary data . <P> Recent diggings in Nebraska revealed a few similar and more perfect teeth . These the museum staff had studied and were delighted to learn that they had erred in their first deduction . The teeth , they announced last week , had served no anthropoidal beast , but an ancient , bristly , snub-nosed pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
