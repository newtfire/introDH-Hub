Any criticism of Russian bolshevism , any assertion of discreditable facts , from any source that can be labeled " capitalist , " is scorned by the adherents of communism . The observations of Mr. Bertrand Russell following a live weeks ' trip to Russia hardly can be disposed of ao lightly . Mr Russell , It is true , fa a gentleman , a man of edv cation and intellectual occupation . He could not be classed as a proletaire , a manual worker , but neither could Lenin nor Trotzky nor a considerable proportion of the admirers of Lenin 's enterprise in this country . Mr. Russell is , however , a phllo ? sop/deal radical of known sincerity and courage , and his attitude toward the communist experiment was friendly and optirMistic . That his conclusions are emphatically adverse ought to carry weight . Mr. Russell 's testimony begins with an assertion which has significant bearing on what we said the other day in regard to the Asiatic aspect of the bolshevik menace and the Russian problem . " Much , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not distinguish them from their compatriots of other parties . It is difficult to exaggerate the difference between a Russian and an Englishman . I am convinced there is more resemblance between Mr. Smillie and Mr. Winston Churchill than between the former and Lenin or the latter and Holchak . " Mr. Russell does not specify and our Red advocates may use his remark to load the excesses of bolshevism on this Russian factor while asserting that communism in western Europe would be guiltless of Inhumanities . Their reasoning would not carry them very far , Inasmuch as violence is preached as an essential of the bolshevik method . What the rest of us have to Consider is that the influence represented by communism has its source now In Russia and is deeply stamped by the Asiatic morale and has turned openly to Asia for aid and alliance . - But what does Mr. Russell find as the actual results of communist rule where it has had full sway for three years ? American Reds are making their chief attack upon our system on the grounds of liberty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finds " a. profound difference between the theories of actual bolsheviki and the version of those theories current among vanced Socialists in this country ( England ) . Friends of Russia here think of the dictatorship of the proletariat as merely a new form of representative government in which only working men and women have votes and the constituencies are Partly occupational , not geographical . They think that ' proletariat ' means ' proletariat , ' but ' dictatorship ' does not quite mean ' dictatorship . ' This Is it 'll opposite of the truth . When a Russian communist speaks of dictatorship he means the word literally , but when lie speaks of the proletariat he uses the word In a Pickwickian sense . " If a " capitalist " critic said that , would n't our parlor radicals hiss ! But Mr. Russell specifies . He says the Russian cOmmunist means by prole . Lariat " the Class conscious " part of the proletariat , i. e. , the Communist party . He ineludes people by no means proletarian ( such as Lenin and Chl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes such wage earners ds have not the right opinions , whom he.classifles as lackeys of the bourgeoisie . Opposition is crushed without mercy and.without shrinking from the methods of the Czarist police , many of whom are still employed at their old work . Thus power , ruthlessly used , is in the hands of representatives of one party , which claims a membership of 600,000 in a total population of 120,000 , . 100 . Virtually all opposition is disfranchised , yet the very men in America who are demanding political and social equality for the Negro and crying out against capitalist tyranny , demanding the right of unrestricted speech and assemblage , are the warmest admirers of bolshevism and want to plant it in America in place of our democracy . Space is not available to give Mr. Russell 's details as we should like . The article , studiously moderate In tone , should be widely read . As a picture of the bolshevik system , with its remorseless dill-regard for private freedom , its centralized ' tyranny is the more ' Impressive for the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's philosophic survey omits.
