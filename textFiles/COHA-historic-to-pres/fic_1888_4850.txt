AMELIE RIVES . CONTENTS . PAGE A BROTHER TO DRAGONS 1 THE FARRIER LASS O ' PIPING PEBWORTH 82 NURSE CRUMPET TELLS THE STORY 168 A BROTHER TO DRAGONS . I. IN the year of grace , 1586 , on the last day of the month of May , to all who may chance to read this narrative , these : I will first be at the pains of stating that had it not been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true or false . Secondly , that the facts herein set down be true facts ; none the less true that they are strange . I will furthermore explain that Marian is the Christian name of my lawful wife , and that our surname is Butter . My wife had nursed the Lady Margaret from the moment of her birth ; and here I must make another digression . The Lady Margaret was the twin sister of the then Lord of Amhurste , Lord Robert , and my lady and his lordship had quarrelled  --  Marian saith , with a great cause , but I can not herein forbear also expressing my opinion , which is to the effect that for that quarrel there was neither cause , justice , nor reason . Therefore , before those who may chance to read these words , I will lay bare the facts pertaining to the said quarrel . It concerned the family ghost , which ghost was said to haunt a certain blue chamber in the east wing of the castle . Now I myself had never gainsaid these reports ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain respect for them , as they have never offered me any affront , either by appearing to me or otherwise maltreating me . But Marian , who like many of her sex seemed to consort naturally with banshees , bogies , apparitions , and the like , declared to me that at several different and equally inconvenient times this ghost had presented itself to her , startling her on two occasions to such an extent that she once let fall the contents of the broth-bowl on Herne the blood-hound , thereby causing that beast to maliciously devour two breadths of her new black taffeta Sunday gown ; again , a hot iron wherewith she was pressing out the seams of Lady Margaret 's night-gown . On the second occasion , she fled along the kitchen hall , shrieking piteously , and preceded by Doll , the kitchen wench , the latter having in her seeming a certain ghostly appearance , as she was clad only in her shift , which the draughts in the hall inflated to a great size . The poor maid fled affrighted into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did essay to assuage the terror of Mistress Butter , identifying Doll and the blue-room ghost as one and the same , she thanked me not , but belabored me in her frenzy with the yet warm iron , which she had instinctively snatched up in her flight ; demanding of me at the same time if I had ever seen Doll 's nose spout fire , and her eyes spit in her head like hot coals . I being of a necessity compelled to reply " No , " Marian further told me that it was thus that the ghost had comported itself ; that , moreover , it was clad all in a livid blue flame from top to toe , and that it had a banner o ' red sarcenet that streamed out behind like forked lightning . She then said that this malevolent spirit had struck her with its blazing hand , and that , did I not believe her , I could see the burn on her wrist . Upon my suggesting that this wound might have been inflicted by the iron in its fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I sought my bed in much wrath and vexation of spirit . Nay , I do fear me that I cursed the day I was wed , the day on which my wife was born , wishing all women to the d  --  l ; and that , moreover , out loud , which put me to much shame afterwards for some days ; although , be it said to my still greater shame , it was full a fortnight e'er I confessed my repentance unto the wife whom I had so abused . But meseems I have in this digression transgressed in the matter o ' length ; therefore , to return to the bare facts . It was on the subject of this ghost that my lord and the Lady Margaret had disagreed . My lord , being a flighty lad , although a marvellous fine scholar and well-disposed , did agree with my wife in the matter of the ghost ; while my lady was of a like mind with myself . It doth seem but yesterday that she came to me as I was training the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put her white hand on my shoulder . ( My lady was never one for wearing gloves , yet the sun seemed no more to think o ' scorching her fair hands than the leaves of a day-lily . ) She comes to me and lays her hand on my shoulder , and her long eyes they laugh at me out of the shadow of her hat ; but her mouth is grave as though I were a corse . Quoth she : " Butter , dost thou believe in this ghost ? " " Nay , my lady , " answered I , hoping to shift her to better soil ; " I ne'er meddle with ghosts or goblins . Why , an there be such things , should they wish me harm ? O ' my word , my brain is no more troubled with ghosts , black or white , than our gracious Queen 's "  --  here I doffed my cap  --  " is with snails and slugs ; " and here I plucked a slug from a vine-leaf and set my heel o n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-shutting of her white eyelids so tight that all the long black hairs on them stood straight out , like the fringe on Marian 's Sunday mantle in a high wind . " Butter ! thou nasty man ! " " Why  --  for how dost thou mean , my lady ? " quoth I. " Why , for mashing that poor beast to a pap . " And then a-holding of her hand level below her eyes , so that she might not discern the ground , " Is he dead ? " quoth she . " Dead ? " asked I , for I was somewhat puzzled in my mind . " Ay , the slug ; is he dead ? " " That he is , verily , " said I ; for in truth he was naught but a jelly , and therewith I drew a pebble over him with my foot , that the sight o ' his misfortune should not disturb her tender heart . " How if I were to crush you ' neath my heel , Master Butter ? " quoth she at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , not seeing it , returning to her discourse . " How wouldst thou like that , excellent Master Butter ? " But somehow , as I looked at her foot , my mouth , for all I could do , went into a smile . For though she was as fine a maiden as any in all Warwickshire , her foot , methinks , was of so dainty a make ' t would scarce have dealt death to a rose . " But truly , my lady , " continued I , seeing that she was making up a face at me , " thou knowest I 've naught in common with ghosts . " " Ay , " quoth she . " And thou knowest the like of me . But "  --  and here stops she , with the slyest tip of her frowzed curls towards the house  --  " thou knowest also this , Butter , that his lordship , my brother , thinks as doth Marian , thy wife , and that therein we four can not agree . " So I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is known to me . " " Well , now , Butter , " she goes on , " thou most wise , most excellent , most cunning , most delectable of Butters , I have concocted a plan . I ' fecks , Butter " ( for my lady , like her Majesty the Queen , was somewhat given to swearing , though more modest oaths , as should become a subject )  --  " I ' fecks , Butter , " saith she , " ' t is a most lustick plot . But I would not thy mome heard us ; " and with that she makes me send away Joe , the under-gardener . He being gone , she whispers in my ear how she hath plotted to fright his lordship and Marian into very convulsions of further conviction , by appearing to them at the door o ' the blue room in her night-gown , with a taper in her hand and her face chalked . What she desired o ' me was , that I should come to the blue room with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy on my lord and Marian . To be truthful in these my last days o ' earth , I liked not my proffered office o'er-well . Howbeit , that night did I do the bidding o ' my young mistress , and  --  loath am I to speak of it , even at this late day  --  ' t was the cause of my young master 's leaving his home and going to bide in foreign countries . Ah , bitter tears did his sister weep , and with mine own eyes I saw her , on the day he set forth , cling to his neck , and when he shook her thence , hang about his loins , and when at last he pushed her to the ground , she laid her hands about his feet and wept ; and between every sob it was , " Go not , brother , for my fault ! Go not , brother , for my fault ! " or else , " Robin , Robin , dost not love me enough to forgive me so little ? " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thou couldst forgive me much . " But he stepped free of her hands and went his ways , and my lady lay with her head where his feet had been , and was still . Then Marian , who was very wroth with me for my part in the matter , did up with her nursling in her own proper strong arms ( for she was aye a strong lass , that being one o ' the chief reasons for which I had sought her in marriage  --  having had , as should all men , an eye to my posterity . It was a great cross to me , as may be thought , to find that all my forethought had been in vain , and that while Turnip , the farrier , had eight as fine lads as one would care to father , of a puny wench that my Marian could have slipped in her pocket , Mistress Butter presented me with no children , weakly or healthy ) . But , as I have said , Marian , in her own arms , did carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day-bed . And by-and-by she opes her eyes ( for Marian agreed that I sate on the threshold ) , and says she , putting out her hand half-fearful-like , " Is't thou , brother ? " " Nay , honey , " saith Marian ; " it is I , thy Marian , thy nurse . " Then said my lady , " Ay , nurse ; but my brother , he is below  --  is't not so ? " But when Marian shook her head , my lady sate up on the day-bed and caught hold of her short curls , and cried out , " I have banished him ! I have made him an outlaw ! I have banished him ! " And for days she lay like one whose soul was sped . Well , the young lord came not back , nor would he write ; so we knew not whether he were alive or dead . Yet were Marian and myself not unhopeful , for full oft did the heady boy find some such cause of disagreement with his sister to abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth he came not back , and that week sped after week , and month did follow month , and still no tidings , we had perforce to acknowledge that the young lord was indeed gone to return no more . The Lady Margaret , in her loneliness , grew into many strange ways . She did outride any man in the county , and she had a blue-roan by the name of Robin Hood ; which same , methinks , no man in or out o ' th ' county would ' a ' cared to bestride . She would walk over to Pebworth ( ' piping Pebworth , ' as Master Shakespeare hath dubbed it ) and back again , a distance o ' some six miles ; and afterwards set forth for a gallop on Robin Hood , and be no more a-weary , come eventide , than myself from a trip ' round the gardens . She swam like a sea-maid , she had fenced even better than her brother , and methinks she was the bonniest shot with a long-bow of any woman in all England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aye , and in the years since she had grown mightily , and was waxed as strong as Marian , and full a head taller . But she had long , curved flanks that saved her from buxomness ; and her head was set high and light on her shoulders , like a bird that floats on a wave , and o'er it ran her bright curls , the one o'er the other , like little wavelets . Her eyes were as gray as a sword , and as keen , and she had broad lids as white as satin-flowers , and there was a fine black ring around them , made by her long lashes . My lady was courted by many a fine lord , and more than three youngsters have I seen weep because of her coldness towards them ; speeding them away out o ' the sight o ' mankind ( as they thought ) , and casting themselves along the lush grass in my lady 's garden , there to bleat and bleat , like moon-calves for the moon . For one lad did my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Lord of Mallow  --  but a lad with buttercup curls and speedwell eyes , and a smile to win the love o ' any maid in her reason ( though , to be sure , my lady was in her reason ) . He comes to me and gets between my knees , like any little eanling that might ' a ' been mine own , and quoth he : " Butter , Butter , she loves thee ! Wilt thou not speak to her , and tell her that she shall be the richest lady in all England , and maid of honor to the Queen , and have more jewels than the Queen herself ? Oh , Butter ! " cried he . Then said I , a-stroking of the yellow gossamer that bestrewed his shoulders , as he knelt , head bowed , between my knees , " Nay , my lord , ' t is not so that thou shalt win the Lady Margaret . She careth no more for jewels than she doth for the beads in a rainbow ; nor doth she care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be maid of honor to a queen would not be an honorable maid either to herself or to her sovereign ; " for so indeed I thought . Then saith he , " Butter , dost thou believe in love-philters ? " And I asked his meaning , for verily I was ignorant of ' t , albeit I was not ignorant in all matters . And he explained to me that it was a drink or potion to cause love . Then I answered , and said , " Calamint doth make a good brew , likewise sage , and some flax is soothing , but methinks none o ' these would cause love . " On this he wept again , but said that I was a good old man , and that on his return to Mallow he would send me a gift ; and so he did  --  a pair o ' silk hose , such as my lady and the Queen do wear ; but being mindful of my station , I laid them aside for the sake o ' th ' poor lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ten fingers through as many moth-holes . Whereupon I was minded o ' th ' text concerning that we lay not up treasures where moth and rust do corrupt , and at my behest Marian read me the whole of that chapter . But to return to bare facts . It was on a certain night in March that there occurred the conversation which was the cause of this narrative . There had been news of the return of one Lord Denbeigh to Warwickshire  --  by report as wild a cavalier as ever fought , and a godless body to boot . Marian , who , as I have said , had always a certain knack for ghost stories and the like , froze me with her accounts o ' this wild lord 's doings . Quoth she : " Fire-brace is a suiting name for him , inasmuch as ' t is a family name , and he a fire-brand to peace wheresome'er he shall go . " " Peace  --  peace thyself ! " quoth I , hearing my lady 's foot along the hall . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given her attention to the fire , when in clatters my lady , with her riding-whip stuck in her glove , and her blood-hound Hearn in a leash . She was much wrought , either with riding or rage , for there was a quick red in her cheek , and she had set her red lips until they were white . Then took she the hound between her knees , and plucked off her gloves . Here I did find it my duty to speak . " My lady , " cried I , " ' t is not in your mind to baste the dog ? " " Ay , that it is , " quoth she , and her lips went tighter , and she jerked at her glove . Then said I , " How if he leap at thy throat ? " And she answered , " Nay , he knows better ; " and with that she gripped his collar , and let swing her whip . Then did I bid Marian that she leave the room . As for me , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given an oath to tell but the truth in this narrative , I must confess that I was in a sweat from head to foot with fear . But the great hound crouched as though he knew he got but what he deserved , and when my lady had given him ten or twenty lashes she flung wide the door , and said she , " Get thee gone , coward ! Go fare as fares the poor beggar thou sought'st to bite ! " and the hound slunk out . Then turned my mistress to me , and  --  " Butter , " saith she , " yon beast sought to bite an old beggar as we came through the park , so I whipped him . But for naught save cruelty or disobedience will I ever whip a dog ; so , Butter , the next time that thou seest me about to lash one , keep thy counsel . " ( This was the harshest that my lady e'er spoke , either to me or to Marian . ) Then went she to the door and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am a-weary . Fling me some skins on the settle , and I will lie down , and thou shalt card out my locks with thy fingers . " So we heaped the settle with the skins o ' white bears , and thereon my lady cast herself , like a flower blown down upon a snow-bank ; and by-and-by , what with the warmth and Marian 's strokings , she fell into a deep sleep . But we two sate and gazed on her . She was all clad in a tight riding-dress of green velour cloth , and her white face seemed to come from the close collar like a white lily from its sheath . She was e'er flower-like , asleep or waking , as I have said , and her pretty head was sleek and yellow , like a butterfly 's wing . She was so sound that it appeared to me and Marian as though one longer breath might transform the mimicry into the actual thing  --  death . But by-and-by awe fell from us , as it doth ever fall , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my wife and I did return to our discourse concerning my Lord Denbeigh . Quoth I to Marian , " But , wife , may not malice invent these tales ? " " Nay , nay , " said she , shaking her head ; " as bloody a rogue as ever lived  --  as bloody a rogue as ever lived . They do say as how he 'll set a whole tavern in a broil ere he be entered in for three minutes . " " But , " quoth I , " may he not be provoked ? " " Nay , I tell thee , " said she ; " but he 'll jump at a body 's head , and cleave ' t open ere a body can say ' Jesus . ' " At this I said , firmly , " I doubt not but what the poor man is most surely maligned . " Whereupon Mistress Butter did wax exceeding wroth . " Why wilt thou e'er be seeking to plead the cause o ' villains ? " cried she . " First that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody villain o ' th ' devil 's . I do wonder at thee , Anthony Butter . " Whereat I did put in that I sometimes wondered at myself . " For why ? " quoth she . " Why , that I ever married to be worded by a wench , " said I. And at this I am most entirely sure that she would have cast her joint-stool at me , had she not been sitting on ' t , and my lady 's head against her knee . So she called me a " zany , " and then after a little a " toad , " but went on stroking my lady 's hair . And , by-and-by , back we come to his lordship . " ' T is not alone his bloody tricks and murderous ways , " quoth my wife , " that causes all Christian folk to abhor him , but he consorts with no other women than drabs and callets . Dost excuse that ? " " Nay , " said I , with sufficient gravity , " then is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not fit for men 's discussion , much less that of women . " At this reproof I saw anger again in her eye , but she was so pleased withal at having got me to call Lord Denbeigh a swine that she forebore any further personal affront . " And yet , " she went on , " they do say he be as fine a man as a wench will walk through the rain to glimpse at , and a brave and a learned ; but that he wed a Spanish maid , and she betrayed him , and so he hath vowed to hate women , one and all . " " Hast thou seen him ? " " Nay , but I 've had him itemized to me by the wife o ' Humfrey Lemon . A blue eye , a hooked nose , a  --  " " Well , well , wife , " quoth I , " if a blue eye and a hooked nose be as bad signs in a man as they be in a horse , methinks this thy villain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " affirmed she . " Yet , " said I , " there is somewhere in me a something that doth pity him . " " By my troth ! " cried my wife . " I do believe , Master Butter , that thou'dst pity the Devil 's wife in childbirth . " " Ay , that I would ! " I made answer , with a great calmness , for I saw that she sought to rouse my spleen . " Well , do not bellow , " blurted she , " for my mistress is as sound as a gold-piece . " Then quoth my lady , a-rising up on her elbow , " Nay , that she is not . And , moreover , she would hear all the stories concerning this bad and bloody Lord of Denbeigh ! " II . When Marian heard my lady so speak , methought she would have swooned in verity ; for she knew my lady 's contempt for gossip . E'en for the first time in all her life , Marian could not find a word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she , and then stopped and was silent . My lady laughed at her , with her deep eyes ; but as was her wont , her mouth was wondrous solemn . " Ay , nurse , " quoth she , " thou thought'st me safe i ' th ' Land o ' Nod , but one hath ears to hear there as elsewhere . " Then she reaches out one hand and plays with Marian 's ruff . " Go to , nurse , " says she . " Dost thou not see I am even i ' th ' same case with thyself ? I too would gossip a little . Come , word it  --  word it ! " So Marian told her all that she had heard , together with a little prophesying here and there , which boded no good to my Lord Denbeigh . She told how he had e'en been a brave lad , but how in Spain he had wed with a wife who played him false ; how then he had vowed vengeance on all womankind , becoming a brawler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword and lightnings in his eye . My lady listened , and now and again she would pinch her eyelids softly with her thumb and ring-finger , as one who is deep in thought . But when Marian paused for breath , she turned to her , and quoth she , " Nurse , thou hast often preached unto me ; listen now to my preachings . Thou shalt often hear a man abused , nurse , but chiefly for that which he hath never done . This wild lord , I doubt not , hath been guilty of sorry deeds . What man hath not ? But the half that thou hast told me is not to be believed . " Then went she to her room , taking Marian with her , but I saw that she was moved . It was but the next day that my lady 's uncle , Sir John Trenyon , came riding into the court . He often came in such wise , to bide for a day or two with his niece . A most courteous gentleman ; red of face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a jest for each tick o ' th ' clock , and a kind word for all . " Ah , Butter , " saith he , " and where is thy mistress ? And thy wife , the good Dame Marian  --  where is she ? And how about thy family ? Hast thou no better prospects than of yore ? " Whereat I looked sorrowful enough , I doubt not , for he did bid me take heart , as my first-born might have had a hare-lip or a crook-back . Then did he toss me his bridle-reins , and my lady , having heard his voice , came forth to meet him . " So , lady-bird ! " quoth he , clasping her . " I am come for no less than three reasons this time . First , to see thy bonny face . Second , to ride thy bonny Robin . Third , to inquire and seek out a certain villain of mine acquaintance , of whom you have doubtless heard ; " and forthwith did he say to her of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrade , and of how he had known him when a lad , together with much more , at which my lady pricked up her ears , as ' t were , having all a lady 's love for stories of wicked men who are not yet either old or ill-favored . " By my troth , " declared the old knight in ending , " I will take but a mouthful to stay me , and then set forth straightway in quest o ' th ' rascal . " So having dined right heartily , he rode forth again . Now , having related this hap to Marian , she was devoured of so great a curiosity that , as I am an honest man , I looked to see her consumed even unto her bones , as some men who burn of drink . She would have it that I must hazard a guess on the shape of Lord Denbeigh 's nose , the color of his hair , and the height of his body . She forced me to wonder whether he were civil or rude of tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aye a chance of his returning with Sir John . She questioned me , in a word , until , having no answers , I was like to lose my wits , or my temper , or both together . At last comes she and sits on my knee , and tickles the back of my neck right playfully , as in the days of our wooing . " As I live , Tony , " quoth she , " we are like to have a strange story under our very noses . What if "  --  and here she takes my face in her two hands , and sets her chin against mine , so that I see four round blue eyes against her white brow , and am like to go blind with her thoughtlessness  --  " what if it turns out that the Lord hath set upon our lady to be the saviour of this wicked earl ? " " Ay , " cried I. " And what if the Lord hath set upon me to be the founder of a nation , like Abraham ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundly . But I could not blame her , for in the wrong I was , without doubt , although verily she had plagued me into it . So I sued for pardon , and got it , and a kiss into the bargain . But she would not leave me in peace concerning Lord Denbeigh . When that same afternoon there comes Sir John a-riding past , and the bad earl at his side , " What dost thou say now ? " quoth Marian , a-plucking me in a way that did not serve to increase good feeling betwixt us . " Ah ha ! Are not women prophetesses by nature ? " " Ay , by ill-nature , " answered I ; and for this quip I was not forgiven for two days . It was towards the setting of the sun when Sir John and Lord Denbeigh rode up to the door of Amhurste , and my lady , knowing naught , came out at the sound of the horses ' feet , thinking only to greet her uncle . The red light from the west shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , and her face was like one of the red roses in her garden . So she put up her hand to shield it , and saw the stranger standing at her feet . There was ne'er a nobler-looking man , for all he might outblack Satan in his soul : straight of body , and strong of limb , and lofty of head . His hair was the color of my lady 's , and there seemed to be ever some sunshine in it , as he moved his head . Methought his face was fair and goodly to look upon , albeit his lips went downward at the corners , and there was a droop in his broad lids . He was clad all in a close suit of dark velvet , and in his hand he held a black hat with a knot of heron-plumes . My lady stood and looked down at him from under her long , white hand , and he stood and looked up at my lady , as one looks upward at a fair picture . And the evening light crept between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I did catch myself remembering Marian 's silly sayings ; but for all that , they did come back to me , as the words of a foolish woman will return to the wisest of men . And in truth he did gaze up at her , as though she were more holy than the heavens above her . And for all her hand , the sunset found its way unto her cheek . What I now relate was told me by Marian some three days after . ' T was on the night of the day on which Sir John had brought the stranger to Amhurste , and Marian was carding out my lady 's tresses before her bedroom fire . Quoth my lady , suddenly , " Nurse , didst thou see Lord Denbeigh ere he went ? " And Marian said that she had seen him . " He hath a strange face , nurse . " " How ' strange , ' my lady ? " " Why , it seems to me that each feature in it doth contradict the other . His brow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be gentle . ' His eyes say to his nose , ' Spread not thy nostrils so proudly . ' His nose commands his lips that they smile not ; but , nurse , there was ne'er a sweeter smile on the lips o ' a saint ! " Marian fell a-thinking , and pulled my lady 's hair . My lady heeded it not , so Marian fell a-thinking yet more deeply . " It is not a face that tells of a bad heart , " continued my lady . " Rather it speaks of rebellion and misfortune . A sad story  --  a sad story . " " What is , my lady ? " asked Marian ; but my lady was far away , whither Marian could not follow . " Nurse , " she saith , presently , " that were a soul worth saving . " Then got she suddenly to her feet , and turned and took her nurse 's hands with hers . " It shall be saved , " she saith , " God helping . " And she kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marian did tell me how that no sleep visited her lady 's eyes that night . Through the darkness she could hear her turn , first on this side , then on that ; then sigh and move her pillow , and sigh again . Methought Marian would have split in sunder with importance , when Lord Denbeigh took to coming sometimes to Amhurste . ' T was never for even an hour that he stayed ; and ' t was always some question of business that brought him . But my lady and he touched hands full oft during a week , and always he would look at her with a different look from that which his eyes did wear at other times . And she spoke to him e'er courteously and kindly , even as though he had been a holy man and worthy of all reverence . One day it chanced that my lady rode the blue-roan out into the woods , towards the hut of old Joan Gobble , who was crippled by reason of age . My lady had me follow her on Dumble , th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some wine . I was taken up with pondering as to why my lady should go in person to Dame Gobble 's , seeing she might have sent me alone on Dumble as well . Be that as it may , as we rode along by a brook-side , under the thick leaves , whom should we come upon but my Lord Denbeigh . He was kneeling beside the water , and holding down his hand into the brook . As I looked I saw that his hand was befouled with gore , and that the brown stream did rush away ruddily from beneath his fingers . My lady did not wait for me to hold Robin Hood , but did swing herself from her saddle , and was beside the earl in a trice . He looked up , and seeing her , did start upon his feet . " Nay , " said she , putting out her hand , " but tell me if I can aid thee . " And he strove to hide his hand at his side , saying . " T is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water on the grass . " Think not to spare me the sight o ' blood , " said my lady , " for I am learned in bandaging wounds . " And certes she was , seeing that every soul at Amhurste did come to her for healing , let a cat but scratch them . And she took his hand between her two fair hands ( having drawn off her gloves ) , and saw that his wrist was deeply severed as with a knife . But she asked him no questions , telling him only to stoop while she cleansed his hand sufficiently to bind it . And as she laid it in the water , and pressed the lips of the wound together , he said unto her in a low tone , not meaning that I should hear him , " Would that thou couldst wash my soul as thou hast washed my hand ! " She looked straight into his eyes , with her own so clear and honest , like a dog 's ( meaning no disrespect to my lady , as God knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It were well worth the washing , my lord ; but an higher than I must cleanse it . " And he saith , " There is none higher . " At that my lady 's blood rose in her cheek , but she besought him that he would not speak to her in such wise . When she had made a compress of the napkins in the basket wherein I was carrying Dame Gobble 's butter , and had stanched the blood , she unwound the ribbon from her silver hunting-horn , and cast it about his neck for a rest to his wounded arm . Then he did bend down his head and kissed the ribbon , and my lady turned quickly , and got upon the roan , and rode away at so smart a pace that methinks Dame Gobble 's butter and wine did reach her in a closer conjunction than she could have found pleasant . When I told Marian of this encounter , merely by the way of a bit of gossip , she did smile in such a wise that I was minded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It was that same night that Marian did tell me how that she feared the earl was in danger of some sort , judging by certain words that my lady had let fall in her sleep . I noticed how that my lady seemed restless , and would start at the clap o ' a door , or when Herne did come suddenly upon her . And one day she leaned from a window , as I swept up the rose-leaves from the grass on the east terrace , and called to me to come thither . She was as white as her kirtle , and her gray eyes were dark like water before a storm . She did not look at me , but beyond into the air . So I waited , having plucked off my cap , and my lady stood looking , looking ; and after a while she saith , " Thou hast aye been a true and faithful servant unto me : therefore I am about to give unto thee a great charge . " And I said , " My lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth I could say no more , for my throat was stiff . And she continued and said , " Thou must be to-night at the Red Deer , and that by nine of the clock . One will be there in whom we have both deep interest . I can not tell thee more . Take thy sword with thee , but have no fear  --  thou wilt have no cause to use it . Yet , lest thou be fearful , take it with thee . " And she said , " Thou wilt remember ? " " My lady , when have I e'er forgotten word of thine ? " Whereat she did put out her fair hand to me , saying , " Never , " and there were tears in her eyes . So that night ( for the first time in many years ) did I find myself within the doors of the Red Deer . A cosey place it was , despite the wine-bibbers that did profane it ; and the inn-keeper 's wife , a most buxom , eye-pleasing wench , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked , some hard and sinful thoughts did visit my heart concerning the bounty that the Lord had lavished upon one who was a barterer of wine , when I , who had lived ever a temperate and ( in so far as was in my power ) a godly life , should remain childless . But I did conquer at last , bidding Satan get behind me , and was left in peace to toast my feet , and to ponder as to who it was that my lady had sent me thither to mark . Had I not loved my lady with all my heart , methinks I could not have stood the terms that were heaped upon me by the brawlers . I will not repeat the foul slanders ; suffice it to say , I sustained for one half hour what few men are called upon to endure throughout a lifetime . At last , the newness being gone , they left me in peace , and I , being settled safely in my corner , did set to work to watch the door . Who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wrapped in a long brown cloak , and wore a broad hat , unornamented by plume or buckle , pulled down over his eyes . He came and tossed himself into a chair near the fire , and sat there pondering upon the coals , with his legs out in front of him . Now , I have ever had a woman-weakness for a goodly leg in man , and the splendid limbs of Lord Denbeigh did witch me into a steadier gaze than that which civility doth permit . This by-and-by he did notice , and so spoke to me . " At what art thou staring , ancient ? " quoth he , not unkindly . So I told him , whereupon he laughed somewhat . " Methinks thou art but a doting body , " he said , " and yet is thy face familiar . What now ? Hast thou e'er met with me before ? " Then did I lie right roundly , being , to confess the truth , not a little afraid . " Out on thee , " saith his lordship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne'er forget a face ; how , then , shall I forget a face such as thine ? Certes I have seen thee before . Wilt thou colt me ? " And again lied I  --  blackly , most abominably . " As thou wilt , " quoth he ; " but thy face is known to me , for all that . " It was at this time that the door opened again , and there did enter a stripling , clad all in dark maroon velvet , wrapped also about with a long cloak , and having a velvet bonnet pulled down over his brows i ' th ' manner o ' Lord Denbeigh 's . One could see naught o ' his visage for the shadow from his head-gear . The revelers scarce noted his entrance , being far gone in drink , and some having departed , and others asleep . The lad came and stood near the fire , and I saw that he looked at Lord Denbeigh from under his drooping bonnet  --  the earl having withdrawn unto a table apart , with a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Even as I looked the boy turned , and went over , and leaned on the table to finger the heavy sword . My heart was afraid within me , for there was a dark light in the eyes that flashed up at the youth from under Lord Denbeigh 's stern brows . I was nigh unto them , being but a stride or two apart , and so marked all that passed between them . " By my troth , " quoth his lordship , " a valiant crack ! " " Meaning me ? " quoth the lad , smiling . " Ay , meaning thee , Sir Insolence . Dost thou know how to handle thine own sword , that thou handlest a stranger 's so freely ? " " Even so . But I meant not to vex thee . In truth , I am come to thee on an errand of life and death ; " and as he spoke , he did doff his bonnet and toss it upon the table , and the firelight and candlelight did leap upon his fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of my lady . The earl did start half-way to his feet , and his face was first like fire and then like snow . " Margaret ! " he saith , back of his teeth , as ' t were . And the lad smiled , leaning still upon the table . " Nay ; my sister is called so , " he said , " but my name is Robert , and I am the Lord of Amhurste and her brother . Haply she hath mentioned me unto your lordship . " The earl stared as one who sees a ghost ( though I believe not in them myself ) , and he saith , " Whence comest thou ? All think that thou art dead . " And the boy said , " Nay , but I would not that any besides thee knew of my whereabouts . As to thee , I know more concerning thee even than my sister , and it is for her sake that I come to thee to-night . " And my lord saith , " For her sake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee that thou wilt not go on the errand thou wottest of two nights hence . There are those who do mean thee death . It is certain that thy life is plotted against . Surely thou wilt be warned ? " And as I looked , the color left the lad 's face , and he grew white as any woman . Almost I could have sworn it was my lady 's face . Line for line , eyelash for eyelash , look for look . And methought no mother 's heart e'er yearned towards her new-born babe as yearned my heart towards the youth . It seemed as though I must cry out to him . To see him thus after five weary years ; to be so near him , and yet unable to touch even the latchet of his shoes , or to hear his voice calling my name . I trembled and was blind with longing . When at last I did look up , he said again , " Surely , thou wilt be advised ? " The earl leaned with his forehead set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible . Would that I could ! " And the lad said , " Nay , it is not impossible . Thou canst save thine own life with a word . " And Lord Denbeigh answered him : " My life is not worth even a word , " and he did not lift up his forehead from his hands . Then said my master , " Thy life may be worth less than naught to thee , but to others its price is above their own . " And again he was as pale as any girl . And he spoke again and said , " Thou wilt not go ? Thou wilt be warned ? " And again did the man answer , saying , " Impossible . " Then saith my master , " Lord Denbeigh , if thou goest to London on the morrow , I will follow thee there . Nay , thou canst not prevent me . And think you my sister 's heart will be warmer towards thee if her brother 's blood be spilled at thy behest ? " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said , " Thy blood will ne'er be spent at my behest . I do forbid thee to follow me . " And the lad said , " I am not to be forbidden . " So they stood and looked at one another . And all at once the boy put out his hand ( ' t was my lady 's very gesture ) and took the earl 's sleeve , and saith he in a gentle voice , " Thou wert a man after God 's own heart did not thou let Satan consort with thee . " Then turned Lord Denbeigh with a laugh that was not merry . And he saith , " As thou quotest Scripture to me , select thy texts with greater care . Even to my mind there doth come one more suiting ; for even as Job , ' I am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls . ' " Then saith the lad , still with his hand on the man 's arm , " Is it not the more to thy discredit that thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers of dragons ? Verily , my lord , I am bold through my sister , for methinks it is thus that she would have answered thee . " And the man turned away as though to hide his face . III . Lord Robert spoke with Lord Denbeigh at some length , but he was not to be turned from his purpose ( which , methought , must be a very strange and grewsome one , judging by their words ) . So finally they went out separately , and I got me back to Amhurste . The next morning I did relate to my lady all that had passed , but mentioning no names , as I saw that she wished it not . And when I was finished she bade me go straightway to London and find out the whereabouts of Lord Denbeigh . Moreover , she told me that she herself would be there shortly with Marian , and that they two would lodge at the house of Marian 's aunt , one Mistress Pepper , a linen-draper 's wife . At this I wondered greatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that she should follow him to London . And all that I could think was that Lord Robert was in some dire conspiracy , likewise the earl , and that she feared for the lives of one or both . So we all go to London , I earlier than my lady and Marian . For a day I lost sight of Lord Denbeigh ( whom I had followed closely all the way from Warwickshire ) , but the next afternoon I marked him as he passed along a by-way , and heard him speak with some one of his friends , naming a tavern where he would meet him at a certain hour that night . So first I found out where the tavern was , then straight to my lady and acquainted her with all that I had discovered . She said naught but to commend my diligence , and she went whiter than a just washed sheep at shearing-time . Quoth I to myself , " Butter , there is more here than thou wottest of ; " which was very true . That night , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the tavern , and lurked quietly in the shadows where none might observe ; and there , verily , was the earl and him with whom he had spoken in the afternoon . He had but said a word or so when Lord Robert entered , and went and stood at his elbow , but did not touch him or pluck at his cloak . Albeit , the earl seemed to feel his presence , for shortly he turned and saw the lad . " How ! " quoth he . " Thou here ? " And the boy said , " I told thee I would follow thee . " And Lord Denbeigh answered him , " Dost thou know of what thou speakest ? " And the lad said , " Verily I know , and thou mayest trust me ; " and with that he muttered two or three words under his breath , which , because of mine old ears , I could not catch . And the two men started and looked at one another . Then the earl did turn to his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad . So they three clasped hands . When that was done , Lord Denbeigh turns to my master , and saith he , " Hast thou thy dirk with thee ? " and the lad answered that he had both sword and dagger . " Not that there is any danger , " quoth the earl , " but that thou mayest feel easy . " But the lad said , " There is danger , as I have told thee ; and thou art putting thy life in jeopardy . " At this Lord Denbeigh only laughed ; but as they went out into the street I marked that he kept the lad close at his side , almost as a mother keeps a child . The night was still and cold , and the sky full of little white clouds that lapped the one over the other , like shells on a seashore . Now and again the moon would strike through , in a long , bright ray , that seemed like a keen blade or lance severing the misty air . The three went on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , for I knew not into what danger the lad might be hastening . All at once , in a dark turning , there came the clang of swords and a rushing and scuffling , but no cry of any kind ; and methought the silence was more hideous than sound . Stiff as were my old joints with disuse , I drew my sword and lay about me lustily , striving to get between the villains and my young master ( which is no credit to me , as I was so wrought with rage that I verily believe I would have no more felt the thrust of a rapier than Marian 's housewife the prick of a needle ) . But there was no method in aught , neither could anything be seen ; for the moon had withdrawn behind the clouds , and we seemed to be fighting underneath clear water , so pale and ghastly was the light shed about us from the pale clouds . And as I struck out with my sword I saw a fellow in a mask close with Lord Denbeigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascal pinned the earl 's hands to his sides . And even as I looked , the lad leaped between , and the thin knife went deep into his breast . At the same time there was a louder clash of swords , and a thudding of men 's bodies together , and the masked wretches turned about and did take to their heels with a good will . So I sheathed my sword and ran forward . Lord Denbeigh and his friend were bending over the lad , who lay out-stretched between them , with his white face turned up to the white sky , looking like the face of a dead man at the bottom of a clear pool . Then could I not withhold my grief , but cried aloud , " My master , my master ! " and tried to feel with my trembling old hands for the wound . Then said the earl , " Not here ! I will carry him to a place of safety . " And he lifted the boy in his arms , as though he had been a hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on Lord Denbeigh 's arm , saying , " What mean you ? are you distraught ? There is but scarce time by the clock . " And the earl said , " Go you on . I must take this boy where his wound can be bound . " " Nay , " said the man . " I tell you , you are mad ! " And Lord Denbeigh turned on him , and spoke in a harsh voice : " I have said I will not go . I have done with thee and thine . Go thy ways ere it be too late ; " and he passed on and left the man to swallow the moonshine with his great gaping mouth . And he saith unto me , " Follow closely . " So by-and-by we came to a great gray house , and Lord Denbeigh opened the door and bade me enter with him . We passed through a vast hall , and up a ponderous staircase , and into a room . A fire was burning on the hearth , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the bed 's foot . I guessed rightly that this was his lordship 's own apartment . He laid the lad on the bed , and fell to undoing his doublet of black velvet . I did see him set to shivering , as ' t were , when he noted the red stains on the shirt underneath , and my heart stood still within me . Then he opened the red linen , and did put in his hand gently to feel if the heart were yet beating ; but no sooner had he done this than he gave a strange cry , and drew out his hand dripping with blood , and stood staring and trembling . At the same moment the lad stirred , and opened his eyes , and began to clutch feebly at his doublet , drawing it together . I made naught of it until Lord Denbeigh did turn to me , with the face of a dead man , and quoth he , " Stay here while I fetch women , " and so rushed out like one in truth distraught . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the face upon which I looked was the face of my lady . Ere another second had passed I heard the earl 's voice without , and he spoke with a woman : " Do thou go instantly and clothe the lady within in some of thy garments ; and have care that thou say no word to any of what hath happened , else will it not be well for thee . " When I heard the tone in which he spoke , methought in truth it would not be well for her did she not heed his commands . Shortly there entered a woman most marvellous fair , with hair that seemed spun of black taffetas , and a skin like a white jasmine . When she saw the blood her lips whitened , and she did close them more closely , but no cry escaped her . Whereat I was much ashamed , remembering the hullabaloo that I had raised . I turned aside while she disrobed my lady and clothed her in clean linen , and drew down the sheets , placing her between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fair linen was soon crimson . And when all was prepared , the woman went to the door and said , " You can enter , " and the earl came into the chamber again . When , however , he did see my lady he cried out , " God in heaven ! she will bleed to death ! " and he called the woman , and showed her how to stanch the wound . Then , when the steps of the surgeon were heard in the hall without , he said unto her , " Remember . She is thy sister , and thieves have stabbed her for the jewels on her neck . " And she answered him , " I will remember . " And all this time methought I was in an evil dream , and that Marian , for some spite , would not awaken me . How it came about , to this day I recollect not , but ere two weeks had sped we were again at Amhurste , and my lady in her own bower , under Marian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lady ever since the fatal night whereon she was nigh done to death by that masked ruffian . The earl did go himself to fetch her from Mistress Pepper 's , and after that she came neither of us saw the sloe-eyed woman any more . None had known of my lady 's stay in town , saving my lady herself , Lord Denbeigh , the black-eyed woman ( who never uttered word more , good or bad , after that she had said , " I will remember " ) , Marian , and me . So besides us five no one was the wiser . It was towards the last of May that my lady did beg that we would lift her out to sit in a long-chair on the east terrace . The birds were at their morning gossiping in the shrubbery , and the air was most sweet with the breath of the white lilacs . My lady looked like a snow-wreath fallen suddenly among the greenery of spring , but her eyes did peep softly , like bluebells , from the snows of her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens above her , and her hair made sunshine over all . Herne , the blood-hound , lay at her feet , and would not be stirred , though for sport my lady had Marian to tempt him with some comfits . While we were all there , and my lady showing us how the light shined through her thin hands , and discoursing right merrily , there came a page and handed her a letter . Back fell she among her pillows , and her eyelids dropped over her eyes , like snow-flakes fallen on violets . Anon she opened the letter , and having read it , said unto Marian , " Nurse , go bid him hither . " So Marian beckoned me , and we left her . As we entered the house , who should pass us but my Lord of Denbeigh , and o ' my word he was whiter than my lady , if anything , and wrapped as usual in a long cloak . He seemed not to see us , and we went on in silence . Here transpires the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . I will out with it , however , and the Almighty knows that I have not done with repentance even yet . So be it . There was a window overhanging the terrace where my lady sat ( the window out of which she had leaned to speak to me about repairing to the Red Deer ) . But let me not defer longer . I , Anthony Butter , of respectable parents , and counted among my fellows and betters an honest man , did go to this window , and did most deliberately listen to the words that passed between my mistress and the Earl of Denbeigh . In fact ( for I have sworn to keep back no jot or tittle of the truth ) , I did speed me so fast that I was at the window ere his lordship reached my lady 's side . He came slowly , but his look went before him , and was fast upon my lady 's face ere he himself was within ten yards of her . When at last he was come to her side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered no word . And also my lady did look down , and there was a light like sunset on her cheek . Then suddenly did he drop upon his knees beside her , and bowed down his head upon her knee and was silent . Then my lady ( God forever keep her ! ) did turn her eyes quickly , and stole a look to see that no one was nigh ( God forgive my dastardly presence ! ) , and did reach out one pale hand , half fearfully as ' t were , and did let it rest upon the man 's bowed head , as a white rose-leaf falls and rests on the earth . And she said but two words , " My friend ; " yet methought all love was in them . Whereat he raised his head and looked at her , and it is so that men look upward when they pray . He took her hands with his and held them to his breast , and he saith , " Dear saint , if thou forgivest me , wilt thou but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him ; and he trembled , calling her by name ; and she asked him what he would with her . Then kneeling at her side , he spoke to her , and his words were as follows : " Thou hast heard of my life and of my misfortunes , but all hath not been told thee . Grant me but patience for a moment , that I myself may tell thee all . " And she saith unto him , " Say on . " So he spoke and said , " There is much that I may not tell thee , yet part I will tell thee , for that I must . Thou hast heard how that my wife  --  " But he could not continue , so dropped his face into my lady 's hands , and she waited for him , saying softly , " I will understand what thou dost not say . Be not troubled , but speak out thy soul to me ; " and presently he told her more . As I do live , never listened I to sadder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down like rain , and I was sore afraid that my sighing would discover my whereabouts . But the Almighty is merciful even to sinners , and I remained unnoted . ' T was the old tale of love and treachery ; a false wife and a friend who was a villain . The earl had killed the man ( but in fair encounter ) , and his wife he had brought back , never to be as husband to her more , but to preserve her from further sin . And I do maintain that ' t was a noble act , and I did quite forgive him the blood of his betrayer . Methought my lady did forgive him too , for she did but stroke his hair softly , saying ever and anon , " Poor soul ! " or " God help thee ! " And by-and-by he lifted his face , and saith , " But the worst is yet to tell thee . " And she said again , " Say on . " And he trembled again , but spoke out bravely : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy wounds . " Now at this I thought to see my lady swoon ; but she only smiled , though better had one seen her weep than smile in such wise . And she saith , " I have known that these many days ; " and she leaned towards him , and placed both hands upon his head , saying , " Weep not . I hold thee guiltless . Do not weep . " But he sobbed , clasping her knees , as one whose heart is broken , saying now and again below his breath , " O God ! O God ! " If there be this side the stars a more awful sight than the sight of a strong man in tears , God grant I may ne'er behold it , for surely I should die of pity . Doth it please God that I resemble Abraham in the matter of age , if in none other , ne'er will that scene fade from my memory  --  my lady , so wan and white and narrow , like a tall lily over which a rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , bowed as a little lad that saith his prayers , clasping her kirtle and her hands , as though one sinking in deep waters were to grasp at a floating stem of flowers for support . And after a while , when the violence of his grief was spent , he saith unto her , " I sail for Spain with Essex on the morrow , as thou knowest ; but it doth remain for me to tell thee why I go . It is for that I think the lad , thy brother , hath been a prisoner of war these many years , and I go to bring him to thee . " And she sat and looked at him as though her heart had leaped from her breast into his body ; but she spake no words save only , " God keep thee ; God go with thee . " And suddenly he saith unto her , as though the words would forth , " I loved thee from the moment that I saw thee . Let me but tell thee that . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " And he lifted his eyes and looked at her . Then fled I , as though I had drawn away the veil from the sanctuary , for I thought that God would surely smite me for having beheld that look . * * * * * So Lord Denbeigh sailed with the Earl of Essex for the war in Spain , and my lady 's soul left her body and went with him ; for surely ' t was but her body that remained at Amhurste . All day long would she sit silent , nor move , nor look , and her hands the one upon the other before her , as who should say , " I am done with all things , whether of work or of play . " So passed the months , and ever and anon some report would reach the village of the wild earl 's deeds in Spain , and of how he would fight ten men with one arm wounded and the blood in his eyes , and such like tales . But no word came direct , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was nigh to August , and the fighting was over for the time , when one day , with a clattering as of a horsed army , there comes dashing into the court two cavaliers on horseback , and one of them was my Lord of Denbeigh . Ere I could look at the other he had leaped to the ground , and had me about the neck a-kissing me as roundly as ever a wench in the market-place . And lo ! when I looked , it was Lord Robert in very truth . He was grown out of all knowledge , and as brown as a nut , but as big and as bonny a lad as ever clapped hand to sword . When I could turn my eyes from him upon the earl , I saw that he was waxed as pale as death , and wore his arm in a kerchief , and that there was a great red streak adown his temple , clean through his right eyebrow . And his splendid flanks and chest were hollow , like those of a good steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his horse 's neck and smiled at us , methought he was by far the goodliest man that ever I had looked upon . His teeth were as white as the foam on his horse 's bit , and there was a deep nick at the corner of his mouth , like that at the mouth of a girl . Then must I call Marian , and send her to break the news to my lady . So in a moment she comes rushing down along the stair-way , like a branch that is blown suddenly from the top o ' a tall tree , and so into Lord Robert 's arms ; and he catches her to his heart , and so stands holding her ; and they make no motion nor any sound whatever . Then turns the earl away , and leaves them together . But I marked that his eyes were brimming , and that there was a quiver in his lip . Ere night all is known to us : how Lord Robert had been a prisoner in Spain all these years , yet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wench . But he did not love her , God be praised ! And ' t is in my mind to this day how he might have wed her , and how the earl did relate to him his bitter experiences with a Spanish wife . Ay , that is my firm opinion . All this and more did we hear , laughing and weeping by turns . But it was not until Lord Robert saw my lady alone that she heard of how the earl had saved him at the risk of his own life , all but bearing him in his arms through the enemy , hewing his way right and left . And , moreover , Lord Robert did tell how that the blood from that cut on the earl 's temple did in truth run down into his eyes and blind him , but how that he dashed it back and slew the man who wounded him , and so they escaped . The next morning , as I did sally forth with my cross-bow to have a shot at a screech-owl which for some nights past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having disturbed mine , I did see Lord Denbeigh come out upon the terrace and throw himself down along the grass , beneath a tulip-tree , with a book . But he read not , lying very quiet , with his head raised up upon one hand and his elbow sunk in the soft turf . And as the sunlight struck through the leaves upon his glittering hair , and his face like marble , I could not but pause to gaze on him , so noble looked he . But his eyes were far away , and his thoughts with them . It was for this that he did not hear my lady coming until she stood beside him , and her white gown brushed his cheek . But seeing her , he leaped to his feet , and the blood ran along his face , and then seemed all to settle in the long wound , leaving him more pale than before . And she said to him , " Nay , do not rise , for thou art weak yet ; " but he would not be seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair morning light . And presently she puts out her hand ( no one ere reached out their hand as did my lady ) , and she just lays it on his sleeve , and saith she , " I am come to thank you  --  to thank you with all my heart and soul  --  " and there a sob chokes her , and she can say no more . Again the blood swept up across his brow ; and he said , " For God 's love , say no more . " But she answered , saying , " Nay , I have so much to say . " And she came nearer to him for a little space ; and her head drooped downward , like a flower full of rain . And she did knit and unknit her white fingers as they hung before her . And she saith , " There is no guerdon worthy such a knight , but if an thou  --  " Then all on a sudden did she reach out both arms towards him , and her fair hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow ; but she lifted her little head proudly , albeit her eyes were dropped downward , and she said unto him , " Take me , for I am thine . " And he trembled from head to foot , and parting his lips as though to speak , reached out his arms and clasped her . And when I realized what I had done , I did drop my cross-bow and took to my heels , like one followed by goblins . Now , even as I hope to be saved , I but just come to recognize that this was my second eavesdropping . So be it . I have vowed , and must keep my vow . It was all made clear to me that night , when Marian did relate to me how that the Spanish woman had slain herself by swallowing flame . At which ( though mightily pleased , God forgive me , on account of my lady and the earl ) I was more than ever thankful that Lord Robert had escaped alive and unwed out o ' th ' clutches o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I have not yet told that Marian did know from the first of my lady 's going up to town dressed as her brother . This I record more on account of its being a marvellous instance of a woman 's keeping her tongue than to shame Marian , who hath often read how that wives should submit themselves unto their husbands as unto the Lord . Howbeit , all ended so happily that I had not the heart to scold her . With the first frosts of October my lady and the earl were wed . Methought the queen herself could not have had a finer wedding , and certes no woman could have had a nobler spouse . He was yet pale from his wounds , but most soldierly of bearing and proud of carriage . He was clad all in white , like my lady . A more beauteous apparel I have never seen . His doublet was of cloth of silver , with a close jerkin of white satin embroidered in silver and little pearls . His girdle and the scabbard of his sword were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poniard and sword were hilted and mounted in gold , together with many blazing orders and richer devices that I know not how to enumerate . My lady 's gown was all of white satin , sewn down the front with little pearls , like those on my lord 's jerkin , and her ruff was of soft lace , not stiff , as was the fashion , but falling about her bosom most modestly and becomingly . Lord Robert , methinks , was eke as goodly , after his way , as either his sister or Lord Denbeigh , being close clad from head to foot in crimson sarcenet , slashed all with cloth of gold . My lady had given me some suiting clothes for the occasion ; and as for Marian , methought in her new gown of sea-green taffeta , with her new ruff and head-gear , that she looked as fair a matron as any mother of fine lads in all England . IV . Seven months they had been wed , and it was May again . Methought such love had never been on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And all , moreo'er , was so well with Lord Robert , who , folks did say , was in mighty great favor at court , and like to become a shining light in the land . ' T was on a May morning . The trees were a-lilt with birds , and the sound of waters set all the winds a-singing . All at once comes my lord , and sets his hand on my shoulder . Then know I that something dire hath happened . And he saith , " Friend , where is thy mistress ? " And I tell him that she is out among her roses . Then saith he all at once , " The Queen hath sent for me  --  I must to war . " And I could do naught but stare at him . And he said to me : " In an hour I must be gone . Say naught to thy mistress . I will go don a suiting dress , and do thou bring me my sword and give it into my hand . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . It was then that we heard the voice of my lady without , and she sang a song of the spring-tide . The words I have ne'er forgot , though I did but hear them once : " For O ! For O ! The cowslips blow , And the ground 's all gold below me ; The speedwell 's eye Peers up so bli ' I swear it seems to know me ! " The lady-smocks In silver frocks Do flout the sonsy clover ; The humble bee Consorts wi ' me And hails me for a rover . " Then trip , then trip , And if ye slip Your lad will lend a hand O ; The lass in green With black , black een , Is the fairest in the land O. " And as the earl listened methought he would have fallen , grasping my shoulder , old man as I was , and bending down his head upon it . And I did stay him with my arm , as though he had been my very son  --  for old age is father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her gold hair blowing , and her white kirtle full of red roses , and seeing her lord goes to meet him . But when she noted the soldierly fashioning of his dress , and the sword girt at his thigh , she opened her lips as though to cry out , but no sound escaped them . And her kirtle slipped from her hold , and the red roses lay between them like a pool of blood . Then she saith unto him , " Tell me . Quick , quick ! " And he lifts her to him , and saith , " Sweetheart , my Queen hath bidden me come fight for her and for my country . " And she saith naught , only clasps him . But by-and-by she cries out , saying , " Go not ! Go not ! Else wilt thou kill me . " And so speaking , falls like one dead at her lord 's feet . Then I , running like one distraught to fetch Marian , do tilt pell-mell into Lord Robert , who hath come down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heydey ! " quoth he . " What Jack-a-lent hath frighted thee ? " And I told him all . Never a word said he , but went straightway and got upon his horse , and clapped spurs to its sides , and so out of sight . And all that night my lady lay nigh to death , so that there was ne'er a thought in the breast of any for another soul . Therefore Lord Robert was not missed . Ere two days were past came a man with despatches , and we found out how that Lord Robert had substituted himself for the earl ( having acquainted the Queen with the circumstances  --  and he being , moreover , so great a favorite ) , and how the Queen had granted Lord Denbeigh leave to remain in England a while longer . And so his lordship was with his lady when their child was born , but Lord Robert was killed in the wars . They grieved sore for him , and for many weeks would not be comforted . And even it was said that the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court for the space of several days . But like as the stars do pale in the morning sky , so pales the orb of sorrow before the rays of the great sun , happiness . And though he was ne'er forgotten , and though the tears would spring to my lady 's eyes heard she but his name mentioned , yet she did smile again and was happy . It chanced but this morning that Marian and I , leaning from the window that overlooks the east terrace , did see a most winsome sight . ' T was a fair morning , and May again , and on such mornings as these my lady would go forth on the east terrace with the child . And there grow all such sweet flowers as my lady loves  --  the red mule-pinks , and dame's-violets , such as are sweet o ' evenings , but marvellous fair to look upon both by sunlight and moonlight . And the south wall was all thick with the yellow violets , so that my lady 's head looked like the head o ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady sit , on a quaintly wrought bench , with the little lord . And this morning , when she was seated , and the babe curled against her bosom , and Marian and myself thinking o ' the pictures o ' the Virgin Mary and the blessed Jesus ( saving that my lady 's kirtle was all of white and gold , like the lilies , knotted in her waistband ) , she looked up on a sudden , and lo ! there was the master coming along over the grass towards her . When he saw who it was that sat there , he doffed his plumed hat like as though it had been the Virgin Mary for very truth , and he paused a minute , but then came on . When my lady saw him who he was , there came a fair red o'er all the white o ' her throat and face ; ay , and withal over her very bosom . And she put up one white hand , with her wedding-ring o n't , and made as though she would shield the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord came slowly over the grass , as though the sweet sight did pleasure him both far and near . And when he was approached , he stood , still with his hat in his hand , and looked down at the babe and its mother , and was silent . Then the child , feeling mayhap that its father was near , twisted over towards him , reaching out its waxen arm , and smiled right knowingly ; whereat my lord did pluck the great plume out o ' his hat and lay it across my lady 's bosom ; moreover , he knelt and put an hand on the babe , but his arm he held about his wife . Then did she draw both my lord and the child to her , and pressed them against her , but her face she lifted Godwards . And something spoke within our hearts that we turned and left the window . THE FARRIER LASS O ' PIPING PEBWORTH . HUMFREY LEMON , meeting Bered Turnip , before the " Red Deer , " doth speak as follows : * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , by my troth ! ' t is none other than Bered Turnip , the farrier , as I do live ! Come for an alms-drink , comrade . Would I had as many gold-pieces as we have burnt alnights i ' this very tavern ! And is it thus we meet after all these years ? It doth seem but yesterday that we supped under this very roof as juvenals . Dost thou mind thee o ' the night that we gave old Gammer Lick-the-Dish a bath in his own sack , for that he served us in a foul jerkin ? By'r lay'kin , those were days ! Well , well , to meet thee thus ! Though , believe it or not , as thou wilt , I had such a pricking i ' my thumbs but an hour gone that I was of a mind to roar you like any babe with a pin in his swaddling-bands . Thou wast my beau-peer i ' those times ; and we are kin by profession , moreover . How be Mistress Turnip and thy eight lads ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  him who was gardener at Amhurste Castle , ye mind  --  dost thou remember in what spite he held thee because o ' those eight little salads o ' thine ? A always said a married with an eye to a 's posterity ; and o ' my word a 's been cockeyed e'er since , for 's posterity has e'er kept him on the lookout : never chick or child hath Mistress Butter given him . Quoth he to me one day , a-setting of ' s chin in ' s thumb and forefinger ( thou mind'st his solemn ways )  --  quoth he to me , " Lemon , " quoth he , " would I knew why the Lord doth seem to look with a more bounteous favor on such as are farriers , than on such as be followers of other trades ; for methinks , what with thee , and Turnip , and Job Long-pate , who bides in Dancing Marston , England will owe the chief o ' her future population to blacksmiths . " I quoth , to humor him , quoth I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Almighty hath gotten wisdom by experience , and doth purpose to put no further trust in gardeners . " Whereat he waxed so wrathful , that for the sake o ' my breeches I took to my heels . But , Lord ! it doth seem as though a had a spite against th ' very children o ' others . Thou mindest my Keren ? By'r lay'kin , ' twill not stick i ' my old pate how that thou hast not been in these parts since my Keren could ' a ' walked under a blackberry-bramble without so much as tousling her tresses . Well , a grew up a likely lass , I can tell thee ! Sure thou mindest why we  --  my wife and I  --  did come to call her Keren ? Go to ! Thou dost ! ' T is the jest o ' th ' place to this day . Well , then , if thou dost not , I 'll be at the pains o ' telling thee ; for methinks ' t was a wise thought . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , " when that we be pleased with her , we can call her Keren  --  which is as sweet-sounding a name as a maid can have ; and , on the other hand , when we be wroth with her , we can call her Happuch  --  which sure would be a rough name even for thy trotting mare Bellibone . " Ha ! ha ! And thereby , comrade , hangs another tale , as Master Shakespeare was wont to say . My wife , thou must know , hath e'er been a loyal admirer o ' our gracious Queen , and it comes to her ears one day as how her Majesty did ride a-horseback most excellent well . Naught would do but that I must let Mistress Lemon mount for a ride upon my gray mare Bellibone . Now Bellibone , though as willing a nag as ever ambled , did think far more o ' getting to her journey 's end than o ' the manner in which she did accomplish the journey ; and , I will say , a trotted as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's highway , instead o ' getting o'er ' em . Well , I did what I could to dissuade Mistress Lemon from her enterprise , but a was as firm as one o ' my surest driven nails in a new shoe . So a let her go . Couldst thou but ' a ' seen her when she was returned an hour after ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! a was for breaking my head with my own pincers . " Dost thou call that devil's-riding-horse ' Bellibone ? ' " quoth she , with what breath there was left to her . " By my troth , I think she hath not another bone in her whole body besides her backbone ! " But I spake o ' Keren . Thou knowest that even as a lass she had a sharp tongue o ' her own  --  as keen as a holly leaf , by my troth . So be it . ' T was one day nigh unto Martlemas that old Butter did undertake to chide her for conducting herself after the manner o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she to him , a-setting of her little black pate to one side , and of her little brown arms akimbo  --  quoth she , " Since the Lord hath not made me a lad , " quoth she , " I can not more than act like one ; and so I will do ! " Quoth he , " Thou hast a sour name , a bitter tongue , and a peppery temper , jade ; and the two last be not gifts o ' the Lord . " " And thou , " quoth she , " hast a mustard conceit , for right sure am I that ' t is big enough for a goose to roost in ! And whether th ' Lord hath given it to thee or not , I 'm glad I have ' t not , " quoth she ; for she had heard it read , in some meeting whither her mother would sometimes take her , of how the fowls o ' the air did lodge i ' th ' branches o ' the mustard-plant . Well , by'r lay'kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and that I 'll prove thee when we be through drinking ! What hath become o ' her ? Go to ! Sure thou knowest that ? Well , well ' t is a tale to make a play of . I 've often thought , had Master Shakespeare known of ' t , how he would ' a ' fashioned it into a jolly play . Tell thee of ' t ? What ! art in earnest ? By the mass , then , thou must drink again . Come , fill up , fill up . What there ! a cup o ' the amber drink for Master Turnip ! Let me see : how old was th ' lass when thou didst set forth on thy jauntings ? Some two years , methinks . And she was fourteen on the first day o ' March i ' that year wherein she did sauce old Butter with some o ' ' s own wit for gibing at her for a tomboy . O ' my word , man , th ' old fellow was not far i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' life did make an error i ' th ' distributing o ' souls , ' t was on the night Keren was brought into this world . And a say that with a cause , moreover ; for th ' same night , mark you , one Mistress Mouldy , over the way , was brought to bed o ' a man-child . That 's neither here nor there . Herein doth lie the singularity . That child did grow up to knit stockings i ' th ' door-way like any wench ; Peter Mouldy 's th ' name , and a plays a part i ' th ' story I 'm about to relate to thee . Ne'er in all thy travels hast thou e'er seen so crack-brain a wench as my Keren ! Lord ! it set thy head to swimming did she but enter a room . She had no more stability o ' motion than a merry-go-round ; and she was that brown , a bun looked pale i ' th ' comparison , when she did lift it to her mouth to eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' her age i ' th ' village . In her seeming she took neither after her mother nor after me , though she was a comely wench as wenches go  --  hair as black as a January night in stormy weather , and eyes as big and as bright and as yellow ( o ' my word )  --  as yellow as two crown pieces ! They looked out from under her thick eyebrows like sunlight peeping from a heavy cloud . And she was made like a lad for suppleness . Taller than her mother by head and shoulders , and within a full inch o ' my forelock . By'r lay'kin ! how she could sing too ! She would troll thee a ditty i ' th ' voice o ' a six-foot stripling , but for a ' that , as sweet as bells far away on a still noon in summer-tide . And she was always getting hold o ' saucy songs , and putting them to tunes o ' her own invention . A could ' a ' had aye the lads i ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , Lord ! a had one sweetheart one day , and another the next , till they were one and all for murdering or marrying her . But she would none o ' ' em . ' T was one summer 's day , her mother being gone to th ' village , that she did set about to brew some sack ; and as she did stand by the big pot while it cooled , to see that naught fell into ' t , up comes Master Peter Mouldy with his knitting , and grins at her across the caldron , after the fashion o ' a horse eating briers . She not noticing him , quoth he , " Good-morrow , sweet Mistress Lemon . " Saith she , not looking at him , " Thou liest . " " How , mistress ? " saith he , with his mouth as wide as a church door on a Sunday . " Why , for calling a lemon sweet , " saith she , " when all the world doth know that it is sour . " Thereat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress Keren , " quoth he , " ' t is thee I praise , and not thy name . And I will wager that thou art not sour , Mistress Keren . " " How wilt thou find out , either to lose or to win thy wager ? " quoth she . " Thus ! " quoth he . And , o ' my word , the homespun got his arms about her , knitting and all ( though I would ' a ' laid two cows and a lamb they could n't ' a ' reached about her pretty waist ) , and smacked her right heartily full on her red mouth . Well , comrade , that something would happen I knew full well ; but when she did up with him by the seat o ' his breeches and the collar o ' his jerkin , and did souse him head first into the pot o ' sack , methought I would ' a ' burst in sunder , like Judas Iscariot ( meaning no blasphemy ) . And when he was climbed out , spluttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat with his big knitting-needles , and did set it upon his head , and did thrust him outside , and did shut the door in ' s face . But never a word said she from first to last . Then methought in verity I would ' a ' split in twain from top to toe , like the veil o ' the temple ( meaning no blasphemy , as I will swear on th ' book ) . And when she caught sight o ' me she too fell a-laughing , and quoth she to me , " I have spoiled a good brew for thee , father , but ' t was worth the paying for . " And therewith she did out with the worth o ' the sack from her purse , which she always carried in her bosom , after a fashion inherited from her mother , and counted down the silver into my hand . I took it , for I ever strove to bring up my children in the ways o ' honesty ; and certes she had spoiled the contents o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouldy . Well , ' t was th ' talk o ' th ' village for full a month ; scarce did young Mouldy dare put out his nose from behind the lattice o ' his mother 's cottage . But th ' other lads seemed to fall more daft about the lass than aye afore . Now , my wife 's sister had a daughter , called Ruth , and in all things was she most different from my Keren . A 'd a head as yellow as Keren 's eyes , and eyes as brown as Keren 's skin , and a skin as white as Keren 's teeth ; and a was slim and tender-looking , like a primrose that hath but just ventured out on a day in early spring . Moreover , she was a timid , sweet-voiced creature  --  the kind o ' wench that makes even a weak man feel strong , ye mind , comrade . But a was ne'er o'er-civil to my lass . Neither did Keren waste much love upon her ; she said from th ' very start that th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly tongue , " saith she , " doth ever mate with a false heart , " saith she ; " and from such a marriage what offspring can ye look for , unless it be for mischief ? " saith she . They had not much to do the one with the other , however , until the coming of Robert Hacket to Pebworth . And a was as fine a lad as e'er caused a lass to don her Sunday kirtle on a Saturday . ' T was said as how he had met with Ruth while that she was on a visit to her aunt in Dancing Marston , and that he had come to Pebworth to wed with her . All would ' a ' been well had not it come to Keren 's ears how that Mistress Ruth said that she would bring Master Hacket to see her cousin Keren , but that she did not want her sweetheart to be out with her family ere that he had married into it ; meaning neither more nor less than that my Keren was a shame unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cat ! " quoth Keren , waxing as red as any damask rose for very anger ; " the little , spiteful cat ! But I 'll cut her claws for her ! Do thou bide and mark me , father . Ay , I 'll serve her and her Robert in such wise they 'll go to their graves remembering . " Now , ' t was the very next day that the lads and lasses o ' the village did crown her harvest-queen , and all Bidford was out to see ' t . And very queen she looked , too , borne aloft in a throne made all o ' dark red roses , and her dark curls crowned with a wreath o ' corn and o ' poppies , that shined in the sunlight like to gold strewn all with rubies . She wore a new kirtle of white wool , and her brown throat rose from her white kerchief like as a frozen wood-dove 's dusky breast doth peep from new-fallen snow . And Mistress Ruth walked beside her as one o ' her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of naught so much as of a lamb trotting by the side of a forest doe  --  the one so meek and white , and the other so free and brown , with great eyes ever moving , and head aloft . There , moreover , walked Master Hacket . He was as brown as my Keren , and nearly half as tall again ; and he had eyes like pools o ' water under a night heaven , wherein two stars have drowned themselves , as ' t were , and brows as black and straight as a sweep o ' cloud across an evening sky . Ruth walked at his side , all glittering with her unbound hair , like to a sunbeam that follows a dark stream . And I saw that they talked together , and nodded as though agreeing on something , and looked together at my lass where she sat on her flower-throne with her poppy-crown , and her lips like poppies . And all at once she turned and saw them , and her lips parted over her white teeth in a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth tear over a white petticoat beneath ; and she turned away ; but I could see that she laughed in her brown throat , as a bird sings sometimes for its own hearkening ere trolling for the whole forest . So I said to myself , " ' Ware , ' ware , my little spring lamb ; there is trouble ahead for thee . Thou wilt not win thy Boaz so easily as thou dost think , my little Ruth . " Now , when they were come to the fields , and the maids seated under some elm-trees , and all the lads fallen to ' t with their sickles , while that they were reaping the glistening corn my Keren doth leap to her feet , and she calls out , " I know not the name o ' yonder man , but I do know that I can give him a lesson in reaping ! " So forthwith up jumps she , and , striding out into the sunlit meadow , jerks young Hacket 's sickle from his hand , and , having turned back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapely legs and begins to reap . Now , methought I had ne'er in all my life seen anything more pleasing to look upon . The wind blew down her thick locks about her , so that she was wrapped in a mantle worthy any queen ; while with every sweep o ' her strong brown arms the tumbling grain did fall like gold about her , so that she seemed to be trampling upon her treasures after a manner truly royal . Also a red came into her shadowy cheeks , like as though a scarlet flower tossed into a clear brown stream should rise slowly upward beneath the limpid surface and shine a-through . And all at once she ceased , and came back towards the young man , and returned his sickle unto him . And she said , smiling , " Take thou thy blade , for I have not only reaped the grain , but I have reaped the reward of my bragging as well . " And , behold ! when I was come up to them with a drink o ' water in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white kirtle , as though the poppies in her crown had melted in the sunlight and did stain her garment . He did cry out , saying , " O ' my word , lass , thou art deeply hurt . Let me but look at it . " She saith unto him ( winding her arm about in her long hair ) , " Nay , ' t is nothing , and belike if thou look upon it ' twill spoil thy dinner : so here 's to thy health , and my father will bind it for me . " Then , when we were retired again into the shade , and I had torn a strip off of her kirtle wherewith to stanch the blood , she laughed outright , and saith , " By my troth , father ! I do verily believe thou thinkest me awkward without a purpose . " " Purpose ! " saith I ; for I could not believe my ears . " How dost thou mean  --  purpose ? " " That 's neither here nor there , " saith she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heifer , father , that Mistress Ruth 's sweetheart cometh on the morrow to inquire after Mistress Ruth 's cousin Keren . " Wherewith she did make me a deep courtesy , and did get her back to the other lasses ere I could reply . Well , as I live , and must some day die , and do hope when I do die to get to heaven , I was so taken aback with the hussy 's cunning I could do naught but stand and stare after her for some minutes . And on the morrow he did come , and on the day after that he came , and yet a third day and he was under my roof again . Then saith my wife , after that his third visit was o'er , and speaking to Keren as she sat spinning i ' th ' door-way , " Happuch , " saith she , " thou art serving thy cousin Ruth a very jade 's trick . " Then , hearing as how she did call her " Happuch , " I did prick up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was anger brewing . " Thou art very free with thy words to-day , mother , " quoth the maid , a-spinning very quickly . " Not so free as thou art with thy favors to the sweetheart o ' another lass , " replied her mother . " How dost thou know he is the sweetheart o ' another lass ? " saith Keren . " If an he be not , " quoth her mother , who , though not half so big as her child , was in nowise less valiant  --  " if an he be not , " quoth she , " ' t is time he were . " " And for why ? " saith Keren . " Thou knowest as well as I do , Happuch , " saith my wife ; whereat up started my crack-brain in a fine fury . " Why wilt thou call me that vile name , when thou knowest how it maddens me ? " saith she , hurling her spindle upon the floor , and tightening both her pretty hands so that they looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not pleased with thee , Happuch , " saith her mother , with all composure , looking at the linen as she washed it , with her head cocked to one side . " There again ! " shouted my wildfire , stamping with her foot . " Why didst thou not call me Beelzebub and have done with ' t ? " " For the reason , " quoth her mother , calmly , " that neither Beel nor Zebub is a suiting name for a woman , and , furthermore , that thou art not the Devil , though thou dost act like him on occasions . " " Wife , wife , " put in I , seeing that the girl was like to split with rage , " speak gentler to Keren . " " To Happuch , " saith she . " Speak gentler to the girl , " saith I , hoping to compromise , as ' t were . " Happuch , " saith my wife again . " Well , well , " saith I , still hoping to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife nor my daughter upon me , " if thou wouldst only speak gentler to Keren-Happuch , thou  --  " " To Happuch , " saith my wife a third time ; whereat the lass did bounce out o ' the house without more ado , and spent that night with a friend o ' her own , by name one Mistress Meg Titmouse . " Wife , " saith I unto her later , hoping to draw her into converse concerning Keren , so that I might reason with her as to her treatment o ' th ' lass  --  " wife , " saith I , amiably , and , as I thought , in a manner most winsome , " wherefore didst thou speak to Keren as thou didst this morning ? " " I spake to Happuch , " saith my wife , " because I did choose so to do . And as for the why o ' that wherefore , though thou shouldst smirk till doomsday like a dog scratching his ear , ne'er wilt thou get it out o ' me ! " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou wilt admit , comrade  --  saith I , " Thou art welcome to keep thy counsel ! " saith I. And I followed the example set me by my vixen , and did spend more than half the night at this very tavern . Well , the next morning , as I did pass out on my way to my forge , whom should I see in the garden but my Keren and Master Robert Hacket ! and if e'er a woman was possessed o ' a devil , ' t was just that lass o ' mine then , comrade . She had caused young Hacket to climb up into a pear-tree , and while that he was up there she did bear away the ladder by which he had mounted , and she saith to him , " Now , Master Robin , I am going to sing thee a song . Wilt thou listen ? " " With all my heart , " saith he . So he leaned on his elbow , stretched out like a young panther along the limb o ' th ' tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live , down went that jade on her knees in the grass , and she lifts up her two pretty hands to him as though in prayer , and thus sings she ( I knew the song by heart ) : " ' Listen , Robin , while I woo . This world 's stale with repetition : I 'll not do as others do ; Haste thee , love , to my tuition . Robin , I 'll make love to you , As men to other maidens do . " ' Oh , what eyes my Robin hath ! April fields own no such blue ; In the luscious aftermath There 's no flower so fair to view . Robin , Robin , hear me woo . All my soul 's in love with you ! " ' Robin , will you marry me ?  --  Thus upon my knees I sue : O ' my word I 'll harry thee Like as men their sweethearts do . Robin , as I live I 'm true : Will you wed me , Robin ?  --  Will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt agree with me , comrade , in saying it did but serve her right . Down falls he like a ripe pomewater at her side , and takes her about the waist , and sets his mouth to hers ( all in a twink , comrade ; thou hadst not time to shape thy mouth for a whistle ere ' t was all done , or verily my mouth had given forth something besides whistling ) , and saith he , " That will I , lass ; an ' if thou be not my wife ere that snail-coming new moon doth thrust out her horns , my name is not Hacket , nor will thine be ! " Now , comrade , though it doth shame me verily so to speak o ' mine own flesh , I saw by her pretending to push him away that she did mightily relish his kisses ; for , by my troth ! had she sought to scuffle with him ' t would ' a ' been as snug an encounter as when day and night wrestle for the last bit o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feigning to scowl , " How now , thou rapscallion ! dost thou dare ? " " Ay , ay , " quoth he , " in verity I do ! " quoth he . And in verity a did , too . But just as I was consulting with the Lord how to act , He having had even a greater experience with wayward children than myself ( may He pardon me if I be too free with His holy name ! )  --  just , I say , as I was asking Him to show me in what wise to proceed , up goes her hand , and she gives him a sound cuff o ' th ' ear ( young Hacket 's ear  --  not the Lord 's ; may He pardon me if so it sounded ) , and she saith , " Take that for striving to make a fool out o ' an honest girl ! I know thy goings on with Ruth Visor , " saith she . " Thou'lt ne'er blind me with thy pretty speecheries . " And a was o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-blown leaf . Then did young Hacket come to th ' fence and lean upon it with both his arms , and support his chin with a thumb on either side o't , and saith he , " Methinks she 'd ' a ' made a better warrior than a wife , " saith he ; " but when she hath ta'en off the edge o ' her warlike spirit in fighting for her freedom , " saith he , " why , then , " saith he , " I 'll marry her ! " So saith he  --  every word o't . By my troth , comrade , an I had not had so much the advantage by having my nippers in my hand , I would ' a ' thrashed him then and there . But , " fair play " being my motto , and having my nippers , as I saith , I forbore ; yea , I forbore , and walked away unseen of him . And , o ' my word , I was much angered with myself for not being more angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out loud , that I might be impressed by the sound as well as by the knowledge o ' th ' fact  --  " for , " saith I , a-hammering away on a shoe for Joe Pebbles 's brown nag King Edward ( though I had often reasoned with Joe on account o ' th ' name , first because o ' its irreverence , second on account o ' th ' horse not being that kind o ' a horse , as ' t was a mare )  --  " for , " saith I , as I made th ' shoe , saith I , " ' t is sure a great wickedness to steal a lass 's sweetheart away from her ! " saith I. And so ' t was ; but , for all I could do , I could not feel angered with the hussy . But that day when she did fetch me my dinner , being finished , I did pull down th ' sleeves o ' my shirt , and wiped off my leathern apron , and quoth I to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . " So she comes right willingly , being fond o ' me to an extent that did oft seem to astony the mother that bore her ( seeing that she was fond o ' naught save her own way ) ; she comes , and she perches upon my knee ( as sometimes thou shalt see a hawk rest wings on a bull 's back ) , and she kittles my throat with her long brown fingers , and hugs me about the neck ( the jade ! a knew I was for scolding her ) , and saith she , " Well , father , here be I. " Methinks I can hear her say it now , as soft as any little toddler come for a kiss . " Here be I , " she saith ; and with that she fills all my face with her curls ( the jade ! a saw that in my eye which a did not care to face ) . " Here be I , " saith she . " Ay , " saith I , speaking in a gruff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " saith I , " I 'll tell thee what I want of thee . " " Thou canst want naught that I will not do , " saith she . ( The jade ! a had a way with her to ' a ' made Bess herself yearn for matrimony . ) But I was stanch ; I was stanch , comrade . Saith I , " Methinks thy mother was right to speak to thee as yesternight she did , " saith I ; " for I saw thee strive to graft a pear-tree with a branch o ' th ' tree o ' knowledge , " saith I. " Then , " saith she , hot as my forge all in a breath , and bouncing from my knee  --  " then thou wast an eavesdropper ! " saith she . " Even as the Lord afore me , " saith I , not over-pleased at her sauciness . " And being in some sort thy Creator , and thou having set up for thyself an Eden in my garden , " saith I , " who hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " saith I. Then she not answering me , thus did I continue : " Why dost thou not take unto thyself an husband , " quoth I , " to do both thyself and thy parents a credit ? " " Show me such an one , " saith she , " and I do promise thee to wed him . " " There , then , " quoth I , " is Davy Short hose , the poulterer  --  " " A bangled-eared buffoon as ever lived ! " quoth she ; " and a fool into the bargain . " " So be it , " saith I ; for I was set upon keeping my temper . " What dost thou say to Beryamen Piggin , the brewer ? " " A say if ever a piggin was in sore need o ' a new link , ' t is that one , " saith she . " And , what 's more , I 'll not serve for ' t , " saith she . " How , then , of Nanfan Speckle , the tanner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , " quoth she , " both soul and body . " " There be Jezreel Spittlewig , the joiner . " " Methinks , " quoth she , " if a 'd do a little joining to a 's own shackling body , a might hold together long enough to go through the marriage ceremony , " saith she . " Howbeit , I 'm not a-sure of ' t . " " Well , then , Jack Stirthepot , the chair-mender . " " A 'd have to stir th ' pot with a witch ere a brewed a wedding with me , " quoth she . " What sayest to Reuben Puff , the tinker ? " " If I say so much as a word to any one o ' em , " cried she , snatching up the pail wherein she had brought my victuals , " may thy first grandchild be born without a tongue ! " saith she . And out she went . Then quoth I to myself , quoth I , " Lemon , " quoth I , " the jade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no less . " And I said further , said I , " Bodykins ! " said I , a-shoeing of King Edward with all my might , " by cock and pye ! " said I , " an a wants him let a have him . ' T is more than his dessert , I 'll warrant , " so quoth I. " And as for Dame Visor 's hussy , let her learn to bridle her tongue , " quoth I. And ' t was just here that wench Keren did creep up and take me about the neck , as I was a-filing of King Edward 's hoof . " Father , " saith she , " I cry thee pardon if I have sauced thee ; but dost not mind the rhyme thou art so fond of ?  --  " ' Shoe the horse , and shoe the mare , But let the little colt go bare . ' Seek not to chide me , father , and ne'er will my heels bring hurt to any . " Then off was she again ere I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But that evening as I came home , about the going down o ' th ' sun , I did hear voices i ' th ' kitchen , and , looking in at th ' window , behold , there was that hussy Ruth a-plucking of Keren by th ' kirtle , and Keren a-holding of a pan o ' milk above her head , as though she had half a mind to souse her cousin in ' t . And saith she , " Get to thy feet , wench . This is neither a church , nor am I th ' Lord . " But th ' girl ( who seemed to be in trouble o ' some sort ) fell a-sobbing , and saith she , " Cousin , cousin , I know I have used thee ill , but all my joy is in him . If thou takest him from me , better didst thou take my life , for he is more to me than life . " Then quoth my lass , " Shame on thee to say it o ' any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame enough have I , cousin ! " quoth the poor wench  --  " shame to ' a ' lost him , and shame that I should plead with another to give him back to me ! " " Go to ! " saith Keren ; " go to ! I have not got him to give him back to thee . " " Thou hast ! " saith Ruth ; " thou hast !  --  he is thine , soul and body  --  soul and body ! And thou dost not care ; and I care  --  oh , I care so that I know not how to word it ! " ( Every word that passed between ' em is as clear in my mind as though ' t were but yesterday it all happened . ) " I say shame on thee to say so , " saith my lass again . But the wench still hung about her , and would not let go , and she saith , " Oh , cousin , cousin , cousin , doth it not show thee in what straits I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather had I died , one week agone , than ask thee for thy hand though I were drowning . And sure ' t is less than thy hand for which I ask thee now , sith it be for a man who is less to thee than the littlest finger on that hand , but who is more to me than the heart in my wretched body ! And a had vowed to wed me ; and ' t was next month we were to be wed ; and all so happy  --  my father and my mother so pleased , and his folks do like me well ; and my wedding-gown all sewn and lain away , and the ribbons for my shoes , and some kickshaws for th ' new house ; and all we so glad , and all going so smooth , and we twain so loving ; for , oh , he did love me the once ! he did love me the once ! And now  --  now  --  now  --  " And here did she fall a-weeping in such wise that never another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen floor , and hid all her pretty head ( for pretty ' t was , though I liked her not )  --  hid it all in the skirt o ' her kirtle . Then stood my lass quite still , and her face like the milk in her pan , and she looks down on th ' hussy , as a horse might look down on a kitten which it hath unwitting trampled on , and she saith , " I would I knew whether or no thou speakest the truth ! " Then saith the wench , a-reaching up her clasped hands to heaven  --  saith she , " May God forever curse me an I do not ! " " Take not God 's name in vain , " saith my lass , sharply , and went and set down her pan o ' milk on the cupboard . And again she stands , slowly wiping her hands on her apron , and looking down at th ' girl , who hath once more covered all her face in her petticoat ; and by-and-by she saith to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me do ? " " Give me back my Robin ! give me back my Robin ! " saith the maid . " Thou art welcome to him for me , " saith Keren . Then fell the maid a-weeping more bitterly than ever , and she huddled herself on the hard floor , like a young bird that hath fallen out o ' its nest , and sobbed piteously . And presently gets she to her feet without a word , still a-hiding of her face in her kirtle , and turns to go , a-feeling her way with one o ' her little hands . But when she hath reached th ' door , and hath got one foot on the threshold , up strides that lass o ' mine , and , taking her by the arm , swings her back into th ' room ; and she makes her sit down on a settle and take down her kirtle from her face . And while she is snooding up her ruffled locks , she saith unto her , " Thou art a little fool to cry so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , well , God patience me ! What 's a body to do with such a little ninny ? There ! dry your eyes . Ye shall have your Robin , never fear . God-a-mercy ! at what art blubbering now ? " But down slipped Ruth on her knees , and caught Keren about hers , and she saith unto her , " Heaven bless thee ! thou art a good woman ! May Heaven forgive me for all such words as e'er I have said against thee ! Bless thee ! bless thee ! " " Bodykins ! " saith my lass ( having learned some round oaths from me , I do grieve to say )  --  " bodykins ! " saith she , " wilt a-hear th ' lass ? I say scamper , scamper ; my father 'll be coming home to sup erelong , and I would not he found thee thus . Away with thee ! and fret no more : dost hear ? If I hear that thou hast moped any further from this hour on , I 'll not answer either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dost hear ? Now scamper ! " And scamper a did , like a hare with th ' hounds upon ' t . So full was I o ' praising my lass on her good ' havior that I had got me from th ' lattice and was half in at the door ere I saw what had befallen . There was my madcap comrade , down on her knees afore the settle , wi ' both hands gripped in her thick locks , and her head bent forward on th ' wooden seat ; and she made no sound , neither uttered she any word , but a shook like water when a heavy weight rolls past . And a drew long breaths ever and anon , like one that hath been half drowned and is coming back to life . And I knew then , I knew then , comrade . I had thought a loved th ' boy ; and I knew then . So I got me out , without making any clatter , and I sat me down on a bench outside th ' kitchen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pye , man , ne'er a thought could I think for th ' tears in my eyes . Th ' poor lass ! th ' poor lass ! It fetches th ' salt into my een now to think on ' t . Well , well , what 's past is past , and God himself can not undo ' t ; and what 's coming 's coming , and God wunnot hinder it an he could ; so there 's an end on ' t . Fill up , man , fill up ! What there , I say ! Joel , I say ! A quart o ' sack for Master Turnip . Well , when I had thought it well o'er , I did determine to say naught to th ' lass whatsoever ; neither did I ; but meseems I was bound to o'erhear heart-breaking words atween somebody , for th ' very next day , as I was henting th ' style as leads into th ' lane ( thou knowest the lane I mean , comrade : ' t lies atween Cowslip Meadow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Way , they call ' t )  --  well , as I was getting o'er th ' style  --  as I had just got me o'er by one leg , after this fashion , ye mind ; as though this chair here were th ' style , and yonder chimney-place th ' lane  --  Sweethearts ' Way , ye mind  --  well , as I was half over , and Mumble , th ' turnspit pup , half under , as ' t were , I heard voices  --  voices , comrade  --  one o ' them th ' voice o ' that lass o ' mine , and t' other th ' voice o ' young Hacket . " Here be a coil , " say I. " What 's to do ? " Now the pup seemed to be filled with the spirit o ' th ' Lord all on a sudden , after th ' fashion o ' th ' talking jackass i ' th ' Scriptures ; for if a didna talk a did th ' next thing to ' t  --  a tried to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiend had got him , a scuttles into th ' thicket , for no cause , as I could see , but to give me th ' benefit o ' example . So in goes I after him . Scarce was I settled , with a bramble down th ' back o ' my neck , and some honey-bees at work too nigh to my legs for my peace o ' mind , when they come , and both a-chattering at th ' same time like two magpies with slit tongues . " Thou didst ! " quoth he . " That did I not ! " quoth she . " Thou didst , and I can prove ' t on thee ! " quoth he , louder than afore . " I tell thee I did not , and thou canst sooner prove that Bidford Mill turns the Avon than that I did ! " quoth she . " Wilt thou stand there and tell me i ' th ' eyes that thou hast so oft looked love into , " quoth he , like a man choked with spleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stand there and face me , Robert Hacket , and say thou hast ne'er given me reason to believe that thou didst love me ? " quoth he . " No more cause than I 've given to twenty better than thee ! " quoth she . " Shame on thee to say ' t , thou bold-faced jig ! " saith he ; " shame on thee , I say ! and so will say all honest folk when I tell ' em o ' ' t . " " An thou tell it , the more fool thou , " saith she ; and a draws up her red lips into a circle as though a 'd had a drawstring in ' em , and a stands and looks at him as a used to stand and look at her dam when she chid her for a romp . Then all on a sudden , with such a nimbleness as took away my breath and drove all thoughts o ' brambles and honey-bees clean out o ' my pate , he jumps aside o ' her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day under th ' pear-tree , and quoth he , " Lass , " quoth he , " dunnot break my heart ! dunnot break th ' heart that loves ye more than a ' that 's in the earth , or th ' heavens above , or th ' waters below ! Say ye love me , and ha ' done with ' t . " Then gives she up herself to him for one beat o ' her own breaking heart , the poor madcap , and she leans on him with all her pretty self , as though begging him to take her against her own will , and then a cry breaks from her , half human , and half like th ' cry o ' a hurt beast , and she saith , " Shame on ye , shame on ye , to forsake th ' lass ye ha ' sworn to wed ! Get thee back to her straightway , or ne'er look me i ' th ' face again ! " And she leaps back from him , and points with her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a sportsman 's dog  --  towards th ' village , and she saith again , " Get thee back to her ; get thee back to Ruth Visor , and wed with her ere this month be out o ' the year ! " Then lifts he his sullen head , and looks at her from under his brows like a smitten blood-hound . And he saith back o ' his clamped teeth , like as ' t were a dog gnarling in his throat , " curse ye for a false jade ! " saith he ; " Curse ye for as black-hearted a jade as e'er set an honest man on th ' road to hell ! " And he turned , and cleared th ' style with one hand on ' t , and went his ways . And th ' lass stood and looked after him as still as though she were turned into a pillar o ' summat , after th ' manner o ' th ' woman i ' th ' holy book , and both her hands grasping her breast . But anon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a little wind doth run across a gray pool at eventide , and her lips begin to tremble , like as though some red flower a-growing on th ' bank was shaken by ' t , and her eyes all full o ' woe , like th ' eyes o ' some dumb thing as can not word its sorrow ; and all at once she falls upon her knees , and thence upon her forehead on the ground , and afterwards to her whole length , with her strong hands grasping th ' flowers and grass on either side o ' her , and tearing them up with th ' crackling noise that a horse makes when ' t grazes . But no sound escapes her , whether a sigh or a groan . Well , well , comrade , I cry thee patience if I do stumble here a bit : I can not think on ' t now without a tightness i ' my throat , any more than a man can think o ' th ' day his first child was born to him without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to th ' bellows . Well , well ! Fill up , I say ; fill up . Remember th ' old days , when thou wast more ale-washed than th ' bottle itself . Where be I i ' th ' narrative ? Yea , yea , ' t is there  --  ' t is there ; I mind me o't now . No sound ' scaped her , but presently she lifts herself up upon her knees again , with such heaviness as a horse overburdened doth get him to his feet , and she holds out both her arms i ' th ' direction where th ' lad hath vanished , wi ' th ' grass and flowers yet fast in her clinched hands ; and she saith twice , i ' th ' voice o ' a woman in travail , " Never will he know , never will he know , " she saith ; and then , " Oh , God ! " she saith , a-lifting her hands again to her breast . " Summat 's broke here , " she saith , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on pain  --  " summat 's broke , summat 's broke , " o'er and o'er again , as though she would use herself to th ' sound , as ' t were . Then all at once did a deep cry break from her . " God , O God , " she saith , " show me how to bear ' t ! My God , my God , show me how to bear ' t . " And she got to her feet , and sped down th ' lane like one blind , running first into th ' hawthorn bushes o ' this side , then into th ' quickset hedge o ' th ' other , and tearing out her loosened tresses on th ' low-hanging branches o ' th ' pear-trees , so that I traced her by her hair i ' th ' twigs , like as thou wouldst trace any poor lost lamb by its wool on the brambles . Now , it did almost break my own heart to say naught to her concerning all o't , but I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather would I ' a ' had my old heart split in twain than bring one more ache into her true breast . So naught say I. Never a word , comrade , from then till now have I e'er said to her about that time . Well , for all ' s fine talk , Master Hacket went no more to hell than do any other men that marry  --  an ' less than some , seeing as how a did not marry a scold , which ( God forgive me , or her , or both o ' us ) I have done . Yea , comrade , I will commemorate this our first meeting in eight years by confessing to thee that my wife ( in thy ear , comrade )  --  that my wife was a scold . Sometimes I do verily think as how women like Mistress Lemon be sent unto men to keep ' em from pondering too heavily concerning the absence o ' marriage in heaven . By cock and pye , man , as I live , I do honestly believe that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband o ' Mistress Lemon in heaven ! But to come back to th ' lass . And , now that I think o ' th ' lass , comrade , I am not so sure that a scolding wife is not well paid for by a duteous daughter . Nay , I am sure o't . Methinks I would ' a ' been wed twice , and each time to a shrew , could I but ' a ' had my Keren o ' one o ' ' em . Ay , even so , even so . Well , as I said  --  or as I meant to say  --  Master Hacket wedded th ' Visor hussy within two weeks o ' th ' day whereon he and my Keren had ' t so fierce i ' Sweethearts ' Way . And therein are two meanings : they fell out , as is the way with sweethearts , and they fell out i ' th ' lane so called . Well , well , let me crack a quart o ' sack with thee , comrade , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visor , and they went to Lunnon Town . And on th ' night o ' their wedding , as I sat by the fireside i ' th ' kitchen a-mending my tools ( for ' t was on a Saturday night ) , and Keren abed , and Mistress Lemon a-peeling o ' leather-jackets to make th ' Sunday pie , " Wife , " saith I to her ( a-mending my tools , as I ha ' said ) , " wife , " quoth I , " would ' t were our lass were wed to-day ! " " For why ? " saith she . No more , no less . " For why ? " saith I. " For the why I think a lass is happier wed to th ' man she loves , " saith I. " ' T is not so I 've found it , " quoth she , a-peeling of an apple so that thou couldst ' a ' put his whole coat back and not ' a ' known ' t had e'er come off . Then quoth I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right glad am I to find out that thou lovest me ! " quoth I. " If thou'st found out that , " quoth she , " thou'rt greater than Columbus , " quoth she , " for thou'st discovered something that never was , " quoth she . " Bodykins , woman ! " saith I , a-losing of my temper  --  " then for what didst thou marry me ? " " For a fool , " quoth she . " And I will say as I ha ' got the full o ' my bargain , " quoth she . Whereat so wroth was I that I said naught , knowing that if I did open my lips or move my hand ' t would be to curse her with th ' one and cuff her with t' other . By-and-by saith she , " And where , by'r lay'kin , wilt thou find a man good enough in thy eyes for th ' lass ? " saith she . " Not on earth , " quoth I. " Neither in this land nor that other across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " quoth she . " Very like thou wouldst have th ' wench to wed with an angel , " quoth she ; " to have all thy grandchildren roosting on a gold bar , and their dad a-teaching of ' em how to use their wings , " quoth she . " Or with one o ' th ' red men i ' th ' new country , to have them piebald red and white , like a cock-horse at Banbury Cross , " quoth she . And with that up she gets , and flings the apple-parings into th ' fire , and gets her to bed without more ado . Whereupon day doth again find me i ' this very tavern . Well , well , a year had passed , and things were jogging very peaceful like , and Keren settled down as quiet as a plough-broken mare , when one day as I sit i ' th ' kitchen , while th ' lass mends my apron , there comes a fumbling at th ' latch like as though a child made shift to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little Marjory Pebble , or one o ' the Mouldy lads over th ' way ; " for the babes all loved Keren , and , now that she was waxed so quiet , th ' lads left her more to herself , and she would sit on th ' bench by the cottage door and make little kickshaws by th ' hour  --  elder-wood whistles , and dolls o ' forked radishes , and what not . So quoth I , " Belike ' t is little Marjory Pebble , " quoth I , and th ' lass having her lap full o ' my apron , I went and opened th ' door . And there , comrade , a-kneeling in th ' grass outside , with her head all hid in her kirtle , as she had kneeled two years agone on t' other side o ' that very door , was Mistress Ruth Hacket ; and she was a-sobbing as though her heart would break . And while I stand staring , ere I could find a word to my tongue , comes that lass o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been little Marjory Pebble  --  ha ! ha ! And down goes she on her knees beside th ' lass , and gets an arm about her , and presses down her head , all hid as ' t is in her kirtle , against her breast , and she saith to her , " What troubles thee ? Tell Keren , honey . So so ! What troubles thee ? Tell Keren . " And from beneath her kirtle th ' poor jade sobs out , " He 's gone ! he 's gone ! he 's gone ! They 've taken him to work on th ' big seas  --  and our child not yet born  --  and me so ailing ; and , oh ! I want to die ! I want to die ! " Then saith that lass o ' mine , saith she , " Father , do thou fetch some o ' th ' birch wine out o ' th ' cupboard and bring it to me in a cup ; " and to the girl she saith , " Come , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been coaxing some little spring lambkin to follow her unto its dam ; and she half pulls and half carries th ' wench into th ' house , and seats her on a low stool i ' th ' chimney-corner , and kneels down aside of her . And when I be come with th ' drink , she takes the cup out o ' my hand , and makes th ' wench drink ' t , holding it to her lips with one hand , while with the other she cossets her hair and cheek . And , by-and-by , seeing myself forgotten , I do withdraw into the room beyond , and wait till I be called , that th ' lasses may have ' t out together . Now , Ruth 's folks were aye so poor that scarce could they keep clothes on their backs and food i ' their bellies ; and it hath some time occurred to me how that the Lord might ' a ' given such as could not provide for themselves a coat o ' wool or o ' hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of a sheep or goat  --  the righteous being clad i ' th ' first fashion , and the wicked after th ' last . Well , well , I must on . I see thou art waxing restless , comrade . Not so ? Well , drink , drink , then , that I may feel thou art well occupied while that my old tongue wags . So poor , then , were Ruth 's folks that I said to myself , said I , " What i ' th ' name o ' pity , " so saith I  --  " what i ' th ' name o ' pity is to become o ' the poor lass ? " But I had scarce asked myself th ' question when my lass answers it for me . " Father , " saith she , a-coming and standing afore me , with the empty cup turning on her long fingers  --  " father , " saith she , keeping those gold-colored eyes o ' hers on mine ( methinks they were coined o ' th ' same wedge as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " saith she , just so , " considering all things , " saith she , " I 'm going to keep th ' lass in my room till her child be born , " so saith she . Then saith I , pulling her down into my arms , " Lass , " saith I , " verily do I believe that not only is every hair o ' thy sweet head numbered , but that each one is blessed with a separate blessing ! " And what with my love for her , and my admiring of her goodness , and my pride in her , and what with her pity for the poor girl in th ' other room , we did shed enough tears between us to ha ' o'erflowed th ' empty cup in her hands . So she held me about th ' neck with both arms , and like to ha ' run me mad with kissing th ' back o ' my neck ( for I was e'er one o ' your ticklish sort ) . I stood it bravely , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whensoever I could get a chance for th ' tightness o ' her hugging . And so we settled it . But Mistress Lemon was yet to be consulted . Ready enough was I to shift that job on my lass 's broad shoulders ( seeing as how a reputation for courage with his wife is ne'er believed o ' a man , at any rate , and as how th ' wench had a way o ' managing her mother which sure none could ' a ' had that were not of her own flesh ) . And that night , when her mother was returned from a round o ' gossiping , th ' lass tells her all ( having i ' th ' mean time put Ruth to bed atween her own sheets ) . Well , ne'er saw I my wife in such a rage . " What ! " saith she , " thou hast ta'en it on thyself to offer my bread and meat to a good-for-naught hussy as ne'er had a civil word for any o ' us ! Thou hast given her bed-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave ! ' Thou godless hussy , thou ! Where be th ' jade ? I say , where be she ? Where be she ? " " Where thou shalt not come at her in thy present humor , mother , " saith the lass , standing with one arm reached out across the door-way , like as though in verity she had been the mother and her dam a naughty child . " How ? Dost word me ? dost word me ? " saith my wife . " How ? dost take any stray cat to kitten in my house an ' then word me too ? "  --  so saith she . Then saith th ' lass , " Well can I understand , " saith she , " how , if thou canst speak i ' this fashion o ' thy sister 's child , thou canst also speak to thy own as sure no mother e'er spoke ere this . " Then , changing all suddenly her tone , and dropping down her arm from the door , " Go an thou like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath come to ask thy help in time o ' trouble ; but just so surely as thou dost turn her out o ' door to lie i ' th ' straw like any common callet , just so sure do I follow her , to fare as she fares , and all the village shall know what thou hast done . " Then for some minutes did they twain stand and gaze upon one another , and at last down flumps my wife into a chair , as though she would break it in pieces for very rage ; but being waxed sulky , and her own wrath cowed , as ' t were , by her daughter 's more righteous wrath , she saith nothing more of ' t , good or bad . In three weeks ' time th ' child is born , and as sound and as pretty a babe as e'er I clapt eyes on , and Keren a-dangling of him as natural as though she herself had been a mother , time and again . " What say'st thou now , lass ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is he sound , verily ? " saith the poor little dame , looking shyly upon him . " Never a spot so big as the splash on a guinea-flower ! " saith Keren . " And ears like sea-shells . " So , after a-kissing of them both , and th ' top o ' th ' babe 's head ( as ' t was permitted me to do ) , I steals out and leaves them together . Well , ne'er saw thou a child grow as did that child . Meseemed he sprouted like corn after a rain ; and in five months a was waxed so strong a could stand on ' s feet a-holding to his mother 's kirtle . But , strange to say or not , as thou wilt have ' t , he did seem to love Keren more than he did th ' mother that bore him , a-crying for her did she but so much as turn her back , and not sleeping unless that she would croon his lullabies to him . Mayhap it was because her strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him than did th ' breast and arms o ' his little dam ; but so was ' t , and nearly all o ' her time did th ' lass give to him . Neither did it seem to rouse aught o ' jealousy in Ruth 's heart : she was too busy a-looking for th ' return o ' ' s father to bother her pretty pate o'ermuch concerning him . And she would sit and talk o ' Robin , and o ' Robin 's goodness , and o ' Robin 's sweet ways and words and doings , until I thought sometimes my poor lass 's heart would just break within her , if ' t had not been broken already these two years . And one day , as she kneels beside th ' cradle  --  Ruth having gone to see her folks for th ' day  --  I come in unknown to her , and stand to watch th ' pretty sight . There kneels she , and Ruth 's red shawl o'er her head to please th ' child ( Keren ne'er had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there kneels she , I say , beside the cradle , and kittles him with her nimble fingers , and digs him i ' th ' ribs after a fashion that would sure ' a ' run me crazy ( though it hath ne'er yet been proven what a young babe can not endure at the hands o ' women ) , and punches and pokes and worries him , for all th ' world like a kitten worrying a flower . And he , lying on his back , kicks with both feet at her face , and winds all his hands in her long hair , and laughs , and bubbles , and makes merry , after the fashion o ' a spring stream among many stones . And by-and-by a change falls o'er her , and she waxes very solemn , and sits down on th ' floor by th ' edge o ' th ' cradle , with one arm upon ' t and her head on her hand , and she looks at the babe . In vain doth he clutch at her hair and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as of water through crowding roots , after his little bare toes : never so much as a motion makes she towards him . But at last up gets she to her knees , and takes him fiercely into her strong hands , and holds him off at arm's-length , looking at him ; and she saith in a deep voice ( such as I had not heard her use for two years ) , saith she , " For that thou art not mine , " saith she , " I hate thee ; but  --  " and here came a change o'er all her face and voice and manner , like as when April doth suddenly wake in the midst o ' a wintry day in springtide  --  " but , " saith she , " for that thou art his , I love thee ! " And she took him to her bosom , and bowed down her head over him so that he was hidden all in her long hair ; but the bright shawl covered it , so that , what with her stooping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly at the door might ' a ' easily mistaken her for Ruth . It was thus with th ' man who at that moment strode past me and caught up child and woman into his embrace . " I have come back to thee , " he said  --  " I have come back to thee . Look up , wife ! Ruth , look up ! " But when she did look up , and he saw her face as white as morning , and her hair as black as night , and her tall figure like to a young elm-tree  --  ay , when she looked up , ne'er saw I a man not dead seem so like death . He drops down his arms from about them , as though smitten from behind by a sword , and he staggers and leans against th ' table , and lets fall his head upon his breast , staring straight in front o ' him . But she stands looking upon him . And I got me out with all speed ; so ne'er knew I more o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take away Ruth with him th ' next day , and she as happy as a bird whose mate hath come back to ' t with the springtide . But a knew how that my lass had taken his wife into her bed , and nursed her through her sickness night and day , after the hard words he had spoken unto her and the ill names he had called her . And that was all I cared to know . He had set th ' iron in my lass 's heart , and now ' t was in his own ; and for th ' rust , it did but hurt him more . Ay , ay , comrade , thou knowest what I do mean . Well , the winter passed , and spring came on again , and ' t was in the May o ' that year that I did break my hammer-arm . God above us only knows what would ' a ' befallen us had ' t not been for my Keren . Wilt believe ' t ? ( but then I think thou'lt believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  eh , comrade ? )  --  th ' lass did set to work , and in two weeks ' time a was as good a farrier as was e'er her daddy afore her . Bodykins , man ! thou shouldst ' a ' seen her at it : clad from throat to feet she was in a leathern apron , looking as like mine own as though th ' mare 's skin whereof mine was fashioned had , as ' t were , foaled a smaller one for th ' lass  --  ha ! ha !  --  and her sleeves rolled up from her brown arms , and th ' cords a-standing out on them like th ' veins in a horse 's shoulder . And so would she stand , and work th ' bellows at th ' forge , until , what with th ' red light from the fire on her face , and on her hair , and on her bare arms , I was minded o ' th ' angel that walked i ' the fiery furnace with th ' men in holy writ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her young arm going like a flail  --  chink , chank  --  chink , chank  --  and th ' white spatters o ' hot iron flying this way and that from th ' anvil , meseemed ' t was as though Dame Venus ( for thou knowest how in th ' masque twelve year gone this Yuletide ' t was shown as how a great dame called Venus did wed wi ' a farrier called Vulcan  --  I wot thou rememberest ? )  --  as though Dame Venus had taken away her hammer from her goodman Vulcan to do ' s work for him . By my troth , ' t was a sight to make a picture of  --  that ' t was , comrade . Well , ne'er saw I such trouble as that arm gave me ( and ' t has ne'er been strong since ) . First ' t would not knit , and then when ' t did ' t was all wrong , and had to be broken and set o'er again . But th ' lass ne'er gave out once . Late and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' forge ; and a came to be known for as good a smith as there was in all Warwickshire . But , for that none had e'er heard tell o ' a woman at such work , or for some other reason , they did come to call her , moreover , " The Farrier Lass o ' Piping Pebworth . " One day , as we sat i ' th ' door o ' th ' shop , a-resting , and talking together  --  after a way we had with us even when she was a little lass  --  there rides up a young gallant , all dressed out in velvet and galloon , and a feather in ' s hat , and long curls hanging about his shoulders . Oh ay , a was bonny enough to look upon . So a draws rein at th ' door . And saith he , " Art thou th ' Farrier Lass o ' Piping Pebworth ? " saith he . Saith she , arising to her feet , and standing with crossed arms like any man  --  saith she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But my name is Keren Lemon . " " A sour name for so sweet a lass , " saith th ' gallant . " Would thou hadst sweetened that old jest with some new wit ! " quoth she . " Thou art sharp o ' tongue , " saith he . " I shoe horses with my arms , not with my tongue , " saith she . " As I live , a witty jade ! " quoth he . " Thou dost much amuse me , maiden . " " My wit was not fashioned any more for thy amusement than for the shoeing o ' thy horse , " quoth she . " So , if thou dost not purpose to have him shod , ride on ! " saith she . Then saith he , to himself , as ' t were , " Verily , " saith he , " they should call thee the harrier lass , for thou hast run down and found my manners when that old hounds have failed . " And to her he saith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I cry thee pardon for having given thee offence . " " It is easier to give offence than pardon , " saith she . " Howbeit , thou art pardoned . Say no more . " Whereupon she sets to work and , taking th ' horse 's foot atween her knees , falls to filing his hoof in such wise that I could not ' a ' done better in her place , though the Queen should ask me to sup afterwards at St. James 's . But the stranger could not hold his tongue ; and when he saw her working th ' bellows , and a-making of th ' shoe , and th ' way she swung th ' great hammer , " By my troth , " saith he , " I would I could paint thee as Sally Mander to give to th ' Queen , " saith he . Then saith my lass , " I know not of any wench called Sally Mander , " saith she , a-burning of th ' horse 's hoof with th ' hot shoe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her , " so saith she , " methinks ' t is as well for both o ' us that I know her not , " saith she  --  every word o't just as I tell thee . Then saith the gallant , clapping hand to thigh , so that it made such a sound as when a young child is trounced , " By my troth , " saith he , " an thy brows be not worthy o ' a coronet , ne'er saw I any that merited to wear one . What wouldst thou if thou wert a lady , lass ? " She saith , a-rolling up of her sleeves a little tighter , and looking up at him as he sate again upon his horse , " Meanest thou if I were the wife o ' a lord ? " saith she . " Even so , " saith he , laughing . " Verily thou hast come at my meaning with a commendable quickness . Well , and if thou wert the wife o ' a lord , what wouldst thou do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her arms again upon her breast  --  saith she , " I would bring up such sons as were born to me to behave worthily o ' their station in life , and not to forget their manhood by speaking with insolence unto such honest maids as had never offered them affront . " Whereupon she did up with her kit o ' tools , and pass by me into th ' forge ; and th ' man rode on with a reddened visage . But it befell only two days later that a came again to th ' forge , his horse having cast another shoe . And again th ' lass sets all to right for him , he keeping a civil tongue in ' s head this time ; and o ' that we thought naught one way or th ' other . But when a comes a third time , and yet a fourth and a fifth and a sixth , " Father , " saith th ' lass  --  " father , " saith she , " this must be stopt , " saith she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how wilt do ' t ? " saith I. " I 'll do ' t , never fear , " saith she . And a did , comrade . Ha ! ha ! I 'd trust that wench to make Satan keep to heel like any well-broke puppy . ' T was in this way . The next time th ' gallant comes riding up ( that being th ' seventh time in all , ye mind )  --  well , the next time up comes riding he , and he saith to her , saith he , " I have come to ask thy service yet again , damsel , " saith he ; " but Merrylegs hath cast another shoe . " Then saith th ' lass  --  ha ! ha !  --  every word as I tell thee , comrade  --  saith she , " Methinks , my lord , if my work hold no better than that  --  methinks , " saith she , " ' t were as well thou went for th ' shoeing o ' thy horse to Timothy Makeshift , as lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it come to th ' ears o ' others how that I will shoe a horse one day , and th ' next how that he will cast th ' shoe  --  if it so be known , " saith she , " no more custom will I get to keep my father and mother in their old age . " Then doth he leap down from his horse , and he doffs his hat as though my lass had been any fine lady ; and quoth he , " Well and justly hast thou spoken ; and I do stand confessed of my fault . But , maiden , thou wast not born unto th ' life thou leadest ; and here in thy presence I do ask thy father to bestow upon me thy hand . I am Sir Dagonet Balfour , of Balfour Hall ; and if thou art willing I will make thee my lady . " Now , I was struck dumb as though my tongue had jumped forth o ' my mouth , and never a blessed thing could I do saving stare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lass o ' mine , comrade  --  she stands and looks at him , and never so much as a glint o ' red in her face . And saith she , " My lord , " saith she , " if that thou meanest what thou hast said , thou hast forgotten thine estate and not remembered mine . Since God hath not made me a lady , methinks it is not in the power o ' one o ' His creatures so to do . But I do thank thee for seeking to honor me , and wish thee joy when thou shalt take in wedlock some highborn maiden . " Then saith he , " An I wed not thee , ne'er will I be wed . What ! dost thou think I can look on in patience and see a woman such as thou following the trade of a farrier ? " Then saith she , " If Jesus Christ followed th ' trade o ' a carpenter , " saith she , " sure , " saith she , " Keren Lemon can follow th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every blessed word as I tell thee , comrade . And no more would she have to do with him , but got her into th ' forge and left him standing there . Well , thou might ' a ' thought that was th ' end o't . Not a bit  --  not a bit , comrade . Th ' knight would be a-riding up at all times and in all weather , and somehow ' t gets out i ' th ' village ( though not through my lass , I warrant ye ) as how he doth in verity seek to espouse my Keren . Well , o ' all th ' tirrits and to-do 's as e'er you heard on ! Methought when Mistress Lemon found out that th ' girl had refused th ' gallant 's offer th ' house would be a tighter fit for us three than its shell for an unhatched chick . ' T was worry , worry , worry , from morn till night , and from night till morn it was worry , worry , worry , till I scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and hang for ' t , or leave her alone and live with her . " Th ' hussy ! " quoth she  --  " th ' ungrateful hussy ! a ought to be tossed in a blanket , " quoth she , " and thou along with her , thou jack-pudding , thou ravelling ! " quoth she . " If I be a jack-pudding , " saith I , " I ha ' more descendants than most such , " saith I. " Yea , " quoth she , " verily , " quoth she ; " and all nine o ' th ' lads be jacks , " saith she , " and th ' wench as very a pudding as e'er fell to pieces for want o ' being held together , " saith she . " Out on ye both ! I 'm done with ye ! " " For that , God be praised ! " saith I , and left ere she could answer . But one day as I sate i ' th ' kitchen , a-cosseting o ' my lame arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a sound o ' wheels and a clatter o ' horses ' hoofs ; and , lo ! there be a chariot pulled up afore the door , with four gray horses a-making play with their trappings , and a coachman , all wig and gilding , a-sitting on th ' box . And ere a could move , out steps a fine dame , with her hair all in hillocks , as ' t were , and a paling o ' lace round about her head , like as ' t had been a flower-garden , and a farthingale to ' a ' covered th ' big malt-pot with as little to-do as a hen covers an egg . And up comes she to th ' door , and her tire-woman a-holding of her robes , and two footmen going before , and in she comes  --  like as though Riches and Death had a ' th ' same right to enter a poor man 's house without knocking . And saith she to me , saith she , a-filling up o ' the room with her finery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nest , saith she , " Be this th ' cottage o ' Humfrey Lemon th ' farrier ? " saith she . " It be so ; and I be he , " saith I. " And be thou th ' father o ' th ' wench they call th ' Farrier Lass o ' Piping Pebworth ? " saith she . " I be , an ' proud o't , " say I , a-beginning to think that she might ' a ' knocked at th ' door , for all her greatness . " Where 's th ' lass ? " saith she , as she might ' a ' said " Where 's my glove ? " Then saith I , " Madam , " saith I , " most like she 's gone about her business , " saith I. " My good man , " saith she , after a fashion that did cause me to feel aught but good  --  " my good man , " saith she , " dost thou know to whom thou speakest ? " " Verily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , madam . " " Boor , " saith she , " I am the Lady o ' Balfour Hall . " " An ' so could my lass ' a ' been , had she willed it , " saith I ; but ere I could further forget myself , in comes Keren by another door , and she saith , " Father , do thou go out , and leave me to speak with this lady . " Then to th ' dame she saith , " Your ladyship , " saith she , " I am Keren Lemon , that be called th ' Farrier Lass . What wouldst thou with me ? " Then I got me out o ' th ' room , but not out o ' hearing distance ; and this is what followed : " I have heard , " saith th ' dame , " these reports concerning my son Sir Dagonet and thee , and , to my sorrow , I find upon inquiry , " saith she , " that they be true . Moreover , though it doth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had an interview with my son Sir Dagonet , " so saith she  --  every word o't as I tell thee  --  " and he is determined in his purpose o ' ruining his life and th ' happiness o ' his mother . Therefore I have come to thee , to ask that thou persistest in the course which thou hast begun , " saith she . " And here , " saith she , " is gold to hold thy tongue concerning my visit unto thee . " And therewith she did count down ten broad gold pieces upon th ' kitchen table . " I must also ask thee , " then continued she , ere my lass could answer her , " to allow me to remain under thy roof until my carriage be returned from th ' other end o ' the village , where it hath been sent with my tire-woman to purchase some ribbon to tie my parrot to ' s perch . " Never a word saith my lass , but she goes to th ' door and opens it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged urchin who is at some spot on th ' other side o ' th ' street ; and he being come as fast as his little shanks would bring him , she bids him enter , and taking him up in her arms , she lifts him up so that a can reach th ' gold on th ' table , and saith she , " Thou'rt not o'er-clean to touch , my good little mouse , " saith she , " but thou'rt cleaner than that stuff thou seest . There , lad , that 's for thee , if an thou'lt run to th ' other end o ' th ' village and bid them return at once with my lady Balfour 's carriage , " so saith she . Then , th ' lad having stuffed all ' s doublet with th ' gold , she sets him on ' s feet , and off a scuttles on th ' best-paid errand e'er chanced since th ' world began . And my lass , having courtesied to the thunder-stricken dame , gets her outside ( where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves her ladyship in possession o ' th ' kitchen . Well , comrade , right sure am I that thou dost think that was the end on ' t . Not a bit . Sir Dagonet did himself come to th ' cottage th ' very next day to see th ' lass , and they had many words together , and at last he did accuse her o ' false pride and proud humility . And saith he , " Wouldst thou make misery for the man who loves thee best of all the world , merely to satisfy a notion o ' thine own ? Greatness and goodness , " saith he , " dwell in the heads and hearts o ' mankind , not in their birth or purses . I do ask thee , with all respect , to be my wife , and I am prepared to face th ' anger o ' my mother and o ' th ' Queen . Ay , " saith he , his face gone red as a girl 's , and comes nigh to her  --  " ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ready to seek th ' new country with thee as my wife , and to leave title and lands and Queen and mother behind me . " Then saith she  --  and I had not seen tears in her eyes for many a day  --  " My lord , " saith she , " well and nobly hast thou spoken , and with all my soul do I honor thee for it , and I thank thee with all my heart and soul . But , my lord , even were there not thy rank and position atween us , there is atween us , " saith she , " which would hold us as far apart as the sea doth hold this England which we live in and th ' new country o ' which thou didst speak . For , " saith she  --  and she speaks in a steady voice , howbeit ' t is very low , and she keeps her sun-like eyes on his  --  " for , my lord , " saith she , " all the love that was mine to give hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saith he never another word , but bends his knee and kisses her long brown hand as though ' t had been th ' Queen 's ; and he gets him from th ' cottage . Now , two more years were sped since that Ruth had left us , and sometimes would we hear through friends o ' th ' little lad and ' s mother and father , and always was Ruth a-sending of pretty messages to Keren  --  her love , and her thanks , and how happy she was , and th ' boy so like his father  --  and more than I remember . A full year had th ' lass been at work in my shop , and my arm no more fit to hammer than afore . So I looks about to get a lad to help her in her work , seeing as ' t were too much for one wench . And , Lord ! th ' trouble I had ! Ten lads did I try , one right after th ' other ; and one would be saucy , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpkin head to fall in love wi ' th ' lass ; and all o ' ' em lazy . But , God-a-mercy ! how 's a man to tell a lazy lad till he ha ' tried him ?  --  unless it be old Butter . Ha ! ha ! I ha ' just minded me o ' th ' way he used to treat th ' lads that came to Amhurste to hire for under-gardeners . He would stand with ' s owlish old visage a-set on ' s hoe-handle , for all th ' world like a fantastic head carved out o ' a turnip and set on a stick , and a would let th ' lad go on with ' s story o ' how Dame This commended him for that , and o ' how Dame That commended him for this , and o ' how a had worked under my lord So-and-So 's head-gardener and in my lady So-and-So 's own hot-houses ; and when a had got through , never a word would old Butter say , but a would just step round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cold day , and a would lift up th ' tail o ' ' s doublet and look at th ' seat o ' ' s breeches . And if they were fairly worn a would hire th ' lad ; but if an they were much worn a would say , " No work dost thou get from me , my lad , " would a say , " thou sittest down too often to work for Anthony Butter "  --  so would a say  --  every word o't just as I ha ' told thee . Ha ! ha ! And all the time as sober as a coroner inspecting a corse . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Methinks I can see him now  --  th ' old zany . Well , well , a was a good man , was Anthony Butter ; and if a was a bit puffed up with ' s own importance , a 's charity ne'er got in a like condition that it did not bring forth some kind act . Well , th ' months swung round , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one day as I sat i ' th ' forge door , a-swearing roundly to myself concerning my lame arm , and how that ' t would not mend , up comes galloping a man , like one distraught , and a child on th ' saddle afore him , and a flings himself down with th ' child in ' s arms ( making no shift whate'er to hold th ' horse , which gallops on with th ' reins swinging ) , and a cries out , a-setting of th ' child on my knee  --  a cries out , " For God 's sake , help me ! My child hath been bit by a mad dog ! Help me in some way , for th ' love of God ! " And I saw that ' t was Robert Hacket that crouched and quivered at my knee like a hurt hound , and th ' child as like to him as one leaf on a tree is to th ' other . But ere I could do or say aught , comes that lass o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , and he roaring as lustily as any bull-calf with th ' wound in ' s little brown arm , and she sees where the beast hath bitten him . Then sets she him down again on my lap , and runs and fetches a bar o ' iron and heats it i ' th ' forge till ' t is white-hot , and all th ' time th ' poor father a-sobbing , and kissing of th ' babe , and calling on me to help him , like as though I were God Almighty . And while he was so doing , and the babe like to burst with weeping , and I gone mad with not knowing what to be at , comes that wench , comrade , and jerks up th ' babe , and sets th ' white-hot metal in ' s soft flesh . Ay , comrade , a did , and a held it there till where th ' dog 's fangs had been was burned as black as th ' anvil . And then , when ' t is done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we two for praising and blessing o ' her , down drops she all in a heap on th ' floor atween us , like a hawk that hath been smitten in mid-heaven . Then ' t was , comrade , that th ' babe was left to endure his pain as best he might ; never thought more did ' s father give him that day ; but he runs and lifts th ' lass in ' s strong arms , and bears her out into th ' fresh air , and he calls her his " dear , " and his " own , " and " his life , " and his " Keren , " till , had ' t not been for my lass 's coming back to life , I would ' a ' struck him on th ' mouth for a-speaking so unto her , and he th ' husband o ' another woman . But no sooner opes she her eyes than he hath both her hands hid in one o ' his , and close against his breast , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chrisom child , and her big eyes wide on his , and he saith to her , " Lass ! lass ! " saith he , " I ha ' come to marry thee , an thou wilt have me , " quoth he . " I ha ' come to marry thee ; and may God bless thee for saving th ' child ! " Then did I understand ; but she saith , with her great eyes not moving  --  saith she  --  only one word  --  " Ruth ? " saith she , even so , once , low like that  --  " Ruth ? " " Ay , lass , I know , " he saith unto her . " I know , " he saith . " But all 's well with Ruth . Ruth is in heaven . " Then saith she , while a light leaps out o ' her tearful eyes , like as when the sun doth shine suddenly through April rain  --  saith she , as she were breathing her life into th ' words , " Methinks I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how that she meant that to be lying in th ' arms o ' him she loved , after all those weary years , was like being in heaven ; but he questions her . " How , lass ? " saith he . " Where dost thou think thou art ? Thou art in thy true love 's arms , " saith he . " Ay , there is heaven , " she saith . And I stole away to get th ' babe some kickshaws i ' th ' village , that they twain might be alone together . Well , well , all that was two year ago , comrade  --  two year ago ; and now that lass o ' mine hath a babe o ' her own , and as valiant a rogue as ever bellowed . Thou must come and sup with us to-night . Na , na , I 'll take no refusal  --  dost hear ? I will not . And a word o ' persuasion i ' thy ear , comrade : Mistress Lemon hath been dead this twelvemonth , comrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's well . And thou shalt hear that lass o ' mine troll thee " Jog on , jog on , " and " Mistress mine , where art thou roaming ? " and " Listen , Robin , while I woo . " Come , comrade , come . But stay ; let 's crack another drink together ere we go . Joel ! What there ! Joel , I say ! Another quart o ' sack for Master Turnip ! NURSE CRUMPET TELLS THE STORY .

Nurse Crumpet.  --  Nay , now , Lady Dorothy , why wilt thou be at the pains o ' such a clamoring ? Sure thou hast heard that old tale o'er a hundred times ; and thou too , my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old nurse with this seeming eagerness ? Go to ! I say thou canst not in truth want to hear me drone o'er that ancient narrative . Well , then , an I must , I must . Soft !

And thou , my lord , come closer to my side , lest the draught from the bay-window smite thee that thou howlest o ' th ' morrow with a crick i ' thy neck . Well , well , be patient . All in time , in time . Soft , now ! Ye both mind that I was but a little lass when thy grandmother , the Lady Elizabeth Lennox , did take me to train as her maid-in-waiting . I was just turned sixteen that Martlemas , and not a fair-sized wench for my years either . Would ye believe ? I could set my two thumbs together at my backbone in those days , and my ring-fingers would all but kiss too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers would be but ill satisfied lovers under those conditions nowadays . Eh , Dolly ? Lady Dorothy.  --  Hold thy tongue for an unmannerly lad , Humphrey . Do not thou heed him , nurse , but go on with thy story . Nurse Crumpet.  --  For all thy laughter , my lord , I 'd a waist my garter would bind in those days , and was as light on my toes as those flames that dance i ' th ' chimney . Lord ! Lord ! how well I mind me o ' th ' first time that e'er I clapt eyes on Jock Crumpet ! I was speeding home with a jug o ' water from the spring , and what with his staring as he stood at the road-side to let me pass , and what with a root i ' th ' way , I all but lost my footing . Yet did I swing round alone , holding fast my jug , and ne'er one blessed drop o ' water spilled I , for all my tripping . " By'r lay'kin ! " quoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a May wind , and as I live I will dance the Barley Break with thee this harvesting or I will dance with none ! " And i ' faith a was as good as his word , for by hook or by crook , and much scheming and planning , and bringing o ' gewgaws to my mother , and a present o ' a fine yearling to my father , that harvesting did I dance the Barley Break with Jock Crumpet . And a was a feather-man in a round reel . Well , ' t was the year o ' my meeting with Jock , thou mindst . ( And a cold winter that was  --  Christ save us ! There be ne'er such winters nowadays . This night is as a summer noon i ' th ' comparison . ) ' T was the year o ' my first meeting with Jock , and my lady , your grandmother , sent for me to the castle , to be her waiting-maid . Lord ! ' t was a troublous time ! What with joy at my good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fain to smile with one corner o ' my mouth and look grievously with the other , like a zany at a village fair . And Jock , he would not that I went , for that he could not see me , or consort wi ' me so often : Jock was aye honey-combed wi ' th ' thing ye call " sentiment . " A would grin on a flower I had wov'n in my locks by th ' hour together . And ' t is my belief a could a spun him a warm doublet out o ' the odds and ends o ' ribbon and what not he had filched from me when my eyes were elsewhere . And Jock  --  but ' t is neither here nor there o ' Jock . In those days thy grandmother had only one child , a little lass , the Lady Patience . And ne'er was man or maid worse named ; for to call such a flibbertigibbet " Patience " were as though one should name a frisksome colt " Slumber , " or christen a spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T was patience in truth a body had need of , who was thrown at all with her little ladyship . But there was ne'er so beautiful a maiden born in all the broad land of England ; nor will be again  --  not though London Tower be standing when the last trump sounds . Meseemed she was an elf-sprite , so tiny was she ; and her face like a fair flower , so fresh and pure . Her hair was shed about her face like sunlight on thistle-down , and her eyes made a shining behind it , like the big blue gems in her mother 's jewel-box . When she laughed , it was as water falling into water from a short height , with ripples , and little murmurs , and a clear tinkling sound . But she was ne'er more at rest than the leaves on an aspen-tree . Hither and thither would she flit , this way and that , up and down , round and round , backward and forward , about and about . I ' faith , ofttimes would I be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere I had been at the castle a day , she took so mighty a fancy to me , that naught would do but she must have me for her maid ; and so my lady , who ( God pardon my boldness ! ) did utterly spoil her in all things , gave me unto her as a nurse-maid.  --  But sure ye are a-weary o ' this old tale ! Lady Dorothy and Lord Humphrey in a breath.  --  Nay , go on , go on . Nurse Crumpet.  --  Well , well , o ' all the story-loving bairns ! But I must invent me a new history for the next time o ' telling . Lord Humphrey.  --  Nay , that thou shalt not . We will ne'er like any as well as we like this one . So despatch . Nurse Crumpet.  --  But my lady had also an adopted daughter , a niece o ' my lord 's  --  one Mistress Marian Every  --  and she walked beside the little Lady Patience as night might walk beside day , for she was as brown o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cloud at even-tide , dark , but of no certain color , albeit as soft as ravelled silk , and marvellous hard to comb on account o ' its fineness . Mistress Marian was full head and shoulders taller than her cousin , the Lady Patience , and she could lift her aloft in her arms , and swing her from side to side , as a supple bough swings a bird . And her eyes were dark , and cool to gaze into , like a pool o ' clear water o'er autumn leaves , and sometimes there were glints o ' light in them , like the spikes i ' th ' evening-star when thou dost gaze steadily upon it . Black and white were not more different than were they , and they resembled even less in mind than they did in body . When Lady Patience waxed wroth , her cheeks burned like two coals , and thou couldst hear her little teeth grinding together , like pebbles squeezed i ' th ' palm o ' thy hand ; but when Mistress Marian was an-angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was whiter than a lamb at the shearing , and her lips like white threads . Then would the light shoot and spin in her eyes , and her nostrils suck in and out , like those of a fretful horse . And she was fierce after the manner of a man rather than of a maid . Moreo'er , she was full a year younger than the Lady Patience ; but she looked it not ; rather did her ladyship look full two years younger than Mistress Marian . And I loved them both , and tried as a Christian not to prefer one before the other ; but what with my lady 's stealings of her arms about my neck as I sat at my stitchery , and popping of comfits in my pocket when I would be otherwise engaged , and teasings , and ticklings , and sundry other pretty witcheries which I do not at this day recall , I was fairly cozened into loving her the best . ( Honey , I charge thee hold my fan betwixt thee and the fire . ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly to me as heart could wish , and every night did she thank me i ' th ' prettiest fashion , when I had combed and unpinned her for the night ; but , Lord ! I had much ado to get Lady Patience combed or unpinned at all ! First would she jump with both knees upon mine , and hug my very breath away ; then , when I had at last coaxed her to get down , first she would perch on one leg and then o ' the other , and then be a-twisting her head now over this shoulder , now over that , to see how I came on with the unpinning , that it was with a prayer to God that I finally set her night-gown over her shoulders , and led her to bed . As for her prayers  --  Jesu aid me and pardon her !  --  ' t was a matter of hours to get her to say " Our Father " straight through , what with her vowing that she wished not bread every day , and how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could ne'er draw the difference between trespasses and trespassers into her pretty pate ) , neither would she ; and how she did not believe God would lead her into temptation at any time , but that it was the Devil ; and how it must anger God even to think of such doings on His part  --  what , I say , with all this , methought sometimes it would be cock-crow ere I got her safely to sleep . And all this time Mistress Marian would be lying as quiet as any mouse , with her big plait of hair between her fingers , for so she always slept , with her hair fast in her hands , as though she loved its beauty ; and in truth it was the one great beauty she had , for my little lady put her out with her glitter as the sunlight doth extinguish a morning moon . Now I had been at the castle scarce two months when one day it chances that I hear my lady a-telling o ' my lord how as her brother , Lord Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her care until he should come of age . And on that Tuesday the little lord set foot in the castle ; and my lady was down at the door-way to meet him , in a new velvet gown , with her wimple sewn in fine pearls , and my lord with her ; but my two nurslings waxed shy at the last minute , and would not come down , but leaned and peered through the posts o ' the stair-rail , and my little lady let fall one o ' her shoes in her eagerness to glimpse at her new cousin . And straightway ran the lad and lifted the wee shoe , and looked upward , laughing , and my lord and lady having retired into the dining-hall , to see that some cold viands were in readiness ( it being then near to nightfall , though not yet supper hour ) .  --  " Ho ! thou little cinder witch , " cried he ; " I am the prince that has found thy shoe , and when I shall have found thee , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but that I will kiss thee too ! " With that , he ran up the stair-way , two and three steps at a leap . And I followed , for I knew not what would happen an he claimed his kiss as he had threatened ( knowing as did I , that in verity my lady 's shoe would a been a tight fit for her temper ) . But when he was arrived at the top , lo ! they had both fled , neither had they left so much as a ribbon behind them . Then the lad laughed again , as pleasant a laugh as e'er I heard in all my days , and quoth he , " I would be but a poor prince an I had not to search for my little princess . " So off he starts , and I after him , up and down corridors , in at half-open doors , out upon balconies , hither and thither , after the manner o ' my little lady on her most unquiet days , till at last , for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction o ' the great nursery . There , catching sight o ' a little red petticoat , he enters , where stand my truant elves confessed , Mistress Marian frowning and biting o ' her dark hair , but my little lady like to stifle , with both hands over her mouth to hide her smiles , and her blue eyes dancing a very Barley Break o ' mirth among the yellow sheaves o ' her tresses . Then there was much parley o'er the fitting o ' the shoe , as both damsels did straightway sit down upon their feet , neither for a long time would they move an eyelash , till his lordship , with a twink o ' his eye at me , did suggest corns and bunions as a reason for their ' havior  --  and , Lord ! then ' t was pretty to mark how like little chicks beneath their dam 's feathers , first one little foot and then the other did steal out from the rich lace o ' their petticoats . And ere one could cry " Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my little lady 's wee foot , and had kissed her right heartily . Moreo'er , what I did most marvel at , was that she neither cuffed nor sought to cuff him , but dropt down her head until her hair made a veil before her face , and moved that foot whereon he had set her shoe , gently back and forth as though the leather was stiff to her ankle , and I saw that she looked at it from under her heavy hair . But Mistress Marian still held aloof , and chewed upon her dark locks like a heifer on its cud . And her eyes were every whit as dark and solemn as a very cow 's . Then the young lord laughed again , and cried out , " Ha ! the ox-eyed June ! " or some such apery , and went and kneeled before her in mock fashion , as before a queen , and quoth he , " Fair goddess " ( for ' t was afterwards explained to me what manner of being was a goddess , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess , " quoth he , " show me how I may dispel thy wrath . " And still she scowled on him , but spoke no word . And he continued , and said , " I prithee , fair lady , cast but one smile upon thy humble knight " ( thou mind'st their pretty foolery has stuck i ' my old pate unto this day ) . Then she answered and saith , " Thou silly lad , how can I be a goddess and a lady both in one ? Thou hast not even enough wit to make a good fool . So ! " ( for Mistress Marian had a sharp tongue at times ) . But he was not so much as ruffled , and laughed even again , most heartily . And he said , " I do perceive that thou art not fashioned either as goddess or lady , therefore be my comrade , and we will fight together for the weal o ' yon fairy princess . " All at once she laughed too , and yielded him her hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " He said , " My name is Ernle ; and I like thee too ; therefore , I pray thee , tell me thine . " So she told him , and my little lady sidling up , the three fell presently a-chattering like linnets at sunrise , and from that hour on I had no trouble with them . ' T was pretty to mark them at their fantasies . They were aye out-o ' - door save when ' t was rainy weather , and then methought the castle had scarce room enough for them . In all their games Mistress Marian was the little lord 's comrade , and wore a helmet o ' silvered wood , and carried a wooden sword silvered to match her head-gear , and the little lord was likewise apparelled . And he called her ever " Comrade , " and clapped her o ' th ' shoulder , as mankind will clap one the other when conversing . But my little lady , they both agreed , was a fairy princess ; and , Lord , Lord ! ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name the perilous ' scapes that did befall her . They fished her out of moats , they bore her from blazing castles , they did drag her from the maws o ' dragons and other wild beasts I know not how to name . Thrice was the little Lord of Radnor in dire straits at the claws o ' goblin creatures . Three times did his comrade rescue him by thwacking upon the chair which did represent the dreadful beast , till I was in sore dread there would be no mending of it , and me , mayhap , dismissed from the castle for carelessness . And always when ' t was all o'er , and the little princess in safety , I was called upon to act parson and wed my little lady to the little lord , while Mistress Marian leaned on her sword to witness the doings . One day , in their rovings through the park , they came by chance upon a door in the hill-side , but so o'ergrown with creeping vines that , had not the little lord stumbled upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day without discovery . Well , no sooner do they see the door than they must needs open it , spite o ' all my scolding , and peer within . ' T was but a darksome hole , after all  --  a kind o ' cave i ' th ' hill-side , which they did afterwards find out from thy grandfather was used in days gone by for concealing treasures in time of war . And indeed it seemed a safe place , for there were two rusty bolts as big as my arm , one o ' th ' inside and one o ' th ' outside , and the creeping things hid all . As thou mightst think , it grew to be their favorite coigne for playing their dragon and princess trickeries . I would sit with my stitchery on a fallen log in the sunshine , while they ran in and out o ' th ' grewsome hole . But in all their frolicking my little lady could ne'er abide the sight o ' their swords , and she pleaded ever for gentler games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to see doomsday ) they did crown her a queen , and then my lord would have it that she dubbed him her knight . She pleaded that prettily against it methought the veriest boor in Christendom would a given in to her , but my little lord was stanch . So they made her a throne o ' flowers , and when she was seated thereon , Mistress Marian handed her the great wooden sword , and my lord , kneeling , bade her strike him on the shoulder with the flat side o ' th ' sword , saying , " Rise , Sir Ernle , my knight for evermore ! " She got out the words as he bade her , but when ' t came to the stroke , what with her natural fright , and what with the sunlight on the silver , she brought down the heavy blade edgewise on the boy 's pate , laying wide quite a gash above his left eyebrow , so that the blood trickled down his cheek . When she saw that , meseemed all the blood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned whiter than her smock , and ran and got her arm about him and saith , o'er and o'er again , " Ernle ! Ernle ! I have killed thee ! " He laughed , to comfort her , and made light of it , and wetting his finger in the blood , drew a cross on his brow and said , " Nay , thou hast not killed me . And moreo'er , I am not only thy knight , but thy Red Cross Knight into the bargain , and thou my lady forever . See ! I will seal thee with my very blood ! " and ere she could draw back , he had set also a cross on her white brow . She shuddered and fell a-weeping , and drew her hand across her brow to wipe away the ugly stain ; and when she saw that she had but smeared it on her hand , she trembled more than ever , and it was not for some days that I could quiet her . I do but relate this story , to show in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , to continue  --  This could not last for aye , and when two more years were sped , his uncle sent the little lord to a place o ' learning ; and afterwards to travel to and fro upon the earth , after the manner of Satan in the Book of Job ( God forgive me ! but ' t has ever seemed like that to me ) . And we set not eyes on him for eight years . Now in that time , lo ! I was married , and my little lady and Mistress Marian in long kirtles , and their hair looped up upon their heads . Mistress Marian was yet full head and shoulders above my little lady , and her skin as brown as ever . But my little lady was as bright and slender as a sun-ray . They would speak to me sometimes of Lord Radnor , and how that great folks were saying great things of him , and how he was become a soldier and a marvellous person altogether ; but as the years went by they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes my little lady would pull down my head as I smoothed the bedclothes over her at night , and quoth she , " Nurse , dost think he will be much changed ? My hair hath not darkened much , hath it ? Dost think his curls will be different from what they were when he was a lad ? " And I would have to tell her " No " a dozen times ere she would let me go . But Mistress Marian said never a word . One day I learned of my lady how that Lord Radnor was to return the next week , and meseemed in truth the whole castle was waxed distraught . It is not in my power to tell o ' th ' doings , but suffice it to say , my lord did cozen them all , and come a full day ere he was expected . When he came , Mistress Marian was standing i ' th ' great door o ' th ' castle , in her hawking gown o ' green velure cloth laced all with silver cord ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawk , Beryl , on her fist . And she turned and beheld him . Ne'er did I see verier light in earth or sky , than flashed into her face as their eyes met . And he doffed his hat , and came up beside her on the step , and saith , with the old laugh , but gentler , " Well met , comrade . " Now when he called her " comrade , " ' t was as when Jock did call me " sweetheart " in the days o ' our wooing . She went red as the ribbon in his sleeves ; and when the falcon fretted and shook its bells , he did put out his hand and stroke it , and , lo ! it was still , and seemed to feel him as its master . And I wondered all this time where could be my little lady . To this day I have ne'er seen so handsome a man as the young lord . He was tall and straight as an oak , with curls the color of frost-touched oak-leaves i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink when men hold it aloft ere quaffing , and his whole countenance bright and eager , and narrow like that o ' a fox , but without a fox 's cunning . Then he seemed fashioned to run , and ride , and war , as doth become all men , whether of high or low estate . Then went I within to inquire after my little lady ; and Jock , who was become a footman i ' th ' castle , did tell me of how he had seen her set forth to walk i ' th ' park an hour gone . So straightway I went in search of her . I had gone some six hundred paces when , at a sudden turning , I came upon her , where she held a little urchin a-straddle of her big deer-hound " Courage . " The child gave chuckles o ' delight as he slipped from side to side , and the sun through the beech-leaves made their heads as like as two crown pieces . Even as I was about to lift up my voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick branches , and steps forth a little behind her , and stands watching her . And as he did stand there , behold , a look came o'er his face , that was stranger than any look I had e'er seen on th ' face of man or of woman , and his eyes were no more bright and eager , but deep and soft . Then she turned and went direct towards him unknowing . When she was beside him , still laughing and half out o ' breath with balancing o ' th ' heavy boy , he saith these two words , " My lady , " and methought there was a whole year 's love-making o ' ordinary men crammed into them . Quoth I to myself : " Ah , my little lord , so thou hast that trick with thee ! God keep my little ladies ! for if the tongue be a fire , how must it burn when such a wit doth wag it ! " And I determined in my heart that by some means I would warn my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards him for the sake o ' by-gone days . Mayhap , moreover , his comely face had something to do with it , for , i ' fecks , ne'er saw I a goodlier countenance on Roundhead or Cavalier . Now when my lady heard his voice at her ear , first gives she such a start as doth a mettlesome filly when a hare jumps out before it , then stock-still stands she , and her face whiter than a wind-flower , and her lips a-tremble as if to speak , but no word comes from them . He saith again , " My lady . " I saw by the moving of her lips that she fashioned the words " My God ! " but still she spoke not . And the child began to whimper and clutch at her kirtle , for she had loosened her hold of him , and he feared falling off of the big dog . So she put one arm about him to hold him , but her eyes were yet upon his lordship . Then he came and lifted her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doublet , as a white flower-leaf doth upon grass , and he saith to her , " Sweetheart , dost thou not know me ? " All at once , for what , God only knoweth , she fell a-weeping , and he had her in his arms . And being some two years a mother , my care was all for the poor little rogue on the deer-hound ; ' t was as much as I could do to hold back from running and snatching him in my arms to soothe his terror . Howbeit , ere that I could commit this madness , the frighted babe set up such a howl as only a man-child can utter , and my lady turned to him in great haste , and my lord also did set about comforting him . Then they walked slowly on , and my lord held the little lad on one side , and my lady coaxed him o ' th ' other . Ever and anon my lord would look from the babe to my lady , and then from my lady to the babe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , as sometimes a wind will just stir the leaves ere shaking them as with jollity . I followed cautiously at some distance , and by-and-by his lordship said , " How was it that thou didst not know me , coz ? Faith thou art shot up like a lily i ' th ' sun , but lilies are aye lilies , and leaving thee a lily , I find thee a lily still , though blooming on a taller stem . " And she answered him : " Yea , cousin , and oaks are aye oaks , though first they be saplings , then trees . And in truth I knew thee by thy voice ere I looked at thee ; but ' t was all so sudden , that i ' faith I was frightened at thee . " And he said , " But thou art glad to see me ? " And being busy with the child , she answered him without lifting her head , " Thou knowest that I am . " Then did he laugh a little , and saith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof , I pray thee . Wilt thou not give me the kiss o ' welcome after all these years ? " Now he had not offered to kiss Mistress Marian . Therefore I waited right curiously to see what my little lady would say unto his offer , and Jock having dinned it into my ears ever since our wedding-day , that all women were by nature eavesdroppers , I was of a mind to prove his theory for him ; so I not only listened with all my ears , but I looked with all my eyes . My lady waxed first ruddy , then like to milk , then ruddy again , and she reached out her hand to him across the hound . " In truth I will , cousin , " quoth she . He did take the little hand in his , putting down his other hand softly over it , as when one holds a frighted bird , and he looked at her as though he would pierce her lids with his gaze , for her eyes were down , and he saith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the kiss o ' an eternal welcome ; but methinks thou hast begged the question . I pleaded to receive a kiss rather than to bestow one . " And her face was like a bended rose . Then did he step round quickly beside her , and once more was the poor babe left in dire terror o ' his life , and he made up a piteous face , but the dog standing still , he fell to rattling its collar , and soon waxed merry with the jingle o ' th ' silver . So I looked again at my lady and Lord Radnor . He had taken her about her waist with one arm , and with the other hand he lifted gently upward her fair face , as doth a gardener a rain-beaten flower , while his eyes looked down into hers . And slowly , slowly , almost as rose-leaves unfurl i ' th ' sun , her white lids curled upward , and her blue eyes peered softly from her yellow locks like corn-flowers through ripe corn , there being a tear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' real corn-flowers . And , to be the more like nature , there ran big waves throughout her loosened tresses , like as when the wind doth steal across a field o ' grain on summer noons . Then he bended down his tall head , and their lips met . God alone knows what their first words would a been , for ere the kiss was well ended , down falls the poor little rogue off of the hound 's back , and lifts up his voice loud enow to be heard across the sea by the red men i ' the new continent . And my lady runs and lifts him in her arms . Lord ! such an ado as they had a-comforting him ! First my lady , then my lord , then my lady again  --  and at last my lord tosses him to his shoulder , and saith he , " Ho ! thou little Jack Pudding ! an thou art not still o ' th ' instant , I 'll swear thou art a girl , an ' thou shalt ne'er have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live , the child stinted , and waxed as solemn as an owl ! Not another tear did he shed . My lord saith , " Now thou art a good lad , therefore thou shalt have my sword to play with . " And he unbinds it from his side , scabbard and all , and holds it while the urchin gets astride o't and pretends to ride . When my lord is tired o ' stooping , he lifts the child again to his shoulder , and so do they conduct him back to his mother , the gardener 's wife . From thence they return to the castle , and are met by my lord and lady and all the servants , while I haste me in by a side door to get on my Sunday kirtle and appear with the rest . As time wore on , the three were as much together as when he was a little lad and they lassies , and sometimes from a window , and sometimes from a quiet coigne in the great hall ( this very hall , ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitchery and mark them at their bright chatter . But often Mistress Marian would come and sit against my knee , even as thou art sitting now , sweetheart , and ask me to stroke her hair , and when she would coax Lord Ernle 's big blood-hound " Valor " to come and lie beside her , she would sit more quiet , almost as though she were asleep . And she would ask me ever and again , " Nurse , wherefore are women at any time born with dark hair , to mar ev'n such small comeliness as they might otherwise have ? " And always I would answer , " Tut ! thou knowest not of what thou speakest , my honey ; in the sight o ' some , dark hair is more comely than fair hair . " And always she would shake her head , and smile i ' th ' fashion o ' one who knows better than another . But she was a wondrous fair woman , in spite o ' her own thinking , and shaped like the brown metal wench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ye ? Why , even so ; so it was that his lordship called her when he did not call her " comrade . " Now young Sir Rowland Nasmyth ( him who was father to that Sir Rowland who wedded your sister the Lady Anne last Michaelmas , ye mind , dears ) , he would be often over for a day , or maybe several days , at the castle ; and all four would ride a-hawking , or ramble together , two by two , through the park ; or Lord Ernle and Sir Rowland would play at rackets , and i ' fecks ' t was a sight to see ' em at it ! One day my little lady and Sir Rowland ( who was a fair stripling , with curls near the color o ' Mistress Marian 's , and eyes the tinting o ' the far sea on a rainy day ) did wander off together , and Mistress Marian and my lord were left alone , seated on a rude bench under one o ' th ' great beech-trees that flank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either knee , and did let his racket swing back and forth between them , and sat looking down on it . Mistress Marian 's gaze was upon him , but her big hat made so deep a shadow o'er her eyes withal that I could not note them clearly . So stayed they for some moments . Then all in a breath did Lord Ernle start erect and push back his heavy locks and speak . " Comrade , " saith he , " wilt thou call me an ass for my pains , I wonder , an I tell thee o ' something that is troubling me sorely ? " She , having in no wise moved from her first position , and her eyes still in shadow , saith , " I pray thee say on , Ernle , for such words as thou hast just spoken to me are idle . " And he leaned forward and took one of her long brown hands in his , but ' t was different from the way in which he had ta'en my little lady 's hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for thou hast e'er been my true and loyal comrade , Marian  --  sweet comrade-cousin  --  this is the matter that doth eat my heart . Dost think there is aught between Patience and that young coxcomb ? " There came a red mark all across her brow , as though he had smitten her , for with her sudden movement her hat had fallen upon the ground at her feet . And she put up her hand to her side as if in pain , but snatched it back quickly . And for one heart-beat she shut her eyes . My lord , who had stooped forward to lift her hat , saw none o ' this , and when the hat was again upon her brow and its shadow over her face , she seemed the same as ever . But I knew the shaft was in her heart , and my heart seemed to feel it , for I loved her dearly . When he could wait no longer , he said , " Well , comrade ? " And she spoke , for from the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as brave as any Cavalier that ever swung sword for the King , and she said , " Well indeed , cousin , for thee . " He said , " How dost thou mean for me ? " Then stooped she and gathered a handful of grass , and held it aloft and opened her hand , palm downward , that the falling blades were blown this way and that by the wind . " I mean , " quoth she , " that Rowland Nasmyth is no more to Patience than  --  I am to thee . " And she laughed a little . He came closer to her , and laid his arm about her shoulders , drawing her to him , and he said , " Nay , thou knowest how dear thou art to me , comrade ; but thou meanest in different wise  --  is't so ? " She said , " Yea ; but call me Marian to-day . It is to my whim . " He answered , " Dear Marian , " and would have kissed her cheek , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By'r lay'kin ! there was a honey-bee tangled in my locks . " And when he had sought for the bee to kill it with his hat , but could not find it , they did seat themselves again , he laughing and saying that " the bee was a bee o ' much discretion and wondrous good taste . " That night when I crept to my little ladies to see that all was quiet , I , pausing in the door-way , did note them as they lay  --  my little lady with her head on Mistress Marian 's breast , and a smile on her lips , and Mistress Marian with her arms wrapped close about her , and her dark hair swept out over the pillow , and thence to the floor , like a stream o ' water that reflects a black cloud , but her eyes wide open , looking straight forward , as though at a ghost . And I stole off and sobbed myself to sleep , but not before I had awakened Jock , who did grunt , after the uncourteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow as though ' t had been an anvil , and in turning over , twist the bedclothes half off of me , so that what with the cold ( it being then the fall o ' th ' year ) , and what with my distress , I slept but uneasily . And the next thing I knew o ' th ' matter , there was a wedding , and my little lady wedded to Lord Ernle , and Mistress Marian her bridemaid . Surely if the good God e'er sent happiness on earth , He did send it to my little lady and to his lordship . ' T was at this time that Sir Rowland asked Mistress Marian to be his spouse . And ' t was even i ' th ' same spot where Lord Ernle had discovered his love for my little lady , that he asked her . Again it was as though some one had smitten her  --  her face deadly white and the red line across her brow . She put out one hand to keep him from her , and let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowland , I love thee well , but no man will ever call me wife . " He said , " Is this the end ? " She said , " Though we should both live to see the last day , it is the end . " Then he went , with his head bowed down . And when he was gone , for the first time in all her life she wept aloud . * * * * * Some time passed , and matters waxed ever hotter and hotter ' twixt Cavaliers and Roundheads , till one night there rode up a man to the castle gate with papers for Lord Ernle , and the long and the short o't was this : His lordship was ordered to ride forth to war , and my little lady only three months his wife . Now when this blow fell upon them they were all at meat in this very hall , for ofttimes in cold weather they dined here , even as thy father and mother do now , on account o ' th ' greater warmth . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to his feet , saying , " Where is the man who brought these papers ? " Jock answered him , " He is gone , my lord . " Then snatching up a flagon of wine that was near at hand , he drank more than half that was in it . And again he turned over the papers in his hand . But all they , my little lady , and Mistress Marian , and your grandfather and grandmother , seemed turned to stone . All at once my little lady started up as from a spell , and went and got her arms about him , as in years gone by when she had hurt him with his own mock sword , and she cried out , " What is it ? what is it ? " Anon came Mistress Marian to his other side , and looked over his shoulder , while he stood between them like one bewitched , and whiter than a man just dead . When Mistress Marian noted the contents o ' th ' papers , up went her hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she caught at his arm to stay herself . He turned from his wife to her as though for help , saying , " Tell her , tell her , comrade . " And he sank into a chair near by , and dropped down his head into his hand . Lord ! Lord ! that was a fearful night ! When they made my little lady to understand , she set up one cry after another , each loud enough to pierce the very floor of heaven . Ne'er since have I heard a woman utter such cries as those . And no one but Mistress Marian could in any wise appease her , for she would not have my lord come unto her , but drove him away with waving of her hands , saying , " Thou dost not love me , but the King ! thou dost not love me , but the King ! " And when Mistress Marian sought to reason with her , ' t was even the same . Naught could she do but sit and hold her , and comfort her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young babes . By-and-by she was calmer , and asked to see her lord . So Mistress Marian went out , but I remained on a low stool at the bed 's foot . Lord Ernle entered , and she crept into his arms like a fawn into the hollow of a rock when the hail is falling . And they clung to each other in silence . Presently he saith , " Darling , darling , that I should have brought thee to grief ! " She answered , " Nay , not thou , but God . O love , dost truly think that God is aye a good God ? " And he hushed and soothed her even more tenderly than did Mistress Marian . Afterwhile she saith , almost in a whisper , " But thou needst not go ? " He said , " Darling , how dost thou mean ? " And she whispered more low and said , " I will go with thee to the new continent to-morrow , and there we can live the rest o ' our days in peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilder than ever : " Ernle ! Ernle ! take me ! I will go with thee ! I will leave father , and mother , and home , and country , and friends , and King for thee ! Only go not to war ! go not to war ! " He said but two words back of his teeth , " I must ! " and then again , " I must ! " But when he looked at her for answer , lo ! she had swooned away . He was to set forth in two days after the morrow ; and on the morning of that day , behold ! we could not believe our own eyes for astonishment when we saw the Lady Patience step quietly forth , composed and gentle , though very pale . She saith good-morrow to every one , and after a while she doth slip her arm through her husband 's arm , and saith she , " Come for a walk , Ernle ; I have much to say to thee . " So they started forth together . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little distance . As they walked she besought him again that he would take her and set sail for the new continent . And when again he told her how that it could not be , she fell down upon her knees before him , and clasped him with her arms , and she said , " If thou dost not love me , let me be the first to die by thy sword . Slay me , as I kneel , for the love I bear thee . " He said , " Patience , Patience , thou wilt break mine heart . " And she , still kneeling , did cry out with a wild voice , " They lied who named me , for in an ill hour was I born , and I have not patience to support it ! I thought that thou didst love me , and lo ! thou lovest the husband of another woman more than thou lovest me ! " He bent to lift her up , groaning , but she would not ; whereat he trembled from head to foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tree when the shaft is smitten by lightning . And she cried out again , and said , " As there is a God in heaven , thou dost not love me , an thou canst go to war and leave me to die o ' grief . " Then , as though ' t was torn from him , he burst forth , " Now as there is a God , thou dost not love me , to torture me thus ! " And all at once she was quiet . So he stooped and lifted her , and called her his " bride , " and his " wife , " and his " darling , " and his " heart 's blood , " and more wild , fond , foolish names than at this day I can remember . ' T was near sundown , and that night he was to ride . Over against the dark jags o ' th ' hills there ran a narrow streak of light , like a golden ribbon . And the brown clouds above and below it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it as a fillet did seek to bind . But they twain walked ever on , till by-and-by they neared that cave o ' which I did tell ye . As they came in front o't my lady turned , and smiling piteously , " Ernle , " saith she , " wilt thou go with me into the cave and kiss me there , that when thou art gone I may come hither and think o ' thee ? " And he said , " Oh , my heart ! what would I not for thee ? " And he kissed her again and again . Presently she said , " Do not think me foolish , but wilt thou enter first ?  --  it is so dark . " And she stood in the door-way , with her hand on the door , while he entered . He said , " There is nothing here , sweetheart , but a monstrous damp odor . " And she answered , " Nay , but go to the very end ; there may be toads ; and when thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited with her hand on the door . He called to her , " There is nothing , love . Wait until I return to thee . " But , ere he had ceased speaking , she clapped to the door with all her might , and did push forward the great iron bolt , so that he was a prisoner in the cave ; I being rooted to the ground with astonishment , as fast as was ever the oak-tree under which I stood . At first he thought ' t was but one o ' her pretty trickeries , and I heard his gay laugh as he came to the shut door , and he called out , and said , " So , sweetheart , I am in truth a prisoner o ' war ; but art thou not an unmerciful general to confine the captured in so rheumatic a cavern ? " She sat down and leaned her head against the door , but said not a word . And he spoke again , saying , " Darling , I pray thee waste not what little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; and again he spake , and his voice began to be sorrowful . " Oh , my wife , " he said , " canst thou jest at such a time ? " At last she answered him , saying , " I jest not . " His voice changed somewhat , and he said , " What dost thou , then ? " She answered , " I keep what is mine . Where my forefathers did hide their treasure , there hide I mine . " He said , in a loud voice , " God will not suffer it . " Then fell a silence between them . But by-and-by he spoke again . " Darling , " he saith , " surely thou dost not mean to do this thing ? " And she saith , like a child when ' t is naughty , and knoweth well that it is , but likes not to say so , " What thing ? " He answered , " Thou canst not truly mean to shut me here to bring dishonor upon me , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so do all men say , and truly think ) . She said , " Thy life is more to me than thy honor . " And he groaned aloud , crying , " Oh God ! that I have lived to hear thee say it ! " and again there fell a silence , save for the whispering of the night in the trees above us and the creeping of small creatures through the dry grass . ' T was almost curfew-time , and there was one star in the black front o ' th ' night , like the star on the forehead of a black stallion . When he spake again his voice was very fierce , and he saith , " Patience , I do command thee to release me . " But she spake never a word . And again he said , " Better let me out to love thee , than keep me here until I hate thee . " She shivered , leaning against the door , until the big bolt rattled in its braces . And he said yet again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here to sully my good name , and that of thy father and mother , who have been to me even as my own flesh and blood , I will never live with thee again as man with wife , but will go forth into the New World to live and to die with thy handmaid dishonor ! " And she was silent . Again he spoke , and lifted up his voice in a cry exceeding sorrowful and bitter , so that my heart froze to hear it . " Woman ! woman ! was it for this I gave thee my fair fame to cherish ? Or was it for this that I put my name into thy keeping ? Oh , child , listen while there is yet time ! Wilt thou with thy own hands take his manhood from thy husband to drag it through the mire ? Patience , as I have shared thy childhood , as I have loved and cherished thy girlhood , as I have held thee in my arms as bride and wife , give me back my honor while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ! " And I heard him sobbing like a little lad . At that sound she put both hands over her ears , and started to her feet , looking from right to left like a hunted thing , and I could bear it no longer , but leaped forward and fell on my knees before her , and grasped her kirtle with both hands . I could scarce speak for tears , but with all the strength that was in me did I plead with her to draw back the bolt , but she would not . Now to this day when I do think of the fool that I was , not to run without her knowledge and bring the old lord , thy grandfather , or bide my time and unbar the door when she had gone , it seems as though I must hate myself for evermore . But as I pleaded with her , all at once there was something cold against my throat , and I seemed to know that ' t was a dagger , and the steel cowed me , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither spoke I a word more . Her face was over me , like a white flower in the purple dusk , but her eyes bright and terrible . And when she spoke , ' t was not my little lady 's voice , but rather the voice o ' a fiend . And she said , " Swear that thou sayest nothing of all this to man , or to woman , or to child , else will I kill thee as thou kneelest . " And I knew that for the time she was mad , and would kill me even as she had said , did I not swear . So I did take that fearful oath , coward as I was , and to this day am I a craven when I think on ' t . When I had sworn , she turned from me as though there were no such woman in all the earth , and went once more to the door o ' th ' cave , and called his name  --  " Ernle ! " He answered straightway , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if thou dost not unbar the door o ' th ' instant , I will never hold speech with thee again , nor touch so much as the hem of thy garments , by the living God ! " She said , " I can not ! I can not ! But oh ! say not such dreadful words . We will be happy . ' T is for that I keep thee here . Speak to me ! Ernle ! Ernle ! Ernle ! Call me thy love once more ! Just once ! just once ! " But she might as well have plead at the door o ' a tomb for all the answer she got . Again and again she called him , but a dead man speaks no more than spoke her lord . And at last she sprang to her feet , and rushed away into the darkness towards the castle , and I after her . And when I was entered in by a side door , and had changed my apparel and gone forth to inquire after her , lo ! she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , and mother , and Mistress Marian , thought that he had ridden away and left her i ' th ' park , having said farewell to them ere he and my lady did set forth to walk . And they strove to comfort her . The morrow was scarce dawned when she was up and dressed , and stealing through the covert to the door o ' th ' cave . I followed her , for she heeded me no more , now that I had taken the oath , knowing that I would be torn in pieces ere I would betray my trust . When she was come to the door , she kneeled down and leaned her head against it , and called to him , with a voice so exquisite low , ' t was almost as though one should hear the spirit when it speaks within , and she saith , " Ernle  --  my love  --  my love . " And all was still as death . And she said , " Darling , feel with thy hands for the bread and wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' door as thou interest in . Two bottles o ' wine and some loaves o ' bread . " But he answered her neither by word or sighing . And she said , " Wouldst thou break my heart ? " Then , when she saw that he would not answer her , she cast herself face down along the ground , and tore up the grass with her hands , and pressed down her face into the damp earth . And after a while ( for th ' looks o't ) she rose and went back to the castle . At nightfall there rode a man to the castle gate with papers , wherein my Lord Falkland did question wherefore Lord Radnor had not answered the summons . And all they were amazed and looked at one another . The messenger said , moreover , " If that it can not be proven ere to-morrow night that the Lord Radnor hath been the victim o ' foul play , he will be branded as a deserter throughout the land . " Thy grandfather gave one cry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in me that I fell down as one dead . And when I had once more come to the possession o ' my wits , Jock did tell me as how ' t was already whispered in the village that the young lord had deserted the cause , and had set sail in secret for the New World . Upon this , I straightway swooned again . And when I was recovered enough to stand upon my feet and go forth from my chamber , behold ! there was a silence over all the house , as in a house where the best beloved has died in the night . Men scoured the country far and near , in search o ' th ' murdered body o ' th ' young lord . And ' t was now the evening o ' th ' third day . But my lady meant not to open the door until the morrow , for if she opened it ere then , she knew not but what matters might be righted , and her lord ride to the wars in spite o ' all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth and kneel at the door o ' th ' cave , and call to him in that beautiful , gentle voice , " Ernle ! Ernle ! my love ! my darling ! " And when he did not answer her , she ceased not , as on the day before , but went on : " To-morrow I will set thee free . As I live , thou shall be free to-morrow . An thou wilt but let me be near thee like thy dog , I will ask no more . Neither will I fret thee with my sorrow . Oh , love , I do beseech thee speak to me , whose only sin was in loving thee too dearly . Let the kisses that as a bride I have set upon thy lips plead with them that they speak to me . Oh , my heart ! oh , my husband , have pity ! If thou wilt never speak to me again , speak to me now . Say but my name , my silly , ill-bestowed name , ' Patience . ' Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call me what names thou wilt . In God 's name , Ernle ! In the name o ' her who was once thy wife ! " And as she knelt and pleaded as a woman with her God , behold ! there stepped forth from the coppice Mistress Marian . She stood there like a figure cut in snow , for her kirtle was all of white seme , and her hair was as a cloud fallen round about her . When she saw my lady she drew in her breath with a sharp sound , and set both hands against her bosom . And she bended forward from her loins and listened , but in none otherwise moved she . And my lady went on , " To-morrow I will set thee free  --  I do swear it . With the rising o ' th ' morrow 's sun thou shalt be free as air . Only speak to me now . Only speak to me now . Just once , Ernle  --  just once . " With one spring Mistress Marian was upon her , and had pinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and gazed into each other 's faces , with their throats stretched forward , as serpents stretch their throats ere springing upon each other . Mistress Marian spake first , and her voice was as a voice that I had never heard , and she said , " So this is the truth , then ? " My lady said no word , but her eyes were aflame . And Mistress Marian gazed on her for an instant more , then dashed her aside , and turned towards the cave . " Ernle , " she said , " take heart . I will set thee free  --  I , Marian ! " But ere her hand did touch the bolt , my lady was upon her like a little tiger , and she wound her hands in Mistress Marian 's thick tresses , and dragged her backward . And they rolled over and over on the ground , even as do men when they fight , saying no word from first to last . The horror of it smote me that I fell down upon my knees and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistress Marian . And had not my lady been strong with despair , Mistress Marian could ' a ' mastered her o ' th ' instant . But she fought like a she-wolf brought to bay , with teeth and talons too , and ' t was almost as though two of a size had fought there . Howbeit , with a sudden move , Mistress Marian flung my lady down , and set her knee upon her , and held her , and looked from side to side , as though at a loss , and my lady 's strength was fast failing . When I saw that , I could bide still no longer , but ran forward , crying to Mistress Marian to be gentle with her . She answered but these words , " Nurse , take off my girdle and bind thy lady 's hands with it . " And there was that in her voice I dared not disobey . So I bound my lady 's hands , she saying never a word , and when the girdle was fast knotted , Mistress Marian helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a care o ' her , turned and drew back the bolt from the door o ' the cave . The last light o ' the sun fell like a golden lance across the threshold , and across my lord as he lay there , face down , with his hands against the sill o ' th ' door . And she stooped down over him , saying , " He hath fainted for lack o ' food , " but I knew that there was both wine and bread i ' th ' cave . And she called his name , but he was silent . And she called him again and again . And at last she bade me come to her side , and when we had turned him upon his side so that his face was towards us , behold , he was dead . But Mistress Marian saith again , " He hath swooned away . " And she put her hand upon his brow , but no sooner did she touch it than she cried out at its coldness , and shook the dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! thou art free ! Wake , man ! thou art free ! " I said , " Mistress , mistress , for love of God ! Dost thou not see that neither thou nor any other can wake him more ? " Thereat she fell back upon her knees , leaning upon one arm . And she said , " Dost thou mean  --  " I bowed down mine head , for I could not meet her eyes . And she fell upon his body , and stirred no more , so that when they came to bear the poor young lord to the castle , they did bear her also . And for some hours we thought her dead . Now when my lady saw them how they lay there , and the sunlight red upon them like to blood , she came and kneeled down in front o ' me , and lifted up her poor fettered hands meekly , like a little child . And she said , " Nurse , I pray you tell me what it doth mean , for methinks I am waxing foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man fell from the cliff . " I could not answer her for sobbing . And she said , " Do they sleep ? " And I nodded my head , for I could say no word . She said , " Pray you , do not wake them . An they sleep till the morrow , all will be well . " Suddenly her wits came back upon her with a rush , as doth a wind that hath seemed to be gone for aye . And she snapt the girdle on her wrists like as it had been a thread o ' silk , and ran and laid hold on him with her hands , and dragged him forth upon the grass . And she saith , " Ernle ! Ernle ! Ernle ! What ! wilt thou not answer me , now that thou art free ? See ! thou mayest ride to war . It is not yet too late . What there , nurse ! My lord 's charger ! Run ! run ! " Then leaped she to her feet with one cry that methought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heads . " Dead ! Oh God in heaven ! " So for an instant she stood , with her arms reached high above her head , and her eyes upon him as he lay at her feet , even as a flame doth poise for a breath ere sinking again upon the coals . But anon she dropped down beside him , and beat her forehead with the lower palms o ' her hands , and she saith , " Well didst thou sign me with thy blood ! well didst thou sign me with thy blood ! " Then all at once did she peep up at me over her shoulder with one o ' her winsome ways , and fell a-laughing softly . " Nurse , " saith she , " hath he not found a pretty way to punish me ? He feigns it well  --  by'r lay'kin  --  doth he not , nurse ? " And she rocked to and fro , as she knelt beside him , laughing softly to herself , and ever and again she would reach forth one little hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would touch a stray lock into place , and once she bent over and kissed him , laughing softly , and nodding to herself very wisely . And she would sit that way , and rock herself to and fro , and smile upon the ground , and laugh softly , until the very day that she did die . And the last words that she did ever say were , " Just once , Ernle  --  just once . " * * * * * ( Nurse Crumpet rises and stirs the fire , amid a heavy silence , broken only by the little Lady Dorothy 's sobs and the rushing of the wind outside the great hall . ) THE END . TONY , THE MAID . A Novelette . BY BLANCHE WILLIS HOWARD . Illustrated by CHARLES S. REINHART. 16mo , Cloth , $1 00 . " ' Tony , the Maid , ' is not only one of the best pieces of work Miss Howard has yet done , but it is one of the very best short stories of the year . Tony herself is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fiction ; and she is , moreover , the only good thing , which is neither superlatively beautiful nor emphatically a bore , or both , that has come out of the Canton of Lucerne since the days of William Tell . Even the insatiate archer , when he is not mythical , is a trifle wearing to the average mind , but Tony is never tiresome and always grand . " As a short story Miss Howard 's ' Tony , the Maid ' has but one fault . It is too short . There is not enough of Tony . She makes her exit too suddenly and too completely . It is consoling to know , however , that Miss Zschorcher is some day coming to America as Mrs. Eduard Maler . Perhaps Tony the Maid may figure as Tony the Matron and Tony the Mother .
