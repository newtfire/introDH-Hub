In August 1915 , a Catholic priest serving as a lowly stretcher-bearer with a French infantry regiment was cited for displaying " the greatest self-sacrifice and contempt for danger " during a ruinous battle . But there is no mention of the honor in the cheap school notebook in which , during the same week , the priest began keeping a diary " to force myself to think , to observe , to be precise . " <P> By the end of World War I , those knapsack-carried notebooks of Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin contained the essence of many innovative theories , including his central concept of human evolution progressing toward an " Omega point , " an ultimate unity in Christ . When elaborated upon in later writings , these ideas proved so unsettling that church officials forbade him to publish them . As a result , during his lifetime Teilhard was celebrated only as a paleontologist who worked on the Peking man discovery . It was not until after his death 20 years ago this week that his philosophical works ( among them : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he became a popular cult figure in theology . <P> Break a Shell . Teilhard 's diary remained unpublished even longer , partly because his Jesuit colleagues were embarrassed about his ecclesiastical candor ( e.g. , a complaint about the church 's " egoism , cultivated idleness , ridiculous self-satisfaction " ) . Only in 1971 did the Teilhard family agree to publication of the notebooks . The first of two volumes will appear in Paris next month . The intimate , unguarded diary , which fleshes out the previously released wartime essays and letters to his cousin , will be essential reading for Teilhard aficionados . <P> To Corporal Teilhard , the war was a " baptism in reality . " The theological musings in the diary amount to a rough draft of The Divine Milieu , the 1926-27 treatise ( finally published in 1957 ) in which Teilhard formally set out his view of God as a " center " who " fills the whole sphere " of creation . Despite his disclaimers , the church found this idea dangerously akin to pantheism , the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last day of July 1916 summarizes his lifelong attempt to reconcile Catholicism and modern science : " My mission = very humbly but ceaselessly to take part in sanctifying natural progress , evolution , by revealing ... its sacred end . " On the day after Christmas 1917 , he wrote : " We are going over a threshold in the history of dogma - we must break a shell , the shell of complacent belief in the possession of a universal explanation of the world . " <P> The diary reveals a striking view of sex , little discussed in his formal writings . A characteristically dense entry of Feb. 8 , 1916 stated : " Just as speech was born by the unexpected use of organs being bent to emit articulated sounds-but originally formed for different ends-so , perhaps the love-liaison with God on which the mystical body 's cohesion rests , is the fortuitous , secondary use of a passion-subjected temperament . " Put more directly in another passage , this meant that " for a man , God must be loved through woman by using her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
