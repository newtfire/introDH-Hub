It is not so much that Ennio Morricone has lost count . He just never kept one . By rough reckoning , he has upwards of 130 original scores for film and television to his credit . This total does not include his various chamber and orchestral compositions , nor does it tally all the musical arranging he did for records , radio and the theater . But whatever the vagaries of the composer 's archival arithmetic , there is no doubt that he has written scores for many films that count heavily in contemporary history . <P> In all these collaborations , in which Morricone reflects and expands on each director 's distinctive style , music and image are indivisibly wedded . Remember a movie , and you can hear its music too . There have been five for Bernardo Bertolucci , including the ravishing 1900 . Gillo Pontecorvo 's The Battle of Algiers and Burn ! , brimming with political conscience and passion . John Boorman 's Exorcist II : The Heretic , a witchy reverie of evil and redemption . Terrence Malick 's edgy elegy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the resonance of some dark folk ballad . And all Sergio Leone 's pop-folk epics , from A Fistful of Dollars to Once upon a Time in America , have had their mythic dimensions deepened by Morricone themes . The music and the filmmaking are reciprocal : each makes the other indelible . <P> Now , at 58 , Morricone has been nominated a second time for an Oscar ( the first was for Days of Heaven ) . His score for The Mission , a large-scale parable of clericalism and colonialism in 18th century South America , is one of the loveliest he has ever done . The composer concedes , " This music represents me nearly completely . " Says Leone : " It 's practically like a sung mass . " Morricone 's mother , who is 83 , has a slightly different perspective . " These Americans ! " she said when Morricone 's wife Maria called with the nomination news . " It is four or five years that they should have given him the Oscar ! Let 's hope that this is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not make the time for The Mission at all . After Director Roland Joffe screened the film for him , the composer announced that he would not do the music . " It was so beautiful without it , " he explains . " But everyone insisted and begged me to write . " Now , whenever Morricone suffers an occasional twinge of conscience about forsaking the concert hall for the soundstage , he overcomes it " with great ease by thinking of movies like The Mission . " <P> Morricone 's father was a trumpet player who performed jazz and opera and worked on movie scores . His son started to write music ( " dreadful " ) at the age of six . When he was twelve , his parents enrolled him in the Rome music conservatory , where he finished a four-year harmony course in six months . Morricone remembers that his professor , wary of wasting such a potential talent , told him sternly that " if I did not enroll in the composition course , I was an assassin . " He also taught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script is the pain that produces it . "
