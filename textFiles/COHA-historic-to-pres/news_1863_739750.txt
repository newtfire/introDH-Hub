Danger of Extravagant Estimates of the Late Victory . There is some danger that , after Lis has been driven from Pennsylvania , the Government , as well as large numbers of the public , will cheat themselves into the belief that the result is greater than it really is , and forget the vastness of the task which still remains to be accomplished . We have all been so scared by the invasion , and the consequences of any failure in resisting it have assumed such monstrous proportions in our eyes , that we shall be , probably , tempted to forget , after it is over , that just as the invasion was a means to an end , and not the end itself , so is our repulse of the invader . Lis came into Pennsylvania not simply for the purpose of harrying the North , but that by harrying the North he might coerce it into peace , and into an acknowledgment of the independence of the Confederacy . And so also we , in rising to resist him , have been seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the power which he serves . The battle of Gettysburgh has not been fought solely to save Baltimore and Philadelphia , but to crush the Confederacy , and it is highly necessary that through all our rejoicings over our successes this should be kept constantly in mind . People are apt , when they find an enterprise very much more difficult than they expected when beginning it , to narrow the circle of their desires as they proceed , and to sit down satisfied at last at a point far short of the original goal . This is especially true of ouch enterprises as war . It is generally begun in a flush of hope and confidence which hides all difficulties , and make the most extravagant longings of national pride seem reasonable ; but before one campaign is over , a large portion of the public is prepared for a peace which , six months previously they would have scouted as ignominious . Our own case has already afforded a striking illustration of the facility with which a nation may adapt its expectations to circumstances . We . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to be a thirty days ' campaign , and that we had only to arm a few hundred town meetings and march straight into Richmond . In May . 1861 , anybody who hinted that this was not possible would have been set down as a croaker . After Bull Run we reconciled ourselves to sitting down for a whole year , and patiently organizing an army , but were perfectly confident that the army , once organized , two or three months would bring the end . After the " Seven Days " we as patiently . organized another , and began to make up our minds for a long war . We have since then met with se reral tack of which has , in many eyes , made the ? consummation of our hopes recede further and further into " the Illimitable perspective . " Before the invasion of Pennsylvania , a good many people had become so moderate in their desires , that far from desiring to retain the South , they wished it in the bottom of the Red Sea . Since the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly scared , that they have banished from their hearts all loftier desires than that of seeing Las fairly back again on slave soil ; and comparing what has just happened with what we expected to happen when we began the war , will resign themselves to the conclusion that oar original aim is hopeless . Ii this brings increased apathy , or increased aversion to the sacrifices and exertions which the further prolongation of the struggle will certainly require , Dues object in invading will hate been answered just as effectually as if he had defeated MiADX . He came into the North to sicken the North of the war by bringing it home to our doors . This was the first of his aims , and whether he accomplish it by victories or defeats , makes to JEITZESON DArTS little difference . We must not , we repeat , look upon the invasion as a distinct episode of the war . It is part of the whole plan , and we must constantly remember that so is our resistance to it . We must bear in mind that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bring us so much nearer to the overthrow of the rebel Government . As compared to this the present safety of Northern homes and Northern fields , important as it no doubt . is , is after all but a trifling matter . We should recover in a few years from the heaviest exactions Las could inflict upon our greatest cities . But from the success of the Confederacy we should never recover . Its overthrow regards not simply ' this genera .. tion , bat countless generations to come . Whether we shall ( destroy it or not , is not a question simply of dollars and cents , nor even of pride , or prestige . The question is , which of two systems of Government , differing as regards the position they assign to the people , and the value they attach to manhood , and as to the great ideas of society , of government , and of human progress , which they recognize , wide as the soles asunder , shall prevail over a continent which in fifty years will contain a population of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to look upon MoAtoi 's victory as anything but one step more toward the annihilation of the Confederate organization . So it must be vigorously followed up on Southern soil .
