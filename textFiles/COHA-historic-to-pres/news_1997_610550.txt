When it comes to low-fat baking , there are no rules to follow , nothing to go by . Nothing , nada , rien , zilch . <p> So forget all that stuff you 've read in cookbooks or seen on food packages , like how you can use applesauce as a fat substitute in cakes . Or how you can reduce cholesterol by replacing each whole egg with two egg whites . Or how you can cut sugar simply by cutting sugar . Or how you should never , ever use lower-fat tub margarine for baking . <p> It 's just not that simple . Baking is a science , a chemical reaction that starts in a mixing bowl , and low-fat baking is even more complex . It 's the advanced course . <p> And we took it . We baked a sour cream chocolate chip coffeecake 23 times to see how low we could go . The idea was this : Take a standard high-fat recipe , replace the guilty ingredients and see what happens . Just what you might do at home ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> But instead of adapting the whole recipe at once , we fiddled with one ingredient at a time . We wanted to see the effect of each alteration , of those recommended " substitutions . " We knew we 'd make mistakes , but that was part of the point . Our goal was to reduce the fat and calories as much as possible but still end up with a moist and flavorful cake . <p> And what we learned was this : Low-fat baking is n't just a matter of replacing the naughty ingredients with their nutritionally correct counterparts . Sometimes doing that causes nasty structural problems , like a caved-in cake . In baking , all of the ingredients have a function , and when you change the amounts or properties of them , there 's no telling what can happen . <p> So it 's no wonder you can end up with a product you would n't feed to your pet snake . The important thing , we found out , is to make gradual rather than drastic changes , and to realize that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no single answer for every recipe , " says Susan G. Purdy , a cooking teacher and author of the new " Let Them Eat Cake : 140 Sinfully Rich Desserts  --  With a Fraction of the Fat " ( William Morrow , $ 25 ) . " People really want a quick fix , but as much as I know about it , I ca n't change a recipe once and have it be perfect . I count on making something a half dozen times , and I 've been doing this for six years . " <p> Purdy recalls one recipe , a poppy-seed cake in her last book , that she made 40 times before she got it right . To help her figure out the problem , Purdy even mailed test cakes from her home in northwestern Connecticut to Shirley Corriher , a food scientist and cooking teacher who lives in Atlanta . <p> Nancy Baggett , a local cookbook author whose most recent book is " Skinny Italian Cooking " ( Surrey Books , $ 12.95 ) , agrees that the attempt to " fool Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers like to make things seem simple , Baggett said she is wary of substitution lists in cookbooks . " To say you can make a gross substitution is generally wrong , wrong , wrong . " <p> Twenty-three cakes later , we agree . Here are the results of our transformation of the sour cream coffeecake , ingredient by ingredient . Keep in mind that just because something worked or flopped for this cake does n't mean the same will be true for one of your recipes . In some cases , we could n't find any explanation for the results . ( Slight variations in room or ingredient temperatures and in beating or cooking times  --  either alone or in combination  --  could have had an effect . ) And although there are no precise formulas , our findings will certainly give you some guidelines and hints . <p> After each round of baking , the winning substitute proceeded to the next level . For example , after Round 1 , in which nonfat yogurt was the better substitution for the full-fat sour cream , all the subsequent cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , each round included one cake made with the original version of the ingredient being substituted . For example , Round 1 included one cake made with the original sour cream . Round 2 contained a cake made with two eggs . These cakes provided a standard by which to judge the substitutions . <p> Nutrition information per serving of the original cake : 258 calories , 12 gm fat , 6 gm saturated fat , 49 mg cholesterol <p> Round 1 : THE SOUR CREAM <p> Original recipe called for 1 cup sour cream . <p> Substitutions tried : one cake with 1 cup nonfat yogurt , then a cake with 1 cup nonfat sour cream <p> Best : 1 cup nonfat yogurt <p> We liked this cake a lot . In fact , this one small change resulted in a reduction of calories , fat and saturated fat while making the cake actually taste better . That 's not likely to happen too often , but the lesson is this : Even changing one ingredient can make a difference in taste and nutrition . <p> Corriher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the success of the nonfat yogurt . " It has two things going for it , " she explained . For one , it 's fairly viscous and can hold and trap air bubbles well , an important element for leavening . For another , the nonfat yogurt probably added just the right amount of acidity for this particular recipe . ( Beware , however , because yogurt may make some cakes taste too acidic and be too watery for others . ) <p> Using the nonfat sour cream , on the other hand , produced a tasteless and gummy cake . Once again , Corriher was n't surprised . Nonfat sour cream contains maltodextrin , a fat substitute she described as " little ball bearing-like things that give you really rich mouthfeel . " But Corriher said she has found that the rich mouthfeel only stays intact when the nonfat sour cream is unheated . ( Doris Dougherty , a food scientist at A.E . Staley in Decatur , Ill. , a company that makes maltodextrin and other fat replacers , said maltodextrin can break down in " high-acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she doubted this was the case here . ) <p> Nutrition information per serving : With nonfat yogurt : 235 calories , 9 gm fat , 4 gm saturated fat , 42 mg cholesterol <p> Round 2 : THE EGGS <p> Original recipe called for 2 eggs . <p> Substitutions tried : first 4 egg whites , then 1 egg and 2 egg whites , then 1/2 cup Egg Beaters <p> Best : 1/2 cup Egg Beaters <p> The recommendation to substitute two egg whites for each whole egg is one of the most ubiquitous . But Baggett says she " disagrees with that rule completely . " <p> So do we . <p> The cake with four egg whites was dry , dry , dry . Egg whites absorb moisture , and more is not always better . That , apparently , is precisely what happened in this case . <p> But what could n't be explained was our preference for the Egg Beaters cake , which contained the same amount of egg whites as the cake with one whole egg and two whites , but nevertheless tasted less dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the egg substitute , 1/2 cup of Egg Beaters is equivalent to three egg whites . <p> We were stumped . So were the scientists at Fleischmann 's . <p> Nutrition information per serving : With nonfat yogurt and Egg Beaters : 229 calories , 9 gm fat , 4 gm saturated fat , 16 mg cholesterol <p> Round 3 : THE BUTTER <p> Original recipe called for 1/2 cup ( 1/4 pound ) butter . <p> Substitutions tried : 1/2 cup applesauce , then 1/2 cup regular stick margarine , then 1/2 cup lower-fat stick margarine , then 1/2 cup lower-fat tub margarine , then 1/2 cup canola oil , then 1/2 cup light butter <p> Best : 1/2 cup Fleischmann 's Lower Fat tub margarine <p> Of all the ingredients in a cake , the fat is probably the trickiest to tinker with . That 's because it performs so many functions in a baked good  --  it tenderizes , moisturizes , adds flakiness and carries flavors and aromas , as Purdy explains in her book . <p> As a result , if there 's one rule for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Purdy stresses . We certainly learned that when we replaced all the fat with applesauce . The result was a gummy , rubbery cake with a slick of moisture on top . And here 's why it happened : Fat helps prevent the formation of the wheat 's gluten , a mixture of proteins that give dough its tough , elastic quality . Gluten is good for bread but bad for a tender-crumbed cake . <p> As Harold McGee , who writes about food science , put it diplomatically , " The incongruity is n't pleasing . " <p> But the biggest surprise in this round was the success of the lower-fat tub margarine . All the other butter substitutions resulted in cakes with less flavor . This baffled practically everyone , including Fleischmann 's , which specifically and emphatically says not to use the product for baking . It contains too much water and not enough fat ( this can be a particular problem in cookies , which can spread into blobs ) . <p> As for our little experiment , " that it happened to work is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our results are n't " projectable to other recipes , " he said . <p> Nutrition information per serving : With nonfat yogurt , Egg Beaters and Fleischmann 's Lower Fat tub margarine : 198 calories , 5 gm fat , 0 gm saturated fat , 0 mg cholesterol <p> Round 4 : THE SUGAR <p> Original recipe called for 1 cup sugar . <p> Substitutions tried : 1 cup sugar , then 3/4 cup sugar , also 1/2 cup sugar <p> Best : 1 cup sugar <p> Here 's what we learned : When you reduce the fat , you ca n't substantially reduce the sugar . That 's because , like fat , sugar restricts gluten development , explains McGee . If you decrease both , you 're left with something texturally akin to a rubber band . <p> You may also be left with a sunken ship . That 's what happened when we tried to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup . In fact , even 3/4 cup was n't acceptable . Sugar aids the creaming and whipping of air into batters , as Purdy explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes failed to rise . <p> The most interesting revelation from this round was that sugar is n't there just for sweetness . Reduce the sugar , and you risk destroying the texture and the chemistry . <p> Nutrition information per serving : With nonfat yogurt , Egg Beaters , Fleischmann 's Lower Fat tub margarine and 1 cup sugar : 198 calories , 5 gm fat , 0 gm saturated fat , 0 mg cholesterol <p> Round 5 : THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS <p> Original recipe called for 1/3 cup chocolate chips . <p> Substitutions tried : 1/3 cup reduced-fat chocolate chips , then 2 1/2 tablespoons regular chocolate chips , then 2 1/2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips <p> Best : 2 1/2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips <p> " I wo n't touch any of that reduced-fat chocolate stuff , " says Alice Medrich , author of " Chocolate and the Art of Low-Fat Desserts " ( Warner , 1994 ) . " Do n't diminish the chocolate experience . " <p> That about sums up what we found . The reduced-fat chips added nothing to the cake , which needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , you can use less , Medrich added . Right on target . And we found the mini chips worked the best because in 2 1/2 tablespoons , there are more of them than in 2 1/2 tablespoons of regular chips . That means a greater dispersal and , thus , a better " chocolate experience .

To toast or not to toast . Those were the questions . <p> In this case , the answers were : Decrease the amount of nuts and keep them in pieces . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you miss the texture , " says Medrich . That 's what happened here . The finely ground nuts got lost in the batter . And the toasting was n't worth the trouble . <p> " You have to figure out what makes the biggest difference , " added Medrich . " It 's this constant juggle .

Purdy , award-winning cookbook author and low-fat-baking pro what she could do to improve our final reduced-fat cake . <p> Purdy thinks of a cake as a balancing act , so she changes all the ingredients at once , rather than one at a time . She looks at the fat first , reducing the amount by about a quarter . Then she 'll play around with the amount that remains , making up the amount with a combination of oil , applesauce and corn syrup , for example . Or maybe butter and something else . <p> For our cake , first she cut the 1/2 cup tub margarine ( equivalent to 8 tablespoons ) by a quarter . With the remaining 6 tablespoons , she suggested using a combination of 4 tablespoons butter ( for flavor and texture ) and 2 tablespoons corn syrup . Corn syrup replicates some of fat 's functions , such as retaining moisture and air when it 's whipped , Purdy explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use 1 whole egg and 1 egg white , instead of the Egg Beaters equivalent of 3 egg whites . Purdy says extra whites can get you " into trouble . " <p> Next she tackled the flour , first suggesting that we should have used bleached flour , which has less gluten-forming proteins than unbleached , and thus produces a more tender baked good . Even better would be cake flour , which contains even less of those toughening proteins , she said . It also absorbs less liquid , so slightly more is needed when trading it for regular flour . <p> Purdy agreed with the importance of keeping the sugar as is , adding that that 's why low-fat does n't usually mean low-calorie . Her only other suggestion was to double the amount of vanilla , to give it a flavor boost . <p> She left us with this : " It may not work . That 's the story of my life . You just do n't know . " <p> We tried it . We liked it . It worked . <p> SUSAN PURDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR THE FILLING : <p> 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon <p> 2 1/2 tablespoons walnut pieces <p> 2 1/2 tablespoons chocolate chips <p> FOR THE CAKE : <p> Nonstick vegetable oil spray <p> 2 1/4 cups cake flour <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder <p> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda <p> 1/2 teaspoon salt <p> 4 tablespoons butter <p> 1 cup sugar <p> 2 tablespoons corn syrup <p> 1 egg , beaten until foamy <p> 1 egg white , beaten until foamy <p> 1 cup nonfat yogurt <p> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract <p> For the filling : Combine the brown sugar , cinnamon , walnuts and chocolate chips . <p> For the cake : Spray a 9-inch tube pan with nonstick spray .
