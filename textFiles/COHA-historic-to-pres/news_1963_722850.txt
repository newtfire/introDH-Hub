As long as he lives , Nicholas Tomas will never forget what he . saw take place yesterday morning at the corner of Pulaski road and Elston avenue . Tomas , 28 , a service station attendant who lives at 1633 Julian st. , was driving south in Pulaski road when a swirl of money suddenly appeared in front of his car . " I 've never seen , anything like it , " said Xmas . " The money seemed to be flying all over , and there was so much of it that when it landed , the whole ' street turned green . " Truck Ahead Stops Tomas says everything happened in lightning fashion from this point on . A truck traveling In front of him slammed on its brakes . Two men leaped out and began stuffing handfuls of money into their pockets . A car drove up alongside of Tomas ' auto . Its brakes squealed and the driver dashed . in front of Tomas ' car to join in the scramble . Six persons waiting for a bus also plunged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting to cross the street , also raced to the ' spot . Tomas said that the scramble for the money was over so quickly that he did n't set a chance to join in . One Bill Remains When it was over , Tomas got out of his car and spoke briefly to Thomas Ryan , 39 , owner of the American Floor company , 4321 N. Pulaski rd . Neither could figure out where the money came from . One possible solution was that the money had fallen from an Armored . - Express corporation truck which was making a delivery to a currency exchange at 4308 Pulaski rd. at the same time . But the drivers ol the truck told Toe= and Ryan they were not missing any money .
