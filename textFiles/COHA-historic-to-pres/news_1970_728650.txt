A high Treasury official told Congress today that in his personal opinion the time had come to " give serious consideration " to some form of voluntary restraint on wages and prices . Murray L. Weidenbaum , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Affairs , thus joined those in and out of Government who back some form of " incomes policy . " This term covers a variety of devices , short of legislated mandatory wage-and-price controls , by which the Government tries to influence private behavior on wages and prices in an antiinflationary direction . Mr. Weidenbaum gave his views , under questioning , to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress . Although he declined to say what version he favored , he said , " Personally I think the time has come to give some serious consideration to an incomes policy . " Watson Testifies In a related development today , Thomas J. Watson Jr. , chairman of the board of the International Business Machines Corporation , urged that " the Administration give serious consideration to resorting at once to the guidelines approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of the Kennedy Administration . " Most of Mr. Watson 's testimony , given before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , was devoted to an appeal for an early withdrawal from Vietnam . He said he recognized that the wage-and-price guideline method " was not successful over the long-term period " // but said it could be helpful now . Mr. Weidenbaum 's statement came as the Administration was reportedly thrashing out a decision on the question of wages and prices in advance of President Nixon 's address on the economy . No date has been fixed for the speech , it is expected next week or the following week . Other Advocates Mr. Weidenbaum is not alone among officials of his rank within the Administration who believe some form of incomes policy should be tried . In addition , Arthur F. Burns , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , has openly advocated such an effort , without saying exactly what device he favors . No one in the Administration , as far as is known , favors mandatory controls . The President is strongly opposed to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner for 45 financial and business leaders . But he did not close the door to a voluntary appeal . Today 12 Democrats on the House Banking Committee introduced legislation giving the President standby authority to impose controls over wages , prices and rents at the level prevailing on May 25 . The legislation would be an amendment to a routine extension of the Defense Production Act . Hearings Scheduled While the sponsors represented a majority of the Democrats on the committee , they were far short of a majority of the whole committee . Hearings on the proposal will begin June 16 . One of the witnesses will be Robert V. Roosa , former Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs , who has advocated a six-month freeze on wages and prices . Mr. Weidenbaum 's statement on an incomes policy attracted attention because last month his chief , Treasury Secretary David M. Kennedy , reiterated the long-standing Administration view that no new control devices were " desirable or necessary . " Mr. Weidenbaum told reporters that he was giving his personal view and regarded himself as a loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue . Until now the standard Administration position has been that the successful policy of slowing the economy through fiscal and monetary restraint on total spending would gradually cure the inflation problem . However , officials have conceded that results have been slow in coming . Consumer prices are continuing to rise at an annual rate of about 6 per cent ? no worse than last year but no better , either . Negotiated wage settlements this year have been running 8 per cent and upward . There was further confirmation today of the continued sluggishness of the economy . The Commerce Department reported that manufacturers ' new orders declined in April while inventories rose by the largest amount so far this year . In addition , a compilation of " defense indicators " showed a continued decline in the various ' measures of defense spending and procurement in the first quarter of this year . Mr. Watson of I.B.M. , in his Senate testimony today , said the Vietnam war presented " a major obstacle " to the economic health of the nation and was threatening " irreparable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal from Southeast Asia " as soon as possible " because , he said , " we must end this tra  --  edy before it overwhelms us . " As long as the Vietnam involvement continues , Mr. Watson said , he sees little chance of fully curbing inflation or restoring the nation 's economic health . The war , he said , has been " the major factor which has turned our healthy economy into an unhealthy one . " The burden of Mr. Watson 's testimony was not on the economic effects of the war but on the " disaffectidn " and " demoralization " that he saw it causing among the nation 's youth . " The longer we continue , the more chaotic the nation will become , " he said . " The damage we have already seen will take decades to repair and , if we continue , I believe we will soon reach a point where much of the damage will be irreparable . " Mr. Watson , one of a series of witnesses that the Foreign Relations Committee has been hearing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " our actions in Vietnam are losing us valuable and traditional friends in the West .
