Governor Herter favors a middle-of-the-road path between organized labor 's demand for liberalization of jobless benefits and employer opposition to any boost in benefits . The chief executive 's 54,000 , - 000 to $6.000,000 liberalization program just presented to the Legislature also goes part way with the Eisenhower administration proposal that state benefits be upped to approximately 50 per cent of a jobless worker 's normal earnings . While the Legislative Com- mittee on Labor and Industries recently reported favorably labor-backed bills to increase benefits , it is believed the Governor 's plan , or a modification of it , will be the one passed by the 1955 Legislature . The major differences are : Would Keen Extra S3 1 . Governor Herter recommended the minimum weekly benefit be increased from $6 to S10 and maximum benefits be upped from S25 a week to $30 .

The Governor proposed maximum benefits paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent to 35 per cent of his wages in his base period , or 26 times his weekly benefit rate , whichever is the lesser . The labor bill would set the maximum at 40 per . cent of wages in the base period or 26 times the weekly benefit rate , whichever is the lesser . Neither the Governor 's program nor the committee-favored labor measures would increase the 26-week maximum duration of benefits . But the Governor also proposed several other major revisions in the employment security laws to liberalize benefits . He favored a change in the base period on which benefits are reckoned . Under the Governor 's plan the base period would be the 52 calendar weeks immediately preceding the first day of the claimant 's benefit year . ? artial Emulovment ? The Governor said " the purpose of the change is more equitably to connect the base period to the claimant 's most recent earnings in employment rather than using wages earned seven to 18 months prior to his claim . " The chief executive also asked the Legislature to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $10 a week while on jobless benefits without losing their compensation . The Governor said the change would effectuate the intent of the 1954 Legislature in this respect . In addition Governor Herter proposed the average weekly wage on which benefits are based he defined as the average of those weeks in the base year in which $15 or more was earned . The Governor said the change is proposed to protect " claimants against a receding economy in which there may be weeks of low earnings . " The purpose . . is . . . to benefit more adequately those individuals who are steadily employed rather than utilizing high quarter earnings as at present with consequent reward to those with short duration employment to the detriment of the steadily employed . " If the Herter liberalization program is adapted by the Legislature , as anticipated , it will mark the second benefit boost during the Herter administration . In the governor 's first term , the maximum duration of benefits was upped from 23 weeks to 26 weeks .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
