<p> The war , we are told , will require cold-bloodedness , deception , and the black arts . Fear not : Rep. Gary Condit ( D. , Calif. ) has been appointed to the newly formed Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security . <p> <p> When they reopened , the markets proceeded to fall by a larger percentage than in any other week since 1933 . More than a trillion dollars of wealth was wiped out . Unemployment is rising . The war is scrambling business plans ; it will probably cause large investments , and purchases , to be deferred . Now would be a good time for an economic-growth package . Yet Republicans are dithering . They should keep in mind the alternative . Now that the Social Security " lockbox " has been picked , the extra billions will be used . If Republicans do not use them to finance pro-growth tax cuts , Democrats will push for their own wish list : An expansion of Medicaid . Larger , and longer-lasting , unemployment benefits . A minimum-wage boost . Republicans should take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda of their own . The capital-gains tax should be cut , permanently . Pending reductions in income-tax rates should be sped up . Business should get tax cuts , too . And Congress should make it easier for President Bush to negotiate free-trade deals . If Democrats demand tax rebates for low-income workers as the price for speedy passage of growth legislation , Republicans should make a deal . The most important thing the government can do to help the economy is to start winning the war . But economic policy can do its part , too . <p> <p> A week and a half into the crisis of his city , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani alluded to the secret of his leadership . In one of the dozens of press conferences he has held since the disaster struck , he was discussing whether New Yorkers would begin to resume their normal routines . " Hundreds of people , " he said , had told him they wanted to do just that . He was telling the truth-but not the whole truth . Hundreds of people had told him that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew and did n't know , what they could and could n't do . Inspiring , informing , stoically grieving , the mayor spoke to the best in every New Yorker-and then , having helped to draw the best forth , pretended that it had come to him unbidden . This tough , odd , and sometimes limited man leaves office on the highest of high notes . <p> <p> The anti-terrorism bill before Congress contains several useful , indeed overdue , provisions . It would enable the Justice Department to detain aliens suspected of breaking the law for 48 hours or , in emergencies , longer , before charging them with a crime ; the current rule allows for only 24 hours . The bill would also allow " roving wiretaps " : Instead of requiring a new authorization every time a suspect switches phones , a wiretap could be authorized for any phone call a suspect makes from any phone . But the bill is much too broad . As Dave Kopel has pointed out on National Review Online , its definition of terrorism includes throwing a rock through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dictatorial government ( such as the Embassy of Sudan ) . Such offenses should be punished , but not subject to the same penalties as actual terrorism . In addition , some of the expanded law-enforcement powers would apply not only to terrorism , even broadly defined , but to drug and other offenses . The bill is being sold as an emergency measure . But it is not temporary : There is no provision for the expanded governmental powers in the bill to lapse after a few years . Congress should pass a stripped-down bill , one narrowly designed to reduce terrorist threats . <p> <p> There was a plausible case for bailing out the airlines : The federal government had shut them down , after all , and an act of war had made their futures precarious . Congress was clearly right to limit the airlines ' liability for losses suffered because of the attacks . But Congress is also giving the airlines subsidies-including $5 billion in direct grants-that will encourage other claimants to line up on Capitol Hill . Already travel agents , airline workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ronald Utt of the Heritage Foundation had a better idea : The government could have bought $5 billion worth of prepaid tickets for use in future federal business travel . Airlines would have gotten needed funds without any corporate welfare . But the bill has already become law . What should Washington do the next time the airlines have trouble ? Approve their merger requests rapidly . Allow the private sector to expand airport capacity . And lighten the tax and regulatory load on business generally . <p> <p> Federal involvement in airport security may also increase . The whole system needs an upgrade , starting with the untrained and poorly paid mall cops currently in charge of passenger screening . But do n't expect too much of safety regulations . Taken too far , they end up making planes safer mainly in the sense that terrorists ca n't hijack jets that do n't take off because they 're chronically underbooked . If air travel becomes too inconvenient , the bailout just passed will be only the first of many . Already there are signs of regulatory overreach . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of the hijackers boarded planes from there , and a nearby airport that admitted hijackers targeting the Pentagon-Dulles International Airport , in Virginia-remains open for business . There 's a balance to be struck here , and the authorities do n't appear to be finding it . <p> <p> Yasser Arafat has long played a double game , with striking success . He says one thing in English , to the West , and another-much different-thing in Arabic , to his followers in the streets and in the mosques . For example , he welcomed the Oslo " peace process " in the one tongue , and in the other reassured his people that it was all " incrementalism , " with the goal of Israel 's destruction unchanged . Following the September 11 attacks , he staged a photo-op in which he gave blood , claiming to be doing his bit to help the American wounded . At the same time , his official news organ-in Arabic , of course-was praising the terrorists as " noble , " " the salt of the earth , " " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us . " In one breath , we are told that Arafat has no control over the suicide bombers and others who commit terror in Israel . In another , we are told that the Israeli government must sit down with Arafat so as to stop this terror . Well , if he has no control <p> <p> Overnight , the anti-globalization movement has turned into an antiwar movement . When the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF was canceled because of the attacks , the leftists who had planned to protest the meeting did not follow suit ; they decided to protest the war instead . The teach-ins have begun . Martin Sheen and other " entertainer/activists " have signed a letter warning that a military response to the attacks would only " spark a cycle of escalating violence . " A facile and ignorant economics has been replaced by a facile and ignorant geopolitics . While these peaceniks bear watching , their numbers are now too small to impede the war effort . What they are more likely to do is further discredit the American Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opposing American self-defense in the blink of an eye , people can hardly be blamed for concluding that it is not so much " anti-globalization " or " antiwar " as it is anti-American . <p> <p> " Frenzied protesters in Peshawar set fire to the American flag , then ripped it apart and ate the smoldering remnants yesterday , " went the report from Pakistan on September 20 . Supposing this disgraceful behavior had occurred on U.S. soil , would it have been covered by the Flag-burning Amendment ? Or do we need a new initiative : a Flag-eating Amendment ? <p> <p> Then again , maybe the crowd was just hungry . <p> <p> The G-word has gotten a good workout recently , as politicians pray in their speeches , ordinary Americans pray in public , and New Yorkers ( even New Yorkers ! ) pray at impromptu sidewalk shrines . This turn to the Father is childlike-and rightly so , if humility is the source of wisdom . Greater even than wisdom is the confidence that God hears all earnest prayers , and answers them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God looks after fools , drunkards , and the United States  --  a very worldly wisecrack . God looks after no one drunk on his own folly . Let us pray . <p> <p> " These men are fighting the first battle , " Rudy Giuliani declared . " These are the men who will fight our wars , " President Bush echoed during his visit to lower Manhattan . The mayor and the president were n't inspired by the city 's " firefighters " ; they were talking about the firemen who raced into the burning towers that Tuesday morning , and their exhausted , bloodied brothers who desperately searched the wreckage for a miracle . Despite determined efforts to integrate women into New York 's fire department over the past 20 years , there are only 36 women in the 11,000-member force . A federal judge found in 1982 that the department 's physical test improperly discriminated against women ( upper-body strength being largely " irrelevant " to firefighting ) , and ordered the department to water down its requirements . The department fought back in court . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 40 percent of male applicants fail . The contrast to the armed services is striking . They simply surrendered to feminist demands , adopting gender-normed scoring on physical tests and enlistment quotas to boost the number of women in the ranks . How to explain the difference ? For the military , equal opportunity was able to trump combat effectiveness in the lull of peacetime . For the firemen of New York , there is never peacetime . <p> <p> At first glance , it could n't have been more heartwarming . Hollywood 's aristocracy dropped everything to help in the recovery effort . Al Pacino , Tom Cruise , Goldie Hawn , Adam Sandler , and many others manned the phones to take pledges during a two-hour " telethon " that raised a staggering $150 million . What will be done with that money remains murkily undisclosed . The United Way will administer it " appropriately . " But there 's a hint as to where the money might be followed  --  and as to why so many hardcore Hollywood liberals joined the effort in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities gathered in Los Angeles on September 23 to record a version of the 1979 Sister Sledge hit " We Are Family . " Proceeds from album sales will go to " the responsible outreach and educational work of credible , non-political , not-for-profit organizations that promote tolerance , combat misfortune , and defend the freedoms of all Americans . " The ACLU can get out its tin cup . <p> <p> Oakland hip-hop band The Coup-whose oeuvre includes such titles as " Kill My Landlord " and " 5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO " - was widely criticized for a future album whose cover had featured an exploding Twin Towers , with bandleader Boots Riley wielding a detonator in the foreground . Riley was quick to apologize : " The original intent of the cover was to use the World Trade Center to symbolize capitalism and was not supposed to be realistic in its depiction . " We 're glad Riley knows his history well enough to understand that the overthrow of capitalism has never meant anything but peace and plenty for all . <p> <p> Since we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it ? Every war must have a name . In modern times , there has been a tendency to dull literalness in this matter , relying mainly on simple geography : the Gulf War , the Vietnam War , the Korean War . It does n't have to be this way . History is replete with more imaginatively named conflicts : the War of the Three Henrys ( France , 1585-1589 ) , the War of Jenkins ' Ear ( England vs . Spain , 1739-48 ) , the War of the Oranges ( Spain vs . Portugal , 1801 ) , the Soccer War ( El Salvador vs . Honduras , 1969 ) , and the Codfish War ( U.K. vs . Iceland , 1975 ) . At least until the geographical scope of the administration 's plans becomes clear , and with no disrespect intended to those who perished in the other two hijackings , we suggest that the present engagement be named after its first and surely most memorable casualties : the Twin Towers War . <p> <p> As the term-limited hero mayor prepares to step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Democratic primary is tantamount to election-especially since the Republican primary winner , Michael Bloomberg , is an ignorant egotist with zero experience . Unfortunately , the Democratic primary field was itself dwarfish , a collection of liberal career pols . Since the winner did not get 40 percent of the vote , the top two will face each other in a runoff . Mark Green is a one-time Nader Raider who may have learned something . He had the endorsement of the catastrophic David Dinkins , but also of the excellent William Bratton , Giuliani 's first police commissioner . His opponent , Fernando Ferrer , ran sharply to the left , campaigning with the lethal race-baiter Al Sharpton . The prospects for leadership are dismal . <p> <p> Among the news items swamped by the horrors of September 11 was a victory for Iain Duncan Smith in the contest for leadership of Britain 's Conservative party . In his victory speech , Duncan Smith pledged that his party would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the Blair government in support of the United States . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw active duty in Northern Ireland as an officer in the elite Scots Guard regiment . He holds traditionally conservative views on such subjects as abortion , capital punishment , and gays in the military . On Europe , the most divisive issue among British Conservatives , he is a skeptic , much more likely to fight for British sovereignty against the bureaucrats of Brussels than was his opponent in the leadership election , Europhile Kenneth Clarke . Since Duncan Smith won 61 percent of the vote among party members , it is not very probable that National Review 's endorsement ( " The Week , " Sept. 17 ) was crucial in pushing him over the top , but we offer him our continued support in any case , and welcome him to the ranks of conservative leadership . <p> <p> For almost a decade , the Pentagon 's top intelligence analyst for Cuba was also a spy for Cuba . She had access to everything-satellite imagery , communications intercepts , human sources ( i.e. , real people , risking their lives for freedom ) - and she gave away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , the question is what to do with her , with Ana Belen Montes . If she were executed , that might well cause her fellow enemy agents and their successors to think twice . Perhaps they , too , should risk their lives . <p> <p> Isaac Stern was a fine violinist and all-around American figure . He was the one more responsible than anyone else for saving Carnegie Hall from the wrecker 's ball 40 years ago . He was a stalwart friend to Israel , memorably playing there in a gas mask during the Gulf War . He was a humorous man , with an enthusiasm for life . He adored tennis and played it vigorously , despite his girth . Performing with people seated on the stage behind him , he turned around and said , " Pardon my back . " Facing the general audience seated before him , he said , " Pardon my front . " He was a very large presence in New York and around the world , and will be missed by many .
