LECTURES BY famous authors , plays , concerts , movies , swimming pools , weight rooms , tennis courts  --  collectively , these things are as much a part of campus life as grueling hours of late-night study . Academia knows that R &; R is as essential as the three Rs . <p> Of course , the need to stretch the mind and body is not limited to those who crack the books . Fortunately , the area 's 12 universities and colleges open many of their facilities to those who do n't carry student IDs . <p> Regardless of your alma mater ( or lack thereof ) , your pattern of alumni contributions , your job or your neighborhood , you can take advantage of all sorts of campus activities , many of them cheap or free . ( Free , that is , if you ignore your share of tax dollars to public schools or donations to private ones . ) <p> Here are just some of the more notable freebies you 'll find at local schools : <p> j Movies at American University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies a week in the school 's Wechsler Theater  --  everything from Hollywood classics to contemporary European films . Members of the public may attend most of them  --  the school even prints schedules for film buffs ' convenience . <p> j A senior citizen exercise program at the University of the District of Columbia . Open to any District resident 60 or older , the Bodywise program offers swimming-pool aerobics and stretch-and-walk sessions . Sessions take place three days a week and draw about 200 participants . <p> j Lectures at George Mason University . John Updike is one of this spring 's guests in GMU 's ambitious readings/lectures series . Other speakers are n't so famous , but they 're all big shots in their fields . Most schools in this area have similar series that also are accessible to everybody . <p> j Open libraries everywhere . All 12 colleges and universities in this area allow the public to browse in their main libraries ' stacks . ( Checking out books , however , usually is n't allowed unless the borrower is a card-holding student , alumna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see , university libraries open early and close late , unlike strapped municipal ones . <p> At local universities most plays , concerts and other live performances do require tickets , but the prices usually are much cheaper than those of for-profit venues off campus . <p> One regular college-theater patron here , John Lawler , says he " boycotts " the Kennedy Center because its theater tickets are n't cheap enough for his budget . The only reasonably priced ticket at the Kennedy Center , in Lawler 's view , is the American Film Institute movie theater . " Other than that , why , that place could fall apart and I 'd never miss it , " says the Agriculture Department economist , who lives in Arlington . " You know , you can see plays at Georgetown University or George Washington . . . at one-tenth the price . I get a season ticket at both places "  --  for student productions , that is . <p> Lawler believes he 's among the relatively few local residents who attend lots of campus plays . " Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parents ' weekend , " he says of Georgetown , " but usually , my wife and I stand out like blueberries in cereal because we 're the oldest ones there . Almost everyone there is a student . " <p> Colleges offer entertainment bargains to the public for various reasons , the main ones being to offset production expenses , to cultivate good community relations and to draw audiences for student performers . <p> As for campus athletic facilities that sell access on either a membership or visit-by-visit basis , the motive is almost purely financial . Schools often build and furnish lavish facilities for students and faculty , only to find that the pools , courts , equipment and locker rooms stand idle part of the time . Administrators figure it makes sense to let outsiders come in and swap cash for a workout and shower  --  and gym rats love the idea . <p> " We have what we call the NBA , the Noontime Basketball Association , " says Bob Druckenmiller , 50 , a Washington advertising executive who pays $ 765 a year to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to those lunchtime pickup games , he also swims and lifts weights during his three or four weekly visits . <p> " What I like about it is that there 's anonymity for me , " says Druckenmiller . " We play basketball and no one knows who anybody else is . You have a great mixture of students , people who work on the campus and professionals . And that 's kind of nice . For an older person to be able to mix with younger people , I think that 's enjoyable . " <p> That sort of enjoyment is widely available and dirt-cheap in a college town like this one . So pick a campus , any campus , and go . Here are some ideas to help you get started . <p> THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY  --  With its strong performing arts program , American University ( 4400 Massachusetts Ave .
