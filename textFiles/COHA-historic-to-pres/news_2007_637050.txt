Every morning in cafes and coffee shops around the country , small groups of older men get together to find solutions to global warming , the war in Iraq , crime in the cities and the oil crisis . Sometimes they elect popes and fire football coaches . <p> By the time the last cup of coffee is poured , they will have solved all the world 's problems except one : What do women really want ? <p> Unorganized and unofficial , men 's breakfast clubs have been meeting for years with the sole purpose of giving retired men an excuse to get out of the house , tell jokes , discuss politics or sports , and eat a cholesterol-laden meal with black coffee . <p> In Carrollton , a senior citizens brain trust has been meeting at Jerry 's Country Kitchen for more than 30 years . They arrive early , around 6 a.m. , armed with the morning paper and fresh jokes . <p> " It 's a diverse group , " says Tracy Stallings , a former mayor and dean at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers and engineers and workers from Georgia Power . " <p> In addition to Stallings , this morning 's group includes Bob Myers , 69 , former senior vice president for Sony Music ; Bill Copeland , 72 , retired dentist ; Bill Fullilove , 70 , a retired engineer ; Roy Johnson , 71 , a retiree from the Georgia Department of Labor ; and Harold Miles , 76 , a retired rental-equipment executive , newspaper columnist and author of " The Devil &; Uncle Will , " " Bad Ol ' Boy " and " Lunacy Hearing . " <p> " Everyone in our group is retired , " Stallings says . " We talk about physical ailments and the drugs we take . But we also talk about politics and trends . And we swap jokes . " <p> The joke of the day is offered by Johnson . " Did you hear about this new drug called Transpan ? It 's half tranquilizer and half Spanish fly . It makes you want to have sex , but if you do n't have it , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anna Nicole Smith story , politics and the misadventures of some colorful local figures . In the end , none of the conversation matters , Stallings says . It 's the camaraderie that counts . <p> " Everybody wants to retire , then they discover it 's not the piece of cake they thought it was going to be , " he says . " You have to keep busy doing something . I retired in ' 94 , and since then I 've served four terms in the Legislature and learned to play the violin . " <p> The loss of identity is a major hurdle for most retirees , Miles says . <p> " When somebody asks you what you do and you tell them you 're retired , they get this look that says you do n't matter . " <p> Men have a harder time adjusting to retirement than women , says Cheryl Stephenson , co-author with Wicke Chambers of " Celebrate Retirement : The Freedom and the Frustrations " ( Winslow Press , $19.95 ) . <p> " They do n't recognize the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed the skill of relationship-building outside of work , " she says . " Some find that having so much time to fill is frustrating . Others , who are accustomed to a network of contacts , associates and co-workers , feel isolated . That 's why men 's breakfast clubs or lunch groups are so important . They give them somewhere to go , someone to talk to and something to look forward to . " <p> Social interaction is not the only reason old men have been going to Jerry 's Country Kitchen for 30 years . Owner Jerry Eady makes homemade biscuits the size of a saucer and keeps coffee mugs refilled continuously . One of the menu items , D.B. biscuits , was named after the late D.B. " Pete " Cofer , a Southwire Co. vice president and famous member of the breakfast group . The special biscuit has the middle part removed , leaving the crusty top and bottom . <p> " Pete was a beloved member of the group , " Stalling says . " He had a lot of humorous stories . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous is a chicken snake . So if you see a snake that does n't have a chicken in its mouth , it 's poisonous . " <p> Finding a men 's breakfast club is not difficult . Ray Stephenson , 74 , a retired major in the Georgia Highway Patrol , is one of 14 members of the Newnan breakfast club at Westside Barbecue Restaurant . He started the club simply by walking over to an old man who was reading a newspaper at a table and sitting down . <p> " We come from all directions in Coweta County , " he says . " It 's a very diverse group . We have retired airline pilots , property owners and developers . We had a lawyer once , but we ran him off . " <p> Like other breakfast clubs , the Newnan group looks after those who are having health problems . <p> " If you miss two days in a row and you have n't told anybody where you 're going to be , there 'll be an investigation and we 'll find you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lung cancer . We see about him , chat with him on the phone . It 's easy to start feeling sorry for yourself when you have health problems . " <p> Retired airline pilot Keith Crosby , 70 , says health issues have become more of a topic of conversation as they 've gotten older , but political discussions are still fun . <p> " We probably have more Republicans than Democrats , but sometimes somebody will take either side for the sake of argument . " <p> Bob Ward , 76 , a retired land developer and builder , joined the club before he retired . <p> " I moved here from New Orleans in ' 86 , and the first place I stopped for breakfast I saw a group of guys in the corner . You can look at them and tell they have nothing to do but meet in the morning to drink coffee . I barged in on them and sat down . " <p> Although such groups are informal with no rules and no dues , they provide an important outlet for retirees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirees in our Emory classes what 's been their most difficult adjustment , many have said it 's the lack of structure . The men who join and regularly attend these breakfast or lunch groups have found a good way to put structure back into their lives , " she says . <p> " And although they 'd never admit it , most retired men need a break from their wife and grandkids .
