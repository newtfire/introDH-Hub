Should U.S. firms pull out-or stay and work for change ? <P> As never before , American multinationals in South Africa are coming under fire in the U.S. At one shareholders ' meeting after another , critics hurl epithets ( " partner in apartheid , " " friend of discrimination " ) . The N.A.A.C.P. , hardening its stand , now calls for a total withdrawal of Yankee firms from white-dominated parts of South Africa . The Rev. Leon Sullivan , a black minister from Philadelphia and a director of General Motors , has been urging a strict code of conduct for U.S. companies in the land of apartheid and demanding that they actively help black workers overcome various bars to forming unions . Anti-apartheid protests stand to intensify on campuses this fall , and many universities and foundations have decided to sell their shares in corporations operating in South Africa .

Most U.S. companies argue that they are helping South Africa 's blacks by staying there and working for change . But are they doing enough ? <P> Some 350 American companies have invested a total of $1.5 billion in South Africa , and they are the chief purveyors of its modern technology and consumer goods . Ford , South Africa 's biggest automaker ( 1977 sales : 42,874 vehicles ) , and GM together account for 26% of the automotive market . Goodyear , General and Firestone dominate tire sales ; Exxon , Mobil and Caltex are leaders at the fuel pumps .

In those days the white Americans , still imbued with their own pioneering heritage , identified strongly with the Dutch-descended Afrikaners , who were also frontier people . That attitude continued in the post-World War II years as newly arriving U.S. firms brought technology and industrial development to South Africa . Yet by the late 1960s , as whites deserted factories for better paying service jobs and the need for labor increased dramatically , American firms were forced to turn to the unskilled blacks and mixed-race coloreds .
