<P> Compared with Moscow 's goose-stepping solemnity or the glitter of a Parisian greeting , what the White House produced for the arrival of Britain 's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last week was really quite modest . And yet it was a splendid tribute to a friend-and indeed to the U.S. <P> An honor guard ranked the South Lawn , green with spring 's first surge . Battle streamers from Lexington to Viet Nam snapped on their staffs in the chill flurries . Trumpets soared and the mellow growl of trombones echoed down the Mall : God Save the Queen . It was a moment of dignity , in a nation that craves it . <P> Perhaps it is Ronald Reagan 's pervasive faith in pageantry that set the stage . Whatever its origins , that sense of dignity is an important part of the new Administration 's appeal in these first tender weeks . Dignity is not leadership , but it creates an aura of care and concern . <P> " The atmosphere in the White House has changed , " says Curator Clem Conger .

" Too nice sometimes , " snapped an aide . One morning the President told his staff firmly that he was getting " impatient " for a certain report . Recalled one : " That is as nasty as I have heard him be so far . " <P> The President one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sparked an order for those around the Oval Office to dress appropriately . The Reagan staff is compiling a code of behavior for all the staff , both on and off the job . " They are , " insists Chief Jim Baker , " symbols for the rest of the country . " <P> Reagan has been as meticulous in his dress as he has been with his use of language . David Kennerly , White House photographer for Jerry Ford , spent a day shooting Reagan on the job . His viewfinder assessment of Reagan 's bearing : " natural dignity . " There is a touch of Hollywood , of course . Reagan 's suits now and then get a little beyond the Brooks Brothers stripe , and he sometimes wears shoes with gold hardware . But blue jeans stay out there on the ranch in California .
