Mrs. Lillian Collings , wife of the missing Benjamin P. Collings , who , she asserts , was thrown overboard by " pirates " from their cabin cruiser Penguin last Wednesday night , was subjected yesterday to the most searching cross-examination she has yet faced . It was imposed on her in a frank effort to break her down and make her admit that her fantastic recital of the boarding of the Penguin by an elderly and a young man who compelled her husband to ferry them about the Sound , bound him and tossed him into the sea , then forced her to abandon her 5-year-old daughter ' on the drifting cruiser and come with them in a canoe is a fiction . She was bombarded with questions for four hours , and at 7 P. M. she emerged from this new ordeal more haggard in appearance than she has been since the first days of the inquiry . But , according to the officials who had questioned her , she had not varied an iota from the strange story which she told Thursday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the motorboat BoPeep in which her supposed captors had marooned her at the end of her ? nightmare adventure . Questioned by Blue . The author of yesterday 's attack on the young woman 's story of piracy , murder and assault was District Attorney Alexander G. Blue of Suffolk County , who may eventually have jurisdiction over the case if it is determined that the crime  --  if there was one  --  was committed in Suffolk County rather than in Nassau .. He was polite and considerate , and even friendly in demeanor , according to spokesmen for Mrs. Collings , but he was unswerving . Mr. Blue met Mrs. Collings , who again was accompanied by her missing husband 's brother and sister , Herbert Collings and Miss Helen Collings , on their arrival from Stamford yesterday afternoon at the estate of William B. Leeds at Cove Neck , near the scene of Wednesday night 's adventures . Persons who were near said that the Suffolk District Attorney told her in the beginning that he did not believe her story bait that he would give her every opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be reached last night for verification of this statement , but Assistant District Attorney Munder denied that Mr. Blue had said he did not believe her . He implied that Mr. Blue did not disbelieve her . The day 's inquiry ' began with a voyage on the Penguin , in which Mrs. Collings re-enacted vesrious incidents which she had described in the statements which she has repeated so many times to the Nassau County authorities . Counsel Accompanies Her . Yesterday , however , Mrs. Collings had for the first time the advice and the protecting presence of a lawyer of her own . On her journey over by ferry from Stamford and throughout the day she was accompanied by Attorney William A. Kelly , a town judge of Darien , Conn. , and a member of the firm of Cummings &; Lockwood . The head of this firm is Homer S. Cummings , a prominent Democrat , one time intimate friend of Woodrow Wilson and noted for his acumen as a lawyer . Mr. Cummings was recently praised in a report of the Wickersham committee for his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of murder after the police , by thirddegree methods , had forced him to confess and then had built up a perfect circumstantial case against him . Mr. Cummings also was counsel for Gene Tunney in the suits , which eventually failed , brought against him by Mrs. Katherine Fogarty . Mr. Cummings , in explaining his retention to assist Mrs. Collings , said yesterday in Stamford : " There is no particular significance in it other than that it affords an opportuntiy for Mrs. Collings and her family to have counsel to whom they can turn for advice . The stivation is a trying one , and they . desire the counsel , of persons presumably more experienced in such matters than they are themselves . It should , of course , be clearly understood that our real purpose is to endeavor to find and punish the guilty parties . Mrs. Collings and her family and her husband 's family are acting entirely in harmony . It is their desire to give every assistance they can to the authorities in attempting to run down the prepetrators of this ghastly outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities have been curious was as to how she threw out the air mattress which she said she cast to her husband as a life-raft after she heard his exclamation that they were putting him overboard . Mrs. Collings re-enacted this . She came up through the narrow hatch on the forward deck and with some difficulty lugged the , mattress with her . Then she hurled it over the starboard side of the little craft . Mrs. Collings 's success with the mattress convinced the Nassau investigators at least that that part of her story was believable . Inspector King questioned Collings 's brother and sister during most of the trip , while District Attorney Blue and Assistant District Attorney Munder devoted themselves to Mrs. Collings . The inspector went over the log with Mr. and Miss Collings and they identified the various persons referred to in it . " M , " who was mentioned in one entry in the log as having come aboard with " Lillian , " taken to be Mrs. Collings , was found to be a mutual friend of the Collingses , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police were convinced that he had no relationship to the case . Two women mentioned in the log were found to be , one an acquaintance of both the Collingses and the other an elderly woman . Counsel Stays Nearby . ? Attorney Kelly was at Mrs. Collings 's side throughout the afternoon 's voyaging inquiry . She pointed out the relative positions occupied by her husband , herself , her daughter Barbara and the two invaders at various times in Wednesday night 's wild journey . She illustrated how she had been able to see them through the cabin window as they talked with her husband on the deck . She reiterated her belief that both were Americans , and . repeated her descriptions of them . One interesting development , possibly possessing a tangible clue , came during the afternoon . Mrs. Collings explained that she was barefooted when the two " pirates " took her off the Penguin in their canoe , and that the older man , with the same solicitude for her comfort which he had shown when he later covered her with blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dufflebag in which he kept his blankets and gave them to her . There was considerable police interest in these sneakers when Mrs. Collings was found wearing them Thursday morning when she was rescued from the Bo-Peep . But apparently no attempt had been made to try to trace the identity of the kidnappers  --  and perhaps murderers  --  by means of them . It was understood last night that they were still in Mrs. Collings 's possession in her home in Stamford . Inspector King said he would get them and try to trace their owners . Early in the evening the party returned to the Leeds estate , where the various investigators and Attorney Kelly were in conference for some time . Mrs. Collings and her party departed for Stamford on the 7:30 P. M. ferry . She was asked on her arrival there about Mr. Blue 's statement to her that he did not believe her story . She hesitated , then referred questioners to Mr. Kelly . " I did not hear any such statement made , " said the lawyer . Asked about District Attorney Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very considerate and very friendly . He said that no date had been set for the return of Mrs. Collings to Long Island , but if any developments should warrant it she would go . Blanket Clue Fails . Yesterday was another day of collapsing clues . The blanket lead the finding in the Bo-Peep of a blanket of the Hotel Charles , Springfield , Mass. , which the elder " pirate " had wrapped around Mrs. Collings when he left her in the Bo-Peepappeared to be useless . Detective Howard De Mott , sent by Inspector King to Springfield , reported by telephone yesterday that the " pirate 's " blanket had come from that hotel , but that it was one of 2,000 of identical pattern purchased when the hotel was remodeled two years ago , and that since that time 100 of them had been stolen . Though the blanket is one of the few definite links to the supposed pirates , Nassau County detectives believed that the number of them stolen would preclude tracing the men in that way . Detective De Mott also was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife " of Stamford who stopped at the Hotel Charles on Aug. 2 , 1930 . No one of the hotel staff remembered who they were or what they looked like . De Mott also made inquiries about the man named Marring of New York , who-registered at the garage on the same date , and who had been the subject of interest to the Nassau police because of the " M. " entry in the Penguin 's log . De Mott reported that he had no connection with the , case . Further weighing by the authorities of the part played in the affair by the canoe in which Mrs. Collings says she was taken on a long ride from the Penguin to the Bo-Peep and subjected to indignities by the older pirate on the way showed that if all the things related were so it had an amazing capacity . According to Mrs. Collings 's story It contained the two pirates and herself , along with a duffle-bag from which the older man extracted the sneakers and the six blankets which he gave Mrs. Collings . Pirate Changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police , learned yesterday , was that on the route the elder pirate rummaged through the bag and found a pair of breeches . He forthwith changed clothes and tossed his trousers overboard . A strange occurrence on Long Island Sound a week ago yesterday was reported to Inspector King yesterday . On that day Frank Cross of the Port Washington Yacht Club was cruising from Greenpoint toward Port Jefferson with his wife and 5-year-old daughter , Barbara , aboard . Opposite Ross 's point Mr. Cross was hailed by two men , who appeared to be foreigners , in a luxuriously appointed speed boat which Mr. Cross thought could hardly have belonged to them . They were of about the same ages , one 50 and the other 20 , as the alleged assailants of Collings . They said their motor had hrnIcon down and asked help . Mr. Cross went alongside and found that an ignition wire was so far out of contact that it must have been purposely loosened . He adjusted this and returned to his own craft . A little later Mr. and Mrs. Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then head toward the Connecticut side . Inspector King said yesterday that a theory advanced that Collings 's assailants were the father and brother of a girl who had been wronged by a man resembling Collings and that they had mistakenly taken revenge on him and his wife was one which had occurred to him and his investigators but which they had quickly dismissed . " If we are to assume that Mrs. Collings 's story is correct  --  and it is the only information we have  --  we must reject that theory because it is extremely unlikely that a father would commit a murder in the presence of his son . to say nothing of his actions toward Mrs. Collings after she was taken from the Penguin . Older Pirate a PuzzleDistrict Attorney Edwards said that one of the strangest features of the whole case was the contradictory behavior of the older man  --  his cruelty at one stage , and his kindness to Mrs. Collings at the other . It was suggested to him that such a character resembled ** who committed a series of murders on Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man of the Collings mystery might oe " 3-X . " Dr. Alex 0 . Gettler of New York in a preliminary report yesterday told Inspector King that some of the stains from the Penguin given him for analysis were blood , but . that the tests had not gone far enough to show whether they were human blood . More than 100 boats scoured the Sound in the vicinity of Oyster Bay yesterday looking for the body of Collings , which , ' if Collings was drowned there , was expected to rise to the surface . Nothing was found . Dr. Collings , at his home in Stamford , revealed yesterday that he was still clinging to the hope that his son had been kidnapped and would still be found alive . No letters demanding ransom have been received by the family . Dr. Collings resented insinuations that his son had acted in a cowardly manner in not resisting the invaders . " Ben was no coward , " he said . " He had both moral and physical courage . I am sure he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the least suspicion of the events which were to follow . " Dr. Collings has received several messages of sympathy from prominent residents of Hot Springs , where he makes his home . One from Circuit Judge Earl Witt said : Sympathy of your people with you in your hour of trial . We have every confidence in your position and you . " Another message in like vein was from high officials of the Masonic lodge of which Dr. Collings is a member . The retention of the law firm , It was earned , was due to the growing irritation of the missing Collings 's father , brothers and sister at what they consider the unwarranted hardships to which the Nassau County authorities have been subjecting Mrs. Collings . She has been undergoing long examinations , repeating her story over and over again , every day , with one exception , since she was first found on the Bo-Peep . " The repeated trips she is being forced to make are decidedly irksome to me and the rest of the family , " said Dr. Coilings yesterday at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nassau County authorities are concerned It was intimated last night that there would be na more of these irksome trips . When Inspector King . in command of Nassau County detectives , finished his interrogation . of Mrs. Collings he announced that he would not call her again unless some evidence was discovered that would warrant her further questioning . " She still told the same story today , " he said . " The most rigid questioning failed to bring a breakdown in any particular . " No direct word was obtainable last night from Mr. Blue as to what his intentions for the future were . There have been intimations that the Suffolk County authorities might take the case over if Nassau County was unable to act , because the question of jurisdiction is still open . Shielded on Voyage . Mrs. Collings 's day started yesterday with a touch of courtesy . She and her party traveled across the Sound on the noon ferry and Captain Abell invited them to sit in his cabin instead of in the public rooms , where she would be subjected to curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to be annoyed while she is on my boat , " he remarked . The attitude of the ferryboat captain was in harmony with that of residents of Stamford generally . In her home city Mrs. Collings is regarded as an innocent woman who is being subjected to a martyrdom , whereas on Long Island the popular feeling , shared by many of the officials , is that there is much more behind the adventures of the Penguin than her stories have revealed . Arriving at Bayville early yesterda r afternoon , Mrs. Collings was taken to the estate of William B. Leeds and there boarded Mr. Leeds 's yacht , the Marold. in company with District Attorney Munder , Inspector King and others and was taken to the Penguin , moored nearby . The party boarded the Penguin and the questioning began . Once more the cabin cruiser was taken over the long and involved route over which Mrs. Collings asserts it was driven under the compulsion of the oddly assorted pair of                @ @ @ @ @
