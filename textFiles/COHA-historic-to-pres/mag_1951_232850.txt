At the end of last week 's Sunday strip , Cartoonist Al Capp left Li'l Abner in Venice , innocently but enthusiastically helping the last of the Borgias bottle the last of the Borgia poison . With typical Capp satire , Li'l Abner named the concoction " Peppi-Borgia , " and Mammy Yokum had a wonderful idea : " We 'll give it a rootin ' , tootin ' , go-gettin ' American ad-vertisin ' campaign ! " <P> But when United Features took a second look at the " go-gettin " ' slogans ( " Peppi-Borgia hits the spot , puts you 6 feet deep and that 's a lot " ; " the Pause that Petrifies " ) , it got cold feet . The slogans obviously splashed close to Coca-Cola and closer to Pepsi-Cola . Although the strips had already been mailed out to Li'l Abner 's 700 subscribers , United sent a hurried order to rout out the " Peppi , " leave a blank before " Borgia . " Most newspapers did .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
