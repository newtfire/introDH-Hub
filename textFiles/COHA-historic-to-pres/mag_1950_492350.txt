I Get ' Em When They 're Broke By IRWIN KURTZ , Referee in Bankruptcy , as told to HAL BURTON IF you sternly resist the impulse to run up bills that ca n't be paid , thus keeping your liabilities from exceeding your assets , it is practically a cinch that you 'll continue through life without discovering at firsthand what a referee in bankruptcy does to earn his salary and title . I 'll be pleased by this , and you ought to be , for it 's never enjoyable to pay me a business visit . As one of 163 referees in the United States and its territories , I take charge of the wreckage when a man or a corporation goes broke . And should a business firm hit heavy weather , I 'm often handed the job of keeping it afloat . Most of the time I deal in straight bankruptcies , involving the little fellow whose ideas are too big for his pocketbook . In my court , which is a division of the United States District Court , bankruptcies outnumber corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are entirely different . A bankrupt is so far in the hole that he ca n't climb out unless his debts are canceled or else paid off at a few cents on the dollar . By contrast , a corporation that asks to be reorganized is not really bankrupt ; it is only temporarily in trouble because too many bills have fallen due all at once . There 's no sense in wrecking a promising business and throwing a lot of people out of work , so I exercise my power as a referee ? I 'm an appointee and deputy of the Federal judges in my district  --  to resolve the dilemma . First , I direct the harried corporation officers to draw up a sensible plan of reorganization . This plan has to satisfy a majority of the creditors . Next , I either give the firm more time in which to pay its pressing debts or else I permit its officers to settle for less than is actually owed . Thecreditors , by going along on either basis , show good judgment . Generally they 're paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to combine philanthropy with sound business practices . I 've been a referee for seventeen years , all of that time in New York City . My bailiwick comprises the populous boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx , which are part of the Southern District of New York . More people get into fiscal jams in New York than anywhere else in the country , and usually in very complicated ways . To straighten out their finances , I need a lot of latitude , and this is granted me under the Federal Bankruptcy Act , better known as the Chandler Act . I have all the civil powers of a judge in bankruptcies and reorganizations except the right to punish for contempt of court . If a chiseler holds out cash assets on me or refuses to turn over his books of account , I can cite him for contempt , after which it takes a judge to commit him to the Federal House of Detention . So far , I have issued contempt citations against twenty-five men , all of whom went to jail . Dishonest bankrupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my oak-paneled courtroom on the first floor of the United States Courthouse , in downtown Manhattan . Most bankrupts are honest but dumb . They 're people who just ca n't say no to a tempting purchase or a highly speculative investment . A few belatedly face the music and file voluntarily in bankruptcy , but a majority are thrown into it by irate creditors , any three of whom may take this step when a total of $500 or more is involved . When the bankruptcy petition reaches me , I immediately ask the creditors to elect a trustee for theassets . Usually he 's an attorney or a businessman of good repute . He has the privilege of designating his own lawyer and accountant . All three of these men are paid fees , which are extracted from whatever money the bankrupt has failed to spend in spite of himself . If the case is a complex one , with a lot of small creditors , often it is difficult to obtain an agreement on a trustee , so I designate a man of my own choice . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting enough proxies from the creditors to elect himself trustee . The total sum involved in the bankruptcy , if large , will insure him a fat fee . The custom among referees is to allot 25 per cent of the assets for just such administrative expenses . Once the appointments have been made , I call in witnesses and listen to their testimony , approve the trustee 's plan for the distribution of assets , if it seems sound to me , and close out the case by discharging the debtor from bankruptcy . He is then free to contract new debts and to go back into business life . A man can go through bankruptcy once every six years  --  no oftener . If he commits a fraud , such as doctoring his books or holding out money , I can refuse to discharge him , thus cutting him off from all sources of credit until he pays every penny he owes . Right now , with business failures at their highest since 1940 ? they 're 40 per cent greater than they were during the fiscal year ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom of the kind that does the country no good . There are only four referees in Manhattan and the Bronx , so even a modest recession clogs our dockets . I do n't mind being kept busy . The more complex a case turns out to be , the more enjoy unraveling it . For example , it took me seven years to rectify the business errors of the United Cigar Stores , a nationwide chain of tobacco shops . This $10,000,000 corporation committed itself to $29,000,000 in leases , nearly all of them at inflated prices . In the free-andeasy traditional the Roaring ' 20 's , United even built the immense Lincoln Hotel on 8th Avenue , thus making sure that no competitor would walk away with two choice corner-shop locations at 44th and 45th streets . The depression forced United into bankruptcy , and the case came before me in 1933 . I canceled all the unprofitable leases , one of which ? involving the mammoth building at 34th Street and 6th Avenue ? caused me some very uneasy moments . Doing business in the grand manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop locations . The balance of the building was then sublet to one of the biggest department stores in the city . I found myself in a dilemma . If I permitted the lease to run on , at an excessive rental , I would be diverting funds from the creditors . But if I disavowed the lease , all six floors of the department store would be out on the street , the store having no legal status as subtenant . After racking my brain , I finally arranged a conference between the owner of the building and the officers of the store . They worked out a new and independent arrangement which permitted me to cancel United 's lease , but left the department store undisturbed . Business conditions were improving rapidly , so in 1937 I was able to transform the bankruptcy into a straight corporate reorganization . Some creditors , who had faith in United 's future , agreed to wash out their debts . The money owed others was scaled down for later payment . The stockholders swapped their worthless shares for a new issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a happy ending to a dismal business story . I did my best to satisfy everybody in this very complicated case , but , despite my best efforts , I had to go around with a police bodyguard for a while . A disappointed stockholder mailed me his shares , promising to follow them in person with a loaded pistol unless I refunded the amount of his original investment . I turned him down , for a stockholder is the last person to collect from a bankrupt corporation . Fees to the trustee , lawyer and accountant , plus other administrative expenses , have first priority , followed by wages up to $600 for each employee , and any taxes that may be due . The creditors come next , and there seldom is enough to pay them off completely . The stockholders , being last in line under the law , practically never collect a cent . The stockholder who threatened me was an obvious crackpot , and they put him in a mental institution . Probably there are a lot of people who regret that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the crooks who file in bankruptcy and then try to hide their assets , using fake fires or sham burglaries as a cover-up . They " lose " their account books on the subway ; they shed crocodile tears over money theysay they 've squandered on the horses , and they are enraged when I refuse to swallow their preposterous stories . Though I 'm tough on such individuals , I 'm human enough to sympathize with the rare swindler who turns honest and belatedly unburdens his soul . Richard Whitney , to cite a case in point , defrauded his friends and relatives of $6,750,000 while president of the New York Stock Exchange . Before pleading guilty to grand larceny in the state courts , he filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy . I was prepared to dislike him , but he turned out to be so anxious to make amends that I wrote a letter to the sentencing judge , pointing out his redeeming traits . Whitney got off with a moderate sentence , and went free after two and a half years in Sing Sing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue-ribbon livestock on the place , and netted only $61,000 for his swindled friends and creditors . The Whitney case was sensational , but easy to handle . By contrast , I had to play Sherlock Holmes to unravel the Case of the Stolen Furs , which involved much less money . The bankruptcy proceeding wound up with three conniving brothers ? Harry , Phil and Sam Krepisman ? on the way to the Federal penitentiary at Atlanta for concealment of assets . The Krepismans were doing nicely with Persian lamb and karakul down in the garment district , but then they decided to add muskrat to their line . At that very moment muskrat went out of fashion . By late 1940 the Krepismans had run up $82,000 in debts . The creditors stepped in with an auditor and made the astounding discovery that $18,000 in cash , $65,000:in furs , and Phil Krepisman , all were missing . An involuntary-bankruptcy petition brought the case into my courtroom . Immediately I smelled something fishy . Harry and Sam were enjoying their martyrs ' role too thoroughly , denouncing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detectives of the American Fur Merchants ' Association , which polices the industry , that Harry and Phil had been seen sneaking bulky parcels from their shop in a loft building late at night . Presumably , these packages contained the missing furs . I next discovered that Phil , who was supposed to have left town on November twentieth after a violent quarrel with Harry , had actually shown up at a Manhattan bank on the twenty-first . He obtained a certified check and made sure it got into the hands of Harry , who needed it to pay off a persistent creditor . When I confronted Harry with the evidence that his story was fraudulent , he stuck to his fabrications . I 'm a redhead , with a temper that matches my flaming hair , and it took a lot of judicial dignity to control myself while questioning him . One Friday his wife brought in a doctor 's certificate . " Harry is awfully sick , judge , " she said . I had to take her word , but the detectives did n't . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week end with a brother-in-law . " I do n't remember , " he replied when I challenged his testimony . " I was dizzy . " It took me seven months , and required the help of the FBI , but we finally got the Krepismans dead to rights . Agents collared Sam as he sold $2700 worth of the missing pelts . Harry 's wife , Dora , broke under questioning , and led detectives to a series of barns upstate , where they recovered $60,000 in furs . A few days later , Phil Krepisman surrendered with only $7.40 in his pocket . He insisted he 'd lost the other $17 , - 992.60 at Santa Anita Race Track , in Southern California . I play the horses occasionally , so I know you ca n't gamble day after day without ever picking a winner . When I questioned Phil , it turned out that he did n't know the difference between betting a horse , show , place , or win . I asked him to describe Santa Anita , which I have visited , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising above the tropical splendor of the track . It was obvious that he had never gone near Santa Anita and had hidden away almost all the $18,000 , but we could n't find the money . I turned him over to the FBI , along with the two other brothers . They served terms varying from two to three years . The sequel to the story is a wry one . While they were in prison muskrat furs took an upward spurt in value . Had the Krepismans stayed in business one year longer , they could have paid off all their debts and come out with a $60,000 profit . Small-fry crooks are not the only ones who make business mistakes . Richard Whitney , a big-time operator , sank $1,000,000 in a Florida Everglades peat bog , but failed utterly to sell this fuel to the public . He wasted another million on a New Jersey applejack distillery , only to discover that the consumers refused to he weaned from Scotch , rye and bourbon . Samuel Insull , three of whose power companies I wound up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that the depression was temporary , appealed to big business to invest in new plant facilities . Insull obliged with a $10,000,000 investment . When the crash came , he lacked ready cash , and his empire caved in on him . I wound up one Insull company by paying the creditors a total dividend of one 4629th of 1 per cant . Completely blameless citizens can blunder in business too . Former Dean Wallace B. Donham , of the Harvard Business School , sank thousands of dollars in a gadget invented by his brother , and the corporation failed . He was a sheepish man when he came in to claim his dividend from me . From personal observation , I also know that Franklin D. Roosevelt , who as President spent billions of Government dollars , was not infallible in his private investments . Back in the late ' 20 's , Roosevelt helped to found the Consolidated Automatic Machine Company , better known as Camco . He served as a director , but withdrew when he became governor of New York State . Camco was a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDR later denounced with such bitterness . The corporation 's stock in trade-12,500 weighing and vending machines  --  did n't bring in enough money to pay the bills , and in 1935 the company asked me for permission to reorganize under Section 77-B of the Federal Bankruptcy Act , later supplanted by Chapters 10 and 11 of the Chandler Act . Debts approximated $6,750,000 ; assets were half that sum , and the stockholders lost everything . Hundreds of disappointed Camco investors flooded me with letters , insisting that they 'd been flimflammed into buying the stock by the luster of Roosevelt 's name . I took this correspondence with a grain of salt . Whenever a big company gets into a jam , the stockholders seize on the name of the most prominent director and hold him responsible for everything . Having failed in business myself ? I lost $50,000 in a phonograph-record company which could n't stand the competition of radio  --  I am well able to understand how a corporation can fall on hard times . I spent three years paying off my debts . It never occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been horrified at the idea . No stigma should attach to an honest bankrupt , but , unfortunately , all too often he is a marked man in the business world . Corporations and small firms were dropping like flies when I took office in 1932 , as an appointee of the late Federal Judge Frank Coleman , and we did n't begin to sense an economic upturn until 1935 . Then came the wartime boom : Between 1941 and 1946 , pending cases declined from 57,000 to slightly under 20,000 . During the 1948-49 fiscal year , ending June thirtieth , the number rose to 27,000 . In the old days in the Southern District , even a modest increase in bankruptcies represented cash in the bank for the referees . The Federal law , which was n't changed until 1947 , permitted referees to collect 1 per cent of the assets involved in each case . Since 1947 the sixty-three full-time referees in the United States have been paid a straight $10,000 salary . The rest of them receive $5000 or less for part-time work . The month I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $20,000 the maximum annual fee of the referees . This was a wise move . It conserved the assets for the creditors , it forestalled any scandal over big fees and it removed all pressure on the clerk of the court , who assigns the cases , to hand the richest bankruptcies and reorganizations over to favorites . One of my colleagues , who is no longer on the bench , decided privately to ignore this ruling . He put $339,000 from one large corporate reorganization into a special account , and then collected all of it when he retired in 1947 . The company is now suing to get back the money . Thereat of us referees stayed strictly within the $20,000 limit . During the war , when  --  to paraphrase Churchill  --  never was there a country where so many owed so little to so few , my fees shrank to $3600 one year , and to $2400 the next year . Yet , even though my income has been fixed at $10,000 annually  --  nothing to brag about  --  the job more than makes up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We bankrupts  --  movie stars , theatrical producers , profligate millionaires , night-club owners , kept women , arrant crooks . Always their explanation is the same ? " I did n't realize how much money I was spending until it was too late . " Generally , this is an honest story . I can always spot a lie , for I hear the same ones year after year . The perpetrators , more often than not , do business in speculative or volatile lines such as textiles , women 's clothing , furs , costume jewelry and restaurants . Liar No. 1 , a common type , hides his account books and then tells me a pitiful story : " I was riding on the subway , on the way to see my lawyer . I had my ledgers in a brief case at my feet . I fell asleep and did n't wake up until the train pulled into my station . I got off in a hurry , forgetting the brief case . I rushed back , but by then the train had pulled out and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately authorize his trustee in bankruptcy to begin turn-over proceedings which will compel him to return the books . Unless he crashes through with them , I cite him for civil contempt . Liar No. 2 is more elaborate . He relies on the horses for his alibi . One man who married a furniture store ? tha t that is to say , he married the daughter of the furniture-store owner and accepted the business as his dowry  --  made off with $3414 . His testimony followed the classic line : He did business with a bookmaker , whose name and number he wrote on the wall . Then the cleaning woman washed it off , and he could n't remember the man 's name . He spent four and one-half months in jail before he came across with the cash . Liar No. 3 relies on tire or robbery to substantiate his losses . One merchant really worked out a whopper to account for the disappearance of $5000 . " I love money so much that I always carried that five thousand dollars  --  in five bills  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told me . " One Friday night I lit the candles on the living-room table and spread out the money so I could admire it . It was windy , and the flame set the bills on fire . They burned up while I yelled for help . " I did n't believe him . I authorized turnover proceedings , and the $5000 showed up in a bank account under his wife 's name . Sometimes , however , a man will stick to his fabrications or flatly refuse to make an accounting . That 's all right with me , if he does n't mind a spell in jail . Some bankrupts enjoy life in a cell . They eat pretty well , they have comparative freedom and their families can visit them . After a decent interval , they apply to a Federal judge , asking to be purged of contempt and pleading sickness or a family crisis . Eventually , some judge is likely to believe the sob story , and they 'll be freed to spend the cash they held out on me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always pay dividends . A tongue-tied dress manufacturer , who cached away $8700 before he filed in bankruptcy , is making this discovery right now . The Constitution outlaws double jeopardy ? the prosecution of a man more than once for the same offense . As the result of some technicalities , however , this particular swindler is undergoing triple jeopardy . First of all , I cited him for contempt when he refused to turn over his books . He walked happily off to the House of Detention on West 11th Street , expecting to go free in a few months . Next , to his consternation , the FBI had him indicted for concealing assks , a criminal offense to which he pleaded guilty . The judge gave him three and a half years , but he wo n't start serving this prison term until he clears up the contempt citation , either by producing the books or by providing a convincing explanation . To add to his woes , I finally ordered him to come across with the qwq The officials of the New York bank , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to still another lending institution for $280,000 , they were delighted to certify him as a sound risk . This got them into a peck of trouble . The district attorney of New York County prosecuted three of the bank 's officers on a charge of furnishing false credit information , a misdemeanor . He charged that they actually knew that Benjamin was a fraud ? that he was n't manufacturing $100,000 worth of jacks for his Chicago customer ? before they certified to his credit standing . A jury convicted them , but the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed the verdict . The case is now pending , on the state 's appeal , in the Court of Appeals , the highest judicial body in New York . The bank officials deny the charges , insisting that they really believed Benjamin 's story . That Benjamin was a crook should be amply clear by now . My interest was in discovering what he did with his money . Some of it he actually gambled away . He played gin rummy at five cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth of a cent a point to be ample . He bought a horse for $3000 and sold it for $1000 when it turned out to be a loser in races . He said that he paid $115,000 to a bookmaker , using corporate funds , which made the whole transaction illegal under Federal laws . We were able to trace $65,000 of his company 's checks to a single bookie . I got back this money by issuing a turnover order , which requires the recipient of moneys paid out illegally by a bankrupt or disbursed in anticipation of bankruptcy to hand them back . Even if Benjamin had settled these bets out of his own pocket , I still could have collected them . In New York , bets made of the race track , and thus out- ? To date , I have recovered $147,000 of Benjamin 's money . That leaves us with $350,000 still to locate . I am positive  --  though of course I ca n't prove it  --  that he has this money salted away against the day he comes out of prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to repay him for his current discomfort . I do n't intend to close his case until I have exhausted every possibility of recovering the missing $350,000 . Actually , Benjamin did n't have to turn crooked . He had a desirable product , and his trustee in bankruptcy made $84,100 profit by operating the factory until he could dispose of it by auction . My guess is that Benjamin was a little crazy . His greed may have unhinged his mind , at least where money was concerned . That often happens to men who think that the code of business ethics can be disregarded ? and almost invariably they get caught . Sometimes , in borderline cases , I find it hard to establish who 's telling the truth . One little fellow insisted that thieves had stolen 7000 ladies ' hats from his store . The creditors doubted him , but the police established that " cat " burglars , working through a hole in the ceiling , were indeed responsible . In another case , I accepted as whole truth a story which later turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman because a policeman confirmed his testimony that robbers were to blame for the loss of several thousand dollars ' worth of merchandise . Several years later the attorney for the creditors got to know this same cop very well when they worked together on another case . " I took a hundred-buck bribe from that guy , " said the policeman , " but I 'm telling you in confidence . If you ever go into court with my story , I 'll deny it up and down . " I was furious when the attorney told me how I 'd been bamboozled , but there was not a thing I could do about it . Had the policeman been willing to stand by his story , I 'd have reopened the case and cited the swindling merchant for contempt . The people who have my wholehearted sympathy are those who get into trouble through no fault of their own . One pitiful chap wound up in bankruptcy because his rich uncle left him a farm in Michigan and 500 shares in a New York bank . When the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high that he could n't pay it , and the property was sold for taxes . The 500 shares were part of the stock of the Bank of the United States , which collapsed with a $46,000,000 thud in late 1930 . In accordance with the law , the New York State Banking Commissioner ordered him to pay an assessment of $50,000 , a sum equal to the par value of the stock . At that point he threw up his hands and petitioned himself into bankruptcy . Right now I 'm hearing from hundreds of veterans  --  poor devils who sank their life savings into business operations for which experience had not fitted them . One ex-sergeant went into frozen foods , a terribly overcrowded field just after the war . He lost every cent , and he was a bitter man when he took the stand . " Please hurry my case , judge , " he said to me . " I 'm disgusted with civilian life , and I 've signed up to go back into the Army next week . " I discharged him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old regiment under his wartime colonel . He must be even more bitter now , for frozen foods have become a profitable commodity . He suffered the penalty common to all pioneers . In the early ' 30 's , emphasizing this point , I closed out a television company . Its backers invested fifteen years too soon . A while back , I discharged from bankruptcy a woman who flew in flowers from Hawaii for the New York trade . That 's quite a business now . She was one of the few woman bankrupts , incidentally , who had a head for figures . She was able to tell me exactly what went wrong . Most women who come into my court are apt to be gaily ignorant of the most elementary business principles . Nita Naldi , a star of the silent screen , made a lot of money in her day , yet all she could hand over to the creditors was a brace of pawn tickets for two diamond pins and a diamond ring . Marguerite Basil Miles , divorced wife of Henry H. Rogers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once in bankruptcy , she had to stop charging things at the fashionable stores . Her money was tied up in a trust , so it took me twelve years before I could pay off the creditors 100 cents on the dollar , plus interest . Once , by taking a personal interest in a woman bankrupt , I forestalled a society scandal . She was a dowdy little thing in her middle forties , and I could n't understand why she had spent so much on the wrong kind of jewelry and clothing . Then her attorney whispered to me that she was the mistress of a prominent businessman , who had established a trust fund for her . The trust was n't big enough , and she ran into debt . I had the lawyer get the businessman on the phone and explain to him that his name would have to go into the record unless he paid up . He produced the money , so I kept his name a secret . One woman tried to hold out assets on me , and her case wound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had hidden away a lot of valuables before filing in bankruptcy . Bit by bit , she grudgingly admitted to a bank account under a fictitious name , a safe-deposit box in an upstate bank under a second pseudonym , and furniture under still a third name . One of my questions pulled the trigger . Screaming with rage , she leaped from the stand , pounced on a man in the front row , raked her fingernails across his face and stamped on his eyeglasses . He was her estranged sweetheart , and he had tipped me off . It does n't pay to keep secrets from me , as this incident proves . Tell the truth , and you 'll find me sympathetic , whether you run a delicatessen in the Bronx or a night club on 52d Street . Because I love the theater and the bright lights , my heart always goes out to Broadway characters who have tumbled down the financial ladder . One day I took the bench to find Archie Selwyn , the producer , sitting there , flat broke . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hit play , which you helped to produce , I ca n't help wondering what became of your millions , " I said to him . " Tell me what happened . " " It 's simple , " Selwyn said bitterly . " My brother Edgar and I put it into what we thought was the safest investment in the world , real estate on Forty-second Street between Eighth Avenue and Broadway . We had half a dozen theaters there , but then the street started to go downhill . Other producers built on Forty-fifth Street , and we were stranded . Look at Forty-second Street now ! Flea circuses and second-run movie houses . We lost every one of our theaters before we finished . " A short time after I disposed of Selwyn 's bankruptcy , the late Benny Leonard , a fine fighter and an honest fellow , showed up in a similar predicament . He turned out to be the world 's best-meaning individual , but an odd kind of businessman . Even while his Tally-Ho Grill , on 72d Street near Broadway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new debts . You might say he went through bankruptcy twice , though I handled it all in one package . What , always amazes me in these night-club cases is the naive attitude of the creditors . These people are gluttons for punishment . The meat merchant , the baker and the liquor dealer may get only five to ten cents on the dollar , but still they 'll go back and sell to the same crowd under another name . Talk about suckers ! The Broadway wise guy is the worst . The average citizen who invests in an enterprise that goes broke is not immune from the disease known as finan cial myopia . In every bankruptcy , I 'm required to send a notice to each creditor . I sent out 130,000 cards to wind up ' 48 , The Magazine of the Year , which did n't last through ' 48 . Another 50,000 cards went to Insull stockholders . One of the latter came back with some cryptic characters scribbled on it , accompanied by an apology from a college professor . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returned it with a notarized proof of claim , which established his right to share in any dividends that might be paid . As it turned out , the professor was pleasantly surprised to receive a little money . I wound up the case , involving the National Electric Power Company , with $50,000 still on my hands . Stockholders who had mailed me a proof of claim within six months of receipt of my post card , the legal time limit , split the melon . Those who ignored my notice  --  most of them did  --  were out of luck . They had a free chance in a lottery , and they turned it down . The same thing happened to the stockholders of the Santa Fe Gold and Copper Mining Company , practically all of whom gave my notice the cold shoulder . A handful of them , who sent in proofs of claim , shared an $8000 residue after we liquidated the property . Almost everybody including me , thought that the mine was a total loss . I paid the trustee a substantial fee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of fees , perhaps you wonder why I distribute up to 25 per cent of a bankrupt 's assets to the trustee , lawyer and accountant . The percentage varies , but my answer does n't . If I do n't give these men an adequate fee , they 'll never handle another bankruptcy case for me . A good trustee , diligent in unearthing assets ; a good lawyer , skilled in the complex procedures of bankruptcy court ; and a good accountant , able to make sense out of cryptic business ledgers , deserve to be paid well for their work . I do n't countenance excessive fees . Some lawyers know this , so they pad their bills , hoping for half the sum they request . I 'm really tough on these greedy individuals , and how they yell ! Some of them do n't even see me when they pass me on the street . Yet , when a case is complex , I figure the fees accordingly . Motty Eitingon , the mouton king , failed for $16,000,000 . Mouton is sheepskin , processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Eitingon bankruptcy still is pending . I have paid the attorneys for the trustee $409,000 , every cent of which they earned by hard work on behalf of the creditors . There were thirty-two separate corporations involved , and the testimony runs to thousands of pages . My job as referee is a nonpolitical one , and a nice change from the 1920 's when I made hundreds of speeches as a Republican Party leader in New York County . There were no amplifiers in those days , so my voice now has a permanent rasp . In seventeen years on the bench , I 've stayed strictly clear of politics , though you might be able to guess my former affiliation by glancing at the eighty-two miniature elephants cluttering the desk in my private office . I 'm sixty-five now , just starting a new six-year term , which I hope wo n't be my last . It 's rewarding work , and I love it . Until I do retire , I 'm going to continue to devote all my energies to the accomplishment of three major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for honest bankrupts , and hopeful for corporations that deserve to be saved from ruin .
