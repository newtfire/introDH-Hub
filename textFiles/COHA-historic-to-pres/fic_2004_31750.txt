July 5 , 1798 The south of Ireland near Askeaton Castle Gerald O'Neill rushed into the manor house , his once-white shirt crimson , his tan britches and navy coat equally stained . Blood marred his cheek , matted his whiskers . An open gash on his head was bleeding and so were the cuts on his knuckles . His heart beat with alarming force and even now the sounds of battle , the cries of imminent death , rang in his eardrums . " Mary ! Mary ! Get into the cellar now ! " he roared . Devlin O'Neill could not move , stunned . His father had been gone for more than a month - since the middle of May . He had sent word , though , every few weeks , and while Devlin was only ten years old , he was acutely aware of the war at hand . Farmer and priest , shepherd and squire , peasant and gentry alike had risen up to fight the English devils once and for all , to take back all that was truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them a century ago . There was so much hope - and there was so much fear . Now his heart seemed to simply stop and he stared at his father , relieved to finally see him again and terribly afraid . He was afraid that Gerald was hurt - and he was afraid of far worse . He started forward with a small cry , but Gerald did not stop moving , going to the bottom of the stairs and bellowing for his wife again . His hand never left the scabbard that sheathed his cutlass , and he carried a musket as well . Devlin had never seen his eyes so wild . Dear God . " Is Father hurt ? " a tiny voice whispered beside him , a small hand plucking at his torn linen sleeve . Devlin did n't even look at his dark-haired younger brother . He could not take his eyes from his father , his mind spinning , racing . The rebels had taken Wexford town early in the rebellion and the entire county had rejoiced . Well , the papist part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but so had other defeats . Now redcoats were everywhere ; Devlin had spied thousands from a ridge just that morning , the most ominous sight he 'd ever seen . He 'd heard that Wexford had fallen , and a maid had said thousands had died at New Ross . He 'd refused to believe it - until now . Now he thought that maybe the whispers of defeat and death were true . Because he saw fear in his father 's eyes for the first time in his young life . " Is Father hurt ? " Sean asked again , a tremor in his tone . Instantly Devlin turned to him . " I do n't think so , " he said , knowing he had to be brave , at least for Sean . But fear gripped him in a clawlike vise . And then his mother came rushing down the stairs , her infant daughter in her arms . " Gerald ! Thank God , I 've been so worried about you , " she cried , as pale as any ghost . He seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . " Take the boys and go down to the cellar , " Gerald said harshly . " Now , Mary . " She cried out , her blue eyes filled with fear , riveted on his face . " Are you hurt ? " " Just do as I say , " he cried , pulling her across the hall . The baby , Meg , began to wail . " And keep her quiet , for God 's sake , " he said as harshly . But now he was looking over his shoulder at the open doorway , as if expecting to see the British soldiers in pursuit . Devlin followed his gaze . Smoke could be seen in the clear blue sky and suddenly the sounds of muskets firing could be heard . Mary pushed the babe against her breast as she opened her blouse , never breaking stride . " What will happen to us , Gerald ? " And then , lower , " What will happen to you ? " He opened the door to the cellar , the opening hidden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said harshly . " You and the boys , the babe , all will be fine . " She stared up at him , her eyes filling with tears . " I 'm not hurt , " he added thickly , and he kissed her briefly on the lips . " Now go downstairs and do not come out until I say so . " Mary nodded and went down . Devlin rushed forward as a cannon boomed , terribly close to the manor . " Father ! Let me come with you - I can help . I can shoot - " Gerald whirled , striking Devlin across the head , and he flew across the stone floor , landing on his rump . " Do as I say , " he roared , and as he ran back through the hall , he added , " And take care of your mother , Devlin . " The front door slammed . Devlin blinked back tears of despair and humiliation and found himself looking at Sean . There was a question in his younger brother 's pale gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet , shaking like a puny child . There was no question of what he had to do . He had never disobeyed his father before but he was n't going to let his father face the redcoats he 'd seen earlier alone . If Father was going to die , then he 'd die with him . Fear made him feel faint . He faced his little brother , breathing hard , willing himself to be a man . " Go down with Mother and Meg . Go now , " he ordered quietly . Without waiting to see if he was being obeyed , Devlin rushed through the hall and into his father 's library . " You 're going to fight , are n't you ? " Sean cried , following him . Devlin did n't answer . A purpose filled him now . He ran to the gun rack behind his father 's massive desk and froze in dismay . It was empty . He stared in disbelief . And then he heard the soldiers . He heard men shouting and horses whinnying . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close by . Shots from pistols punctuated the musket fire . He slowly turned to Sean and their gazes locked . Sean 's face was pinched with fear - the same fear that was making Devlin 's heart race so quickly that he could barely breathe . Sean wet his lips . " They 're close , Dev . " He could barely make his mouth form the words , " Go to the cellar . " He had to help his father . He could n't let Father die alone . " I 'm not leaving you alone . " " You need to take care of Mother and Meg , " Devlin said , racing to the bench beneath the gun rack . He tore the pillows from the seat and hefted the lid open . He was disbelieving - Father always kept a spare pistol there , but there was nothing but a dagger . A single , stupid , useless prick of a dagger . " I 'm coming with you , " Sean said , his voice broken with tears . Devlin took the dagger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a sharp letter opener as well . He handed it to Sean . His brother smiled grimly at him - Devlin could n't smile back . And then he saw the rusty antique display of a knight in his armor in the corner of the room . It was said that an infamous ancestor , once favored by an English queen , had worn it . Devlin ran to the statue , Sean on his heels as if attached by a short string . There , he shimmied the sword free from the knight 's gauntlet , knocking over the tarnished armor . Devlin 's spirits lifted . The sword was old and rusted , but it was a weapon , by God . He withdrew it from the hilt , touched the blade and gasped as blood spurted from his fingertip . Then he looked at Sean . The brothers shared a grin . The cannon boomed and this time the house shook , glass shattering in the hall outside . The boys blinked at each other , wide-eyed , their fear renewed . Devlin wet his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Meg . " " No . " He felt like whacking his brother on the head the way Gerald had struck him . But he was also secretly relieved not to have to face the red hordes alone . " Then let 's go , " Devlin said . ( Continues ... )
