" This is not a toy anymore . This is a revolutionary leap , " says Sega 's Michael Ribero , and for once the hardware may meet the hype halfway . <p> Sega and Sony roll out the heavy video-game artillery today at the Electronic Entertainment Expo here , with powerful ( and more expensive ) systems due in September . Nintendo follows next April with an even more advanced machine , which at the last moment the company decided not to display at E3 . <p> For the first time , video games approach reality : You 're in the driver 's seat , behind the punches , atop a dragon . The 16-bit games to date are two-dimensional environments with pedestrian colors ; Sega 's Saturn and Sony 's PlayStation use multiple 32-bit processors , giving them power beyond the average PC and rivaling that of the advanced computers developers use to conjure video game magic . <p> If the battle seems pitched , it 's because the stakes are huge . Last year , Americans spent up to $ 6 billion on video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . With newcomers like Sony jumping into the fray , and prices on the rise , anything could happen . <p> " The platform wars before were skirmishes compared to the one that 's about to begin , " says Sony 's Steve Race . <p> A lineup of high-priced systems " is a fast way to kill the industry . I do n't know how the kid or the parents will decide which one to buy , " says Bob Gerson , editor of industry weekly TWICE . " I 'm afraid they 're just going to get confused and stop buying . " <p> Sega and Sony seem confident . Their systems have sold about half a million each since going on sale last year in Japan . But in the USA , sales of the $ 400 3DO system have been disappointing . <p> Lew Alton , managing partner of industry analyst L.H. Alton &; Co. , says price is " a consideration . " But he sees a paradigm shift similar to that which made TV sets a household necessity . " Kids 16 and younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not a passing interest . " <p> And the new game systems , with their realistic graphics , smooth game play and vibrant , 3-D environments , can only fuel that fascination . <p> The bodies of the gladiators in games like Sega 's Virtua Fighter and Sony 's Battle Arena Toshinden have the fullness of on-screen actors . And the perspective changes - the camera " moves " as in a film - as the action progresses ; you zoom in and swivel as fighters get closer together . <p> In racing games , Daytona USA ( Sega ) and Ridge Racer ( Sony ) offer views that literally put players in the driver 's seat to get a feel for what auto racing must be like . In Daytona , your car even gathers dents as you go . <p> Arcade-style scrolling games also gain new life . In Bug , being developed by Sega for Saturn , the 3-D character travels along a path . But it 's not left-right and up-down as in Sonic the Hedgehog , but in a dimensional space " into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bug 's avoidance of a wave of grasshoppers coming from the back of the screen toward and past him is a striking effect similar to the wildebeest stampede in The Lion King . <p> " We can now provide an experience so immersive that we will actually be able to suspend disbelief , " boasts Sega 's Ribero . <p> Even the 16-bit systems gain from the learning curve . Nintendo 's Ultra 64 developers , on a lark , tried a dose of their technology on its current Super NES . What resulted was Donkey Kong Country , which sold 3.5 million copies in the USA and another 3 million worldwide to became the top selling game of all time . <p> Nintendo 's strategy in the coming battle reflects that success : While the new systems slug it out this fall , Nintendo plans to play off the confusion with better 16-bit Super NES games . <p> Kong 's advanced computer modeling techniques , generated on powerful systems made by Silicon Graphics ( one of Nintendo 's Ultra 64 partners ) , will show up again later this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instinct , originally designed for Ultra 64 , and in Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy 's Kong Quest . <p> Instinct , due out this August , is so impressive the company thinks it can sell 4 million in the USA , says Nintendo 's Peter Main . " This is going to be some three-way brawl ( with Sega and Sony ) , " he says . Players " will have to decide whether to plunk down $ 400 to bring home the other guys ' fighting game or $ 70 to $ 75 to play Killer Instinct . " <p> Then , next year , Ultra 64 will premiere - for less than $ 250 , says the company - having given Nintendo an extra eight months to develop better games . " That 's what Nintendo has always done really well , " says Silicon Graphics ' George Zachary . <p> Many software manufacturers are hedging their bets , making similar games for many platforms . Time Warner Interactive is putting out Primal Rage for every system in stores this year . Electronic Arts is bringing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saturn , PlayStation and 3DO . <p> LucasArts , on the other hand , is developing different games for the big three , but is placing a heavy bet on the Ultra 64 . The company , which has had a string of hit Star Wars games over the last few years , plans a " major Star Wars marketing campaign " around an action-adventure game called Shadows of the Empire , a title due exclusively for Ultra 64 next year , says LucasArts ' president Randy Komisar . <p> The game introduces new characters and a new plot that takes place in " a different part of the Star Wars universe , " he says . <p> The final judges , as always , will be game fans . Doug Burton , 32 , of Bellevue , Ky. , gives a slight early advantage to Sony , " because when Sony does something they do it well . " <p> Nintendo loses points because game fanatics do n't like to wait and Ultra 64 cartridges may cost more than current ones , Burton says . Sega may have upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because few games were released . Gamers " will view Sega suspiciously , wondering how soon it will be before they drop the Saturn in favor of another new machine . " <p> A market leader may not emerge until 1997 , says Patrick Ferrell of Infotainment World , which is co-producing the E3 Expo and publishes Electronic Entertainment and GamePro magazines . <p> He says industry estimates suggest that 40 million of the next generation systems will be in homes by the year 2000 : " It 's anybody 's game for the next four to five years . " <p> Other game-system entrants : <p>  --  Virtual Boy . In August , Nintendo releases a 3-D stand-alone system that uses mirrored eye-stations to turn red line images into an immersive experience , for $ 179.95 ( games $ 40-$ 50 ) . Blockbuster Video will rent the system and two games for $ 9.99 , with a coupon for $ 10 off purchase price . <p>  --  3DO , under $ 400 , looks better all the time , but still has sold fewer than 500,000 . Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video and gameplay . <p>  --  NEO*GEO came out more than three years ago for $ 600 , with $ 100-plus games . A CD-based NEO*GEO , due this fall , is less than $ 500 , games less than $ 80 . <p>  --  Atari Jaguar can run with the big dogs and its price is dropping ( under $ 160 ) . But fewer than 200,000 systems have sold ; still waiting on a promised CD add-on . <p>  --  Philips CD-i sold about 1 million worldwide and its price has dropped under $ 400 , but it has never really caught gamers ' eyes . Starting this fall , a new volley of video game systems hits stores . How the contenders look : Sega Saturn <p>  --  Basics : Eight-chip " parallel processing " scheme includes three 32-bit chips ; plays new CD games , music CDs and photo CDs . <p>  --  Due : Sept. 2 , for $ 350-$ 450 <p>  --  Games at release : Twenty ; arcade hit Virtua Fighter is included with the unit , as is a 20-game sampler disc ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sega makes great games , but consumers have n't embraced a system this expensive before . Overwhelming support of game developers should help . <p>  --  Hands-on : Virtua Fighter plays as smooth as in arcades ; Panzer Dragon makes you 're a dragon-rider in a fantasy world straight out of Heavy Metal magazine . <p> Sony PlayStation <p>  --  Basics : Uses a single customized 32-bit " system on a chip " as a processor and separate chip for graphics . <p>  --  Due : Sept. 9 , $ 300-$ 350 . <p>  --  Games at release : About 25 , including Battle Arena Toshinden , ESPN Extreme Games . Prices similar to today 's games . <p>  --  Outlook : Nearly as much game developer support as Saturn , plus Sony 's marketing clout . Could be a winner , especially at lower price . <p>  --  Hands-on : Different type of controller than Saturn 's , with lots of options , but same smooth on-screen graphics . <p> Nintendo Ultra 64 <p>  --  Basics : Plays new cartridge games ; uses a 64-bit processor and separate graphics chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 . <p>  --  Games at release : Most likely , Killer Instinct and George Lucas ' new Star Wars game . <p>  --  Outlook : Nintendo is arguably the best at making games ; if buyers balk at other system 's high prices , could leapfrog everyone next year .
