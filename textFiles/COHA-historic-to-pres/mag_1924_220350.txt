What Use to Write Books , Poems ? <P> <P> Zona Gale , novelist , poet , playwright , always comes to my mind when a discussion of pacificism arises , because the accomplishment of World Peace with her is so impassioned a crusade . She is the sort of person who does not eat meat or wear furs because she believes it is wrong to kill animals for the luxury of mankind . I should like to have her meet Prof. Grindell-Matthews , famed inventor of the death-ray ( TIME , Apr. 21 , SCIENCE ) as I met him the other morning , and to see the motion picture of his experiments . What would she have to say to him , I wonder ; for he is a quiet , shy , slight Englishman , just as shy and as quiet as is she , and he claims to be a devout advocate of World Peace , advocating fighting war with its own instruments . Yet when I had seen two reels of his dreams , there seemed nothing to say . He went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had chanced to see the picture spoke to him . There was absolutely nothing to say . <P> A beam of light shoots from a projector . It seeks out a mouse in its cage . The mouse blinks , surprised , into the glow . A switch is turned . Terrible energy flies along the beam . The mouse jumps into the air , quivers , is dead . So , in the future , Prof. Grindell-film such prophetic visions-the death ray will sweep whole armies into oblivion , whole cities into bleak , smoldering ruins , explode bombs in midair , blow up ammunition dumps from great distances ; in a word , make existence for those who do not possess its mysterious secret impossible , and , so he says , end war . <P> This is a dream worthy of H. G. Wells ; but too long thinking about it will send anyone of imagination into a mood of depression .

What time will anyone have for reading ? <P> Ah , well , what I saw the other morning was , after all , only a shy little Englishman trying to put across an invention , just as scared , doubtless , as the youngest ingnue trying out her first speaking line on Broadway . The human comedy is just as amusing , just as pathetic , just as worth playing and writing as ever ; and Death , whether by death-ray or automobile accident , just as cruel , kind and inevitable as ever-just as inevitable as bad novels and good novels coming in a steady stream across my desk .
