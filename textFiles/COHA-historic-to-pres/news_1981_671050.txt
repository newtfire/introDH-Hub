It is in the middle levels where " the crunch will come , " she predicts . According to Dr. Linda Keller Brown , of Columbia ' s Center for the Social Sciences , these studies indicate that this crunch has to do with the reluctance of American companies to send women abroad for management experience. // " Because foreign profits are so important , companies can not have people in upper management who do not have foreign experience , " she said recently in an interview at her Columbia office . " But these companies are not yet willing to send women abroad on foreign assignments . They think that women will not be accepted in third world countries or in countries like Japan , where there are few women managers. " // // Future in Jeopardy // " Without this foreign experience , " Dr. Brown added , " the woman manager ' s future in the company will be compromised. " // Dr. Brown has written a new book based on her analysis of the studies , called " The Woman Manager in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business and Professional Women ' s Foundation in Washington. // She was also speaking from her experience as director of the center ' s Cross-National Project on Women as Corporate Managers . In that role , she analyzes the economic and social factors affecting the leadership of women in business in the United States and several foreign countries . The project is financed by the Ford Foundation and the German Marshall Fund . <> <> Success in Foreign Countries // Calling the reluctance of corporations to send women abroad " one kind of fly in the ointment , " Dr. Brown said she thought that women did much better in foreign countries than was commonly thought. // " They do very well in Thailand and the Philippines , " she said . " And anyone who goes to Japan is considered an outsider . A woman going into that situation with a high enough rank would be at an advantage . She would be considered so unusual that the Japanese would go out of their way for her. " // Dr. Brown characterized the situation for women managers in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but added that the change was not as great as indicated in the news media. // " The press has conveyed the impression of a tremendous change , which has not yet happened , " she said . " The situation is more like a big tub of hot water , with a few cold drops coming into it . It takes a while for the temperature to change . " <> <> Change at Business Schools // She said the major change taking place was at the business school level , where 28 percent of the students in the top American schools are women . She said that about 15 percent of today ' s management trainees were women , compared with only 1 percent in the mid-1960 ' s . And 36 percent of corporate boards now have women directors , she said , as opposed to 11 percent in 1973. // " The key to what happens to women in the next few years probably lies with the the older male managers , " Dr. Brown said . " How they view women is very important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Al Neuharth of the Gannett newspaper chain . Both have outstanding records of seeking top management talent , regardless of sex. " // Quoting from studies mentioned in her book , Dr. Brown said that the greatest discrimination toward women in business came from male business school students . " Much of this student antipathy toward women results from the fear of more competition for fewer jobs in a poor economy , " she said . <> <> The Mentor Concept // The 38-year-old social scientist said she thought the notion that mentors were important to a woman ' s advancement was " overblown. " // " It doesn ' t hurt to have friends , " she said . " But one study , by J.J. Speizer , shows that the popularity of the mentor concept tends to reinforce the male-dominated organizational status quo. " // She was more enthusiastic about the value of women ' s networks to women in business . " They ' re crucial if a woman is going to change jobs , " she said . " This is especially true in business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women in other fields have. " // Adding to the value of networks , she said , is the fact that 48 percent of all jobs come through personal contacts and that in management the percentage is " much , much higher. " // In the area of salaries , the most recent census statistics showed that only 102 , 000 female managers earned over $25 , 000 , compared with 2 , 560 , 000 males . And according to one study in Dr. Brown ' s book , the wage differential between men and women managers was actually worse than the national earnings average . Nationally , women earn 62 percent of what men earn ; women in managerial and administrative jobs earn 60 percent of what men earn . <> <> Type of Jobs an Issue // " Part of the problem is the kind of jobs women have gone into in management , " Dr. Brown said . " They are most heavily in health administration , general office administration , the food area and the retail trade area . Those are not particularly well-paying fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that despite the stereotype of female managers as being more helpful , intuitive and understanding than male managers , studies done in this area had shown that male and female managers had more characteristics in common than they had differences . One study of 2 , 000 male and female managers in 1980 found " a significant case of no significant difference , " she said. // One difference that showed up in another study was that male managers considered personnel decisions the most important part of their jobs , while women rated task decisions highest - a reversal of the stereotype that women are oriented toward relationships and men toward tasks. // Another lingering difference is that the women managers in the studies were only a third to a half as likely as male managers to be married. // " Compared with the general population , " Dr. Brown writes in her book , " a substantially larger percentage of women in middle management are not married , and those who are married tend to marry late. " // Among the reasons cited in the studies were dedication to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the kind of " power-motivated " men that women managers were likely to meet at work preferred dependent wives. // Anyone wanting to order a copy of " The Woman Manager in the United States " should send $5. 50 to the Business and Professional Women ' s Supply Service , 11722 Parklawn Drive , Rockville , Md. 20852. //
