In the eyes of many South Vietnamese , Tran Van Huong represents the forces of decency and honesty in this country . It is this reputation that Mr. Huong is running on . It is this reputation that has made him the leading civilian candidate for president . South Vietnamese relate that when Mr. Huong was Mayor of Saigon he refused all bribes and kickbacks ; that he scraped together enough money to live only because some of his former lycee students insisted he take a paying job as secretary of their dentists association . Saigonnais know also that when he was Premier , Mr. Huong rode to work on a bicycle . Such unpretentiousness is rare in a land of easy corruption . It is admired by numbers of South Vietnamese , who have contributed whatever they could afford to Mr. Huong 's campaign . According to the candidate 's own report , some 600,000 piastres ( about $5,400 ) have come in spontaneous small donations , many of them anonymous . Mr. Huong speaks further of widespread student support . He says that what touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students who have come up to him and said they were in error when they demonstrated against him in 1964 and would like to help him now . During his troubled three months as Pre-mier , Mr. Huong took an adamant stand against the Army , against Buddhists , and against students who allied themselves with the Buddhists . That was three years ago , however . Observers do not generally expect that Mr. Huong would be equally forceful ? in any direction ? in office today . They say they do not consider him tough enough , either physically or temperamentally , to be a strong leader . Some questions regarding his health have arisen . And he has not developed hard issues of governmental policy in the campaign . Interference ' stressed He has stressed government interference with his campaign and his campaign workers to the virtual exclusion of policy issues . ( In fairness it should be added that the other civilian candidates , by and large , have been equally vague . ) Yet Mr. Huong is the symbol of unambiguous honesty to many South Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week to serve as premier in any government headed by Generals Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky so important  --  and so disappointing ? to Americans who had hoped that the campaign could serve to bring about some kind of united government rather than to push the military and civilian segments farther apart . Mr. Huong 's distaste for greed , for " mercantilism , " for abuse of power and those who are interested only in power is unfeigned , as anyone who speaks with him is quickly convinced . If he dwells at length on the humiliation of the first day of the campaign , if he demands that Chief of State Thieu and Pre* // *Huong builds appeal to Vietnam voters // mier Ky not only speak at the joint candidates rallies but even travel with the candidates on the same plane , this represents as much a deep conviction that absolute fairness should prevail as a tactical maneuver or an appeal to the American public over the heads of the Vietnamese public . One issue that Mr. Huong does bring up repeatedly in his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . Here again it is his honesty that he runs on . The procedures he proposes to achieve peace do not differ greatly from the government 's . He has denied rumors that there are neutralists in his camp and that he would negotiate with the National Liberation Front as such . He would negotiate only with Hanoi , he has stated . But his position does differ from the government 's in that he says the war can not be won militarily but must be won politically by rallying the people to the government 's side . Here he sees himself as the only leader who can do this , who can overcome the present " crisis of authority " or " crisis of confidence " in the government . Source of support Mr. Huong 's strongest support comes from southern loyalists . They resent control of the Saigon government by Premier Ky and other northerners . He is generally considered to have the best campaign organization going for a civilian , and the backbone of this is the " interschool group " of graduates of Southern Buddhists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern voters . Mr. Huong has not appealed to regionalism overtly in the campaign , but he is well known as a stanch Southerner . And one of the three senatorial tickets informally associated with him is headed by the wife of Tran Van Van , the assemblyman and southern spokesman who was assassinated last December . Mr. Huong is not likely to draw all the Southern votes . The Southerners in general have displayed less energy and talent for . politics than Northerners . Other Southern presidential candidates , some of whom entered the campaign at the persuasion of Premier Ky , will pull votes away from Mr. Huong . Rumors that the other civilian candidates might withdraw in Mr. Huong 's favor have not materialized . Voters attracted In addition , Mr. Huong appears as of now to be attracting middle-class voters and intellectuals to his side more succes ' fully than poor workers or peasants .. The success of this leading civilian ticket will depend , Mr. Huong says , on the intellectuals in Saigon  --  where there is less opportunity for pressure and intimidation than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be voting under the-watchful eye of soldiers stationed to guard the polling booths . If he is defeated , Mr. Huong says flatly that he will retire from politics . " I am not a man of politics , " he explains , " I am a simple professor . " " The door is shut " on any premiership that might be offered him by the military government .
