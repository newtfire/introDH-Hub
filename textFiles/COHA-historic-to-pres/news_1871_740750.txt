At last , we have a sample of the sort of defense by which our estimable Mayor and our immaculate Controller hope to place their administration of the City finances above suspicion . The figures elsewhere given show far too little to satisfy the public demand for a detailed statement of City expenditures , and . prove a great deal too much to serve as a vindication of the men who are now on trial before the public on certain very specific and serious charges . The Herald published yesterday a report of an interview with Mayor HALL , in the course of which the Mayor took occasion to make some explanations , by way of introduction to the financial statement , " at the close of business July 31 , 1871 . " These explanations are almost as remarkable as the statement itself . The Mayor begins with a flimsy attempt to gloss over the truth , followed up by a direct perversion of it . The first is contained in the following sentences : " The last report of the Controller was of 1869. lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish an annual report . " Had the Mayor desired to state the exact truth ho would have said that the last report of the Controller was issued in 1869 , and covered the expenditures of the year 1868 . That he desired people to believe what was false is obvious from his further assertion that , " While the r text fiscal year was running , and about one quarter gone , the charter was passed audit repealed the old law about reports . In the old order of things the next annual report would have come up to January , 1871 , and have been printed about February last . " The next fiscal year was 1869 , and instead of coming down to January . 1871. the next annual report would of course have come down to January , 1870 . The Mayor wants the public to believe that it was only with reference to the first three months of 1870 that the Controller omitted to comply with the statutory enactment requiring published reports of his accounts , while he attempts to conceal the fact that no accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1871 , the omission with reference to the year 1869 being in direct contempt of the law . After the new charter came into operation , April 1 , 1870 , the Mayor admits that he alone was responsible for the publication of the Controller 's report . Section 31 of the charter is explicit on the point , or as the Mayor , with his accustomed felicity of expression remarks , " it was not his ( the Controller 's ) fault that one did not sooner appear ; it was were to publish proofs showing that onel not very eminent sinecurist receives $9,000 a year for work which he makes no pretense of performing , what answer would it be to point us to the Controller 's monthly statement , recapitulating under certain heads of expenditure certain totals whose correctness no tax-payers can verify and whose details are studiously kept out of sight I If the " statistical tables , " about which the Mayor talks so grandiloquently. are of this kind , he may as well spare the City the cost of printing them . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not in the slightest degree satisfy the public demand to know the whole truth . We have challenged the Mayor to show that our transcripts from the Controller 's books were not correctly made . He has , as we said . he would , utterly failed to impugn the accuracy of any of our figures . We have demanded from him , on behalf of the public , certain specific information which he seems determined to withhold . We shall probably come to his relief , some of these days . on subjects about which the publics is exceedingly desirous to have more information . mine for not asking . " After having , in this highly conclusive manner , done justice to his colleague , the Mayor promises that he will shortly justify himself . He makes a vague reference to certain " statistical tables , " which , because of being " huge , " and calculated to fill the major portion of " a dozen bound volumes , ' , are rather in arrears . It has been the misfortune of the TIMES , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figures , though it is some consolation to know that the " tables " for ' 68 and ' 69 are , in consequence of our statements , to be reprinted , ( the latter , be it noted , have never been printed at all , ) and that , consequently , we shall have become the means of introducing to the world some thirty " bound volumes " instead of a dozen . As a sort of commentary on this appalling mass of accounts . which are definitely promised this week , we are assured that the Mayor will write a message to the Board of Supervisors , accompanying the County figures , and one to the Common Council along with the City figures . The nature of these messages can not be better indicated , than in the choice language of their author : " In these messages , without being journalistic or personal , I will endeavor to dignifiedly satisfy the public mind and to the unprejudiced explain much that the partisan press has been befogging . " After so lucid and satisfactory an in troduotion. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monttly statements of City expenditure which are now promised in unbroken order . This production is confidently put forward in order to allay the public apprehensions on the score of our legal expenditures . How well it is calculated to do so may be gathered from the following considerations . It shows that during the last three months the City debt has been increased by the amount of $16,283,260 30 , or as we have explained below more in detail , at the rate of $5,427,753 43 per month . It shows that $67,740 83 was expended in July last for cleaning streets , which , nevertheless , remained shamefully filthy . It shows that in the various departments of the City Government there was paid for salaries in July the sum of $160,575 38 , or , at the rate of $1,926,904 56 per annum , and it does not show what proportion of this sum was drawn by men who gave no services in return . Under the head of county payments , it shows that there was expended on account of armories and drill-rooms the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess how many chairs were mended and pines soldered for the largest proportion of this modest sum . We find that in the Legislative , Executive , and Judiciary Departments of the county there was expended for salaries in July $97,934 56 , or at the rate of $1,175,214 72 per annum . The Controller does not enlighten the taxpayers as to how much of this sum is devoted to the maintenance of Court messengers , whose only work is drawing their salaries ; of stenographers , who would be puzzled to tell the meaning of the word under which they are described ; or of numerous watchmen and janitors , who. in that capacity , have an existence second column missing
