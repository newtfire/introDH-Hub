After the election came carnival . Posters blaring announcements of fiesta dances encroached on the tattered billboard images of Pern and Tamborini . Argentines who could afford it rushed off to the villas and casino of Mar del Plata . Yet Argentina , recovering slowly from the calmest election day-and bitterest campaign-in its history , was hardly in a carnival mood . It was still dazed . Juan Pueblo , the man on the Buenos Aires street corner , contemplating the strange , post-election calm , said " Parece raro-Seems funny . " <P> The Army , which had policed the elections , stayed on the job . In the 14 provinces soldiers stood guard while Government employes counted ballots in the presence of party representatives and newsmen . By week 's end barely 10% of the vote had been tallied . <P> All returns for crucial Buenos Aires province ( 88 of the 376 electoral votes ) were postponed till six small precincts , whose votes had been thrown out for possible fraud , could reballot next Sunday . Though Pern led , the tardy 88 votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> No matter who won the Presidency , Strong Man Juan Pern promised to remain the Strong Man of Argentina . His new Labor party piled up votes in working-class districts . It won seat after seat in Congress , even capturing all lesser offices in San Luis province which Tamborini had carried . If Tamborini by some miracle beat Pern , he would probably be confronted with a hostile Congress and unfriendly provincial governments . <P> The U.S. State Department 's attitude toward Pern was not likely to change . That attitude was founded on evidence , printed in last month 's Blue Book , that Juan Pern. had been hand-in-glove with U.S. enemies in World War II . But with Pern the winner , his country 's presence at the proposed Rio conference of American republics would be embarrassing to all , and most to the U.S. Prospects that the conference would meet this month-or even this spring-were growing dim .
