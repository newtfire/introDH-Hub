Nutritionist Marion Nestle stares in wonder at the latest bit of marketing wizardry to hit American sweetshops : sour green tamarind-flavored Shrek candies . She pops off the Shrek-shaped cap on a Crazy Hair confection and , after some initial befuddlement ( of a kind no one under 12 would suffer ) , turns a dial on the bottom of the plastic tube . Sticky strands of chartreuse goo extrude through a nozzle and " grow " upward in apparent defiance of gravity . " Wow ! " says Nestle , who has a deep appreciation for such ingenuity . She plunges in with a taste test . " Yech ! So sour ! " she complains . " And it sticks to your hands . " Popping on her reading glasses , Nestle , who chairs the department of nutrition , food studies and public health at New York University , casts a practiced eye on the label . " Nothing but sugar , corn syrup and a bunch of food additives , " she says , sighing . " What kid can resist this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven , Conn. , psychologist Kelly Brownell pulls out a full-page advertisement he has torn from the Wall Street Journal and marvels over the message . The ad displays a new snack-food product from Frito-Lay called Munchies Kids Mix , packaged , once again , in that child-friendly chartreuse hue . It reads , " Mom and Dad , you 'll feel great about offering it to your kids because Munchies Kids Mix is a good source of 8 essential vitamins and minerals , has 0 grams trans fat and meets nutritional guidelines established by Texas fitness expert Dr. Kenneth Cooper for sugar , fat and sodium . " The snack is a mix of Cheetos , Doritos , Rold Gold pretzels , SmartFood popcorn , Cap'n Crunch cereal and M &M-like; candy . " See what we 're up against ? " laments Brownell , who is director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders . " This is being promoted as a healthy product ? No wonder people are confused . " <P> For Nestle ( rhymes with wrestle ) , Brownell and a handful of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obesity epidemic has become more than a scientific quest for new data and better ways to help individual patients battle the bulge . It has become a crusade to change the way Americans live . The nation 's landscape , they argue , is littered with junk food masquerading as health food , candy and candylike cereals featuring kids ' favorite cartoon characters and toylike packaging , schools that shamelessly hawk soft drinks and snack foods , and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns to promote such unwholesome products . Schools , in particular , " have become nutritional disaster areas , " says Dr. David Ludwig , a Harvard pediatrician who directs the obesity program at Children 's Hospital Boston . Experts like Ludwig and Brownell are equally worried about what 's missing from the landscape : sidewalks and bike paths ; neighborhoods with safe , accessible parks and stores you can walk to ; daily physical-education classes in public schools ; and staircases in office buildings . " We 've created environments that are hostile to physical activity , " says psychologist James Sallis , director of the Active Living Research Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
