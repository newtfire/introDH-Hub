In support of Secretary WEEKS 'S proposal that General PERSHING-be retained on the active list after reaching the statutory . age of retirement on Sept. 13 , 1924 , it may be said that no other officer - of the army is so well qualified to organize the system of national defense required by the act of 1920 . General PERmanza as Chief of Staff has an able assistant in Major Gen. J. L. HINES , but if the latter were t. be consulted he would urge that General PERSHING be allowed to complete his task . At the convention - of the Reserye Officers'Associatioln at Detroit in October General FluIss reviewed the labors of ? his chief in tile last two years and said : - General PERSHING thinks we have arrived at a stage of our preparations where we ought to take stock . We have built our machine . It islet per- , toot 170 , Doubtless there Will , rialre to be changes , but he has every-confidence the ; even in its present unperfected state iTottr co-operation will cause it ' CO function to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t out . ? ? ? He has the very natural desire to see his dream come true . The test will be a mobilization of all arms , branches and auxiliaries , to be held some time next year , provided Congress makes the necessary appropriation . Of an impression widely held that this intricate business will demonstrate that the National Defense ack is actually in effect , and that the country is ready for war , General HINES said : This belief is the opposite of the truth . We realize that we are scarcely at the beginning of the national defense development . The test mobilization is a test of our plans even more than a test of our ability to mobilize . Great complicated projects can be soundly designed only after a Process of approximating and experimenting . We fully expect that our Mobilization plans will be considerably changed from year to year , and it will be only through such means as this projected test that we can feel , ourselves upon the solid foundation of practicality . ? ? ? September of next year has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seems to be no doubt by the General Staff tat the mobilization test will disclose unavoidable hyperfections in the carefully laid plans of national defense . The act of 1920 was the product of many minds , and it asks of the General Staff an achievement that can be accomplished only after the machine provided for has had many tests . The directions of the act leave a. great deal to the judgment of the Chief of Staff . The demonstration for which a liberal appropriation will have to be asked will be experimental . Many ideas may have to be scrapped . Replacements , Supplies , shelter , as well as the assembling of men , must be worked out . At such a time General PERSHING , the builder of the machine , could not well be allowed to pass off the stage . He is in full vigor and considers this peace work - of more importance to the nation than his leadership in France . In any European nation there would be no doubt about keeping such a man on the job until it was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the power of Congress to amend the retiring law so as to retain General Pei/sumo until his work under the ' National Defense act has been thoroughly tested .
