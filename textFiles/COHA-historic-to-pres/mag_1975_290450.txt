John Shaw Billings was only mildly enthusiastic when Editor Henry R. Luce told a group of Time Inc. executives over lunch one day in 1936 about his idea for a new kind of magazine devoted to pictures . Billings , then managing editor of TIME , was too busy running the nation 's first weekly newsmagazine to give the new project much thought . But nine months later , Luce called him in to say that the experiment was a shambles and that he wanted Billings to take it over . There was one little problem : the first issue was scheduled to go to press in 17 days . <P> With the energy and decisiveness that stamped his 27-year career at Time Inc. , Billings got that historic first issue of LIFE to the newsstands on time . The entire press run of 466,000 copies sold out within hours , and virtually overnight LIFE became what was then the most successful magazine in publishing history . When death , as it must to all men , came to John Billings last week at 77 , that accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made LIFE was a Southerner , born at Redcliffe , the Beech Island , S.C. , plantation built by his great-grandfather , onetime South Carolina Governor and U.S. Senator James Henry ( " Cotton Is King " ) Hammond . Billings dropped out of Harvard to drive an ammunition truck for the French army in World War I , then became a reporter for the Bridgeport , Conn. , Telegram . He was fired , he recalled , for " writing too goddam much purple prose , " and went to the old Brooklyn Eagle as Washington correspondent . Luce hired him in 1928 as TIME 'S capital stringer to succeed a New York Herald Tribune reporter , Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . A year later , Billings became national affairs editor and in 1933 managing editor . <P> Billings was a tall , quiet , intensely private man whose gentle manner masked a steel will . He served as managing editor of LIFE until 1944 , when , with the magazine 's circulation over 4 million , he became Luce 's deputy as editorial director of the four Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and FORTUNE . Illness forced his retirement in 1955 , and he returned to Redcliffe . As LIFE 'S first managing editor , Billings was more responsible than anyone else for inventing the genre of photojournalism . Recalled Edward K. Thompson , managing editor of LIFE from 1949 to 1961 : " He lived his entire life by what landed on his desk . He interpreted the world as something he edited , whether text or pictures . He was an editor 's editor . "
