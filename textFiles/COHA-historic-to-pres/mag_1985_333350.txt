From the viewing audience ( 65 million in the U.S. alone ) to its stars ( Tina Turner , Bruce Springsteen ) , nearly everything about last week 's Grammy Awards ceremony was oversize . The whole business , in fact , is Big Enterprise at work . About 85% of the U.S. record industry is controlled by six mega-diskeries : CBS , Warner , RCA , MCA , Capitol and PolyGram . Even so , 20 of last week 's 67 % Grammys were won by the products of such offbeat labels as Arhoolie , Top Hits , Reunion and Delos . These names represent the recording business 's vibrant flip side , a growing industry of as many as 2,000 small , independent companies . <P> As profit-making ventures , tiny record companies are sometimes as shaky as a needle on a warped LP . Yet music buffs and entrepreneurs are lured into the business by the long-shot chance of spinning gold . " All of them are so excited , " says Keith Fields , whose Georgia Record Pressing company manufactures disks for dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it . " The companies have been helped by an industry boom , which pushed sales up about 10% last year , to an estimated $4.2 billion . <P> The giant record companies have grown so enamored of the successful rock market that they have passed up many smaller pockets of popularity in jazz , folk and urban-teen music . Like boutiques , the tiny firms cater to special tastes and keep overhead low . Major labels sometimes spend as much as $500,000 to record and promote an album , which means they must sell at least 200,000 disks to make a profit . The independents can earn money on record sales of 1,000 or less . <P> Perhaps the most financially savvy of the independents is Windham Hill , a Palo Alto , Calif. , company started nine years ago by Carpenter-Guitarist William Ackerman , then 26 . He borrowed $5 from each of 60 friends to record an album of his own called In Search of the Turtle 's Navel . From the outset , Ackerman groomed his disks for the baby boom generation , an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded melodic albums like Pianist George Winston 's Autumn , which cost just $1,720 to produce but has sold more than 500,000 copies . Some critics regard Windham Hill 's silky sound as yuppie Muzak , but young professionals can not get enough of it . Sales reached $20 million last year , up 230% from 1983 . Ackerman now chums with Apple Computer Chairman Steven Jobs and gives lectures on his success at Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business . <P> The appeal of much independent music is too narrow to interest many radio stations , so the little companies must find other ways to promote and sell their wares . Tom Rush , a popular folk singer of the 1960s who started his own Night Light label in 1976 , boosts his mail-order sales with ads in The New Yorker . Manhattan 's Select Records gave its rap single Roxanne , Roxanne ( sales : 300,000 ) a fast start last November by persuading music-store clerks to blast the song on their sound systems , a promotion ploy that bigger companies had overlooked .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
