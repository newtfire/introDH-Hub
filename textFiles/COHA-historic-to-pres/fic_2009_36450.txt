AGAINST THE MORNING DARKNESS , Jessie Ann Gaebele quietly litthe stubby candle . Its feeble light flickered at the mirror while she dressed . She pulled her stockings on , donned her chemise , debated about a corset , decided against it . She 'd make too much noise getting it hooked . No one was likely to see her this morning anyway , and she 'd be back before her mother even knew she 'd left the house without it . She could move faster without a " Grecian Bend , " as ladies magazines called the posture forced by the stays and bustle . She guessed some thought it an attractive look for a girl in 1907 , emphasizing a small waist and a rounded derriFre . Jessie claimed both but had little time for either that morning , and timing mattered if she was to succeed . If Jessie did n't catch the moment , it would n't be for lack of trying . <br> She spilled the dark linen skirt over her petticoat , letting it settle at her slender frame . She inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their own soap , something they did more often now since they 'd moved to Winona , Minnesota . Selma was prone to sensuous scents ; sensuous music too , her husky voice holding people hostage when she sang . <br> Jessie looked at her sleeping sisters . The candlelight cast shadows on the tousled hair of Selma , her younger sister , and on the nightcap that Lilly , her older sister , always wore . ( " It will keep you from catching vapors in the night , " Lilly claimed ) . Jessie pulled on the white shirtwaist . Even in sleep they reflected who they were when awake : Selma , dreamy and romantic ; Lilly , organized and right . Always right . Jessie slept somewhere between them , literally . In life she guessed she had a bit of both of those girls ' practices in her . Selma would approve of Jessie 's morning goal for its dreamy adventure ; Lilly would n't . But Jessie 'd organized it as Lilly would , leaving little to chance . She 'd walked the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find when she got there . If she could make it on time . <br> Luckily there were only five buttons down the back of her blouse , close to the high neck . She considered waking Selma to help her button them but decided against it . Selma would want the details and wake up Lilly , who would question her judgment . Jessie would not lie . Lilly would point out how ridiculous she was being , rising early and setting out for such foolishness when she had an important appointment in the day ahead . " That should be your emphasis , " Lilly would say . She spoke as though she were Jessie 's mother . Oh , she meant well ; older sisters did . That 's what her mother told her . But still , Jessie was tired of having every person in the family older than she considered wiser and worldlier too . <br> So Jessie reached back and buttoned the blouse herself , then centered a beaded-buckle belt on her tiny fifteen-year-old waist . Hat or no hat ? Going out in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might question what she was doing or , worse , remember and tell her mother . She could get by without the corset , but she 'd best wear the hat . <br> She tossed a shawl around her shoulders , grabbed her shoes , then dropped one by mistake . She held her breath , hoping no one would wake . She blew out the candle and waited . <br> " Jessie ? " <br> " Go back to sleep , Selma . " <br> " What are you up to ? " <br> Jessie moved to her sister 's side of the bed and whispered , <br> " Do n't wake Lilly , all right ? It 's a secret . Can you keep a secret ? " Her sister nodded . " I 'm going on an adventure . " <br> " Can I come too ? " <br> " Not this time . But I 'll tell you all about it after you get home from school . Just do n't tell , please ? If Mama asks , just say you do n't know . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beau ? " <br> " You read too many of those stories in Woman 's Home Companion . <br> No boys . Nothing like that . " <br> " I better tell Mama . " She pushed the quilt back onto the empty space where Jessie had slept . " She wo n't like you going off by yourself in the night . " <br> " No ! " Jessie looked at Lilly to see if her loud whisper had awakened her . <br> " It 's nothing . I 'll be back before breakfast . " <br> " All right . But you 'll tell me everything ? " <br> " Everything necessary , " Jessie said . <br> Her sister settled back under the quilt , and Jessie picked up her shoe . She 'd nearly crippled her adventure before it even started ! Shetiptoed past Roy 's room with special quietness , careful of the oak floor that creaked at a certain place near the head of the stairs . Roy had hearing like their mother 's . That woman could tell when any of them squabbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outside in the yard , hanging up clothes on the far side of the house while the wind blew ! Sadness bordered Jessie 's thoughts of her little brother like a photographic frame . Jessie slipped past his room , past her parents ' door , out onto the porch with the swing , and sighed relief . <br> Outside , Jessie inhaled the morning . Late March and the promise of an early spring . Not long before flowers would poke their heads up through the crusty Minnesota ground . She heard a steamship whistle bawling its presence at Winona 's docks along the Mississippi . The shawl would be enough to ward off the cold once she started walking , and the promised sun would warm her up when she stood still.Within an hour , dawn would offer up its gift but would wait for only a few seconds for Jessie to receive it . After that , the shapes she wanted to capture would change , and soon the snow would be gone , the city would stop the burning , and she 'd have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't be late today . <br> On the porch steps , she pulled on her high-button shoes , then grabbed the heavy leather bag from behind the porch latticework , where she 'd placed it the night before . Her uncle August Schoepp had given her the bag and its precious cargo just last year , she supposed in memory of their time at the St. Louis World 's Fair . It was her treasure . She drew the strap over her shoulder , centered the weight on her right hip , then set off , holding the bag out to prevent the bruises it often left behind . The corset might have been a help to support her back against the bag , but it was too late to think of that now . <br> She set a fast pace on Broadway , liking the feel of the new concrete solidness pounding up through her slender legs . She crossed the street , kept walking . Pigeons flew from the rooftop of the Winona Hotel . Pancakes of dirty snow exposed themselves in the shaded window wells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair yards broke the morning calm . Against the gas streetlights , fingers of elm and maple branches rose before her . There 'd be buds on them before long , and the maple sap would drip like dark honey down the trunks , making a rich contrast of brown on black . <br> She turned the corner , walked several more blocks , then at the lamplight flickering in the bicycle shop 's window , Jessie grinned . Mr. Steffes had remembered . He was not a founder of the city , but he 'd been around to see many of its changes while running his cycle livery and dealership and doing repair work on the side . <br> A bicycle leaned against the framed wall . Maybe he meant for her to just take it . It would certainly save time . But he might have left it for someone else . She 'd better go in and check . <br> Jessie stepped inside , the small bell above the door announcing her arrival . She scanned the room . " Mr. Steffes ? I 'm here . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ? " The silence felt heavy . The shop smelled of sawdust , the kind brushed onto the wooden floors to soak up grease and oil . It was awfully cluttered . And still . " Mr. Steffes ? " Jessie swallowed . " Remember ? I left you a nickel for the use of the bicycle this morning . I said I 'd come early . " <br> She stumbled over a bucket filled with rags . Maybe she could earn the five cents back by offering to clean up this place . That thought made her cringe . Her mother would not be pleased to know she 'd spent a nickel of her own hard-earned dollars from the book bindery on something frivolous like a bicycle rental , especially because she 'd recently been released from the bindery . There was little money to spare with her father 's illness , which the doctors could n't name or fix . He had so much pain that they 'd had to leave their Wisconsin dairy farm near Cream and move across the Mississippi into Winona , where the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors . Her father eventually worked in the dray business and drove a team to make deliveries , but they all worried over him , her mother and brother and sisters , fearing he might have one of his episodes and suffer excruciating stomachaches that could n't be stopped without laudanum and rest . <br> Prickles of uncertainty clustered at her temples.This morning 's ride was important too , important for Jessie . If somehow her mother found out she 'd spent the money , she 'd just have to convince her that it was for a worthy cause  --  though how she 'd do that she was n't sure . When she tried to explain this recent pull on her , this desire that came over her , the words came out as flat as a knife and not nearly as sharp . <br> She 'd deal with that later . Jessie pushed her spectacles up on her nose , set her shoulders , and took a forward step , moving past the shadow ghosts of bicycles and what appeared to be one of those new ringer washers in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she straightened , she saw a sliver of light , a thin string that marked the bottom of a back room door . Had it just come on ? <br> " Mr. Steffes , I do n't mean to bother you , but it 's Jessie Gaebele and I was hoping I could just  --  " <br> She heard a groan , then what sounded like scuffling followed by a thump . <br> She readied herself for someone to come charging through the door.When that did n't happen , she listened to her throbbing heart , swallowed , then pushed the door open to face this complication of her day . <br> Continues ...
