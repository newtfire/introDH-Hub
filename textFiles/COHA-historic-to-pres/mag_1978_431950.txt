North to Naibor Keju T he plain was strewn with dead zebras . Last night 's thunderstorm had flooded the flatlands hoof-deep , and lightning did the rest . More than two dozen carcasses dotted the grasslands . Already , only an hour after dawn , the vultures were at work . Black-backed jackalsstood their ground defiantly as the Toyota safari wagon rolled to a halt . " The rifle of God , " Bill Winter said . " Silaha ya mungu . The government can keep us from hunting all right , but it ca n't deny God His sport . " Winter and I were traveling through Kenya , assessing the state of the game animals . Winter , who is 46 , had been a professional hunter until last May when President Jomo Kenyatta outlawed his calling in an attempt to help preserve Kenya 's wildlife . Ten months later , to curtail the widespread slaughter of game by poachers , Kenyatta had had to prohibit the sale of wildlife trophies and curios . Ahead of us , at the edge of the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorogi Forest , a stately curve of granite that glowed in the early light . Naibor Keju means " White Legs " in Samburu , but there was nothing remotely white or leggy about it . The most obvious landmark in the region , Naibor Keju is prominent in Samburu mythology . Nearby stands a more famous landmark , a smaller outcropping known as the Rope of God . Ages ago , the Samburu say , this was a giant umbilical cord connected to Heaven . Down it poured milk and blood ? food for the people ? from God 's herds . One day a man whose cattle had been killed by lions climbed up and asked God for some cows to replenish his stock . God refused , and in a rage the man severed the rope with his short sword . That was the Fall from Grace , Samburu-style . A great gusher of milk and blood poured down , inundating the country side , and the umbilicus drew back up into the sky . Indeed , the whole sky rose higher than it had ever been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . But the man who had c. the Rope of God was forbidden to keep cattle . Henceforth , God decreed , the only creatures he could herd would be bees . That , according to the legend , was ho the bee-hunting Wandorobo bands split off from the cattle-herding Samburu . Despite heavy poaching , the wildlife of southern Kenya was still in excellent condition , except for rhinoceroses and elephants , whose horns and tusks are valuable enough in the outside world to warrant the risk of arrest . Having seen this , we had come to Naibor Keju in the hope of gauging the situation to the north . Northern Kenya has traditionally been the scene of raiding and poaching by its neighbor Somalia . Bands of Somalis , known as shifta , cross the border with impunity , often armed with Russian-made AK-47 assault rifles and plastic land mines . They raid villages , ambush trucks and slaughter game . Somalia claims that all of northern Kenya , clear down to Mount Kenya itself , is its property . As a result , the Kenyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expedite troop movements in the event of war , and caravans of its own troops course the countryside every day . African soldiers are notorious for slaughtering wildlife whenever they can . And they have the weapons at hand . Between shifta and sol-@# @#  | diery , the game takes a heavy pounding . I had hunted the country around Naibor Keju with Winter in 1974 , and at that time it was thick with gazelles , buffalo , eland , impala , game birds and lions . In our three-day stay this time out we saw plenty of gazelles but very little else , except for the zebra herd , which seemed to be stronger than it had been four years earlier . Heavy rain kept us from penetrating deep into the surrounding Lorogi Forest , so we had no chance to check for signs of rhino or elephant . But clearly the region had taken a " dreadful clouting , " as Winter would say in his English locution . It seemed that the Rope of God had been cut again in a new , more insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrocuted zebras we came upon the carcass of a freshly killed impala doe . She had been partly skinned , and a spear , a blanket and a walking stick lay beside her . Lambat , our Dorobo tracker , found blood and hair along a track down which she had been dragged . An entry wound gaped in the doe 's neck . Nearby , a group of young Samburu were herding goats , and when we began to gut the animal one of them ? a boy of no more than 12 ? came running up . Soldiers had shot the impala , the boy said , and because they had left it to rot , he had decided to salvage the meat . Yet on opening the body cavity we could find no bullet , not even a fragment of one . The doe was heavily pregnant . " She was probably lying up in some cover , in labor , and the lad spotted her , " Winter said . " Short work with the spear . Well , Bwana , we 've caught ourselves a poacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the police in Maralal ? If we let him go , this boy will be a hero tonight in his manyatta for bringing home the bacon . If we turn him in , he 'll spend months in the toils of the law , and that is n't a pretty prospect anywhere on this continent . " The boy went off to his goats , loaded with fresh meat . Behind him he left the almost born mitnba . The fetus was sleek and darkly marked , gleaming with amniotic fluid , and its perfectly formed hooves felt soft as jelly . " I hope we did the right thing , " Winter said as we drove away . " This kind of poaching is never going to be eradicated . The people are hungry for meat , for protein of any kind . They see game as competition for their cattle . And with the human population of Kenya growing at  | about 3.5% a year , the competition is going to get sharper and sharper . In the old days the tribes were nomadic , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Now the government is encouraging permanent farms , subsistence farms . No farmer wants bushbuck invading his plot of maize . He sets wire snares along the game trails . Keeps crop loss down and puts meat in the pot . When lions kill his cattle , he puts a spoonful of Coopertox ? cattle dip ? into the carcass and the lions are finished . Poisoned . In the old days the warriors went out after the lion with spears , but that 's all in the past . Tin roofs , babies , wire snares and cattle dip ? that 's the wave of the future . That 's what will ultimately finish the wildlife . " Later in the day we found the skeleton of a buffalo , its horn tips cut off to make the ubiquitous Kenyan snuffboxes called karanges . Stopping at various villages along the way , we heard the same story from everyone . Nyama mingi ? plenty of game . Lions had been taking the cattle . There were elephants and rhinos in the deep forest . Baboons had been into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the hunting is finished , " Winter explained time and again . " It is over . The government has taken away our guns . " " But I am a good skinner . Could you not hire me for this safari ? " Driving back to camp that night we spotted glowing eyes in the light of the head lamps ? a leopard high on Naibor Keju . I hoped it was the same leopard that had kept me awake every night with its coughing four years ago , as it prowled in search of baboons . The stars were out in fuller force than we had seen so far . Beyond the reach of the campfire the air was Rocky Mountain crisp . I recall hearing that this was the very country in which Arthur Neumann , the turn-of-thecentury elephant hunter , made his name . I was told he was the first white man to live here permanently . And that only 70-odd years ago . The Samburu have a name for him , Nyama Yangu ? My Meat ? because whenever they came begging he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Lesombolo , who came to camp in hopes of selling us a spear ( " This is my heart ! " he exclaimed in his sales pitch . " I 'll take $8 for it " ) , said he once worked for Nyama Yangu . He said that Nyama Yangu carved his initials and those of his safari boys on a tree trunk below the waterfall across from camp . But that was long ago . Dropping off to sleep , I remembered being told that Nyama Yangu had never sold the ivory of the elephants he had killed . He told friends he had cached it somewhere in the Samburu country . Maybe there , near the waterfall , where the old man had told us we might find his initials ? The Treasure of Nyama Yangu . . . . That 's what Africa does to you . The leopard coughed up on the rock face far above my tent . That was reality ? at least there was one leopard left . The Shaba Game Reserve , north of Isiolo in the Northern Frontier District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 square miles in area ? yet it is quintessentially East Africa . Flat-topped acacias stud the rolling , high-grass game plain . The country looks deceptively easy to travel but is in fact a lava bed that will turn an ankle in an instant of un-  | wariness . The park 's northern boundary is the Ewaso Ngiro River , cascading down from the heights of Mount Kenya to die , finally , in the Lorian Swamp south of Wajir . When we arrived the river was in spate , thanks to the ongoing rains . It ran red between its sandstone banks , carrying with it tons of topsoil . On the way in we spotted birds working over a carcass and , on approaching , found it to be that of a young lion . He had not yet developed a mane , and the condition of his hide ? hair slipping at the touch of a boot ? showed he had been poisoned . " Probably a cattle killer , " Winter said , " or maybe the son of one . At any rate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with this indiscriminate use of poison is that it kills everything that comes to feed on the carcass of a dead cow . Jackals , hyenas , vultures , marabous , not to mention the lion that quite innocently did the job in the first place . " Our camp had been pitched beside a limestone spring . Blacksmith plovers circled anxiously as we settled in . Buffalo weavers , the males with dusty red bills and white-flashed dark wings , nested in the acacias that provided our shade . Nearby were a group of stone cairns , lava black in the afternoon light . They probably date back to the earliest arrival of the Boran tribe in these parts . We pondered on the life-styles of the dead men lying under those rocks . Shaba is Joy Adamson country , established largely through funding provided by her from the profits of her popular book Born Free , films and money raised by the Elsa Wild Animal Appeal . The park was opened last May , and we were only the ninth party to register at the Garba Tula gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , and Mrs. Adamson was in residence and in the process of releasing back into the wild a leopard she had raised from a cub . One afternoon we set out to call on her . A tall , lean woman of 68 , her sunbleached hair cropped close , she received us graciously despite the pressure of her work . " Penny , my leopard , is 18 months old and weighs 120 pounds , " she said as we drank warm beer in her compound . " She 's a proper scoundrel . All claws and teeth , as you can see . " She indicated the healing scars on her arms . " I 've learned to clear out whenever she begins chewing at her hind feet . That 's the sign that she 's about to chew my front ones . " Mrs. Adamson spoke with a heavy Austrian accent , quite a surprise to those who saw the film version of Born Free , in which perky Virginia McKenna , an Englishwoman , portrayed her . " I spend about eight hours a day tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She 's wearing a radio transmitter in her collar . You 've seen Shaba ? it 's tough walking . But a short time ago Bob Aguya , the game warden at Samburu Park just west of us , gave me a lion cub . Now I have both Penny and the cub to deal with . Would you like to see him ? " We went into the wire-fenced cage and the lion cub looked up at us . Then he scooted to a grassy corner and flattened to invisibility . " I call him Kula , the Swahili for eat , ' " Mrs. Adamson said . " He 's a darling , but I do n't know what to do with him . By the time I 'm finished with my work on Penny , I have none left for him . Some nights I 've sat up with him for hours , just chatting . Baby lions need a lot of attention . But I have n't the time . Would you like another glass of beer ? " The talk swung to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing of the curio shops was the most important step thus far . " But the real salvation of East Africa 's wildlife wo n't come until foreign demand for animal products ceases , " she added . " Leopard-skin coats , ivory gewgaws and the Chinese belief in the medicinal properties of rhino horn . Education of the public to the plight of the game is all-important . That 's what my Elsa clubs all around the world are about . If we can save just one lion or leopard or giraffe or zebra , we 'll have done something . " A brilliant red sunset illuminated the mountainous horizon . A herd of oryx , more than 50 strong , galloped across the track ahead of us , their long horns spiking the oncoming night . Ayan , Winter 's second tracker , a husky , one-eyed Turkana , watched them go wistfully . " Picture safaris make my blood bad , " he gruffed in that deep , raspy voice all Turkanas affect . " Hunting is better for me . I love to watch animals and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adamson prays for " education . " I wondered if Ayan would care for an Elsa club membership . That night , as we lay reading in our tents , I suddenly heard a loud rumbling directly outside the canvas . Lion ? Not likely . It sounded more like a cement mixer going berserk . Then I caught the strong barnyard odor ? elephants ! Eating 300 pounds of greenery a day , their stomachs are always churning . Peering out the side flap I saw the starlit sky suddenly go black . Not 10 feet away an elephant trumpeted . Any moment now they might blunder into the tents . If so , we would soon be squashed as flat as hammered tin cans . Winter leaped out of his tent with a flashlight , swinging the beam wildly at the herd . It stampeded ? an earth-quaking roar , punctuated by squeals and high trumpeting . I ran out to watch them go . On the hillside opposite us was a wall of dust punctuated by the gray , sinuous trunks snaking high as the herd fled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Winter yelled . " Crikey , that was a close one . " Back in the tent , I gingerly removed six needle-sharp thorns from the soles of my bare feet . In the excitement , I had n't even felt them penetrate . Somehow it was difficult to regain interest in the Tolstoy short story I had been reading . Our final safari camp was at Meru National Park , beyond the Nyambeni Range east of Isiolo . The lads had pitched the tents at the edge of a wooded stream , far off the main roads of the park . Vervet and colobus monkeys festooned the trees , watching owlishly as Masamba , our worthy mpishi , whipped up another threestar supper . Meru , with its weird , twotrunked doum palms and strange red outcroppings ? decomposed lava boulders covered with red sandy soil ? is excellent country for elephant-watching and , until recently , for rhinos as well . On the road in we met with Denis Zaphiro , an old hunting buddy of both Winter and Ernest Hemingway , and stopped to hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zaphiro , a lean , grayhaired Englishman , appeared particularly scholarly when he put on his glasses to read the park map . Plenty of elephants , he told us , but only one with decent ivory . Rhinos , too , but they were up in the red hills , off the good roads , and with all the rain we 'd been having it was very difficult to get to them .  | " Those three white rhinos that were pranged up here last fall were killed by a group that included a game scout , " Zaphiro told us . " A Somali who 'd recently been transferred to Meru from down south . I had a personal stake in those kifaru ? I helped in procuring them from Natal . " Zaphiro and his clients , an American couple from Ohio , were heading up to the Matthews Range in the northcentral part of the country for a threeweek horse and camel safari . We wished them all a hearty kwaheri . " Quite a lad , old Denis , " said Winter striped bus unloaded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three rhinos , petting their mud-caked hides , stroking the heavy frontal horn of the big male and posing for fake matador shots ? windbreakers sweeping in clumsy veronicas as the camera shutters buzzed . Once again we were awed by the enormous fecundity of the wildlife . Everywhere we drove in the vastness of the park we saw young ? from baby weaverbirds and red-billed quelea to 10-foottall infant giraffes . Climbing into the redMt . Kenya , which rises 17,058 feet , can be seen on a clear day from Naibor Keju , 100 miles away . later . " He house-sat for us while I was in England last year having my wounded foot filleted after my client accidentally plugged it with a .375 . The rotter ate up all my good chutney and my costly English marmalade , not to mention drinking a whole case of Scotch whisky . Still , we all love him , and after all he 's but a growing boy . " Next day we paid a call on Kenya 's surviving white rhinos , which had been imported from Natal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them , a nearly full-grown male , a juvenile cow and an infant male . A zebraclay hills , the Toyota 's deeply lugged tires slip-sliding as if in grease , we came upon a herd of elephants . Two young bulls were fighting , their trunks entwined , small tusks poking at one another 's shoulders , slamming their bodies together with the sound of toppling trees . " We 'd best not get too close , " Winter said . " They could turn on us . " Just then , from behind a tangle of low trees , a big bull with one tusk emerged and spread his ears . Winter gunned the motor and we slowly slid away . Then , as we rounded a curve , Lambat called from the open rear hatch of the truck . 40 " Twende , twende ! Let 's go ! He 's coming ! " " Oh , sugar ! " Bill gritted , speeding up once again . But Lambat was laughing ; he 'd fooled us . " You 'll do that once too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And then an elephant will really be coming , and Iwo n't believe you , and we 're all kufa . " On our final day we drove down to the Tana River . Buffalo herds browsed the high grass ; two male giraffes battled on a ridge , slamming their heads like sledgehammers into one another in search of a knockdown punch ; blue-legged Somali ostriches wobbled flat out across the prairie , their gray puffballs of young scooting to keep up . In a hippo pool a family of the rotund , ill-tempered river horses blew and yawned , then watched us with their rotary ears twitching before sinking silently back into the slimy green depths . The Tana was in spate . A mountain of roaring , red-brown water crashed down Adamsons ' Falls ( Meru is the country where Elsa was found and later released ) . A big crocodile basked in the sun on the bank across the way . We sat on the slotted rocks beside the falls ? vertical jointing , black and brown , ocher and beige , as the chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a drowned elephant come tumbling down through these falls ? " Winter said . " It happens , you know . Giraffes , too . A hell of a sight . I know . I was washed down a falls like these some years ago up in the Mukogodo country , where Lambat comes from . A place called The Crocodile 's Jaws . Took a swim and got caught in the rip . Over I went . How I lived through it I still ca n't figure , but all I picked up were a few nasty scratches . Ah yes , I was a ndume in those days , Bwana , a real bull . Now I 'm finished , like old Nyngao . Old . Getting fat from lying around in hospitals having my bones plucked out . Mguu mbaya ? a bad leg , thanks to that .375 . But I would n't change a day of it . Not a minute . It was a good life while it lasted out here , with the hunting and the tough oldtimers and the country even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , black and white alike . Old Nyama Yangu . Karamoja Bell . Richard Meinertzhagen . Robert Foran . Your own Hemingway and Ruark . Now they 're all gone , they 're fin-continued for JOCK ITCH ) Tines suns ) excessive Perspiration itching chafing  | ished , na kwisha kufa like old Nyngao . " A yellow and blue agama lizard crept out on a rock to bask in the heavy-hitting sun ; as if in some strange counterbalance , the crocodile across the way slid into the roiling water , out of sight . " But maybe the hunting will come back , " Winter went on . " The government seems serious about preserving the herds . The World Bank loaned them $3 million to beef up their anti-poaching patrols , and no one in the government today seems deeply into the trophy or ivory trade , not with their coffee sham bas paying off the way they are . Surely they can see that it was n't the sport hunting that was decimating the herds . Yes , I think that the attitude is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of its land and income , proportionately , to wildlife as Kenya . It 's important to keep that in mind . Your country does n't . Britain does n't . On balance , Kenya has done a remarkable job in keeping its wildlife alive ? when you consider the strong pressures on an underde- veloped nation to gratify its people . And certainly we 've seen that the game can come back in a hurry , given some protection and a decent amount of rainfall . " Yes , maybe the hunting will come back , " Winter continued . " At least the bird shooting and plains game . Buffalo seem strong enough to take a little pressure , and certainly there are plenty of lions . The thing about sport hunting is that everyone benefits from it : the government in license fees ; the professional hunters in a steady living ; the tribes whose lands you hunt get their fair share of the client 's money for every animal killed ; marauding animals are eliminated at no government expense ; and the client himself has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poachers , and the Game Department can certainly use all the help it can get . Yes , logically it would be good to reopen the hunting , perhaps with seasons on certain species and with a total ban on the killing of rhino , small , ivoried elephants and the spotted cats . Let 's hope so , anyway . " I uttered a heartfelt " Amen " to that . Leaving Meru , with the tents struck for the last time and the lorry following , we spotted a solitary bull elephant browsing under a scarred , bulbous baobab tree . It is my fantasy that baobab trees , which elephants love to gouge mercilessly with their tusks , are the reincarnations of dead poachers , doomed to stand forever under the hot African sun , getting punched and ripped by their erstwhile victims . This elephant had good ivory ? 60 or 70 pounds to the tusk , Winter estimated . But he had a bad hind leg ? a mguu mbaya just like Winter 's , maybe from a .375 bullet as well . He flapped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less attack . We left him under his baobab tree , a fitting omen for the " reentry blues " I would be feeling soon , back in the world of towns and shops and jetliners and people .
