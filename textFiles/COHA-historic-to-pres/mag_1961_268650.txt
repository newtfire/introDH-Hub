Fretting about U.S. industry 's " export of jobs " to lower-wage foreign lands , leaders of two major U.S. unions-the Machinists and the Steelworkers-last week urged Congress to restrict corporate expansion abroad . Next day , at his press conference . President Kennedy used their plea to press his own drive for powers to negotiate sweepingly lower reciprocal tariffs . His argument : if tariff walls stay high , U.S. companies will continue to elude them by setting up branches abroad . " This , " said the President , " is a matter of importance to United States workers . " <P> Behind the rising clamor against overseas business ventures lay the fact that U.S. direct long-term investment abroad , which now stands at $34 billion , is increasing at an ever-mounting rate . Last week the management consultant firm of Booz . Allen &; Hamilton reported that between mid-1960 and mid-1961 , U.S. companies started 653 new businesses overseas , mostly in chemicals , machinery , food , and transportation equipment . Western Europe attracted more than half the new businesses , followed by Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates , U.S. companies will spend $4.5 billion on overseas plant and equipment-but up to two-thirds of that sum will probably be generated by profits earned abroad or by foreign borrowing . <P> Short Sights . U.S. seed money abroad bears fruit in the form of repatriated profits , dividends and taxes . Not counting Ford 's special purchase of its British subsidiary , U.S. manufacturers last year invested $237 million in Europe , pulled back to the U.S. $241 million in earnings . Moreover , critics innate the danger of " job exports . " Many of the investments are aimed at cracking markets that simply can not be satisfied from the U.S. ; if Coca-Cola had no plants overseas , few foreigners would go to the trouble of importing Cokes . And the existence of U.S. foreign plants makes jobs for those U.S. workers who supply machinery and spare parts . <P> Also creating jobs for U.S. workers are the steadily mounting investments of foreign companies in the U.S. Long-term foreign investments in U.S. plants and real estate have doubled since 1950 , now total $6.9 billion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. 's typewriter-making Underwood Corp. , and other European giants such as France 's glassmaking Saint-Gobain and Germany 's chemical-making Bayer have opened U.S. branches with U.S. partners . One British real estate syndicate-Boston British Properties , Inc. - even intends to rejuvenate downtown Boston , has bought a tract near the scene of the Boston Tea Party to put up the city 's tallest building - a 30-story. $20-million affair . <P> Long Gains . Foreign investment is a two-way street , and the U.S. is by no means getting the worst of the bargain . Booz , Allen figures that U.S. income from private investments abroad has topped outflow by $7.8 billion over the past decade . Says Booz , Allen Partner C. Wilson Randle : " Income on foreign investments is-next to exports-the largest single source of income in the U.S. balance of payments . ' '
