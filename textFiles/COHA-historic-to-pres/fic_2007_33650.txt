In a city called Stonetown , near a port called Stonetown Harbor , a boy named Reynie Muldoon was preparing to take an important test . It was the second test of the day-the first had been in an office across town . After that one he was told to come here , to the Monk Building on 3rd Street , and to bring nothing but a single pencil and a single rubber eraser , and to arrive no later than one o'clock . It he happened to be late , or bring two pencils , or forget his eraser , or in any other way deviate from the instructions , he would not be allowed to take the test , and that would be that . Reynie , who very much wanted to take it , was careful to follow the instructions . Curiously enough , these were the only ones given . He was not told how to get to the Monk Building , for example , and had found it necessary to ask directions to the nearest bus stop , acquire a schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into paying for it , and walk several blocks to catch the 3rd Street bus . Not that any of this was difficult for Reynie Muldoon . Although he was only eleven years old , he was quite used to figuring things out for himself . From somewhere across the city , a church bell struck the half hour . Twelve-thirty . He still had a few minutes to wait . At noon thedoors of the Monk Building had been locked , so Reynie had bought a sandwich at a deli stand and sat down on this park bench to eat . A tall building in Stonetown 's busiest district must surely have many offices inside , he thought . Locked doors at noon seemed a little peculiar . But then , what had n't been peculiar about this whole affair ? To begin with , there was the advertisement . A few days before , Reynie had been reading the newspaper over breakfast at the Stonetown Orphanage , sharing sections with his tutor , Miss Perumal . ( As Reynie had already completed all the textbooks on his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had assigned him a special tutor while the other children went to class . Miss Perumal did n't quite know what to do with Reynie , either , but she was intelligent and kind , and in their time together they had grown fond of sharing the morning paper over breakfast and tea . ) The newspaper that morning had been filled with the usual headlines , several of them devoted to what was commonly called the Emergency : Things had gotten desperately out of control , the headlines reported ; the school systems , the budget , the pollution , the crime , the weather ... why , everything , in fact , was a complete mess , and citizens everywhere were clamoring for a major - no , a dramatic - improvement in government . " Things must change NOW ! " was the slogan plastered on billboards all over the city ( it was a very old slogan ) , and although Reynie rarely watched television , he knew the Emergency was the main subject of the news programs every day , as it had been for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had discussed the Emergency at great length . Finding themselves quite in agreement about politics , however , they soon found such conversation boring and decided to drop the subject . In general , then , they talked about the other news stories , those that varied day to day , and afterward they amused themselves by reading the advertisements . Such was the case on that particular morning when Reynie 's life had so suddenly taken a turn . " Do you care for more honey with your tea ? " Miss Perumal had asked - speaking in Tamil , a language she was teaching him - but before Reynie could answer that of course he wanted more honey , the advertisement caught Miss Perumal 's eye , and she exclaimed , " Reynie ! Look at this ! Would you be interested ? " Miss Perumal sat across the table from him , but Reynie , who had no trouble reading upside down , quickly scanned the advertisement 's bold-printed words : " ARE YOU A GIFTED CHILD LOOKING FOR SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES ? " How odd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not their parents . Reynie had never known his parents , who died when he was an infant , and it pleased him to read a notice that seemed to take this possibility into account . But still , how odd . How many children read the newspaper after all ? Reynie did , but he had always been alone in this , had always been considered an oddball . If not for Miss Perumal he might have even given it up by now , to avoid some of the teasing . " I suppose I might be interested , " he said to Miss Perumal , " if you think I would qualify . " Miss Perumal gave him a wry look . " Do n't you play games with me , Reynie Muldoon . If you are n't the most talented child I 've ever known , then I 've never seen a child at all . " There were to be several sessions of the test admistered over the weekend ; they made plans for Reynie to attend the very first session ... (    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
