Jack was a movie star , which meant he was granted some latitude in the outrageous behavior department . Nevertheless , when he showed up sweaty and stoned to Lindsey 's thirtieth birthday party , punched the overly solicitous maitre d ' in the nose , and vomited into the potted gladiolus lining Torre 's knee-high windowsills before passing out into a chair at our table , no one was amused . Not Lindsey , who said , " Screw this , " and walked over to the bar for another shot of vodka . Not Chuck , who tossed the ice from his drink and mine into his napkin and , cursing Jack under his breath , ran into the kitchen to tend to the maitre d ' . Not Alison , who jumped out of her seat and anxiously began trying to revive Jack by gently slapping his face and applying a wet cloth to his forehead , urgently saying over and over again , " Oh my god , Jack , wake up . " And not I , who , lacking any other positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the disapproving hush of well-dressed diners to join Lindsey at the bar . Well , to tell the truth , I was somewhat amused . How often , after all , did you see that sort of thing in real life . " You okay , Lindsey ? " I asked , as she threw her head back and killed the vodka shot . Somewhere in the background , what sounded like Yanni or some other music on sedatives was being faintly piped into invisible speakers . " Comparatively speaking , I would say I 'm doing great , " she said , casting her eyes in the direction of Jack and Alison . " What a shithead . " " Two more , " I called to the bartender , who managed to stop oglingLindsey from under his eyebrows long enough to comply . " You think anyone recognizes him ? " I said , looking out across the restaurant . " Who cares ? " " Here 's to you , birthday girl . " We clinked glasses and downed the shots . " I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , " Lindsey observed . " It 's not every day you get to watch a bona fide movie star destroy , his life . " " He 's lucky he has n't been arrested . " " The night 's young . " " I hope the maitre d ' is okay , " I said , grimacing as I recalled the lurching punch , the snapping sound Jack 's fist and the maitre d 's face had produced in their collision . Jack 's punches usually had the benefit of accompanying THX sound effects . In real life the sound was startling in its lack of resonance , but somehow more imbued with violence because of it . " Do you think it would be possible , " Lindsey said to the bartender , " for you to stop staring at my breasts for a little while ? " The bartender , a fortyish guy with a goiter and a handlebar mustache , gasped and quickly moved further down the bar . He pulled out a dish rag and began meticulously scrubbing an invisible dirt spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was n't even being subtle about it , " she said , annoyed . " So it was n't the staring , but the sloppy execution that bugged you . " " Shut up , Ben . " At that point , Chuck returned from the kitchen , his forehead dappled in sweat beneath his receding hairline . " Sweet Jesus , it 's hot in there . " He ordered a club soda on ice , which is what he always drank when he was operating the following morning . The bartender served him without making eye contact , and then quickly retreated to the other end of the bar . " How 's the maitre d ' ? " I asked . " He 'll live . He 's got a contusion on the bridge of his nose and it 'll hurt him to sneeze for a few days . I told him I 'll phone in a prescription for him . How 's Hollywood doing ? " We all looked over to the table , where Alison had finally revived Jack , and was force-feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending up in dark , damp spots on his brown shirt . The restaurant 's dim lighting lent a jaundiced pallor to his already ashen complexion , making him appear gaunt and sickly . " He 's looked better , " I said truthfully . " Dude , I 've seen homeless junkies that looked better , " Chuck snorted . " Spare us the lurid details of your social life . " " Eat me , " Chuck said with a smirk . Chuck had somehow missed the stage where we all outgrew salutations like dude ' and eat me , ' and he clung to those anachronisms tenaciously , as if they might somehow slow down the balding process . " There 's a shot for the tabloids . " Lindsey interrupted us , turning back to the bar , the track lighting picking out her blond highlights in a glimmering halo as her head moved . " I think we 'd better get him out of here , " I said . " If someone recognizes him , we 'll be watching this on Entertainment Tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we got up from the bar . " What 's the point of being a famous movie star if no one recognizes you ? " Chuck grumbled . " Look at him , " I said . " I barely recognize him myself . " It was true . Jack 's usually bright blond hair was in a matted , greasy mess above his Gucci shades , and he wore four or five days ' growth of a beard . It was hard to believe that this was the same man whose face ( and body , always the body ) had been on every major magazine cover at one time or another over the last few years , the same guy who reduced tabloid journalists to trite adjectives like " heartthrob " and " hunk . " But his grungy appearance that night would have done nothing to change that perception . Jack often went out looking like he had n't showered in a week . It was a Hollywood thing . All the stars were doing it lately , if the candid shots in Entertainment Weekly and Movieline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Even when I look like shit I 'm beautiful . " Which , in Jack 's case , was undeniably true . His essence shone through the layers of grimethe perfect green eyes , the exquisitely carved cheekbones , the casual , unconscious grace with which he threw his lean body around . On your best day , you 'd be lucky to look like Jack with smallpox . As we approached the table , Alison looked away , but not before I saw that there were tears in her eyes . I nudged Lindsey . " Take her outside . " After the women left , Chuck and I took seats on either side of Jack , who was now sitting up , looking bleary-eyed but only slightly befuddled . " Do you think we can get out of here without any further incident ? " I asked him . " Sorry , guys , " Jack said with a sheepish , million-dollar smile . Then , concerned , " Did I hit someone ? " " You whacked the maitre d ' , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly . " " Shit . " He examined his knuckles with contempt , as if they had acted independently of him . " I knew I was too wrecked to come , but I really wanted to make it to Lindsey 's party . " " Mission accomplished , dude , " Chuck said . " Fuck , my head hurts , " Jack said , leaning back and rubbing his temples . Chuck suddenly leaned forward and squeezed Jack 's nose between his thumb and forefinger . Jack bolted upright in pain and swatted away Chuck 's hand . " Asshole ! " " I thought that might hurt , " Chuck said , with a modicum of satisfaction . " Cocaine ? " I asked . " Definitely , man , " Chuck said . " Leaves the nasal passages very raw . " " Not heroin ? " " Could be , " Chuck answered . " But his behavior is much more consistent with a cocaine habit . " " Shit , Jack , " I said , instantly depressed . " Coke ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the manager arrived , accompanied by two burly kitchen workers , to kick us out of the restaurant . That was when we first thought Jack might be in serious trouble . Of course , it was n't the first time it had crossed our minds that Jack might be something other than drug free , but how do you distinguish a genuine addiction from standard celebrity behavior ? What major Hollywood star did n't trash the occasional Plaza suite , or get snapped by the paparazzi outside the Viper Room looking dazed and unkempt ? If the warning flag went up every time a movie star cut a little too loose they 'd have to install revolving doors at the Betty Ford Clinic . Still , in retrospect , Jack had seemed somewhat withdrawn over the last few months , hurried and antsy on the phone , speaking the way you do when you 've got a long distance call on the other line or you 'd just stepped out of the shower when the phone rang . He was distracted and tense , not at all like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million per film is bound to come with some pressure . The tabloid vultures had been circling for months now , searching ( read : yearning ) for any sign of a meltdown , but as Jack 's friends we felt duty-bound to ignore the reports . No one wants to believe they need the mass media to stay in touch with a friend . The irony was that . Jack had never been interested in acting . For him , stardom came with the same serendipitous ease that everything else did . In college he would wander aimlessly into a party on his way home from a late evening jog , unshaven , his hair plastered to his scalp with sweat , visible pit stains on his ratty NYU sweatshirt , and he 'd leave an hour later with any one of the multitude of girls who practically climbed over each other to make themselves available to him . He did n't plan it ; he never planned anything . Things just happened for Jack . If he ever thought about it , he would have assumed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You wanted to resent him , or even hate him a little , but how could you begrudge someone his innate gifts when he was n't even aware of them ? He lived in complete oblivion to his own charms , which , of course , made him all the more charming . In our senior year Jack took a part-time job waiting tables in the Violet Cafe . His financial aid agreement stipulated that he work twenty hours a week . One day he served a frappacchino to some guy who was on the fast track at one of the major studios . The guy knew someone who knew someone , and within a few weeks he 'd arranged a screen test . It was almost inevitable . Right after Thanksgiving Jack got a S.A.G . card and a walk-on part in a Harrison Ford thriller . Some on-site rewrites gave him three additional lines and a twelve-second gunfight sequence in which he blew away a Chinese body-builder before getting shot himself . It took three weeks in LA for Jack to shoot his scenes , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison Ford . " He was n't even there , " Jack said bitterly . " He 's already working on another movie . " A casting agent working on a modestly budgeted action movie for Miramax called Blue Angel saw the Ford movie when it came out a few months later and liked the way Jack held a fake gun . Jack was cast in the lead role for Blue Angel for which he was paid scale , and he flew out to Hollywood to begin preproduction . Blue Angel was the sleeper hit of the year and the trades anointed Jack Hollywood 's next great action star . None of us was greatly surprised when he did n't come home to graduate . I once asked Jack what he 'd been planning to do before he was discovered . " What do you mean ? " he asked . " You were majoring in sociology , which is pretty much the equivalent of majoring in unemployment , " I said . " What did you plan on doing after college ? " He frowned at me , clearly perplexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , running his fingers through his perfect hair . " I would have thought of something . " " Do n't you ever worry about the future ? " I asked . Jack shrugged . " This is the future , " he said . When we left the restaurant Jack , one of People magazine 's Fifty Most Beautiful People of 1999 , puked all over himself , so Alison got him into his limo to take him back to his hotel , insisting , as he climbed in on all fours , that we did n't have to come along . Lindsey , Chuck , and I went to Moe 's , a bar Chuck knew on the Upper East Side , one of those places that carefully spreads sawdust across the floor every night so as to seem like a genuine dive . For a surgeon , Chuck certainly got out a lot . He seemed to know the majority of the women in the place , and got a kiss hello from the bartender , who looked like a supermodel fallen on harder times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck 's life was a movie . Or at least a beer commercial . While Chuck hit on some barely legal girls at the bar , Lindsey and I took a table in the back and ordered some kamikazes and a pitcher of Sam Adams to chase . " How 's Alison ? " I asked . I had to shout above the jukebox , which was playing one of those annoyingly catchy novelty songs that have slowly been replacing real music on the radio . The fact that I occasionally discovered myself humming along only intensified my dislike for the music . " Still loves him , for all the good that does either one of them , " she said , pouring beer into the plastic cups . " She thinks he 's reaching the breaking point . " " What do you think ? " " I do n't know . That was a pretty ugly display , even by movie star standards . " I nodded in agreement . " He 's seriously messed up . " We drank in silence for a minute . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiring into her health ? " " Forget it . I 'm sorry . " I looked over to the bar , where Chuck was laughing it up with a brunette in a sleeveless blouse so tight I could make out the outline of her navel from where I was sitting . The light was causing a gleam on Chuck 's head just above the point where his hairline continued to defy the daily assaults of Rogaine . He was in a desperate race with his hair , determined to bed as many women as possible before it disappeared altogether . A few weeks earlier Chuck and I had gone down to Atlantic City for the weekend and I 'd come into our room at the Trump Casino Hotel to find him standing in front of the bathroom mirror in a towel , using an eyedropper to apply Rogaine across his scalp . It was like inadvertently stumbling upon a deeply private ritual , like that scene in The Empire Strikes Back when the officer walks in on Darth Vader with his mask off . Chuck 's hair , still wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his pink scalp visible through the pithy strands like exposed tissue . He turned to me with an embarrassed grin , the eyedropper still poised over his head like a conductor 's baton and said , " What have I got to lose ? " " It must be nice , " Lindsey said , indicating Chuck . " He 's able to find someone to hit on everywhere he goes . " " To a man with a hammer , everything looks like a nail , " I said . Her eyes smiled at me from over the rim of her beer glass . " What do you think he 's after ? " she asked me , putting down the glass . I shot her a look . " Other than the obvious , " she said , correcting herself . " I mean , why do you think he 's so determined to sleep around so much ? In college , okay . It 's an acceptable rite of passage , but at thirty it 's a tad ... " " Juvenile ? " " More like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " I said wearily . I took a sip of beer and held it in my mouth , letting the microscopic air bubbles tickle my tongue as they popped . " Maybe Chuck just has n't found the right person . " " How would he know ? He 's gone before the sheets dry . He 's got more of a Peter Pan complex than you do . His actually includes flying out the window before daybreak . " I laughed . " First of all , shut up , " I said . " Second of all , I think it 's more of a James Bond complex . He 's not doing it to keep feeling young . I think he does it to feel like a real man . " Unlike Lindsey and Alison , who only met him in college , I knew that it had n't always been this way for Chuck , which was probably why I cut him more slack than they did . We 'd grown up together , gone through elementary school and high school together , where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood through our junior year of high school , Chuck was easily the most overweight kid in the class . Not grotesquely fat , but comically plump in a way that always made him look somewhat unkempt . He was n't singled out for persecution the way it happens in those John Hughes movies , but he still suffered , especially when it came to girls . His wit made him popular with them to a point , but when it came to pushing for a girlfriend , he got the " just friends " speech every time . In high school he finally experienced some growth spurts , which , combined with some brutally disciplined dieting , brought his weight down into the normal range . But by then it was too late . He 'd been a blimp for the first two years of high school , and that 's how he was universally perceived for the last two . At sixteen , perception is nine-tenths of the law . College , though , was a clean slate and Chuck was like a horse right out of the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women for past rejections , or maybe it was just the store of repressed sexual urges that he could finally have gratified with someone else after years of flying solo , what he shamelessly referred to as " roping one off . " However you wanted to explain it , Chuck could n't believe how easy it suddenly was to get laid , and he went about it with reckless abandon , as if he 'd been granted a free shopping spree . At some point toward the end of college , Chuck began losing his hair , and in his mind it was as if a giant clock had started ticking . It must have seemed terribly unfair to him that he 'd worked so hard to shed one physical obstacle only to inherit what he perceived as another , completely beyond his control . Lindsey and I watched as Chuck drew the girl closer to him and whispered something to her . She laughed with her entire body and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek . " Well , he 's got some skills , " Lindsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " If only we could get him to use his powers for good , " I said distractedly and drank another swallow of my Sam Adams . " You look sad , " she said . " I 'm just pensive . " " What are you thinking about ? " " Whether or not to be sad . " " Same old Ben . " We drank in silence for a while . " We 're getting divorced , " I finally said . " Oh ! " She seemed genuinely surprised . " I knew you were separated , but I thought it was just a temporary glitch . That you 'd worked it out . " " I do n't know , " I said , even though I did . " I think maybe the working it out was the temporary glitch . " " I 'm sorry , " she said , truly meaning it . " Subject change , please , " I said . " How 's your writing going ? " she asked . Wrong subject . " At Esquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You writing any features yet ? " " Nope . I 'm still the list-maker . " Esquire was big on lists . 7 Crucial Stomach Exercises . 10 Little Grooming Tips For a Big Night . 30 Things You Should Know About Your Money . Before they let you graduate to real articles , you had to put in your time on the lists . " And your novel ? " " Have n't touched it in months . " " What 's the problem ? " " I have a tendency to procrastinate , but let 's talk about that some other time . " " Ha . " " I do n't know , " I said , grinding an ice cube between my teeth . " I think it 's the protagonist . He 's too autobiographical . " " Meaning ? " " No motivation . " " Poor Ben , " she offered . " Poor Alison , " I returned . " Poor me , " Lindsey said . " Thirty years old . Can you believe it ? " " I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her jaw dropped slightly in surprise , and then she turned to me with a sad smile , taking my head between her hands . " Oh shit , Benny . I totally forgot . " She leaned forward and kissed me softly on the lips . " Happy birthday , Benny . " The kiss and the nickname brought me back six years , to when Lindsey and I were still together . It 's an axiom of group dynamics that no circle of friends can remain a truly cohesive unit unless a handful of them are in love with each other in some twisted fashion or other . Twisted because if it were simple they 'd pair off and that would be the end of the group . There was Alison 's unflagging and unrequited love for Jack , conveniently disguised as maternal concern so as to keep things from getting uncomfortable . Chuck was happily in love with himself . And then there was my love for Lindsey , which started as simple lust when we first got friendly in college , but blossomed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had graduated . We both knew it was there , and we both knew that we both knew . It was evident in the way , when she kissed me hello or good-bye , that she always managed to get just the corner of my mouth . Or in the fact that whenever the five of us went out , Lindsey and I always seemed to wind up sitting together . And I was the one who walked her home at night , even though Chuck 's dorm was closer . But still , despite all of the hints , neither one of us was willing to let it grow during college . I think we were afraid of not having each other anymore if it did n't work out . Or at least , that was probably her rationale . I would have been willing to risk it , if I were n't so sure of a gentle but firm rejection . I did n't get laid in college as much as Chuck , and certainly not as much as Jack , who might as well have been listed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended . But I did okay for a somewhat bookish , **32;85;TOOLONG type , and the reason for that , I think , was that all of the feelings I had for Lindsey that were being stirred to a slow boil inside me needed somewhere else to go in the meantime . At a party the day after our graduation , Lindsey and I were dancing , as usual just a wee bit closer than the legal limit for just friends , when she asked me , " So , Benny , what are you going to do now ? " " I told you the plan , " I said . " I 'm taking off a few months to write , and then I 'll start interviewing at some publishing firms . " " No , " she said , her lithe body coming to a complete stop as she pulled back to look me in the eye . " I. mean , what are you going to do about me ? " We were together for two perfect years , the kind that would get a sixty-second montage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song like in When Harry Met Sally . Walking through the park , kissing in the rain , clowning around at a street fair , et cetera . Two years , which was long enough for me to believe it would never end . Of course it did , though , when Lindsey panicked and decided that at twenty-four she was much too young to be settling down and it was time to get out there and see the world . She quit her job as an elementary school teacher and launched her world tour , facilitated by a brief stint as a flight attendant , and I eventually rebounded into Sarah , who had a career , goals , and a more highly developed nesting instinct . Lindsey moved back to Manhattan around the time I got married . Over the next few years she was in a constant state of career flux , from advertising , to diamond trading on Forty-seventh Street , to teaching aerobics classes at Equinox . Mostly she temped as a receptionist while she was between jobs . Whatever it was she 'd been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't found it , which should have made me feel vindicated but only made me sad . I saw her periodically , when all of us went out , but we never got together one-on-one . Lindsey never would have suggested it since I was married , and I was scared of being alone with her because it would make it harder to deny that I 'd married the wrong person . So we met in the safety of our little group , stayed in touch intermittently , and tried not to see the tragedy in the casual acquaintances we 'd become . " Ben ? " Lindsey asked , bringing me back to the present . " Yeah ? " " You 're crying . " " I 'm just drunk , " I said . She put her head on my shoulder and wrapped her hands around my arm . " Poor Ben . "
