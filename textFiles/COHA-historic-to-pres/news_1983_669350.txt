He has just had his picture taken promoting his new line of bed linens , and he seems anxious to dance away from his entourage and the British photographer who has been urging him to ' ' Tilt your head . Lean forward . Hold it , ' ' for half an hour. // ' ' Issey , Issey . We need you over here to talk to some more people , ' ' calls out a voice . With a quick snap of his head and an even snappier smile , the designer stops dead in his tracks , and like a child , obediently turns toward those who have called him. // He is Issey Miyake , Japan ' s premier clothing designer . In the 20 years that he has shown his fashion collections , this puckish , unprepossessing designer has created a virtual sartorial stampede . Around the world he is recognized as the forerunner of a new breed of Japanese designers currently considered ' ' hot ' ' among retail buyers and clothing critics . Collectively they are known as the Tokyo group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Comme des Garcons . Indeed the Tokyo-based Miyake Design Studio is thought to have fostered the first indigenous change in Japanese fashion since the kimono. // But more important , Miyake is now considered one of the greatest innovators in fashion history . Observers credit him with mapping out an entirely new fashion direction - one that no longer copies Western design conceits . His designs - inventive , imaginative , derivative of nature in their colors and textures - can appear downright strange to Western sensibilities as they nearly obliterate the body ' s natural lines . Yet they are undeniably the first significant challenge to traditional French concepts , which have dominated world fashion for more than a century. // Already , sales of his clothing - marketed under three labels : Issey Miyake , I. S. ( formerly Issey Sport ) , and Plantation - are in the $60 million range , a 20 percent increase from one year ago . While many women and men still consider Miyake ' s vision an unwearable enigma , most New York retailers have already increased their Japanese orders. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wrote Brenda Pollen , fashion editor of The Guardian ( London ) . ' ' His influence upon a whole generation of designers has been formidable. ' ' // ' ' He is one of the greatest designers in the world today , ' ' says Alan Bilzarian , owner of an exclusive Boston boutique that carries Miyake ' s couture line. // ' ' His importance will persist , like Yves Saint Laurent , ' ' says Amy Yates , division merchandising manager for Filene ' s department store . ' ' Miyake will remain successful beyond current trends. ' ' // In the West , the Miyake phenomenon has been etched by the unique shapes and fabrics of his clothes that confound traditional expectations of elegance . His 1984 spring collection , considered the best of his career , includes such unusual textiles as ' ' whisker linen , ' ' ' ' cotton embossed by plucking thread , ' ' ' ' six-layered woven cotton , ' ' and ' ' Japanese paper ( raincoat ) coated with panlownia oil. ' ' // However , in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group over that of the individual , Miyake ' s success is seen as the triumph of a personal vision . He is perceived as part of that energetic generation - including the well-known Japanese artist Eiko Ishioka - whose formative years were marked by postwar hardships and who today are comfortable with commercialism and material success . To understand Miyake ' s significance is to not only plunge to the core of the most revolutionary fashion trend in decades , but to comprehend a bit more fully , the Japanese themselves. // One ' s first impression of the boyish-looking designer , who is dressed simply in his own collarless shirt and soft black trousers , is that he is charming and delightfully unaffected . He laughs frequently , pays polite and rapt attention to those to whom he is talking , and happily converses in English or through his interpreter in Japanese . But underneath the winning personality one senses a strongly ideological individual. // ' ' Japan is a very conformist society , ' ' says the designer , who was born in Hiroshima in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . My generation went through its formative ages during the postwar chaos when American and European cultural influences were very great . It hurt me so much not to be proud to be Japanese . And I had to think , ' What can I do to be truly Japanese but to do so in an international way . Had I been born 10 or 15 years later , I would not have had as many challenges , but undoubtedly my work would be different. ' ' ' // With an early interest in art and design , Miyake attended Japan ' s Tama Art University , where he presented his first collection , entitled ' ' The Poem of Material and Stone . ' ' Later he studied at La Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne in Paris and became an assistant designer to couture doyens Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy . He also worked in New York under American designer Geoffrey Beene . His first official showing in Paris was in 1973 . Since then he has opened every collection there . ' ' I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make my reputation in Paris , ' ' he says. // While Miyake credits those early apprentice years with teaching him fine French dressmaking techniques , he insists it was the student riots , or so-called ' ' jeans revolution , ' ' of the late 1960s that provided the real impetus for his own more democratic definition of fashion. // ' ' I feel very lucky to have lived when the class system began to crumble , when jeans became the garment for all people , ' ' he says . ' ' I am not negative about European couture , but I find clothes of that tradition to be a package that people step into . They are fine and beautiful clothes , but they feel stiff and everyone looks the same in them . I want to be different , to be flexible to show the personality of the person wearing the garment . ' ' Indeed , observers credit Miyake with unparalleled feeling for texture , mass , and volume , for elevating the ' ' wrap and tie ' ' style of dressing beyond mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great flexibility . Miyake actually uses the word ' ' skin ' ' when talking about his clothes . ' ' When I design , it is a little bit like molding clay , ' ' he says . ' ' I cut the fabric , wash it , sew it , put it on me , feel it - the design comes out of the fabric . ' ' And always what is uppermost in his mind is the relation of the fabric and the body of the wearer - a spatial arrangement that more approximates art than mere design. // ' ' I want the body of the wearer , her individuality , to make the shape of the clothes. ' ' // It is a principle that many observers compare to the original design premise of the kimono . Still others insist that Miyake is providing Japanese women a new outlet for their individuality . ' ' In my country , people think of fashion as only for the young , ' ' he says . ' ' But I am trying to make fashion a challenge. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his principles is to be acquainted with an intensity usually associated with an artist , not a fashion designer . Not only has Miyake designed couture and ready-to-wear clothes , company uniforms , and ballet costumes , but he creates and weaves his fabrics . He is now beginning to spin his own yarn . Additionally , he has published two books on his work and has created a traveling exhibition of clothes and unique silicon mannequins called ' ' Bodyworks . ' ' His fashion shows - including ' ' Fly with Issey Miyake , ' ' and ' ' Issey Miyake and Twelve Black Girls ' ' - are considered unequaled in their theatricality . For Miyake this coincidence of art and craftsmenship is no accident. // ' ' Unlike the United States , it is very important in Japan not to distinguish between the artist and the craftsman , ' ' he explains . ' ' For us they are one and the same . Our first need is to make something practical , and then to make it beautiful and more fun . That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel from me , that is it.
