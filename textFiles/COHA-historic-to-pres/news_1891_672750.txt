The Treasury Department has decided to appeal to the courts from the decision of the Board of General Appraisers concerning the doubling of the high duties on carpet wooL It will be recalled that by the tariff the duties on the two grades of wool of the third class , or carpet wool , were increased . from 2432 per cent . and 3012 per cent . to 32 per cent . and 50 per cent. , respectively . These are coarse wools which are not produced in this country in any considerable quantity , and 70 per cent . of the wool imported belongs to this class . The questions which were carried to the board arose under a , ruling of the departmeat that these duties must be doubled when there was any indication that the wools had been sorted . But this ruling was not made until the new tariff had been in force for several months , and it required the application to wools of the third class of a , " sorting clause " which had generally been regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The department yielded to the pressure exerted by Judge LAWRENCE and his associates iu Ohio , whose avowed purpose is to exclude from this country " every pound of foreign wooL " The ease came before the board upon the action of the Collector of this port in doubling the duties on two invoices of wool imported by carpet manufacturers . We shall not now discuss all the questions involved . The board decided that the great tax of a double duty ( 64 per cent . on one grade and 100 per cent . on the other ) had been wrongfully exacted , and the decisions of the Collector  --  who had obeyed the instructions of the department  --  were reversed . We may refer to one part of the board 's decision , which was that the grading of wools by color is not " sorting , " The board remarked that it had been the practice for thirty years so to grade East India wools . In this particular and with respect to some other points the decision of the board was obnoxious to the political shepherds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appeal is pending , the very heavy double duties will be exacted . We desire to direct attention to the comments of certain authorities in the carpet trade . The Dry Goods Chronicle says : " It will probably be many months before the case willbe reached upon the overcrowded calendar of the Supreme Court , and meanwhile the manufacturers of carpets are forced to pay double duty ( under protest , of course ) on their wools , thus disturbing their calculations and rendering it almost impossible for them to determine the actdal cost and selling values of their product . " A leading manufacturer estimates that the payment of double duty means an increased cost per yard on such goods as Moquettes and Axminsters of about 12 cents . Higher grades , such as Brussels and Hiltons , will coat more proportionately . And ' all for what ? That some selfish politipians may coin political capitaL " Another journal , the Carpet and Upholstery Trade Review , said in its issue of the 1st inst . : " It is generally asserted that the Government has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , but solely with the purpose of currying favor among the wool growers of Ohio , where an election is soon to sake place . " The point of roost interest to the carpet trade is the probe/A ? effect which the doubling of duty on certain grades of wools will exercise on the prices of carpeting . The wools affected by the Government 's construction of the sorting clause comprise Ilussian , East Indian , and similar grades , and their use in carpet manufacture is so general that the great increase in the duty on them which is now in effeot must result In higher prices for all grades of carpeting . " Manufacturers believe that the advance which ought to follow would range from 5 to 12 cents a yard , according to the various grades of goods . " Of course , the importers will contest the decree of the Treasury Department in the courts . But under the present administrative tariff law the Government has the power to prolong litigation for an almost indefinite time , and there is consequently little probability that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carpeting have been settled for the Spring season , and it is , moreover , possible that manufacturers with short stooks of wool may not be able to fill duplicate orders for the Fall trade at present prices . " The price of carpets must be increased again . We showed a few days ago that under the influence of the duties , as they were collected before the sorting clause was applied , the prices of Donskoi , Aleppo , Damascns , Vicanier , Candahar , and Jona wools were from 10 to 15 per cent . higher in this country than they had been a year ago . The continued exaction of the doubled duties will still further increase the cost of the carpet manufacturers ' raw material , with the inevitable and natural result of increasing the price of carpets . Bat Judge LAWRENCE says the people can get along without carpets , and he boasts that MCKINLEY permitted him to write the clause which the department now interprets to the manufacturers ' discomfiture. - And these duties are imposed upon kinds of wool which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in this country except at a cost for production which would require from 600 to 1,000 per cent of protection " !
