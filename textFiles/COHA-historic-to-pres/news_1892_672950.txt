The project of the most ambitious and best-equipped exploring party over sent into the interior of the Australian Continent has been abandoned . This was the party led by DAVID LINDSAY and supported by Sir THOMAS ELDER . We recently narrated the experience of the explorers in the first stage of their journey . Owing to unexpected and unprecedented lack of water on the route , they were forced to go to the coast . Not long after the journey had been resumed the scientists who accompanied LINDSAY quarreled with him and resigned . Thereupon LINDSAY and the seceding members of the party went back to Adelaide , where their stories were told to the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia and to Sir THOMAS ELDER . It - was then expected that the original plan of exploration would be followed by LrNDSAY , but our latest advices from Adelaide show that nothing more is to be done . Sir THOMAS ELDER wrote to the Geographical Society on March 14 that he had decided to bring the work of the expedition to a close . " I shall hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of resuming this scientific and exploring work at a more favorable time . As I have not lost confidence in Mr. LINDSAY 'S management and still think he was beaten by the season , I propose to give him what I consider fair compensation for loss of office . " The party traveled about 4,000 miles . We described recently the discoveries made . The Adelaide Register speaks of the expedition as follows : Such a complete scheme of its kind has never before been attempted in Australia : If its full purpose had been fulfilled . the opportunities for further Australian exploration would have been practically closed . The design contemplated not only the filling up of the blanks in the map of this great continent , and of the hiatus in our geographical and topographical knowledge , but the collection by specialists of information concerning the fauna and the flora , the geology and the ethnology of the regions to be traversed. - Those regions cover an area of about 800,000 square miles lying between the routes of FORREsT , GILLS , and WARBURTON . to the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south and the Fitzroy on the north . This was to be the main theatre of the exploits of the expedition . If , however , the chief project had been successful , examination would also have been made of the country further north below the Victoria River , thence southeast between GREGORY 'S 1856 and 81-TART 'S 1860 tracks , and even of the little patch situated to the west of the Herbert River as far as nearly to the verge of the Queensland boundary . " It was an expedition of great promise but small performance . " At every important stage it found its reasonable hopes and plans cruelly frustrated by ill fortune . " The real cause of the quarrel between LINDSAY and : the specialists has not been disclosed to the public in Australia , although it is known that " the rigid . temperance views of the leader " were not acceptable to those who seceded . The first stage was made at a time of great drought . The camels were forced to travel 560 miles in 34 days , and for 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the supply of water in the region traversed was smaller than it was fifteen or twenty years ago , there is no positive proof that the interior of tho continent has become more arid . The expeditious of ? earlier years may have been made at times when the supply was exceptionally and temporarily large , and it is known that the country had been suffering from drought for some time before LINDSAY began his journey in April . 1891 . The explorers found large forests of noble trees where no water could be obtained except by tapping the roots of a few trees of the malice variety . The presence of these thriving forests certainly indicates a considerable supply of water be- neath the surface . The reports of the expedition , so far as they have appeared . do not deal with the question of subterranean supplies of water , although it is one of great importance to those who hope that parts of the unused and almost unknown interior of the continent may be utilized for grazing or the growing of crops .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
