NEI ' a little while ago we were by way of pass ing a law to take the profit out of war . But there was already such a law . We did not pass it . No parliament nor any congress of nations had passed it . With no celebration it had passed itself . And if it has not yet established itself in world intel  --  ligence , that is because , firstly , it took place as a fact not all at once , but gradually in the evolution of mod  --  ern circumstances , so that you can not make a stroke through time or touch a place and say it was then and there the economic motive for war became bankrupt in principle ; and because , secondly , the immemorial idea of conquest deeply inheres in the human race . Certainly the President was unaware of it when he was saying in his Chautauqua speech , in 193n : " If war should break out again in another continent , let us not blink the fact that we would find in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches  --  fools ' gold  --  would attempt to break down or evade our neutrality . They would tell you  --  and , unfortunately , their views would get wide public  --  ity  --  that if they could produce and ship this and that and the other article to belligerent nations , the unemployed of America would all find work . . . it would be hard to resist that clamor ; it would be hard for many Americans , I fear , to look beyond  --  to realize the inevitable penalties , the inevitable day of reckoning that comes from a false prosperity . To resist the clamor of that greed , if war should come , would require the unswerving support ol ' all Amer  --  icans who love peace . " Three years later , the war on another continent did come . Then two unpredictable things happened . One was that in his message to Congress for lifting the arms embargo , it was the President . himself who spoke of the greater profit from selling also arms and m tie it i Otis and the finished implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . He said : " From a purely aratcrial point of view , what . is the advantage to us in sending all manner of articles across the ocean for final processing there , when we could give employment to thnusa rids by doing it here ? " The other was that business nailed on its lintel these words : " American industry hates wart " The Voice of American Business rrHE National Association of Manufacturers said : I " No sensible person believes that profits can come out of the wreckage of human life and economic dis  --  location . " The United States Chamber of Commerce said : " We wish no profit advantage . " In all the McGraw-hill industrial and business publications appeared a message beginning : " Business stands against war . Let us take a clear-eyed look at this thing we call war . War is a political tool for domina  --  tion or suppression , a device of futility . " Such was the voice of business , big and little ; and it was raised not only against war as a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic evils , even in a neutral country . " The use of this crisis , " said the National Association of Manufacturers , " as an excuse either to extort unjustifiable profits or to pursue partisan political objectives is not only indefensible and dangerous but reprehensible morally . " In this position , no two divisions of business were more positive than the steel and chemical industries . whence come guns and orplosives , Nothing that was believed of business , as to its foresight , wisdom and character , could have pre  --  pared any expectation of this radical event . The cyn  --  ical opinion of it was that the role of supplier to a war in Europe would have been regarded as an answer to faith and prayer . A neutral and distant geographical position , a surplus of raw materials , a surplus of in  --  dustrial capacity , a surplus of labor , and a , law to save business from its own folly , saying the war customers must come themselves and get the stuff and pay cash clown on the barrel head at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing more . But instead of the fools ' rush that had been predicted , instead of the clamor of greed that was going to put American neu  --  trality in jeopardy , there was that violent contrary reaction . American business represents the most powerful economic machine in the world , and it makes this original declaration  --  that it has neither heart nor stomach for war profits . Such a thing has never oc  --  curred before , neither here nor anywhere else . Twenty years ago , the possibility of it was unimaginable . What does it mean ? Several answers to that question are current in the market place . Among forty-one directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce , for example , thirty-six have been in the trenches . They remember what . war is like , and , remembering , they are the more fearful that a high material stake in the outcome of the war might Lend to involve this country as a bel  --  ligerent . Secondly , business is still tinder the influ  --  ence of elders who experienced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflation . Thirdly , of course , is the dread of the Mobilization Day Plan , under which , in ease of war , the Government would be expected to lay its hands on all business , with the possibility that it might never take them off . These are reasons , no doubt , and yet they bear hardly more than their own weight . It is by no means so certain that memory and experience do withhold us from repetitive folly . Moreover , what is signifi  --  cant here is not the attitude of American business toward war as it might involve this country . That could have been taken for gran Led . The thing to be accounted For is the adverse judgment pronounced upon war profits as such , even though it should be guaranteed that the country would stay neutral and not itself become involved , There is , of course , the moral aversion . War profits are stained with blood . But that is an emo tional consideration , not rational , and give it what weight you will , it still is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate reason . And that reason would be that American business , for the first time , and by an intuition of its own not yet entirely rationalized , has arrived at the truth that war as an instrument of economic policy is ob  --  solete in the world . If that is so , it follows as a fact that there is no profit in war , and a new way of thinking begins . This truth , now to be affirmed , is not one of the immortal verities , like a moral truth , nor is it in any way a consequence of civilization . It is an economic truth , belonging to our time , and in some sense a created truth , because it could act only in the arti  --  ficial modern environment with which science , inven  --  tion , technology and mechanical power have sur  --  rounded life .

War could be made to pay . It was so down to the year 1870 , when Bismarck maneuvered France into war when she was not pre  --  pared , laid siege to Paris and won the game . The Germans went home with the province of Alsace , part of Lorraine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking . But that was a fluke , and , it may be , the last instance or pure gain on the gaming table of war . Why ? Because , thanks again to science , in  --  vention and mechanism , the cost of war is too great . The cost of taking Paris today would be enormously more than any sum of tribute the French could be made to pay , just as the cost of stopping the Ger  --  mans when they tried to do it again twenty-five years ago was so great that the Allies navel ' could get it back in the form of German reparations . It was impossible . What were the economic objects of conquest ? To name them in their probable historic sequence they would be land , slaves , treasure , tribute and trade ; and what has happened to them , one by one , is that either the necessity ' which once was pleadable has disappeared or that the object itself has passed be yond the reach of ( Continued on Page 55 ) .72 ) C.

The tray dropped from her fingers , but she did not know it . Her lips opened and her hands lifted and extended toward Gamaliel . Suddenly he was tired , exhausted , numb with a dreadful weariness .

The application of knowledge and scientific thought to agriculture and the amazing extension of man 's physical power by mechanical means have together produced this re  --  sult ; and it is not a temporary condi  --  tion , likely to he overtaken by an in  --  crease of population , for whereas the productivity of both the soil and the labor laid upon it has been increased already two or three fold , there is new Before you build your home or camp , knowledge enough in the field of n1 ' 0- biology to increase it many-fold more , so that the amount of human life that may be sustained on a given area of land is much greater than was ever hitherto imaginable . IL is , in fact , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of fertile land is no longer for any people a mat  --  ter of life or death , nor need it lie a matter of the slightest anxiety . IL fol  --  lows that land is not a rational object of conquest for two reasons  --  namely , first , that for an industrial nation it is and for it long time will be cheaper to buy agricultural commodities than to produce them for itself , and , secondly , that the productivity of the land it already possesses may be wonderfully increased . Fear of famine , on the western side of the world , at least , has been ban  --  ished . Yet remember , this has occurred only in our time , whereas land hunger in people is from what is probably the oldest fear memory in the tissues of the human race  --  the memory of scarcity . If you look , you will see this again and again  --  that the facts of human be  --  havior , political behavior especially , contradict the facts of modern exist  --  ence . Change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we know , causeless  --  as who can say what caused the machine ? ? whereas habits of thinking and feeling are his  --  toric and continuous and change very slowly . Slavery was one of the very old insti  --  tutions in the world , older than written history . The moral sense of mankind did not destroy it ; the machine did that . Yet the machine is new . It has neither a tradition nor any way of ac  --  counting for itself . Each day it is new again . It destroyed the economic value of slavery because it is cheaper than slaves . It had been cheaper to build the Pyramids with machines , only at that time there were no machines . In the time of Cato , a fair price for a farm slave was two hundred and fifty dollars . Which will you have  --  a tractor or four slaves ? There was no original necessity for the machine . Civilization might have continued forever with out it . Now life is more dependent upon the ma  --  chine than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the population or the world has more than doubled , all owing to the machine . Abolish the machine and half the human life now existing in the earth would perish . Well , then , why is the machine riot a rational object of conquest. ? Why not capture the machine instead of the slave ? The Lesson of the Ruhr The French . had that thought when , in 1923 , because reparation payments were not forthcoming from the Ger  --  mans , they occupied the Rulu ? Valley region . That was the very heart of in  --  dustrial Germany . The machines were there . Along with the troops the French sent engineers and technicians . The troops were to command obedience ; the engineers and technicians were to supervise the Germans at work in the mines and steel plants . I was there . From the hotel in Essen , which had been staffed with French cooks and French servants bemuse they were all afraid to touch German food , three army officers and an en  --  gineer took me in a French motorcar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region . They spread out a map on which the industrial plants were marked . Over there was Stinnes , there was Thyssen , there was Krupp , and so on . Then we rushed off at high speed to visit them . Each plant was surrounded by a high brick wall ; and each time we came to a gate , there was a lone German watchman , unarmed , his arm upraised , rotating his palm against us . That was enough . The Frenchmen dared not try to pass him . Why not ? They could call their troops ; they could knock down the walls . Yes ; but what they knew was that at a signal a few Germans could wreck the machines , and it would take them only five minutes to do it . The machine , you see , may be trusted only to willing hands . Fancy chaining a slave to a tractor or to the levers that control a rolling mill worth two or three million dollars ! Two thousand years ago , in the same place , the Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior force and chains . The German himself was the booty . Nevertheless , the Germans now are pursuine the idea that would not work for the French in the Ruhr . They have captured the machines of Czechoslo  --  vakia and Poland . But who will work them ? If the Czechs and Poles who were working them before can not be trusted to do it , or refuse , then , of course , they may be exterminated . That is possible . Only , mark it . each Czech or Pole who is exterminated for his unwillingness to accept this servi  --  tude is one customer less for the prod  --  ucts of German machines , whereas it had been Germany 's bitter complaint against the state of the world that her economy was in want of customers . The importance of this fact will become more apparent under the head of trade as an economic object of conquest . We are coming to that . But what needs first to be emphasized is the change that has taken place in the na  --  ture of wealth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gold and treasure , in relation to the total , is insignificant . Alexander , thinking to loot the richest country in the modern world , as if it were the opulent East of his time , would he as na  --  ve as a retired hank burglar who once conferred upon me the honor of his acquaintance . His chronic mental state was one of moral indignation against . the dishonesty of bank figures . He knew that I wrote about banking in a serious way , alit I for a while ho could not make up his mind whether to blame my intelligence or my morals . One day he took from his pocket an old and carefully preserved piece of newspaper , which turned out to be the published statement of the finrineiul condition of a suburban bank . Pointing to the item of total assets , whiff is all that he understood of it , he said : " Look . That 's what they tell the people they 've got . Every bank does . They are lying . I know , been-use I ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there . You 'd be surprised . I 've seen more money in a faro bank . " I could not make him understand that the wealth of a bank , not the one he examined only , but any one , is riot in gold and currency ; that it is in book entries , in bundles of I 0 II 's , in a stream of people arriving and depart- ing , some to deposit money , some to receive , some to pay interest , and some to burrow . What do the borrowers do with the money ? Let it be that one puts iL into a machine , promising to pay it back with interest . He can not pay it hack with interest , or at all , but from the sale of the machine 's product . The product , provided it satisfies a human want and people are ready to buy it , is truly wealth . The machine itself is not . That is to say , the machine considered merely as an object is not wealth . It is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines of the motor industry would be utterly worthless if there were not millions of people able and willing to buy new motorcars each year . Nor is gold wealth , but in ornaments and jewelry that satisfy an aesthetic desire . Monetary gold is not wealth . The only reason why we regard it as such is that people can not trust one another to keep their word and not to counterfeit or debase their paper money . The case of a nation trading and exchanging goods with her neigh  --  bors is that if her word is not good and her trade is out of balance , she will he unable to keep a gold reserve if she has one ; whereas , if her word is good and her trade is in proper balance , she will not need any gold , or hardly any . The gold the Germans have seized in Austria , Czechoslovakia and Poland , no matter how much , is of very little importance , except in a state of war economy . All the gold in the world would not solve Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and consume what she bought with it , instead of producing and ex  --  changing real wealth ill a. way to make herself and the whole world richer . When the gold was gone , she would he much worse off than before . The Price of a War Machine Yet one hears the argument that Germany , being obliged to buy the raw materials required by her industry , first Was drained of gold by reparation payments to the Allies , and then , hav  --  ing only the products of her technical skill to exchange for a continuous sup  --  ply of raw materials , the world turned against her goods , wherefore she could not buy because she could not sell , her exchange position was ruined , and she was forced to go to war in order to possess herself of the raw materials she was no longer able to buy . Never was Germany denied access to raw materials at the world price  --  the same as was paid by everyone else . It is not true that she was drained of gold . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency . It is not true that reparations drained her . She did not pay them . She borrowed the money to pay them , principally from us , and then defaulted . I t is true that she has to buy raw materials and that what . she has to buy them with is her technical skill in the form of manufactured goods ; but that is true also of Belgium , for example , and there were no more barriers in the world against German goods than against Belgian goods un  --  til , in this country , we raised tariffs against Germany to compensate for the subsidies she gave to her own export  --  ers , with a political motive , and this we thought unfair . What Germany did was to use the proceeds of everything she could sell to build a war machine , and that is what ruined her exchange position . If you buy raw materials to make a machine , you can sell either the machine or its products , and the whole world is thereby richer ; but if you buy raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tending to use them yourself , as Ger  --  many did , these you can not sell and your buying power declines . Having pursued that . policy , a nation finds itself in an impossible dilemma . In no case can the war implements be converted back into things that satisfy human wants . That way the economic loss is irretrievable . You can convert food into guns , by doing without butter and having armaments instead , but you can not convert guns back into butter . So , therefore , that nation must make a desperate choice between two evils . One is to suffer an immediate economic disaster from demobilization , which will entail unemployment and then years of hard work and privation until new wealth can be created ; the other is to release the war machine on its de  --  structive and profitless errand . There was , it is true , a high emo  --  tional barrier against German goods . That was the boycott , in retaliation for her treatment of the Jews , and no doubt it did a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not economic ; the consequences were . And from this you come to a kind of wealth , imponderable and yet very im  --  portant , that can not be bought or sold . Since the great wealth of the modern world consists not in things that may be seized and dragged home , but in the continuity of process and exchange , in debits and credits . in the faith of con  --  tract , in mass production as a means and mass consumption as the end , none of which may he commanded by force , all of which are beyond the reach of conquest , it follows that the good will of neighbors is itself a priceless commodity . It has been cultivated more or less ; never has it been con  --  quered . But the toughest of all surviving de  --  lusions are those concerning trade as a rational object of conquest , compre  --  hending ideas such as economic empire , colonies to exploit , preferential mar  --  kets , pathways of one 's own to the sources of raw material and then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ideas as these now are obsolete in 111 reason , or tending to become so , that was not always to be said of them . Not long ago , they were valid enough . They were valid for Great Britain while she was founding her empire . What happened to them , briefly , was that the world passed from what , in the language of the economist , is called an economy of scarcity to an economy of plenty ; and that has taken place within one lifetime . It may be strange that one of the splendid visions of a world of amicable well-being and wealth beyond con  --  quest occurred in Germany . I was there during the second year of the World War . The man I most wanted to see was Walther Rathenau , because he was the economic director , with abso  --  lute power over physical resources , and my errand was to find out , if I could , whether it was true or not that Ger $ many 's material means to war were about to be exhausted . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discouraging . They said I might as well be wanting to see the Kaiser . So I sent a note around to him , and the answer was that I might came in the next morning at ten , for half an hour . .17 Window in Berlin It was winter . Snow was falling . He was alone in his office and the tempera  --  ture was uncomfortably low . We stood at the window looking out , and that made it seem warmer inside .

II Or I had expected to meet a great ad  --  ministrator , and that he was . I knew also that he was an engineer , and that as a chemist he had made important discoveries .

Whether Germany 's resources would permit her to go on for a. month , a year , two years  --  what . difference did it make ? Sometime it would end , and then the problem would be what it was before . How shall competitive people live together in the world , now all shut up in it , no insulating partitions of space , solitude or silence between them , yet obliged to be continuously dividing it , else retreat into barbarism ?

Trade of that kind , besides increasing the satisfac  --  tions , would save so much  --  saving . that is to say , the cost of senseless com  --  petition , the waste of duplication and , most of all , the cost . of war and armaments  --  that in a time to come the human race might be truly and re- , sponsibly rich .

It is the same theme . While the World War lasted , Rath-1 enau 's genius for administration made him indispensable to his country . After  --  ward , serving her in statesmanship and representing her in foreign affairs , his dream became a liability . It was not a German dream . The German instinct turned against him , as it was bound to , do , and in 1922 he was assassinated . How inevitable that was , then or later . is now apparent .

But if you could swap glass beads for gold and ivory , that was in every way much better , since it entailed no risk , did not dry up the source , and saved you the cost of a fighting force with which you would have to share the loot . Long after international trade had become highly civilized , very complex , and inseparable from the well-being of the world , it still retained more or less of that character . It was implicit in the mercantile doctrine of England down to the time of Adam Smith  --  the doctrine that in order to profit by foreign trade , a nation must sell more than it buys and tw  --  itundate the differ  --  enee in gold , which is another way of saying that what you take must be worth more than what you give in ex  --  change . And since then , even until now , it has been implicit in the scheme of economic empire , colonies and colonial markets . That principle of trade would work for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one great indus  --  trial notion in the world . There might be two or three great industrial nations , exchanging the products of their ma  --  chines and their high-caste labor for the food and raw materials produced by drudge and peasant labor in far  --  away places , and still it would work and there would be profit in it . But the machine was uncontrollable . It got loose and went migrating all over the earth . And when it . was  --  as I have heard a . British lord say  --  that many countries had come to have industries who were not entitled to have them , each one wanting to have a favorable balance of trade , the old principle was hound to break down . Everybody could not have a favorable balance of trade , for where would it come from ? It is the machine again . Not only did it , go migrating , taking with it everywhere , like a tag , the primer of economics ; it became more and more versatile . Industry had invented it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving food and raw ma  --  terials to be produced by manual labor . The Birth of Surplus Not until the machine began to act upon the production of food and raw materials , too , did that change take place in the state of the world which has been called the change from an economy of scarcity to an economy of plenty . This was the incomparable event in the life of the race , since the Expulsion and Curse , aud our intelli  --  gence has not yet been able to assimi  --  late it . The word " surplus " appeared , not to mean blessing , but , in absurd contradiction of common sense , to mean economic disaster , panic and unemployment . The further absurdity is that with some glimpse of the right way , people all with one voice cry , " Trade , more trade ! " and at the same time put up barriers against one an-other 's trade and each Dation goes on trying to sell more than it buys . Which means only that a theory of trade that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before had there been enough of anything becomes utterly bankrupt in a world where there is a surplus of all things  --  of food , of raw materials , goods and labor . There was a phrase above : " Mass production as a means and mass con on sumptio sumption as the end . " The key is there . A problem that had been always the first . economic anxiety of man has dis  --  appeared  --  how to produce enough . A problem hitherto unknown presents itself  --  how to ? onsurne what we are able to produce . Suppose it were possible to dispense with the man as a producer , letting the machine do everything . All the more is the man indispensable as a con  --  sumer , else what will you do with the products of the machine ? That is to say , whereas formerly it was con  --  sumption that could he taken for granted , because never was there enough to satisfy bare human wants , now it is production that may be so taken for granted , and the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much cheaper that the consumption of them may be enor  --  mously increased . That seems a. simple statement . But what are its implica  --  tions ? It means that it no longer pays to exploit your customer , your market or your colony for all the immediate profit it . will yield , for if you do . you limit the power of consumption , whereas how to increase it is your real problem ; and if you do not increase it , your profit , too , will be limited and may altogether fail . It means that the motive to possess customers , markets and colonies , in or  --  der to exploit them , is unsound eco  --  nomically and will in the end defeat itself . And it means that economic , empire , founded upon the ancient right of the strong to exploit . the labor of the weak , has more past than future . Within a country , or , as we say , in a domestic economy , it means that the cost of human satisfactions must tend to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that the standard of common living may rise , for unless it does , the fruits of mass production can not , be consumed . What is true of a , domestic economy is true also of a world economy . The great object of trade , therefore , must be to raise the standard of living in the whole world , not to enrich a few nations . Always trade has had that effect , whether in  --  tending it or not ; never has it been rationally conscious of that object , as now it must begin to be in order to save itself . Beyond the thought of markets and colonies of their own to be exploited , those nations called the " have-nots , " Germany foremost , keep saying they must possess their own sources of raw material in order to compete with the " haves , " meaning especially Great Britain . They n lake an outcry of it , and it is specious . For metals , fibers , rubber , fuel and all basic commodities , there is a world market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , raw ma  --  terials flow freely to meet any demand as by gravity of price . Moreover , those who produce them are more anxious to sell them than any industrial nation is to buy them , and generally those who produce raw materials have a standard of living below that ? of the industrial life . Formerly , in the pioneer time of development , when the supply , if left to itself , was inconstant or inadequate , then it was well for an industrial nation to invest its capital in sources of raw material . But there is no longer any advantage in it ; on the contrary , there are conditions under which it entails additional risk . Only in time of war is it important for a nation to possess its own raw materials , and then , of course , it may be vital , since a nation at war will he unable to buy them at any price if its enemy controls the highways by land and sea . But by that fact the ar  --  gument is turned upside down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of its own for purposes of trade , seeing that in time of peace it is cheaper to buy them than to produce them . It is the other way . It wants control of raw materials in order to go to war . But go on with it . Suppose Germany by force should get possession at the source of all the raw materials her in  --  industry needs . What will she do with them ? She will convert them , of course , in to manufactured goods . Then where will she sell the goods ? What cus  --  tomers will she have that she did not have before ? If the answer is that she must go on to conquer new markets for German goods , that means she must take them from her rivals , from Eng  --  land perhaps . But she can not do that without . hurting the economic position of England , and she can not hurt the economic position of England without hurting her own , because in time of peace England had been her best cus  --  tomer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will partly or wholly lose upon the other , for the web of trade now is such that rivals are one another 's customers . A National Will , o'A'he  --  Wisp Twenty-five years ago , Germany was saying this same thing . She had come late to the feast and the world was all taken up . She had no place in the sun , uowhere to trade , no room at all . She was squeezed in an iron band , and was obliged to break it by force . Such was her propaganda . Now turn to the figures of her foreign trade . In the twelve years preceding the World War , her exports had more than dou  --  bled . In the year 191:3 , the last before the World War , she stood second only to Great Britain . Her share of the total foreign trade of the world was 14 per cent : Great Britain 's share was 19 per cent . For ten years , Germany 's share had been rising ; Great Britain 's bad been falling . And in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying twice as much from Germany as Germany bought from her . With no economic empire , and not  --  withstanding the fact that she was buying both raw materials and food  --  stuffs , Germany was already the most powerful industrial nation in Europe , and on the way to becoming the fore  --  most nation of the world in trade . She was ahead of the United States and was overtaking England . Her exer  --  tions in foreign trade were prodigious ; she sacrificed her domestic economy for the sake of it . Yet she was not think  --  ing of foreign trade as a way of increas  --  ing the wealth of the world , nor of her own primarily . The motive was political  --  cal . She regarded foreign trade as a means to Weltmachl , or world power . That was what she wanted most . Going to war for it , she lost it , and to  --  gether with it , her eminence in world trade . So also with Japan , only in her ease it is Asiatic power . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and sorry thing to look at . What does she want in China ? Trade , she says , and raw materials . The cost of taking the raw materials by force , over what it would have cost her to buy them , has already devoured the profits of fifty years ' trade ; besides that in doing it she has wrecked the economic life of China and killed her own customers by hundreds of thou  --  sands . How much buying power have these dead Chinese for Japanese goods wrought from China 's raw materials ? Lying deep in the original contra  --  diction , wherein the race hath both iniquity and grandeur in it by mix  --  ture , there are too many reasons for war  --  revenge , fear , honor , lust for power , delusions of racial and national aggrandizement , ideas of freedom and justice  --  but now and for the first time the economic-profit motive is not among them , having deserted to the other side . It is as if in the blind mag  --  nificence of his material achievements man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-interest than upon generosity , without knowing what he did or how , or that it would ever happen . For now it is to he perceived that your enemy is also your customer , and indispensable as such . That was the problem that presented itself at the end of the World War . A strong Ger in the official life of Washington , I will be constantly so engaged . " That ended the whispering cam  --  paign . Hanes said that now that his critics knew where he stood , all was fair , since he had always known where they stood . Hanes can he equally direct with great financiers . A few months ago he was invited to speak at a large gather  --  ing in the East . He was to discuss Gov  --  ernment finance . Present wits a hanker who , he suspected , might prove diffi  --  cult when the time for questions came . ( Hanes has the habit of making his speeches very short and then inviting questions , because , he says , that is the only way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested in what . he is talking about . ) Sure enough , when Hanes invited questions , the first man on his feet was the banker . " I want to ask you , Mr. Secretary , why is it that all business has to be reg  --  ulated and advised by a lot of crack  --  pots in Washington instead of by able and patriotic people who understand business ? " Hanes looked at the banker and said : " T am mighty glad you asked me such an intelligent and straightforward quest ion , and I am gratified that you use the words ' able ' and ' patriotic ' in describing the kind of person we need in Government work . I know you arc able , because you are the president of the largest bank in this city , you own and manage more real estate than any  --  one else in this section of the country and you are a director in seventy per cent of the corporations in this city . I know you are patriotic , because of the fervor with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess in great measure , and I am glad , because it so happens that there are two vacancies in the Treasury De  --  partment at this moment either of which I can recommend to the President be filled with a man whom I suggest , and I am happy to offer you either one of them . One of them pays eighty-five hundred dollars per year and the other pays nine thousand dollars a year . I get ten thousand dollars per year , and whichever one you accept , I will make up the difference to you out of my own salary . " The banker discovered that he did not have the time to go to Washington . Hanes observed later that patriotism with most people stops at about $30,000 a year . many , restored by the aid of her trade rivals , would probably fight again ; on the other hand , a weak Germany would be a poor customer . The ancients , as Woodloek says in the Walt Street Journal , did it much better . Whom they did not kill on the battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left to be governed and to pay tribute for the blessings of law and order . But war is no longer battle . It is a total thing . Once it Starts , it can not stop until one people has its foot on the other 's neck . Then what . will you do ? The cost of this victory is greater than any sum of tribute that can be collected . You can  --  not . kill a people , neither could you afford to do it . if you would . Therefore , all you can do is to help your enemy up , dust him off , straighten his tie and put money in his pocket in order to begin trading with him again . Hanes ' sense of hemer is the kind that permits hint nut le take himself or the people around him too seriously , When Katharine Hepburn was a house guest of Mrs. ! lanes last winter , she complained that the Washington the  --  ater audiences were not responsive to her comedy lines . Hanes said it was n't a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lines were n't nearly so funny as the things all of Washington was accustomed to seeing and hearing in official eirties every day . One night about ten o'clock , after a hard day , the Under Secretary was sit  --  ting in the Washington Hotel , across the street from his office , waiting for his car to take him home . A tourist , who was sitting in the chair beside him , turned to Hanes and asked , " Mister , do you know how to get those cards that take you into the Senate Gallery ? " " Just ask one of the senators from your state . " " Do you work for the Government , mister ? ' ' " Yes , I do . " " Where do you work ? " " I work over in the Treasury , " " Gosh , it must be fine to be around with all that money . " " I have n't seen as much as a. thin dime since I went to work over there , except when I got my pay check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , maybe they 'll let you handle the money . " " Yes , maybe they will . " " Are you a New Dealer ? " " No , I 'm not . " " How did you get your job ? " " 1 do n't know ; it just happened . " " Civil Service ? " " No . " " A friend of . Jim Farley 's ? " " Well , I 've met him. - " Did he get the job for you ? " " No . " " Does Morgenthan know much ? " " Yes , he knows a whole lot . " " What kind of a guy is this fellow John Hanes ? " " Well , I 'll tell you , he 's a pretty tired guy , " " Do you know him ? " " Yes , I know him . " " Like him ? " " Not very well , but I get along with him .
