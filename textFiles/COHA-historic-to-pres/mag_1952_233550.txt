What is mind ? The old gag answer , " No matter , " is not good enough for medical science , but the experts still have a tough time explaining what little they know-of the relationship between mind and brain . Sir Russell Brain , one of Britain 's top specialists in the workings of the nervous system , tackled the subject in a lecture at Cambridge University , which is published as The Contribution of Medicine to Our Idea of Mind ( Cambridge University Press ) . He begins with a disclaimer and a definition : " I speak of the mind quite openly and unashamedly , not being one of those philosophers who make their living by expounding the nonexistence of their own minds . . . I shall assume that you know what I mean when I say that thinking , remembering , imagining , willing , feeling emotions and experiencing sensations are the kind of activities we describe as mental . " <P> Soaring . Though he shies away from any attempt to define precisely and positively what mind is , Sir Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than grey matter : " Though it is linked through the brain to the world of matter , it moves in its own sphere as though it could soar above the physical . " <P> For a century , says Sir Russell , doctors have been studying how disease in the brain affects the mind , and some of the results have been surprising . Example : " We might have found that the mind behaved as something homogeneous , and that damage to the brain in any part merely made the mind generally less efficient , but that is not the case . The brain has a highly complex structure and so has the mind , and we are discovering by degrees what is the relationship between brain structure and mind structure . " <P> While the brain is roughly compartmented for distinct types of work ( e.g. , emotional , intellectual ) , there is no sharp division between brain processes which accompany conscious and unconscious mental activity , said Sir Russell . " Mind , therefore . . . can not . . . be identified with consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are large and important parts of the brain which are concerned with . . . solving problems while we sleep , making jokes , creating the characters who people our dreams , and contributing that vital element which we call inspiration to the work of the artist , poet and novelist . " <P> Curtain Call . Neurologist Brain refused to try to adjudicate between physical and psychological explanations of mental states . But he could not resist a dig at the extreme Freudians : " You will recall the moving end of Peer Gynt , where Peer finds Solveig . . . and realizes that she is both wife and mother . . . If , as the curtain falls , a psychoanalyst in the seat behind you whispers : ' Oedipus complex ! ' , do you understand the play better or enjoy it more ? " <P> Medicine , said Sir Russell , may have to be scientific and therefore analytical , but it must also be an art . And the art of medicine , insisted Scientist Brain , must never lose sight of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
