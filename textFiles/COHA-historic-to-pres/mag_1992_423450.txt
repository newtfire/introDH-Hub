<p> HER FACE goes blank , and everyone in the room knows what 's coming . Things were moving along smoothly during Sinead O'Connor 's public debut of material from Am I Not Your Girl ? , her first album since her 1990 breakthrough I Do Not Want What I Have n't Got . The risky new record is a collection of pop standards that were family favorites in her youth : These are the songs that made me want to sing , ' she explains in the album credits . <p> She 's spent all morning in front of a forty-piece orchestra at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens , New York , singing Loretta Lynn 's Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home , ' in preparation for a television broadcast on the BBC 's Top of the Pops . As show time approaches , she 's told she only needs to answer one brief introductory question before going into the song . <p> But when the host beams in from London over Sinead 's headphones , the singer flinches . She does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a boring question , ' she says . What do you think I 've been fucking doing ? ' Then she 's off - ca n't he ask her something specific , like was there really a potato famine in Ireland ? No , it 's explained , that would confuse the listeners . Finally , she agrees to answer . I 've been getting as far away from being famous and materially successful as possible , ' she snaps , a response that - surprise - never makes it to the airwaves . <p> As she starts to sing , her voice sounds great , fuller and more dramatic than on the album , but what everyone will remember about Sinead this day is that she was difficult . It 's a split-second paradigm of her career . After I Do Not Want rocketed up the charts , powered by a haunting , unforgettable version of the Prince-composed Nothing Compares 2 U , ' and established her as both one of the most revered and most despised new stars in recent years , she commenced a series of moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans . <p> In rapid succession , she pulled out of a Saturday Night Live appearance because shock comic Andrew Dice Clay was that week 's host , refused to allow The Star-Spangled Banner ' to be played before a concert of hers in New Jersey ( Frank Sinatra said she deserved a kick in the ass ' ' ) , boycotted the Grammy Awards to protest the materialism of the music industry ( Hammer offered to pay her way back to Ireland ) and moved to Los Angeles but soon returned to London , claiming that there is n't any American culture . ' Last year she continued growing up in public , giving painful accounts in the press of the childhood abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother . <p> As she curls up barefoot on a sofa in her mid-Manhattan hotel , smoking Camels and slamming espresso through two intense marathon conversations , it is clear that the twenty-five-year-old O'Connor continues to regard interviews as an opportunity for public therapy , a way to confront her current twin obsessions - God and child abuse . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asserts ideas and opinions that are still essentially unformed and , more curious than strident , is passionately sincere even when directly contradicting herself . And talk about wearing your hang-ups on your sleeve : Her ripped oversize T-shirt reads RECOVERING CATHOLIC . <p> What is it like to go back and sing songs familiar from your childhood - such an unhappy time in your life ? <p> Without me noticing it , it became a kind of a journey inside myself , to rescue myself . To go in and have fun and be who I am , which is just a girl who wants to have fun and sing . The songs on the first two albums were all about me working things out . These songs are about having worked a lot of those things out . <p> I 'd say it 's the closure of a phase and therefore the opening of another one . I have to let go of some things so that I can become whoever it is I 'm supposed to be . I 'm only twenty-five . I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fifty or sixty . I think I 'm becoming a woman . I 'm growing up , but I 've been finding it hard to let go of being a girl . Were the songs selected for specific memories ? <p> A lot of them were . Do n't Cry for Me Argentina ' is very emotional for me because my mother used to really like me to sing her that song . It was the first song that I ever sang outside of school . Later , I used to run away , and to make money I would sing that song in talent competitions . Scarlet Ribbons ' links up with my father because he used to sing me that song . I was staggered by the idea of these ribbons just appearing because this girl asked God for them . Are you afraid of people looking at Do n't Cry for Me Argentina ' and thinking you 're being presumptuous , trying to emulate Eva Peron or present yourself as a martyr ? <p> I do n't know anything about Eva Peron . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . I can hardly sing it , it makes me feel so much . That 's the only reason I 've ever done anything . <p> Actually , that 's the song that a lot of people have picked out because they said they thought it was just crap , but then when they heard it , they said they heard the song for the first time in their lives . They could hear it as a song and not just some bollocks . What was it like singing in front of an orchestra ? <p> I felt like they must look at me and think : Who is this upstart ? Why is she pretending to be a singer ? ' I felt so intimidated because they just walk in off the fuckin ' street and play . That 's how they spend their whole lives . I just felt like such a bluffer . <p> I was really fucking paranoid about it . I was walking in where people like Ella Fitzgerald and Julie London had been . I just kept saying to myself , Shit , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who do you think you are ? ' But after I was done , I ended up feeling that I 'd like to get into that side of it , cabaret , ' for want of a better word . I 'd like to do things like musicals or things like what Liza Minnelli does . Most of the artists you usually talk about - rappers , Dylan , Van Morrison - break so many of the rules of songwriting , whereas these songs defined many of those rules . <p> No , I do n't think they do at all . I think that pop music these days is all along defined lines , but this music is n't . Cole Porter was an enormous chance taker . In an age where there was such a lot of censorship , he was able to very cleverly write rude things but say them in the most beautiful way . They did it in a much more pure and honest and truthful way . They went for reality then . <p> We do n't really write about real feelings , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . We do n't make love anymore , we fuck , and so we write about fucking . We do n't feel , we do n't feel . These people felt , and the songs still feel now . They wrote fifty or sixty years ago , and it 's exactly the same as it is now , whereas sixty years from now I Want to Sex You Up ' is not going to be in any way connected to what anybody feels . These people had it right . And after them it died . Did you try to record anything that you had written ? <p> No , I had no interest in putting out another Sinead O'Connor record . Just not interested . I needed to have some fun and get away from it for a while , ' cause it went somewhere that I was n't planning for it to . It 's not that I was displeased by that ; I 'm pleased with being successful , but now I need to leave that alone . Besides , I 'd like to be happy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a writer . I think of myself much more as a singer than a writer . The only reason I ever wrote songs was because I was so fucked up in my head that I had to figure things out for myself , and so I wrote songs to figure things out . Nothing Compares 2 U ' was an interpretation of a song you did n't write , too . <p> Well , exactly . And I think that that 's what I enjoy doing . I enjoy doing other people 's stuff better because it 's like acting . It 's a chance to use someone else 's words for a change instead of having to expose yourself . It 's a chance to let out the other parts of myself and not just the angsty young thing . Now I want to be a woman . How do you look back on those crazy months after I Do Not Want What I Have n't Got ' came out ? <p> Well , it 's all one thing to me . Nothing Compares 2 U ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomeration of experiences to me . I feel I was very lucky to have the experience . It was very frightening , and it was also good fun . And I got completely and utterly fucked up by it . I felt lost , I did n't know who I was , I had a total identity crisis . I practically broke down . But if it was n't for having got to that point , I never would have been put in a position where I had to find that out quickly , or else I was going to die . Is there anything you would handle differently now ? <p> No . Well , a lot of personal things , not public things . As far as any of the things I 've done in public , no . Except before the second album came out , my having said that I would support the IRA . Apart from that there 's actually nothing I regret . <p> On a personal level , I regret relationships that I got into where I did n't have my armor on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have had to ask myself why I did these things , why I attracted these people , why I could n't protect myself emotionally . Now I have my armor as a result of not having had it . So you 've got to be grateful to the people that fucked you up . It 's actually something to thank them for . What got you back on track ? <p> I had been stopped at a very young age and really had n't grown at all . So then when I became famous , all these things happened to me , and I was so broken down that I had to be helped . That 's when I met someone who became a very good friend - Peter Gabriel - who had been through a lot of the same things himself and recognized them in me . There was talk of a romance between the two of you . <p> People always assume that if a man and a woman are great friends , that they are lovers . I would say that Peter Gabriel and myself are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's one of my best , best friends , and beyond that I do n't have any comment . We 're a man and a woman who happen to be very good friends , and we have a lot in common . <p> I 'd say actually that most people who are influential in my life are grown men , men with a lot of experience and a lot of life . When men get to that age , they think about their lives a lot , they analyze their lives , and they 're very wise . Men really come to fruition when they 're about forty . Women , I think , more when they 're around thirty . It takes a long time to become a man . What do you think of the men 's movement ' ' ? <p> I love it . I love it . I love that book Iron John . It 's very accurate , what Robert Bly says in that book . I wish he would do a book that was the equivalent for women . I 'd love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Iron Joan . I think women are not very understanding , and I think it 's our own fault . Women are in control , whether we see it or not , because we have the babies , we raise the sons and the daughters . So if we do n't like how we 're being treated , we 've got to see that it 's our own fault because we 're not allowing our sons to be men . You have said that you are not a feminist . <p> I 'm not an anythingist . I do n't belong to anything . What does feminism mean to you ? <p> I have a very deep love and respect and understanding for men . I have a love and understanding for women , too , but sometimes I feel more compassion for men because of the pain they 're in . I do n't feel that men are bastards , and I do n't think it 's right to frighten them by trying in a conglomeration to act against them . It 's very difficult to be a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not to make little of what women are saying , because women are being treated abominably by some men , but it 's only because they do n't know what to do . Do you have any female role models ? <p> Joan of Arc is my biggest . My influences have been men , which is curious . I have n't felt as safe with women . I 've never been close to them . Obviously , because of my mom . My singing has been influenced by people like Etta James or Barbra Streisand . But Joan of Arc is definitely the one , because she fought for what she knew was the truth . She took literally what God told her , and she listened to the voices inside her and died for it . Died a most horrific death . Is the reason for these feelings about women entirely due to your relationship with your mother ? <p> I think probably inside myself I 've been quite frightened of women . Not that I do n't like them - I love them . But because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at me . The most frightening aspect is the way their faces look when they actually look at me . I 've been treated quite badly by women , like the girls at school . They hated me because I was very quiet , and I had long hair , and I would brush it in front of my face , and I would sit in the back of the class , and I never used to speak to them . They thought that I was very full of myself . They thought I was very beautiful and thought that I thought I was great and that 's why I would n't talk to them . So I feel safer with men . It seems you 've gotten more focused on religion . <p> There 's no such thing as religion , there 's only God . Which is truth . Organized religion is a lie . It 's designed to take you away from God , particularly the Christian church . People must learn about the history of the popes , the people who are running the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we practice Christianity or Catholicism or not , we 've got to realize that those fuckers are running the world , they 're running every government in the world . They are the World Bank . I do n't have proof of that , but I know that it 's true . <p> We 're living in hell as far as I 'm concerned . The existence of child abuse means that the devil is winning . The devil to me is not a little red guy with a fork , he 's a guy with a collar and a big red hat on that goes round saying , Young people of Ireland , I love you , ' when the young people of Ireland are sitting on the streets on heroin . Your spirituality sounds almost obsessive . <p> It 's from direct experience . I lived in hell for a long period of time . The only thing that saved my ass was God . I suppose it sounds like kind of an obsession , but it 's the only reason I survived . It was the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a decent relationship with myself and my family . I 'm still angry , but I 'm alive , and that 's because of God . If I had n't believed in God , I would be dead now , I would be drunk , I would be on drugs . God gave me a voice , and that 's what saved my ass . What got me through hell was my voice . <p> They do n't know what God is ; they 're the Roman Empire , the people who invented child abuse . All you have to do is look at their history to know that this is true . That 's why they killed Joan of Arc , that 's why they killed Jesus Christ , that 's why they killed Martin Luther King , that 's why they killed John Kennedy , that 's why they killed Pope John Paul I. That 's why they killed Malcolm X. It 's why they 've locked up Mike Tyson . <p> Poor Mike Tyson . I mean there is an example of a man who was treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused as children . He 's only a little tiny baby , and all of these people are trying to fuckin ' kill him . And they have killed him to a certain extent . They all have a great time saying what a monster he is . Lay off , because there but for the grace of God goes every single one of us . Poor man . He has had the most miserable upbringing . If he looks for solace in the arms of lots of women , what do you expect him to do ? And that woman that is suing him is a bitch . I do n't care if he raped her ; he should learn about himself and why it is he behaves like that , et cetera , et cetera . But equally she should look at herself and look at the disgrace that she is making of women . Look at what she is doing to him by trying to get money off him , going around doing chat shows . She 's used him , you know . It 's disgraceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned . You say we need to counter that with love . How do we get to that point ? <p> It takes forgiveness . Forgiveness is the most important thing . We all have to forgive what was done to us - the Irish people have to forgive , the African people , the Jewish people - all have to forgive and understand . The only way to stop the cycle of hate and abuse is not to allow ourselves to get caught up in it . What did you think about the riots in Los Angeles ? <p> I thought it was great . I really did . I thought it was time something happened and that people had some expression at last . I think it 's a shame that some people went so far as to kill other people , although I understand that people are in so much pain that they do n't know how to stay in control . But I think those people have a perfect right to go into shops and take anything they wanted to take . Absolutely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cleansing experience , and a lot of good has come out of it . Still , it does n't seem the most forgiving response . <p> They have to defend themselves . Jesus says that as well : Woe to the nation that does n't defend itself against the invader . ' You do n't have the right to kill , but you have the right to feed and clothe your family . You do n't have the right to go and break into a shop , but if the shop is fucked up and your children are starving and they do n't have anything to wear or they 're sick , then you have every right to take what you want . I think that obviously it 's awful for the people who do business and whose stores were destroyed , but in the end it 's a good thing that serves everybody . There 'll have to be a lot of chaos for us to sort ourselves out . When you moved from L.A. , it was said that you felt a lot of anger toward America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave the country for anything to do with that . I left because I missed home , and I missed my husband , and I missed red buses . I was lonesome . Being in Los Angeles was very tricky . I thought that the people would be so used to celebrities that it would n't be a problem . In fact the opposite is true because all the celebrities there really love being celebrities . I hung around with a couple of those people for a day or two , and they frightened the shit out of me . It 's like a hotel people check into for material success at any cost . Do you think people will be surprised to see the album dedication to New York ? <p> I never said I had a problem with America . People told you that because they want you to think that I 'm a liar and that I 'm full of hatred . They distorted what I was doing . People like me are scapegoats , people who point out the fact that those people are living a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why they 've assassinated everyone throughout history that ever spoke the truth . Why do you think there was such a backlash when you started speaking out so much ? <p> I think that was mainly because I was at a stage in my life where I had not yet the energy to be understanding of other people 's feelings , and therefore I expressed my own feelings in an aggressive way . I would n't change my feelings or not express them . But now I try to be considerate of what other people out there hear . I would n't be so aggressive and angry and pointing blame - I regret that - but that all came from a lack of understanding . Do you think the changes you 've gone through can happen on a larger scale ? <p> I can see it happening . I can see Axl Rose , myself , Roseanne Arnold and other people talking about their experiences . We can see the role models coming out now and giving hope to other people , giving a sense that you can survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing right in front of our eyes . Really , we 're just the same as everyone , we just happen to be so angry about it that we got ourselves famous so we could tell our stories . Are you comfortable presenting yourself as a role model ? Lots of rappers , for instance Ice Cube , say that they never signed up to be role models just because they make records . <p> I used to say that , too , but I think you 've got to accept the responsibility . With Ice Cube , that 's his low opinion of himself because of the upbringing he 's had . He does n't necessarily see how wonderful he is ; really he 's afraid to accept that he is the greatest poet that America has ever had . I would rank Ice Cube on an equal level with Bob Dylan in terms of being the voice of a generation . He 's possibly the most powerful person in this country , but he 's afraid to see that . Were you bothered by any of the controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean that he 's not a good writer . The point that everybody 's forgetting is that art is the use of language , the means of expressing feelings . We all know what he 's talking about and he 's making us feel . Also , he 's created a conversation where there has been silence . He 's created that debate , and that 's what art is for . Do you still listen to a lot of rap ? <p> I think it 's had its day . I think its age is over because it 's done everything it can do . It will continue , but it ca n't go any further , musically . Now something else will happen . Rap was the most influential form , the thing that most brought people together in the last ten years and that saved our asses , but it 's over . <p> Rappers are all young men , and they 're angry , and that 's why it 's brilliant . They 're angry , and they 've all been fucked around by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is why they 're making themselves heard . It 's also why Axl Rose is famous , Roseanne Arnold - it 's why I 'm famous . Because of a need to be heard ? <p> Because of wanting help , because we want help . We want our stories told . We do n't understand what 's happened to us , and we 're in a lot of pain . When Axl talks about his childhood abuse , you 're very aware of his being in therapy . <p> My therapy is my belief in God . Have you tried formal therapy at all ? <p> I tried it , yes , but it did n't speak to me . I tried one of the twelve-step programs - adult children of alcoholics-dysfunctional families , but I did n't like the clinical shrinks so much . I did n't get off on that , but I got off on the twelve-step thing . Is one-on-one therapy just too detached or too structured ? <p> It 's too much by the book . There 's rules they apply to everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their watch . It just did n't speak to me . Whereas the first time I walked into the adult child of dysfunctional families group , I was home . But it 's my belief in God that 's got me through . You 've talked about your fondness for smoking dope and also about your belief that crack imprisons the population of the inner city . By buying any drug are n't you helping finance the destructive part of the drug trade ? <p> I do n't buy marijuana off anybody that sells any other kind of drug . As far as I 'm concerned , selling marijuana is one of the most respectable things anyone could do . I think everybody should smoke it . Why ? <p> Because it teaches you a lot about yourself . It forces you to feel . You can not avoid being aware and getting in touch with yourself . People say you get really paranoid when you smoke , but it 's not that ; it 's that you were feeling that way the whole time . You ca n't run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . What do you make of the elections ? <p> I 'm shocked at how the stars in the entertainment industry allow themselves to be used . I 'm shocked that Aretha Franklin sang the national anthem at the convention , for example . I do n't know anything about Bill Clinton ; I ca n't really say except that his speech at the convention was more sad than anything else . You do n't think stars should choose sides or they should n't be involved at all in the process ? <p> Being involved in politics , which is designed to take you away from the truth . Those people are only interested in getting into power and getting a good salary . What if a celebrity feels that since they get this kind of attention , they should use it to help a cause they believe in ? <p> That 's fine , they should do that - but why not do it through the truth ? Do n't go through the liars to give your truth . Just give it . But as long as this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion is controlled by the political process . . . <p> No , as long as you 're in a situation where you 're controlled by people who want money , it does n't matter who you vote for . George Bush said that he would n't ban abortion . Bill Clinton will probably do the same thing . I would n't trust any of them . I would n't trust anyone who would hold a convention like that , who would hold it as if it were a gig , a big show , balloons and bands and flags and TV screens . It 's got nothing to do with anything but the publicity and the pomp . It has nothing to do with people who are starving . It 's all a lie . Should people vote ? <p> I 've never voted , and I will never vote in my life , because I realize that there 's absolutely no point . Because they 're all fucking liars , they all want the same thing , they 're all after one thing , which is money . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away from truth . <p> People should just not vote , they should stop going to work , they should screech this whole fucking sham to a halt . Put the fuckers out of business and start all over again . Have the faith to go through the chaos that will result from doing that , realize that 's the only thing to do . Look at what happened in Los Angeles . That has to happen on a larger scale without the destruction of people 's property or lives . If we 're all together , we can fuck it up . <p> PHOTOS ( 2 ) : Sinead O'Connor ( ALBERT WATSON ) <p> By ALAN LIGHT <p>
