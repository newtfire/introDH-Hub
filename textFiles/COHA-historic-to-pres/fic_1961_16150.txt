1 Exterior : Small Town Main Street , Afternoon An old Packard coup pulls up to a roadside gas pump . Two men , their baggy suits crumpled and sweaty from the long drive , get out and stretch their legs . The older man , Charlie Burns , a balding , desiccated man in his mid-forties , shambles toward the bar across the street . Eddie Felson remains behind to speak to the attendant . &nbsp; ATTENDANTYes sir ? &nbsp; EDDIEI think I got a little breach in this lining here . &nbsp; ATTENDANTOh yeah .

He downs his bourbon , weaves a bit , bends over the table , and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick , missing an easy shot . Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play .

Fade out Fade in : Section Details 6 Interior : Ames Pool Hall , Morning Henry , the elderly Negro janitor , draws up the venetian blinds to let the early morning light flood into Ames Pool Hall . Henry is the janitor of Ames , the sexton of this immense , shabby cathedral of pool , in which the pews are pool tables covered with oilcloth slipcovers and the great vault of a room is lit by brass-and-globe chandeliers .

Church of the Good Hustler . &nbsp; CHARLIELooks more like a morgue to me . Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on . &nbsp; EDDIEI 'll be alive when I get out , Charlie .

His clothes reflect his high station at Ames : a gray felt bowler hat , and an expensive , tailored overcoat , with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket . He moves like a sultan through the room , past Big John , who nods significantly , and over to the coat rack , where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat . The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie 's table . Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case , then casually strolls toward Eddie 's table , standing apart and quietly observing the sharp , precise movements of his prospective opponent . Even though Ames is filled with players , there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls . &nbsp; FATSYou shoot a good stick ! &nbsp; EDDIEThank you . Gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; FATSNow and then . You know how it is . &nbsp; EDDIE ( grinning ) . You 're Minnesota Fats , are n't you ?

At his command , Ames comes to life . Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table . The uniformed maids withdrawn the cover off the green felt top , and Sausage , the racker , begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle . Everyone is ready except Fats . He is in the washroom , scrubbing his hands and nails . After drying them , he carefully extends his palms  --  11  --  so that Henry may sprinkle on some talcum powder . Eddie stands and screws together his inlaid , ivory-pointed cue , unable to take his eyes off the cool and suave figure of Minnesota Fats . &nbsp; CHARLIEHow do you feel ? &nbsp; EDDIEFast and loose , man . &nbsp; CHARLIEIn the gut , I mean . &nbsp; EDDIEI feel tight . . . but good .

Willie takes the money . Two balls are rolled to the end of the table , and Fats and Eddie , like two duelers , prepare to shoot for the break . In the silence of the room , they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots . The balls roll down the table , bank off the far shoulder , and slowly return toward the two players . Fats ' ball lies closest to the shoulder . &nbsp; FATSYou break . The balls are racked and Eddie makes his break shot , a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table .
