the look in his eyes , Rita was content and forgot completelythe strange mood of his that had just passed . " I 'll be all right . It 's sleep I need more than anything else . I 'll go home and take a sedative and get a good night 's sleep . In the morning I 'll be a new person . " " Do n't do that , " he said softly . " Do n't be a new person . " " There 's no danger ; sometimes I wish I could be , though . " " Why do n't you wait a little ? " he said . " Maybe this rainwill kind of let up after awhile . I hate to think of you drivinghome in a storm like this . " " You do n't need to worry , " she said . " I 'm the world 's best driver . It 's the only thing in the world that I can do really well .

" He started to say something , and then he changed his mind . He almost got his timing off that time , he thought . With a woman like this you had to take it slow and easy . " No , thanks , " he said . " Hell , the night is just beginning . What do I want to go home now for ? I tell you what , we might ride around or something for awhile though , and then you could go over and pick up Joe when he gets out of work over to the shop . She shook her head . " Goodness , no . Joe would be astonished if I ever went after him at the shop . Besides , he would n't be ready to come home for hours after he gets out of work . He always has all kinds of things to do after he gets out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for awhile , anyway . " " No , I do n't think I 'd better . Not tonight , Kenny .

You 're liable to see me around most any time . " " I do n't mean that . When are you going to meet me again ? " " Well , I do n't know . Perhaps I 'll come up here some night next week , and if you should happen ... " " No , I 've got to see you again before that . I ca n't wait till next week to see you again . I could n't stand it that long . " " Kenny , you have to stop talking to me like this . You have no right to say such things . " " Why not ? " he said coolly .

" " No , " she said . " You would n't do that . " " You know I would and you know if I come down there you would n't slam the door in my face neither . " Because she could not be sure that she would , she weakened . " Well , I ca n't come up here tomorrow night , " she said . " How about the night after ? " " All right , " she agreed weakly . Rita , she kept telling herself , you are a fool , you 've gone stark raving mad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with fire with this man . But underneath that she was pleased and excited , because Kenny Veech , who was a very attractive man and one who had his choice of many women , was in love with her and desired her passionately . She had to have more of his passion and desire for her , she thought ; it was the only tonic that would ever help her.  | " Okay , that 's settled , " he said . " Day after tomorrow night , same time , same place . " She nodded . The eager , frightened young look on her face elated him . He decided to be daring , and went on to the next move with consummate artistry . He took her hand again and spoke softly and tenderly to her . " Do n't fight against things so hard , darling . You only hurt yourself , fightin ' so hard against things that you ca n't stop , anyway . " She looked at him oddly , her face flushing a little and got up from the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny unlocked her car for her . Neither one of them had spoken a word . She slid in under the wheel , and looked at him standing by the open car door . " Ca n't I drop you off some place ? " He lifted his head and apparently took bearings . " Uh uh , thanks just the same . " " Where are you going ? " she said before she thought . " Oh , I 'll just make the rounds and see what all the boys are doing for awhile , " he answered . She slid her hands back and forth on the steering wheel . " I hate to just drive off and leave you standing in the rain . " " Do you ? " he asked , smiling suddenly . " Well , I tell you what , if you want me to , I 'll walk off and leave you . How 's that ? " She laughed . " Okay , " he said . " I 'll be seeing you . Do n't forget . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heel and walked off down the street without looking back once . I le walked easily with a sort of free pleasing rhythm through his big wide body . He held his head up to the soft rain , and once a streak of light from a neon sign caught his wet blond hair and made it sparkle . Rita Sibley sat at the wheel of her automobile and watched him go until he was swallowed up in the darkness and mist . Then she slammed the door shut and shot her car away fromp103the curb . She drove furiously , but with a reckless precision , the city speed regulations entirely disregarded . The task of getting out of the city traffic at that speed left her no time for thinking . Once she was out on the empty wet and narrow strip of pavement that led back to the village , she shoved the accelerator down until the speedometer wavered above sixtyfive , and held it there . The car leaped and skidded under her . She drove in the middle of the pavement , straining her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her headlights . Where the road went between two marshes , a thick fog drifted like a blanket across the road and shut off her vision for a foot ahead of her . She only slackened speed a little , and blindly drove the skidding , careening car from memory of the road . And when she came to the sharp , unbanked curve just north of the village , she lost control of her car momentarily , and slid around the curve sideways . She righted the heavy automobile just before the wheels struck the muddy shoulder on the wrong side of the road . She twisted the steering wheel , her face set and her lips still , while the tires shrieked on the wet asphalt . She tore down the middle of the pavement again into town . The speedometer still ticked at sixty-five , and her foot was numb from holding down the accelerator.  | SHE next day old Jud disappeared . He was already gone when the family gathered for breakfast in the morning . He did not appear at dinner time . By late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supper , worrying audibly about where in the world Mr. Higgins could be . Kenny was impatient to be off to a baseball game , so at last Molly abandoned her supper preparations temporarily and gave him a lunch of sandwiches and cookies , promising to have supper later after the game was over . She followed him out onto the porch and called after him up the street . " Kenny , you come right straight home now when that game 's over , ' cause I 'll have supper all on the table waiting . If you want to hang around uptown , you come home and eat your supper first . And Kenny , you ask the boys if anybody 's seen Mr. Higgins today . You be sure and ask , wo n't you ? " When Kenny was out of earshot , she turned to Sam in the porch swing . " Move over , " she said , and sat down heavily beside him . The sun was falling out of sight rapidly in the sky to the west , casting strange splotches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top step with the old cat on her lap . The cat sprawled across her thin knees on his back , relaxed and unafraid , with his legs sticking out stiffly . Dorothy was preoccupied with exploring his bony ribs and his hip joints with her spidery , sharp little fingers . The air was close and steamy as if there was more rain to come.  | " Dor'thy , I would n't handle that cat all the time if I was you , " Molly said absently over the placid creaking of the swing . " This hot weather makes him kind of sick and he do n't like to be handled ; besides he 's just covered with fleas . Lord , I wonder where Mr. Higgins has gone to . " " I would n't worry about Jud , " Sam said , looking up from the folded paper that he was straining his eyes to read in the dim light . " Would n't be surprised if he got up early this morning and beat it over to Centerville to see that old man that lives over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that old man  --  what 's his name ' now ? Jud used to go over to see him real often a couple years ago ; he 's the one that used to ... " " You mean that old Moses Hathaway ? Lord , he 's been dead and buried three years . Do n't you remember Ernie took Mr. Higgins over to his funeral ? It must have been three years ago . " Well , I would n't worry about Jud , anyway , " Sam said . " He 's just gone off somewheres . He 'll be back when he 's ready to . " " That 's all right , " Molly flamed . " You do n't have to worry about him none if you do n't want to , but I ca n't help worrying . Mr. Higgins is getting along in years and I ca n't help but worry , his bumming off somewhere all by himself . Suppose he had a bad spell walking along some place , and just toppled over in the weeds and is laying there right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of calling nobody or getting to no help ? " Sam was silent . Dorothy listened to them attentively , while she tried to pry the old cat 's mouth open in order to count his teeth . " Like enough Jud hiked out to some farm around here , " Sam said at last , " to see if he could n't get a job in the haying . Jud always gets restless to be doing something in the summer . " Molly was angry now , and anger loosened her tongue . " Samp106Meech , you know just as well as I do where Mr. Higgins has went to . He 's gone off on another of them drinking spells of his , that 's where he 's gone , and you know it . And he 's getting too old to go out and drink like that . Two or three days at a stretch . He ca n't stand it no more . It makes me so mad , that cussed drinking ... " They were both silent then . At last Sam said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting supper on and ask around and see if anybody seen him , or if anybody up there sold him any liquor today . " " Well . . . " Molly said doubtfully . " All right , but you get right back here . I ai n't gon na have you hanging around up to that poolroom with that good-for-nothing Mary Roberts half the night when Mr. Higgins is gone like this and I 'm all upset . " " Supper 's ready ! " Molly called up the stairs . " You kids come on down here right away before everything gets cold . " Carl opened the door and went down the stairs in three great bounds , stumbling against Josette at the foot . " You big lummox , " she said . " Why do n't you look where you 're going ? " " Yaa , yaa , yaa , " he answered cheerily , with singular inappropriateness . " Why do n't you ? " he rumpled her hair airily , as he had seen Kenny do . " For heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . Sam and Kenny were already seated at the table in the kitchen . They had just returned from town together . Jen took up round , hard , fried patties of hamburger from a sizzling hot frying pan , and Molly sat down last of all with the coffee pot . The light poured down on the family around the stained oil-cloth table top , and outside , beyond the open kitchen door , the lightning flickered in the darkness uneasily . " Lord , if it 's going to rain , I wish it would go ahead and get it over with , " Molly said , wiping at her fat perspiring face.  | " I hate this thundering and lightning . Did you hear it thunder right then , kind of rumbling , far off ? I always been afraid of lightning . " Dorothy laughed loudly and uncontrollably , and Molly stared at . her . " Being scared like that ai n't nothing to laugh about , " she said reprovingly . " It 's a terrible thing , I tell you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sam said soothingly . " I 'm always so ' fraid of windstorms this time of the year too , " Molly said . That time Kenny laughed , between great healthy bites of food . " Poor old Mom ! Looks like you 're just in for a good scare no matter what happens . " " It seems so funny , eating without Mr. Higgins here , " Molly said . " I ca n't bear to think of it raining tonight and him laying out somewhere , for all we know . " " Rain ought a sober him up , and then the old boy would come home a-running , " Kenny said . " Well , its like I told you , " Sam said to her . " Nobody uptown has seen him around today . I asked all around up there . " " I seen Jud today , " Dorothy said suddenly , mashing the warmed-over potatoes on her plate with her fork , and looking up to see the effect of her words on the family . All eyes were turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Why in the world ai n't you said nothing about it when you heard us all talking about him and wondering where he went to ? When did you see him ? Where was he at ? What did he say when you saw him ? " " Well ... " Dorothy closed her eyes and tipped her head to one side , apparently attempting to remember the details connected with her having seen Jud . Her audience waited for her impatiently . " You think hard now , and tell Grandma all about it . " " Well . . Dorothy said finally , " I was playing down by  |p108the  lake , I guess it was before dinner , and I see Jud coming and he was acting kind of funny , and kind of talking to himselfkind of . . . " " You little liar ! " Jen said cheerfully . " You never played down by the lake in your life . You know you 'd get skinned if we ever caught you running off down there . " " I was too down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there lots . You do n't know where I play . An '  --  I see Jud coming and he was looking awful funny-like , and I got scared somethingawful , and I hid in the bushes , and Jud went right by , walking right along close to the water , and he had a whole lot of bottles , about a dozen of them . He was carrying them . They was full of something , I guess it was whiskey bottles , " she finished brightly . The family stared at her in consternation . " You 're a little liar , " Jen said . Molly for once was at a loss . " You suppose she really seen him ? " she asked . " Naw ! " Kenny said . " I seen Jud down by the lake , " Dorothy 's eyes were closed , and she talked , her voice singsong in a kind of ecstasy . " And he had a lot of whiskey bottles , and he was drinking out of one of them , right while he was walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to once he fell right over , right in the water , and he just laid there , right in the water . " " For Lord 's sakes , " Molly said solemnly . " What did you do when Jud fell in the water ? " Kenny said casually , still busily eating . " Why , nothing , " she said . " He just laid in the water all still , and I was scared and I run away , and I looked back and he was awful sick , like to die , and he was hollering something awful , but nobody could hear him and he was drinking whiskey right out of a bottle . " " He was , huh ? " Kenny said . " Drinking whiskey right out  |p109of  a bottle . Did you get a real good look at the bottle he was drinking out of , the whiskey bottle ? " " Why , sure , " Dorothy opened her eyes in surprise . " I see him drinking whiskey out of a bottle , just as plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you did . Did you see what color whiskey it was he was drinking out of the bottle ? " " Sure , I did , " she said promptly . " It was blue , bright blue . Some of the bottles he had was red and green and yellow , but the one he was drinking outa was blue , I seen it real plain . " " There you are , " Kenny said . " Looks like Jud 's took to drinking soda pop in his old age . " " You think she was just making it all up ? " Molly said , round-eyed . " Hell , yes . " " That does n't prove a thing , " Josette said earnestly . " She might have seen him just the way that she said she did , but you would n't expect her to remember the color of the bottles . And when you asked her about the colors , any child her age would make up all the colors she knew when she could n't remember . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to tell Grandma the truth now . You been lying or did you really see Mr. Higgins down there by the lake like you been telling about ? " " I seen him right down by the lake drinking whiskey , and he fell right over in the water and it splashed up something awful , an ' a great big fish flew right up outa the water ... " " You 're the worst little liar I ever heard , " Jen said . " You ought a be spanked for telling stuff like that , till you could n't set down for a week . " The first big drops of rain rattled on the roof and on the porch steps . Molly pushed her plate aside disconsolately , and drank coffee instead . " Well , sir , you boys 'll just have to swallow your  |p110su|p|per  and go down there by the lake and look . I could n't sleep a wink tonight unless you did . " " Oh , for God 's sakes ! " Kenny said , holding out his cup for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew her close to him . He whispered in her ear , running his fingers along her sensitive bony little back , as he talked . She listened to him attentively , and then she nodded and both of them laughed loudly . " There now , " Kenny said winningly . " Now you tell your grandmother about how you was just playing a joke when you said you seen Jud down by the lake drinking whiskey . You was just having fun and teasing everybody , was n't you , Dorothy ? " " Sure , " she said , readily , nestling against Kenny 's arm . " Sure , I was just fooling everybody . " She laughed immoderatelyuntil tears shone in her large blue eyes . " Lookit here , young lady , " Molly said . " You tell the truth now . Did you see Mr. Higgins the way you claimed you did , or did n't you ? You tell the truth . " Out of the protecting circle of Kenny 's arm , Dorothy spoke , clutching his shirt tight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I never seen Jud at all . I just made it up . I never seen Jud . I was n't even playing down to the lake . " " Oh , you make me sick , " Josette said to Kenny . " You know very well that that child will say anything you tell her to . She 's crazy about you and anything that you want her to do she always does . Ma , do n't you pay any attention to what she just said . Kenny just put her up to saying that to get out of going out in the rain to look for Jud . " Molly dealt with the situation decisively . " Well , I do n't know . You boys better go on down there and take a look around anyway . It wo n't do no hurt , and I ai n't gon na sleep tonight unless you do . Dor'thy , you listen to me . I catch you lying any more , and I 'm going to tell your mother on youp111proper , and she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it . " The rain was blowing hard against the window , and it came in through the screen door and made a puddle on the warped boards of the kitchen floor . Carl watched the rain blow in apprehensively . " I ai n't going out in no storm like this chasing after old Jud . If he do n't know enough to come in out of the rain , he can stay out in it , for all I care . I ai n't got no raincoat nor nothing , and I wo n't go out and get soaked looking for him . " " You 'll do as I tell you , " Molly said . " You ought a be Ashamed to talk like that about Mr. Higgins , him just like a grandfather to all of you kids . He was the best man alive , except when he was on one of his drinking spells , up to a few years ago when he started getting kind of funny as he got older . Lord , many 's the night he used to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you was just a little tiny baby and had the three-months ' colic . You got a raincoat , ai n't you , Kenny ? " she queried . " I guess there 's an old umbrella around here , somewheres , you can take , Carl . " " I do n't want no umbrella , " he said sourly . " Getting wet ca n't no more'n kill me . I 'll go on out and get soaked . I do n't care . " Why ca n't Kenny go ? He 's got a raincoat . " Jen said . Molly evaded the question neatly . " You boys hurry up and go on down there by the lake and look around before it rains any more . Lord , if that old man 's laying out in all this rain , it 's enough to give him pneumonia , sure . " Carl got up immediately with a scowl creasing his forehead . He went over to the clothes hooks hanging in the corner by the stove and selected an old dark gray suit coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him in the shoulders , but he buttoned it up and turned the collar up high around his neck . " Come on , " he said to Kenny , " we might just as well get it over with . "  | " You wo n't just go downtown and fool around and then come back , will you ? " asked Molly earnestly . " Ah , take it easy , Mom . We 'll go down to the lake and look , do n't you worry no more about it , " Kenny said . Both of them steeled themselves for the plunge out into the rain . Molly stood in the doorway and watched them go down the street together until they were out of sight . They walked close together , with their heads down . " Jesus , what a night , " Kenny said . The water ran over the sidewalk in a thin stream , wetting their feet before they had taken a dozen steps . The water ran out of Carl 's dark hair , and plastered it down over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of pleasure , walking beside his brother , intimate with him , while the cold rain soaked through his clothes to his skin . He breathed deeply and found an exultation in it . He felt excited and alive to be walking with Kenny in the rain , and sharing a mission of importance with him . When they reached the corner under the lights of the downtown area , Kenny said , " Hell , let 's stop in to the beer garden for a minute . Ai n't no sense us trying to keep moving out in a rain like this . We can have a beer , and maybe it 'll let up and then we can take a look around for Jud . Ma gets all excited something like this . I knew damn well the kid was just lying when she claimed she seen Jud down there by the lake . " " Okay , " Carl said casually . He felt excited and good . Kenny had never offered to take him with him to drink a beer before . But now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both grown up , the men of the family . Kenny dodged in the door of the beer garden , with Carl behind him . They stopped inside the door and wiped the water from their faces . The room was warm and brightly lighted , and smelled pleasantly of beer and tobacco smoke andp113perspiration . The tables were about half filled , and the room was full of the sound of voices and the music from the record machine standing in the corner , the front of it shining with bright green light . Once he had the raindrops brushed out of his eyes , Kenny gave a wild yell , because there just inside the door stood Ernie . The brothers swooped down on him on a run , and Kenny threw his arms about him . " Ernie , old kid , old scout , old brother , how 's the boy ? Jesus , are we glad to see you . How 's everything in heaven , old angel , old kid , old Ernie ? " " Hey , leggo , you 're choking me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his face remained impassive . " Ernie , you 're just the guy we wanta see . " " Hey , Joe , gim me two packages of Camels , will you ? Whose bail you trying to raise now ? " he said to Kenny . " Ernie , how 'd you like to take us for a nice little ride , huh ? " " Maybe . Where you wanta go , Ashbury ? " " Well , we was figuring on Detroit . " " Sure , anywhere you say . " The brothers went out together and dodged across the sidewalk to Ernie 's car . Carl crawled into the back seat , and sat hunched forward , his elbows on the back of the seat between Ernie and Kenny . " What 's up ? " Ernie asked Kenny . " You seen old Jud today ? " " Hell , no . What 's the matter ? He gone off on another drinking spree ? " " Yeah , he sneaked off sometime last night , and we ai n't seen nothing of him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing him laying around down by the lake , at the supper table . You know how Ma is . She 's worrying herself sick about him . She wanted us to go on down there and take a look around , just to make sure . " " Jesus , I could tell Ma where he is , " Ernie said . " Sure , I thought I could too . But Horning 's outa town.  |p114His  wife do n't allow no drunks hanging around down there when she 's running the place . " " Yeah . God , I do n't know where else he 'd be , unless he just figured on laying outdoors some place . He sure picked nice weather for it . " " Yeah , " Kenny said . " And you know Jud when he 's been drinking whiskey . He would n't even know it was raining even . " Well , we better go down and take a look around the lake . " Ernie started the motor and turned the car in the direction of the lake . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street became narrower and more winding . The brothers were silent , straining their eyes ahead through the rain . Ernie drove slowly , and the heavy car slid a little in the soft mud of the road . They came to the end of the road abruptly , and Ernie stopped the car . The powerful headlights shone out along the overgrown lake front , and onto the dark , weed-infested lake itself , where the rain hung over it like some malignant vapor . " I do n't know how you 'd find him if he was down here , " Ernie said . " I 'll get out and take a look around , " Kenny said . Kenny opened the door and put his foot out on the running board . " You ca n't see nothing , this rain . " Ernie said . " Wait a minute . I got a flashlight around here some place . " He hunted in the glove compartment and on the floor between the seats . Carl searched the back seat thoroughly . " You never can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumbled . " Never mind . I can see all right . I got eyes like a cat 's . I can see in the dark . " Kenny jumped down and slammed the car door . He went toward the lake , running easily , his hands in his pockets , leaping and zigzagging through the puddles of water and the underbrush . The rain seemed to fold in around him . He stopped right at the water 's edge and looked bothp115directions up the lake shore . The trench coat made him a vague , light-colored figure silhouetted against the water . Carl felt chilled ; something about the lake and the deserted uneven shore line in the darkness and rain impressed him as being peculiarly evil and sinister . He could not bear to think of his brother alone there , separated from the world of warm human beings by an air full of water and darkness . He jumped out on the running board and called to Kenny . " Hey , wait a minute ! I 'm coming with you . " Kenny whirled around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to them , weakened and distorted by the rain . " Go on get back in the car , you crazy little fool . Wo n't take me but a minute . " Carl stood uncertain , and Ernie hauled him back into the car by his coat tail . Kenny looked up the lake shore as if he was smelling the very air for directions . Suddenly he turned off short to the right , trotting along at the very edge of the water , in the sand , beyond the low underbrush , leaving great black water-filled tracks behind him . He passed beyond the range of the auto lights and was instantly swallowed up in the darkness under the great willow trees that leaned over until their trailing fronds lay along the water . Ernie talked musingly , while both of them strained their eyes into the darkness at the point where Kenny had disappearedfrom view . " He sure was a funny little kid that way . Never scared of nothing . Used to drive Ma crazy running off alone around the lake at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more'n eight or nine years old , the damndest thing . They still had prohibition them days , you know . Some big bootlegger from Detroit used to run liquor in here by truck . Had a cache where he used to hide it down here by the lake some place . Then he used to put it on motor boats and take it across the lake and through the channel into Big Goose Lake , and God only knows where from there . Most likely he got it right over the state line by boat before he ever had to load itp116onto trucks again . Anyway , Kenny was just a little kid then , but he was the only one in this whole town that knew where the cache was , or ever saw the guys that was handling that liquor . He used to be friends with all that crowd , called ' em all by their first names and everything . They used to give him money and candy and stuff . It used to about drive Ma wild . Funny thing though how close-mouthed he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the cache or where the liquor went from here , nor nothing . Kenny even claimed he knew the big boss himself from Detroit . Ma could n't keep him in the house at night . It was the damndest thing I ever heard of . " Ernie was silent again , and the two windshield wipers cut double swaths through the water . The story he had just told stirred Carl 's imagination . The atmosphere here became charged with sinister potentialities and dangers for him . He felt gooseflesh all over his body . He worked his hands together nervously and strained his eyes for some sight of Kenny . They waited together , while the rain drummed down on the car roof and beat against the windows . Ernie lit a cigarette , and Carl thought that his hands moved nervously too , as if Ernie also felt this curious tension . " God , I do n't know what he wants to chase around the whole damn lake for , " Ernie said at last . They both kept their eyes on the darkness under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again , he came up out of the underbrush from behind the car . He opened the car door before either one of them saw him , and when the door opened they both jumped . Kenny was laughing and out of breath . He peeled off the dripping raincoat and wadded it up under his feet . His face was shining with moisture and his wet hair was curled into tight dark ringlets . " God , " he said , " I like to drowned . Somebody gim me a cigarette . "  |p117Ernie  handed him a fresh package . " What was you doing ? Walking clear around the lake ? " " Well , old Jud ai n't nowhere around this side of the lake , and I do n't figure he 'd be apt to be over on the other side . " Ernie turned the car around , the motor roaring , and the mud and water flying up from under the wheels . " This place is enough to give you the creeps on a rainy night , " Ernie said , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't suppose you saw nothing of your old pals from Detroit that used to handle liquor outa here , tonight . " " Jesus , I had n't thought about them guys in a long time , " answered Kenny . " Remember , Ma and Pa used to live in that house up on the hill by the point , that burnt down , then . Them sure was the days , all right . " " All I got ta say is you sure used to pick yourself a nice bunch of little playfellows , " Ernie said . Kenny laughed softly . " Say , Ernie , did I ever tell you about the time that that Detroit mob had a gun fight with a bunch of hijackers right down here by this lake ? I was right there and seen it all . Two guys they killed right here by this lake on a rainy night , must have been fifteen , sixteen years ago . I seen the whole thing . And you know what they did ? They filled them bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took ' em out in a boat and dropped them right in the middle of the lake , in the deep part over the drop-off . " " The hell you say , " Ernie said derisively , but Carl 's chest became so tight that he could hardly breathe . " Okay , you think that 's nothing but bull . Well , anytime you want to do some big fishing , you just get some hooks and do some dragging around in the mud bottom the other side of the drop-off and see what you find . " Ernie was sobered into half-belief by the tone of his brother 's voice . " I do n't believe it . If you'da ever seen ' em do anything like that , they 'd a drilled you full of holes and sunkp118you right over there in the middle of the lake with them hijackers . " " Like hell they woulda , " Kenny said shortly . " Them guys was smart . I was a local kid . What you think they was gon na do ? Have the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipping the whole thing off ? " " Well , I do n't know nothing about it , and I do n't want to , " Ernie said . " Any more stories like that you got about your pals you can keep to yourself . You always thought you was pretty smart playing around with guys like that and always keeping in the clear . All I got ta say is , you ca n't do stuff like that forever and get away with it . Some day some of your pals are gon na get kind of nervous with their trigger fingers , and then I 'll be taking a little trip into Detroit where you 'll be laying all nice and quiet on a cold marble slab down to the morgue , shot so fulla holes you 'll look like a sieve . " Kenny laughed again and Carl was afraid . Kenny suddenly was no longer the simple , warm , light-hearted brother whom he thought he knew so well . He was shocked to realize how little he really knew about this brother of his with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remember . He was afraid . He wished that he had never heard them talking this way . He thought of the lake , and believed that he would never go near it again . He remembered how boys who were unwise enough to go swimming in its waters always broke out in a rash over their bodies , and fishermen said that the fish in this lake were poisoned and no good . He shuddered at his own thoughts . Ernie stopped the car in front of the house . " Rain do n't seem to be letting up none . We better run for it . Do n't forget your raincoat there on the floor . " They clattered up onto the porch together and Molly met them at the door . " Did n't you see him anywhere down around the lake ?  |p119Ernie  , you ai n't seen nothing of Mr. Higgins today , have you ? " Molly 's gloom spread a damper over all of them . Ernie stayed but a few minutes , and when he left she followed him out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street into the drizzle of rain as if she expected to see the bent figure of Jud Higgins coming along the sidewalk . When she came in , she said , " We better leave the front door unlocked in case Mr. Higgins comes home sometime before morning . " The family trooped upstairs to bed , and the last thing before she put out the lights and climbed the stairs Molly went out to the little bedroom off the kitchen and looked at Jud 's empty bed . Not quite empty , for tonight the old cat slept there undisturbed . She moved to put him out , and then she thought better of it . The skinny old cat , sleeping peacefully there with his mouth open , and his legs sprawled stiffly , seemed to her symbolic of old Jud himself . She decided to let him remain there , warm and comfortable against the storm , just as she was hoping that Jud himself had found a refuge this night against the weather . She sighed a little , switched off the kitchen light and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room at the end of the hall , Kenny sat on the edge of the bed and smoked a cigarette while Carl undressed silently . It was far too early in the night for the prospect of sleep to appear inviting to Kenny . He felt peculiarly alert and wakeful , but it was no concern over Jud Higgins that kept him so . Carl climbed into bed on the other side , and turned his back on his brother , pulling the covers up over him . Kenny sat still with his elbows on his knees and wriggled his toes in his socks , watching their busy agile movements appreciatively . Carl tossed the covers back suddenly and flopped over on his back in the bed , shielding his eyes against the light , in the crook of his elbow . " For God 's sakes , you coming to bed , or are you gon na set up there all night with that light on ? "  | " Well , I 'll tell you . I ai n't decided yet , see ? " At the coldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fit of nervous fear that he had experienced earlier in the evening . He repeated the words that Kenny had just spoken over and over in his mind , studying his brother 's strong back while he did so . After the fifth or sixth time that he recalled them , he found something hard and sinister in the words , something quite to be expected in the way of conversation from a man who consorted with murderers and mobsters . The sudden vivid thought image of the two limp bloody bodies slipping over the side of the boat and sinking silently to the bottom of the very lake that he had looked at every day of his life gave him a nasty start and turned his mouth dry . Kenny turned around to him suddenly . " What in hell 's the matter with you tonight , anyway ? Your eyes look like a scared cat 's . You look like you got the jitters right . " Carl stared back at Kenny fascinated . It seemed to him that Kenny 's half-dosed blue eyes had a power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all surprised at Kenny 's next words . " What 's the matter ? You ai n't still thinking about that stuff Ernie and me was talking about tonight , are you ? " Carl 's mouth sagged open foolishly , and he never took his eyes off his brother 's face . Kenny appeared slightly bewildered . " Look , " he said helplessly , " what you worrying about stuff like that for ? It ai n't nothing for you to worry about . It happened a long time ago when you was just a little kid . It 's all done with now . There ai n't been no mob around this town since repeal . " But the fear was still there before his eyes , plain on Carl 's face . " You ai n't worried about what I said about a couple of stiffs sunk over there in the middle of the lake , are you ? You been living here next to that lake ever since you been born and they ai n't never hurt you yet , have they ? "  |p121Carl  worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept staring at Kenny , fascinated and horror-stricken . Kenny was completely baffled by something soft and sensitivein his brother that was beyond his understanding . " You ai n't thinking about that stuff Ernie was feeding me , about me getting hurt some day and ending up in a morgue some place ? It 's a lot of baloney . Ernie just likes to hear himself talk . There ai n't nothing to it . I got lots of different kinds of friends . It never made no difference to me what a guy did so long as I liked him , but no guy is gon na shoot me full of holes or nothing else , so long as I do n't give him no cause to . " Carl licked at his lips and listened to his brother attentively , his eyes still bright and distended in his face . He was making a vast effort to comprehend the logic of Kenny 's words and drive this weak senseless fear out of himself . But time after time the image of those bodies sliding down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up into his mind , and each time it was as if it were a motion picture projected against the raw sensitive nerve tissue throughout his body . Kenny closed his fingers over Carl 's ankle in the bed . " What 's on your mind , kid ? Spill it , " he said kindly . Carl made another great effort to put into words this groundless fear that tortured him , and made him afraid to be in the room with his own brother . He spoke with his voice toneless , and the words disconnected , hanging in the air . " Them bodies  --  out there in the lake . . . " Kenny was silent , closing and unclosing his fingers around Carl 's ankle . " I do n't know what to say , kid . I ca n't seem to get the way you feel about it . I can get how it is to be afraid of some guy that 's crazy mad at you and out to get you , but stiffs is something altogether different . When a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or crazy and hurt people . But once a guy is dead , that 's all done with . A stiff  --  hell , I don'tp122know , and I been around plenty of ' em in my time  --  a stiff ai n't a person no more . It ai n't nothing . It ai n't a thing more'n a stone alongside of the road , or a heap of dirt , or a puddle of water . You see what I mean ? It ai n't nothing to be scared of . " Carl nodded his head a little and licked his lips again . Kenny was aware that there was much more to this feeling of Carl 's than he had touched upon . But he could not understand . He closed his fingers tight around the boy 's ankle under the bedclothes and groped for understanding and for the right words to say to him . There was actually only one thing outside of death  --  which he rarely thought of in terms of himself  --  that Kenny was afraid of , and that one thing was fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . Kenny was abnormally sensitive to fear around him , and it always frightened him . To be aware of it in anyone knotted and chilled the muscles in his abdomen and made him feel sick . He was afraid of fear . It seemed unclean to him , contaminating and disgusting . He wanted to say something to Carl to make him feel better , but the words would not come right for him . " The trouble is , kid , you take things too hard . You let everything get you . Of course you 're young , but you 're getting older and you got ta get hold of yourself . It 's something nobody can do for you , or tell you about . You got ta quit letting every little thing get clear through to you . You see what I mean ? " Kenny was floundering down hopelessly in his own words , but he went on again . " The only way to keep living is to be hard and at the same time to take things easy . You see what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you run up against living along from day to day that ai n't pretty and pleasant , but you ca n't let ' em get you down , nor you ca n't let ' em scare you ; you ca n't even feel sorry about ' em . You just got ta take ' em easy , and not let ' em get through to you . You ca n't even think about ' em , or try to understand about ' em . You just got ta forget ' em and keep moving . You see what I mean ? " ip123The words he spoke were only so many inexplicable words to Carl and Kenny realized it . He got up from the bed abruptly . " Oh , hell , " he said . " Forget it . You go on and get some sleep . I do n't feel like sleeping . I guess I 'll go downstairs and see if I can scare up something to eat , or something . " He went out of the room into the dark hallway , and closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned on the light on the sitting-room table . He was not hungry , but he felt a restlessness . He rummaged through the books and papers on the table , but found nothing among them that caught his interest . The big old-fashioned radio set was dark and silent on a stand beside the wall . He idly turned the dials and snapped the buttons . It had been broken for almost a year . Ma liked a radio , he thought . Maybe Ernie would buy the folks a new radio for Christmas . He made a mental note to speak to Ernie about it . He walked through to the kitchen and snapped on the light . The room was empty and forbidding . Just as he reached to turn the light off again he saw his shoes resting on the oven door of the stove where he had put them to dry when he came home . He picked them up and turned the light off and went back into the sitting room . He sat down in a chair and put his shoes on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bumpy from the soaking . He felt better now and stretched his legs , sitting slumped in the chair , listening to the rain . He realized suddenly that he was lonesome for Mary , that he could not sleep without seeing her . He relaxed in his chair and listened to the drowsy sound of the rain , with the thought of Mary warming and soothing him . He heard the car stop out in front and he thought that it was Jen coming home . But when he heard the soft light steps on the front porch he knew better . He got out of his chair and to the door just as it opened . Mary smiled at him as she closed the door quietly behind her . " You holding down the fort alone ? "  |p124He  nodded . " Yeah , everybody 's in bed but Jen , I guess . She 's still out , chasing around somewhere . God , ai n't this an awful night ? I was just setting here wishing I could see you . You 're home early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple days tonight , and I 'm going with him . I just come home to pack some things . " " I noticed the car was waiting for you . That Lew out there now ? " " No . One of the boys drove me home to pick up my things . " " Oh , hell , then you ai n't in too big a hurry . " Kenny relaxed visibly . " I got ta get right back , though . Lew 's just finishing up some business and then he 'll be ready to leave . " " You know Jud 's gone ? " " Yeah , so I heard . Look , " she said , " you come on upstairs with me while I pack , if you want to . " They went up the stairs quietly together and Kenny closed the door of Mary 's room behind them . She turned on the light , and Kenny sat down in her big chair in front of the window . She knelt down by the bed and drew out from under it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , " Kenny said . " Jud beat it outa here some time last night , and we ai n't seen nothing of him since . Tonight Ma got to feeling nervous , so the kid and me and Ernie took a look around , but Jesus , you do n't know where to look for him . " Mary put silken underwear and cosmetics in the bag swiftly . " He would n't be down to Horning 's this time , because Horningis n't home , " she said . " Yeah , I know it . There ai n't no place else he 'd be ; must be he just figured on laying out outdoors some place till he got sobered up . This rain is gon na raise hell with him , if he 's out in it . " Mary stood still reflectively with a delicate negligee drapedp125over her arm . " I do n't like the looks of it . If he is n't back here by morning , or nobody 's seen him , you better get moving . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent a moment while she went on with her packing . " State police ? " She nodded to him from the clothes-closet door . " By noon anyway , tomorrow . Ma wo n't want to , but you better . " Mary stripped the limp linen dress she was wearing over her head and hung it on a nail in the closet . She took a blue suit down from the wire hanger and threw it across the bed , and pulled a sheer white blouse down over her head . She fumbled with the buttons in the back and gave it up and put on the blue skirt . Kenny went over to her and she stood still with her arms at her sides while he buttoned the blouse . There were five tiny pearl buttons , but Kenny poked them through the little boles at last with his big brown fingers . When he was through he returned to the chair , and she put on the blue jacket and buttoned it up the front to her chin . " How 's everything ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar weary gesture of his hand . " I got a date with Rita Sibley tomorrow night . " She stood still with her hands at the last button at her throat . " Yeah ? " " Yeah . " Mary laughed then , as she had laughed once before when Kenny had spoken of Rita , a quick short mirthless laugh . " She may be an iceberg , " Kenny said , smiling , " but there 's a way to melt her down . " Mary went to the mirror and combed out her short silky hair , and set her hat at the right angle . She powdered her nose quickly and retouched her lips . She kicked off her shoes , inspected her hose seams and put on the pumps that matched the purse and gloves , laid out by the closed bag on the bed . Then she returned to the mirror once more , and turned to Kenny . " I guess I 'm ready . " " You look beautiful , " Kenny said . He cupped her face in  |p126his  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it along her dark , shining , winged eyebrows , wiping away the tiny flecks of powder . She smiled at him , her rare childish sweet smile . He picked up the suitcase from the bed and followed her down the stairs . At the door he gave her the suitcase , and she hesitated a moment with her hand on the doorknob . " Have a good time , kid , " he said . " Go buy a half a dozen new hats . They say it always makes a woman happy to buy hats . Go buy a dozen of ' em . " " I think I will , " she answered . " They 're showing fall hats in Detroit already . I think I 'll buy a lot of hats . How do you think I 'd look in a pill box with a snood ? " " I do n't know what in hell a pill box with a snood is , but go ahead and get one . You 'd look swell in it . " " I 'll be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days at the most . " " You better . " She opened the door a crack , and looked back to him once more . " You can sleep in my bed , " she said . Kenny grinned across his face . " Thanks . I was gon na , anyway . Well , up and at ' em , kid ! " He caricatured a boxer 's feint , with a slight motion of his body , and cocked his doubled fist at her chin . From outside the door , she ducked her head slightly and duplicated his gesture , but touching his chin briefly with her small doubled fist . She turned then and walked down the steps briskly , the suitcase in her hand , her back straight and her head up . The door of the long black car was open for her . Hands reached out and lifted the suitcase over into the back seat . As she got in , the car drove away into the mist of rain toward town . Kenny closed the door , switched out the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room behind him and turned the bed down . He undressed leisurely and then tidied her dresser back into its usual order , wiping off the dust ofp127powder along the edge . On the bed he found one of her filmy stockings . He crumpled it up in his hand , his face suddenly serious . He loosened his fingers carefully so that they might not snag the sheer chiffon and laid it gently down on the corner of the bureau . It did not look right to him there . He opened several drawers exploringly until he found one with a stack of silk hose piled neatly in a corner . He laid the lone chiffon stocking in on top of them and started to close the drawer . But still the stocking was out of place because there was only one of them . He searched the room for the mate to the lone stocking but he could find no trace of it . At last he gave it up . He took the stocking out of the drawer , closed it and stood helplessly with it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered under the bed , as if he was making a last effort to produce the mate to that baffling lone stocking of Mary 's . Then , as if disgusted at his own foolishness he suddenlycrammed the stocking under the pillow on the bed and turned off the light.  |p128THE  rain wore itself out in the night , and in the morning the sun shone clear and hot . The air was close and unbreathablewith the steam that rose from the wet ground . Dorothy sat on the top stair step hunched over with the little tin box in her hands , the tin box that had contained her savings and that she had kept hidden away among the box of toys at the head of the stairway . The box was empty . She had found it empty when she came this morning to put in a nickel that Ernie had given her the night before . She was angry in hot and cold flashes , and she was wise enough to know that she could not complain about her loss to anyone , without giving away the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel in the bottom of the tin box . She was so angry that she sat there for nearly an hour , holding her breath from time to time until her heart pounded and she felt faint and sick . She suspected each of the family in turn . Most of all she was angry because she could not know for sure which one of them had done it and because she could think of no adequate way of getting even with anybody that did not involve telling her grandmother of the loss . She got up finally and sneaked downstairs and out of the door , the little tin box hidden in her hands . She went down among the weeds in the back of the garden where she would be all to herself , and sat down . She wanted to writhe on the ground and scream with hatred . She wanted to hurt people ,  |p129break  things to pieces and set things on fire . She sat swaying back and forth with her eyes closed , her mouth wide open shivering all over . She gripped the tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bony old cat came ambling up out of the cool weeds headed in the general direction of the kitchen door . He stared at her out of his oblique , wise , old eyes , then went up to her and rubbed against her bare arm . The touch of his mangy fur startled the little girl and she opened her eyes . A perfect scream of fury came up in her throat , but she did not make a sound . She dropped the tin box on the ground , grabbed the old cat by the neck with both hands and squeezed with all the strength that she had . The cat struggled for his life , twisting and clawing with his feeble strength . She threw her thin body on top of him , careless of the scratching claws that drew blood along her arms and hands , never releasing her fingers from around his neck . The motion went out of the cat 's body finally , leaving it still and limp , but for a long time the child did not release her fingers from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not look at the cat . She stared at her tiny , numbed fingers curiously and at the blood running down her arms and hands . She was tired and worn out . The heat seemed oppressive to her . She hid her face on top of her knees awhile , conscious of the stinging pain in her arms and of the ache in her head . She sat up at last , and this time she stared at the twisted limp body of the cat beside her on the grass . She took hold of one of his feet experimentally , and then she put her hand along the prominent rib bones where so many times she had felt his feeble old heart pounding . She stared at the body of the cat for a long time , her face impassive . Some of the blood from her scratches had dried on her arms and hands . A long smear of it along the side of her face and up into her pale hair had dried also . She got up on her knees and peered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , still kneeling , she dug a little shallow pit in thep130ground with her hand , put the tin box in it and covered it over again . She picked the tender green tops from a couple of weeds above her , and laid them over the spot where she had hidden the box , crossing them carefully to make an X. Then , looking toward the house again , she furtively crawled through the weeds , dragging the cat 's body behind her by his hind legs . By keeping to the weeds of the vacant lot she came out on the sidewalk about a block from the house . She picked up the cat then , carrying the body carelessly over her arm , as she had carried him many times before . The street was desertedin the heat . There were no cars along the pavement . She crossed the pavement and crawled under the fence to the railroad track . She walked up the track , in the deep grass besideit , until she was directly behind a large billboard that faced the pavement . Securely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad track . She looked cautiouslyin all directions to see that there was no train coming , or anybody watching her . There were three or four tracks togetherhere . She studied them carefully and finally decided on one of the middle ones . She looked again in all directions , and then she squatted down and draped the limp body of the cat directly over the hot shining steel rail . She arranged the body carefully , the head hanging down inside the rail against the tie . She stood up breathing a deep sigh of relief . The creosote on the ties had melted in the sun , and stuck to her shoes , a black sticky substance . She wiped her shoes carefully in the thick grass and darted back across the pavement onto the sidewalk and ran toward home . As soon as she came in sight of the house she began to cry . The tears ran out of her eyes and streaked down her dirty face . The crying and the tears were genuine enough . She wept at the top of her voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , past her startled grandfather into the house , and straight to Molly in the kitchen . Molly caught the weeping child in her arms . " For Lord'sp131sakes , what in the world you been doing ? Why , child , you 're all covered with blood . Did you fall down ? Tell Grandma how you got hurt . Here , let me see . Why , something just like to scratched you nearly to pieces . Tell Grandma what happened to you , Dor'thy . " She went to the sink and wet a cloth with water and began to wipe the dirt and blood from the child 's face , hands and arms . Over her sobbing Dorothy talked incoherently . " The cat done it . The prettiest black and white cat , and it scratched me something awful . I just picked it up and wanted to pet it . I was n't going to hurt it , and it scratched me something awful ... " Molly got the turpentine bottle out of the cupboard . " This is gon na smart just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . There , hold still and let Grandma put it on your arms . " She applied the turpentine liberally , and Dorothy danced and shrieked with the smarting of , it , over the kitchen floor . She gathered the weeping child into her arms again , pressingher against her big soft bosom . " There , there , now . Do n't cry no more . You 'll feel all better in a minute . Next time you see a strange cat do n't you pick it up , ' cause some cats is ugly . You just do n't want to have nothing to do with ' em . There , do n't cry so . Why , I swear to Lord , she 's just shaking somethingawful . There , there , do n't cry so . Why , the poor little thing ! "  | THE State Police did not locate Jud Higgins after all , just as Kenny had suspected when he notified them . It was Mike Setlowe , or rather his dog , Pat , that found Jud lying under some bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night just after sunset . The old man was unconscious , and Mike picked him up and took him home . The family were gathered in the sitting room  --  Molly , Sam , Carl , Josette and Dorothy  --  when he arrived . Mike got out and Pat , the Irish setter , jumped out ahead of him , her beautiful tail pluming the air . Mike carried the shriveled body of Jud Higgins up the walk to the porch steps . They heard the sound of his feet on the steps , inside the house . All of them looked up nervously and stared , fascinated by what they saw . Pat came first to the screen , pressing her soft muzzle against it and behind her came the great towering figure of Mike Setlowe carrying old Jud in his arms . The old man 's head rolled limp against his chest . For a moment they were all perfectly still , staring in horror at the picture before their eyes . Setlowe broke the silence irritably . " Will somebody please open the door , or do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Carl moved first and opened the screen , his knees weak and shaking , staring furtively at old Jud 's face . " Oh , Lord , oh , Lord , " Molly said , utterly bewildered.  |p133Pat  bounced through the door ahead of her master and shuttledback and forth from one to another of them , sniffing inquiringly . Molly stumbled up out of her chair and stood helplessly by , her eyes on Jud 's shriveled pinched face with the mouth hangingopen , and the breath coming through it hoarsely . Mike Setlowe looked at her irritably . " I think we had better put him in bed , Mrs. Veech , if you 'll show me where to take him . " With the first shock over , strength and energy were coming back to Molly . " You can bring him right out here and put him in his own bed , " she said . She led the way and Mike Setlowe and Pat followed her to the little bedroom . Molly switched on the light and hesitated , undecided whether or not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , Mike laid the old man gently on the blanket spread over the top of the bed . Molly pulled the pillow from under the blanket and put it under his head . She could not take her eyes off Jud 's face . " For Lord 's sakes , what 's the matter with him ? " she said tremulously to the big man . " I think you had better call a doctor , Mrs. Veech . Do you have a telephone ? " Molly did not answer him . She picked up Jud 's limp hand between her own and was rubbing it briskly , anxiously watching his face . Mike Setlowe came out into the kitchen where the rest of the family stood aimlessly by , looking into the bedroom . He singled out Carl and walked over to him . " Do you have a telephone ? " he asked . " No , " Carl said awkwardly . " I was just saying to your mother that you ought to have a doctor right away . I think you better get one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Carl said . " You do n't have to . I 'll go over to Doctorp134Biessels ' . It 's only about a block , I can run and be there in just a minute . " " You better tell the doctor to come right away , the old man 's unconscious . Carl nodded , and bolted out of the front door into the twilight . He felt resentful toward Jud for all the trouble he was making and a little ashamed because he felt resentful . He wished fervently with the careless selfishness of the well and strong that if Jud was going to die he 'd hurry up and get it over with . This was the first time in his life that Carl had come in contact with illness , and he found it disgusting and upsetting . He foresaw that the whole house was to take on this new atmosphere . The pompous little doctor came and went , leaving his envelopesof pills and labeled bottles behind . There seemed to be a number of things wrong with Jud Higgins . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exposure , poisoning from insect bites , sunburn , possibly a sunstroke , and a high-blood-pressure condition . There was no cause for alarm however , he said . He predicted that Jud would be delirious for several days , and then might very possibly exhibit some kind of temporary mental derangement for a few weeks , before he made a complete recovery . In the days that followed , the entire household pivoted around Jud 's sick room , just as Carl had anticipated . Molly gave up all pretense of doing housework and remained in constantattendance upon him . The burden of the work therefore fell upon Jen , who complained about it bitterly . Meals becameeven more irregular than normally , and were generally scanty and ill-prepared . Jud remained unconscious for several days , and then one morning he woke up in a more normal state of physical health , cheerful enough , but also , as the doctor had predicted , in a state of mental derangement . The family had had nop135previous experience that could prepare them for this . The old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his bed . His constant rich and varying hallucinations crowded his bedroom continually with all manner of unexpectedobjects , people and animals . Molly accepted his condition more readily than did any of the rest of them . Neighbors and townspeople that she had known all her life came to call on her in a steady stream , offering sympathy unfailingly , assistance and bringing gifts of food . Molly came to enjoy it all . She talked with them for hours , basking in their interest and in the sense of her own affliction , entertaining them with long detailed accounts of Jud 's latest exploits and aberrations . Carl 's birthday was approaching , and he was secretly excitedabout it . He had retained a childish delight in the anticipation of a cake and gifts . Furthermore , it was to be his eighteenth birthday , and for some reason it seemed to him to be a momentous occasion . It did not seem possible to him that the family could overlook it , but as it drew nearer he began to have a suspicion that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them thought of it . The morning of his birthday confirmed his suspicions . There were no teasing references made to the date , no congratulationsoffered , and no veiled hints of secrets to come later . His feelings were deeply hurt . He was sure that they had only forgotten about it in the preoccupation over Jud , and that if they only knew that this was the day they would be only too anxious to celebrate it . But his pride however forbadehim to make any mention of the day to them . He was so morose that Mr. Sneider teased him unmercifully all day . He had an impulse to confide his troubles to Sneider , but pride again interfered . The butcher was a kindly man . He would have undoubtedly given Carl the afternoon off had he but known the occasion and possibly would have handed himp136a dollar out of the cash drawer as well . But Carl was determined to suffer this out alone . Kenny came home from Ashbury that morning and while his mother regaled him with a belated breakfast in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squashed four layer cake covered with smeared sticky white frosting , and a great bouquet of flowers . Aunt Maggie had been in attendance upon Molly when every single one of the Veech children was born . They were just like her own children to her she often proclaimed and they had accorded her since childhood the courtesy title of Aunt Maggie . Molly sank down into her chair in astonishment . " For Lord 's sakes , " she said . " Would you believe it , I clean forgot everything about today being that kid 's birthday . I just had so much on my mind here , I never give it a thought . Why , sure enough , today 's Carl 's birthday and he 's eighteen years old . Well , sir , none of us thought a thing about it . We ai n't baked him a cake or bought him a present nor one single thing . You know , he was acting kind of funny at the breakfast table this morning . He kept scowling , and you could n't get a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what was wrong with him . He could tell that we 'd all forgot about this being his birthday . " Aunt Maggie was delighted . " You know , that was just what I was afraid of . I got to thinking about it last night and I says to myself , now ten to one , Molly 's so busy with Jud sick and all , she ai n't never give it a thought . So I got up this morning and got a fire started in my cookstove and hustled around and made him a cake and picked him a big bouquet of flowers outa the garden and come on over here with ' em . " Kenny was inordinately concerned about it . " Jesus , Mom , we got ta have a party . We always have a big supper and stuff everybody 's birthday . The kid 's gon na take it something awful if we do n't kind of make a fuss over his birthday . " " I know he is , " Molly said . " But what we gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix no fancy supper nor nothing , andp137there ai n't a soul of us that 's bought him a present . You ca n't buy nothing here in town . I do n't know what in the world we can do but just explain it all to him and kind of postpone things for a day or two ! " " Oh , hell , Mom , you ca n't do that . It ai n't no fun having a birthday after it 's all over with . " " Now that 's just what I say , Kenny , " Aunt Maggie said . " You know how kind of sensitive Carl is about things . It 'll just bust him all up , telling him you forgot about today being his birthday . " " Well , I know it , " Molly said , unwilling that anyone else should show more concern over one of her own children than she did . " But I just do n't see what in the world we are gon na do about it . " " Mom , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You just leave it to me and Aunt Maggie and we 'll see to it that the kid has the best birthday today he ever had . How about it , Aunt Maggie ? " Aunt Maggie was only too glad to be taken into the Veech family affairs and Kenny was a particular favorite of hers . " Why , sure we will . You just say the word , Kenny , and anything I can do , you know I 'm only too glad to do it . " " Well , " he said , " suppose you get the dinner , huh ? I 'll get Jen home here to help you , and you do the cooking and fix up a fancy spread for tonight . I 'll go downtown right away and buy everything you want . Then I 'll kind of tip off everybodyto be home here for supper . Ernie 'll come all right , and Mary can get away if she knows about it . " " But what about the presents ? " Molly asked . " Oh , hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and tell me what you want to get and I 'll beat it up to Ashbury and buy everything all to once . Then I can get a ride home with Josie and Nina Warren at five o'clock . " His enthusiasm was contagious . Aunt Maggie started to roll up her sleeves . " Well , that 's just what we 'll do . I can cookp138up something nice for tonight easy , and we got the cake all baked . Why do n't you have chicken , Molly ? Chicken always cooks up nice and Carl likes it , and maybe we could have biscuitsand gravy . That 'd be something Jud could eat too . " " Atta girl ! " Kenny said approvingly , getting up from the table himself . The women planned the meal together , and Kenny went off downtown with a list of groceries to be bought . He talked to Ernie at the depot and collected money from him for an order of icecream from the drug store . He called Mary on the telephone from the beer garden , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an ample donation of money from her , sent over to him by a waiter from the hotel . He discussed the matter of presents with her over the telephone , and with his mother back at the house , and then he departed for Ashbury . When Carl came home from work that night he found a bustle of activity around the house , and tempting smells from the kitchen floated out to meet him on the front porch . Inside the door , Aunt Maggie met him , enfolding him in a great warm embrace . She kissed him heartily and called him her baby , to his great embarrassment , and wished him a happy birthday . After his first spontaneous pleasure and relief to find that the family had not forgotten his birthday , as he had thought , his embarrassment at being so unwontedly the center of all attention grew . He began to wish fervently that the family had seen fit to ignore the occasion . He was not used to so much attention . He did not know what to do with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table and , considering the occasion , Molly had insisted that her best white linen tablecloth be used on it . Aunt Maggie put her bouquet of flowers in the middle of the table triumphantly , and the birthday cake beside it . During the course of the afternoon eighteen pink candles had been added to the slightly lopsided top of the cake.  |p139Carl  knew that he was in for a general family celebration when he saw Mary arrive . He was thankful that she had the decency to omit the beaming and kissing and hugging . She went immediately to the kitchen , donned a big apron , and went to work . A few moments later he saw Kenny and Josette arrive , mysteriously carrying a load of parcels through the back door . By the time that Ernie arrived , he was as weak as a rag , and his dark eyes were distended in his pasty white face . He had reduced his conversation to the minimum , because he was afraid to trust his voice , which in times of embarrassment was apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off entirely . He wondered what would happen if he should faint right at the supper table . In the kitchen Kenny was treating Molly to surreptitious peeps into the various packages while going about the task of painstakingly labeling each one of them . " Carl from Mother , " " Carl from Father , " and so on through the family . He whisperedinto her ear the details concerning the delivery of the icecream , and he confided in her that they had better eat as soon as possible because he had to be back in Ashbury by seven-thirty at the very latest . When Ernie arrived Kenny went out immediately and lugged in the two sacks of beer bottles that Ernie had brought for the occasion . The men all drank beer while they waited for supper , Carl slopping his down the front of his shirt in his anxiety to drink carelessly out of the bottle the way the rest of them did . Then , of course , he had to go upstairs and put on a clean shirt before they could go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and deposited according to family tradition on Carl 's chair , at the place of honor , just behind the birthday cake . When they all trooped out to the table , Carl stood helplesslyby his chair , staggered at the array of parcels , while the family beamed on him . It was Mary who suggested that hep140stack them on the floor and wait to open them until they were clearing the dishes , before they ate the cake . Carl was only too glad to postpone it . Once they began to eat the attention veered away from him , to his great relief , but even so he had no appetite at all for the meal that Aunt Maggie had preparedso painstakingly . The bedroom door had been left wide open , and Jud , propped up on two pillows , so that he might look out on the festivities , took no notice of them whatsoever . He mumbled to himself occasionally and made strange motions with his gnarled old hands along the coverlet , completely occupied with the exigencies of this peculiarly engrossing mental life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappearance of the old cat vociferously . " It 's the funniest thing . I ai n't seen hide nor hair of that cat since Mr. Higgins has been sick . He was getting to be such an old cat , it was getting so I was kind of afraid . This hot weather had been awful hard on him too . Lord , he was n't nothing more'n skin and bones . I thought maybe he took sick and died out in the weeds somewheres , but Dor'thy 's been looking for him all over . Course , he mighta got run over . You think he mighta got hit by a train , Ernie ? " " Hell , cats and dogs getting hit out there on that track every day . " " You ai n't seen nothing of his body out there , have you ? " They roared all up and down the table at Molly 's innocence . " Jesus , Mom , " Ernie said seriously , " you ca n't tell one of them from another . If the train goes right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it left to tell what color it is hardly . " ' Well , do n't let 's talk about it , " Molly said . " Especially right at the table when we 're eating . " Over the babble of voices Kenny spoke to Mary , beside him , softly , " I guess our party 's going off all right , kid . " " Yeah , " she said . It was the first word she had spoken since they sat down to the table.  |p141Kee|ping  her voice down under the other voices around the table she asked , " You going back up to Ashbury tonight ? " He nodded , " Yeah , I got ta . I 'll have to be beating it outa here pretty soon , too . " " Dutch is going up from the hotel at a quarter of seven . Why do n't you get up there and ride in with him ? " " Thanks , " Kenny said . " I was just wondering where I was gon na hook me a ride . " He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this intimate moment with her end . " I have n't been home enough to see you hardly at all . How 's everything ? " " So-so , same old thing . " She turned her shadowed eyes on his face . " You staying up to Ashbury ? " " Yeah . " " Mechanic Street ? " " Uh huh . " She looked at the watch on her wrist . " You better not stay for cake , if you 're going up with Dutch . " " I 'll sneak out right now , nobody ai n't gon na miss me . " Molly and Aunt Maggie and Jen were already clearing away the plates and food , and there was a great deal of confusionas Carl lifted his packages up onto the table . Kenny lingered a moment by Mary 's chair . " Have fun , " she said , looking up at him . She made the familiar half motion of her body imitating the boxer 's feint , cocking her fist at his jaw . Kenny smiled with her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kitchen door . Carl unwrapped his packages with trembling awkward fingers , while the family looked on delightedly . Most of the gifts were the ever-practical ones of shirts , socks , handkerchiefsand neckties . Ernie 's gift , when opened , excited so much interest and comment that Ernie felt called upon to demonstrate its peculiar virtues on the spot . It was a mechanicalpencil complete with a new package of leads . It was madep142of glass , which revealed all of the inner workings of its mechanics plainly to the astonished eye . The most unusual feature about it , however , was that by the pressure of writing the amazing pencil shed a little pool of light around its point . It was a pencil , Ernie explained , to use for writing in the dark . Only Jen was unable to conceal her bewilderment . " What in God 's name would anybody ever want to write in the dark for , anyway ? " Ernie gave her a withering look , and let her question go unanswered as being too stupid even to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was bound to appear anticlimactic . Of the three packages yet unopened , two large ones and a small one , Carl opened next the largest one of all . It was marked with Dorothy 's name and it contained a carton of Mary 's own expensive and mild cigarettes . Mary 's own gift was contained in the small package . It was a fine leather wallet , and in the pocket for bills there was enclosed a fivedollarbill . The last package of all , marked with Kenny 's name , contained a cheap camera , a roll of film and an instruction book on the art of camera angle shots . After that , the candles on the cake were lighted , and Jen led them off in singing the traditional " Happy birthday to you . With the meal finally over , Molly divided the family and suggested that those who were to be excused from doing dishes should play cards . Ernie , Sam , Mary and Carl started a game of rummy around the center table in the sitting room.  | SEVERAL hours later Kenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street in Ashbury where he had kept a room for the last couple of weeks . He was at that momentsomewhat weary of Rita . They had ordered liquor several times in the course of the evening and he suspected that Rita had by far exceeded her capacity . Furthermore , one of her baffling , difficult moods had come over her . When she had proposed leaving he had been frankly thankful , looking forward to a good night 's sleep , with her out of the room and away from him . But she had insisted that he come out with her for a ride before she returned home . Rita , after the course of recent developments in their relationship , was becoming far too possessive to suit him . He was weary of her now . She no longer retained anything that could interest him . He wondered why it was that women never could see when something was played out and over with ; or was it that they never would admit it to themselves , even when they did see it ? Why should any woman ever want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were completely exhausted ? That problem was too much for him , and he abandoned it . His own mind , he admitted , was not quite as clear as it might be . He was not used to these expensive liquors that Rita ordered . Out on the street , Rita linked her arm through his , and walked with her body close up against him . " Oh , it 's such a beautiful night , " she said . She stopped still and raised her facep144up to the sky . " Just look , Kenny . Oh , it 's such a beautiful night ! " There was a dry hot wind that seemed to have blown bright more stars in the dark sky than he had ever seen before . But Kenny was preoccupied instead with finding her car and gettingRita into it . The ambling , incurious passers-by who frequentedthe sidewalks in this area of the city moved out around them , with no more than a glance at them . Rita was wearing a white silk suit , and the reflected electric light turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling contrast with her smooth dark skin . He closed his fingers on her arm and started her walking again . " Come on , there 's the car right over there . " " Kenny , " she said solemnly . " You have no soul at all in you , have you ? Do you know what the trouble with me is ? I 've got too much soul . All my life I 've had too much soul . " They came to the car then , and she stood and waited while he unlocked it , with the strong wind billowing her skirt . He held the door for her to get in and said , " Why do n't you let me drive , honey ? " " No , I want to drive . I love to drive . It 's the only thing in the world that I can do really well . It 's so neat , driving ; all precision and no mess . " Rita never seemed less appealing to him than when she talked around things as she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordy artificial language . " You do n't want to drive tonight , " he urged . " You just want to sit side of me with the wind blowing your hair , and look at the stars . " She laughed . " You are so simple , Kenny . The only time that you ever say poetic things like that is when you want something . You think I 'm drunk , do n't you ? Well , I 'm not . I 'm cold stone sober . I wish I were drunk . But I 'm not , and I 'm going to drive myself . " " Okay , " he said . " Go ahead and drive if you want to . " Shep145stepped by him to get into the car . " Wait a minute , " he said deliberately . The zipper fastener on the side of her skirt was gaping open , unfastened . He zipped it up , with a smooth rippling sound . Rita watched him do it and a flush of color came up in her face . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the car she said , " Do you know what Bill Saroyan says about love , Kenny ? He 's right about it , too . He says that love is a lot too good for people . It 's all right for the birds and the bees , he says , but it 's a lot too good for people . " Kenny was in no mood for philosophical discussion about love . " Where you gon na go ? " he asked her , as the car slid away from the curb . " I do n't care , any place , but out of the city . I do n't want to go any place . I just want to drive . " He was somewhat relieved to see that she handled the car with her usual adeptness . The cool air evidently was n't going to have the effect on her that he had anticipated . She crisscrossed through the city toward the outskirts , and neither one of them said anything for a long time . At last she said to him , " Kenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still and quiet like that ? " The wind was blowing hard through the car , because Rita had rolled the windows down on both sides , and it blew the smoke from his cigarette back into his eyes , smarting them . " I do n't know . I guess I was n't thinking about nothing . I was just setting here watching the lights shine on the road and feeling the wind blow . I always get a kick outa riding . I was n't thinking about nothing . " " I might have known it , " she mourned . " You are the luckiest person I know of . It 's just natural for you to feel always , instead of think . As for me , I ca n't help myself . I have to think all the time , so that I hardly ever have time to feel . " He did not understand what she was talking about , and he liked her less when she talked . She looked very attractivep146though , at that moment . She was smiling , her eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse he reached out to her forehead and gently brushed the hair back from her eyes . She turned to him immediately at his touch . " I think I can come in again tomorrow night , " she said ' lovingly . Immediately he regretted the gesture that had made them suddenly more intimate . " Well , I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't think I 'll be in tomorrow night . I got some real important business to attend to that 's gon na keep me tied up till real late . You had n't better come in tomorrow night . " This was the first time he had ever refused an offer of hers to see him . Kenny disliked this stage of the game particularly : the tapering-off process , for now all of the zest was gone . He felt only impatience to get to the end of it , and when you are bored and impatient it requires a great deal of skill to keep the timing right , he had learned long ago . He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Rita Sibley . They were driving along a wide gravel road with the outskirts of Ashbury behind them . She stepped on the accelerator hard , sending up a hail of gravel stones against the sides of the car . Her speech became less controlled , it was rapid and fluid . " Kenny , do n't say that , do n't , do n't . Do n't change your feeling about me . Do n't get tired of me , Kenny , because I ca n't stand it if you do . I tell you I ca n't stand it . You loved me , Kenny , you know you did , and I gave you everything I had to give , more than I 've ever given before in my life . Do n't say now that you 're sick of it , and tired of me , because I ca n't stand that , I tell you . " She was driving the car too fast , the wheels sliding in the loose gravel , and from her sudden burst of uncontrolled speech he thought that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . " Now , Rita honey , " he said . " Do n't get so excited and talk like that . Why do n't you let me drive awhile and . we 'll talk this over ? "  | " Do n't touch me , " she said . " Take your hands off from me . " She was driving the car like a crazy woman down the middle of the road while the speedometer ticked steadily upward . Kenny felt no fear , but he had an intuition of danger . He searched for words to placate her . " Look , Rita , there 's no sense you acting like a fool about this . I just said I was gon na be busy tomorrow night . I had some business to see to , but if you 're gon na take it like this , why , I can let it go . You can come tomorrow night if you want to . " " Shut up , " she said . " Do n't go on talking ; you only make it worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes were half closed against the wind that rushed through the car , blowing her words back into her mouth , so that her voice was twisted and unrecognizable . She hunched down over the steeringwheel talking loudly and wildly . " Kenny , what 's the matter with me ? Tell me , just tell me , why do n't you ? Why am I different than other women ? Why do all men get tired of me ? Men fall in love with other women and keep right on loving them all of their lives . But what is the matter with me ? Why am I different ? What do I lack that other women have ? Why do n't you tell me ? All my life I 've wanted somebody to love me and keep right on loving me , but they never do . They get tired of me . " " Stop talking rot , " he said angrily , " and look where you 're driving . If you do n't slow down you 're gon na turn this car over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it . There 's something wrong with me . I married Ernie and look what happened . He got tired of me and started going to other women . I divorced him and after that I met a lot of men , but what happened ? After two or three months they went on to some other woman . I married Joe , and I thought that was different , but Joe got tired of me too . He 's tired of me right now . He does n't care whether he 's married to me or not . He stays awayp148from home all the time , hanging around up there in Ashbury . I hardly see him for days and days . " " Jesus , " Kenny said , " will you cut , out the hollering and look what you 're doing ? " His mind was moving swiftly . He wondered if he dared risk trying to get the steering wheel away from her . Her hands were clenched on it with all of her strength , and at the speed the car was traveling he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wheel . The same problem faced him if he attempted to pry her foot loose from the accelerator . Any struggle at all at the speed they were traveling would be fatal , and to touch the brake was out of the question in the loose gravel . She was a good driver , and perhaps she would have sense enough to keep the car in the road herself , but it was a long-shot gamble , but a long shot either way . He tensed his body and kept his eyes on the road ahead and weighed the comparative odds desperately . " And now you , Kenny Veech , " she said . " Now you 've got sick of me too . Well , there 's one thing I want you to know right now . I never loved you , do n't ever fool yourself . You 're nothing but a crude , uneducated , rotten bum . Do you think I 'd ever love a man like you ? " she laughed bitterly . " I was just playing with you , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to prove to myself that I had what it takes to make a man want me and keep on wanting me . Well , I found out all right , did n't I ? " Her words roused an anger in Kenny that temporarily quelled his anxiety over whether or not she would be able to keep the car in the road . " You bet you , you found out , all right ! " he shouted at her , over the roar of the wind and the clattering gravel stones . " And do n't you ever fool yourself that I ever was in love with you either . I wanted to make you , that 's all , and I did . And it was easy , so God-damn easy . You ai n't got a God-damn thing to make any man love you . You do n't never think about nothing on earth but yourself . You never loved no man in your life . All you love is yourself.  |p149You  're all the time wanting men to love you just because it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get something for nothing , but let me tell you right now you ca n't . You got ta pay for every damn thing you get in this world and give something right back . That 's what 's the matter with you . Why , Jesus , you ai n't no kind of a woman at all . " " Stop it , " she screamed . " Stop it , I wo n't have you talking to me like this . Why , who do you think you are , you lowdown , good-for-nothing . . . " " You shut your mouth and listen . You kept asking me what 's the matter with you . Well , I 'm gon na tell you . You ai n't no kind of woman at all . You never give nothing to no man in your life . Remember when Ernie wanted you to have a baby ? But you did n't want no kids , and you seen to it too , did n't you , that you did n't have any ? Sure , you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want some man to love you just so it makes you feel good , but you want to cheat outa paying for it . And you can quit your bellyaching to me about Joe Sibley , too . Joe Sibley is so God-damn much better than you are that it ai n't even funny . Joe Sibley is working his heart out up to Ashbury every day of his life , trying to get a break for a lotta guys workin ' up there in them factories . He ai n't setting around all the time thinking about himself . You ai n't no kind of woman at all . Why , hell , you ai n't even as much a woman as a common whore in a whore house , because even they know they got ta give something to get their money . " He stopped for breath and Rita Sibley screamed incoherent words at him in her rage . And then she stopped talking and just screamed , holding her breath and shutting her eyes tight . Kenny tensed his body to lunge for the wheel , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in that secondafter the car slid crazily in the loose gravel along the edge of the road . He saw the cement abutment on the bridge over the dry stream bed ; he saw the stars blown bright all over thep150sky ; he saw the wide white gravel road that they had left winding away among the dark hills and gullies under the stars . And just as the great crash came that shut all other sounds and sights and feelings out of his consciousness , he opened the catch on the door on his side of the car and said Mary 's name like a prayer , and then everything was gone from him . The car broke and folded together against the cement abutment , and catapulted over like a child 's toy thrown carelessly aside . And as it rolled , the door on Kenny 's side came open and his limp body was hurled aside into the darkness and the car rolled on , and came to rest at last at the bottom of the bank , the two rear wheels of it that were still intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home the birthday party was breaking up . The rummy game had given way to general conversation , and after that Molly had insisted over everyone 's protests on making coffee and eating the remains of the cake . Ernie had offered to take Aunt Maggie home and she and Molly went to the kitchen to find her empty cake plate . Mary and Dorothy climbed the stairs . Dorothy did not know her mother very well , and she was silent and suspicious when she was with her . Mary herselfdid not vary her manner with her daughter from that which she showed any adult in the family , outside of Kenny . In silence she assisted the child to undress and , just as she was tucking her into her bed , quick footsteps sounded on the front porch and someone knocked furiously on the door . At the sound , Mary turned and ran down the stairs , stoppingmidway to listen to the torrent of words that an excited boy was pouring out to the family . " Say , Mrs. Veech , Central just called our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell you folks quick . They just telephoned down here from Ashbury to get hold of some of you folks . Kenny 's been in an awful automobile accident and he 's up to Ashbury in Receiving Hospital right now . They said he was awful badp151hurt and there was some woman with him and she 's terrible bad hurt and gon na die , and they do n't know who she is , and they thought maybe you folks would know if she was anybody from town or not because they want to get hold of her folks quick too , but they ca n't tell who she is . They said some of you folks better come up to the hospital right away . " Molly 's face crumpled up and she began to sob before the boy was half through talking . " Oh , Kenny , Kenny ! What are we going to do ? What are we ever going to do ? " Mary on the stairs heard the news with an expressionless face , only her hand on the guard rail clenched tighter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs to her room where she tidied her hair mechanically , powdered her nose and slipped on a coat and hat . Downstairs she found a babble of sound . Molly was weepingand Sam was trying to quiet her . Jen also was crying noisilyand Josette , white-faced , was saying over and over to Carl , " I always knew that something like this would happen to Kenny . I wonder who the woman is . I wonder if it could be anybody here from town . I 'll bet you anything they had been drinking . I 'll bet you anything . " " Carl , " Molly sobbed . " Go get Ernie quick , go on and get Ernie . Somebody 's got ta go right up there to that hospital right away . Mary shook her head at Carl . " Do n't cry , Mom . You ca n't help Kenny any by letting yourself get all upset . Ernie will be back here in just a minute and then he and I will go right up to the hospital . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Molly sobbed . They all waited-together nervously for Ernie to come back . Molly began to cry louder as the minutes dragged by . " Oh , why did it have to be Kenny ? I could stand it better if it had been anybody else but Kenny . I just could n't stand it if anytilingshould happen to him . " " Shshshsh , " Sam said nervously . " You do n't want to talkp152like that . You do n't want to say anything now you 'll be sorry for later . You 'd feel just like this if anything happened to any of the kids . " " No , I would n't , " Mollie said angrily . " Not the way I feel about Kenny . " The disturbance woke up old Jud , and for once the sounds about him seemed to penetrate his consciousness . He began to yell at the top of his voice and pound on the head of the bed with his fists . In the midst of the clamor , Ernie arrived , but none of them heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , God , what in hell has gone wrong around here ? " " Ernie , " Molly called to him wildly from Jud 's bedroom . " Kenny 's been hurt terrible bad . He 's up to Ashbury in a hospital . You got to go up there right away . " Ernie 's face turned sardonic for a moment and the look of it chilled Carl through . " So Kenny got hurt , huh ? " " Automobile smash , " Mary said . " Let 's get going . " At the door she called back to her mother . " Now , take it easy , Mom . Just as soon as I can I 'll telephone back here to Jones ' and the kid can run over and tell you . " Ernie and Mary went out to the car together . " Well , I do n't know as I 'm surprised any , " Ernie said . " If ever a guy was heading for trouble Kenny was the one . " " I want to go back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they reached the hotel , she got out of the car and ran in the front door . The taproom was deserted except for a couple of waiters . She went directly to the door of Lew Lentz ' office without speaking to anyone . Lew was at his desk when she came in , his coat neatly draped over the back of a chair , and the electric fan humming . She came up to his desk . " Kenny 's been badly hurt in an automobile accident . He 's up to Ashbury in the hospital . " Lew Lentz ' pale blue eyes gleamed a little , but his face andp153voice were impassive . " Well , is n't that too bad , " he said softly , looking straight into her face . They looked at each other quietly . The brown shadows were deeper around Mary 's eyes , but her soft pink crumpled lips were quiet . She looked straight at him , without moving , only ; , the little pulse in her throat moving quickly in and out . But Lew Lentz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn away before hers . " Did you expect me to bust out crying ? " Lew said . " Christ , I hope he dies . If it was n't for him hanging around here and the way you feel about him , we 'd be married now . " After a moment she spoke softly without taking her eyes from his face . " There are other places where I can get the money I need , if I have to . " Lew Lentz ' eyes became expressionless , and he got to his yj feet . " Oh , hell , I 'll give you all the money you want , " he said . " But if he 's hurt as bad as I hope he is , all the money on God 's earth wo n't saveHe went to the safe in the corner and twirled the combinationdials while she waited . He came to her with a packet of bills , and she put them into her purse without looking at them . He stood close to her . He was a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One other thing , " she said . " I wish you 'd get on the phone right away and see if you can get hold of Joe Sibley in Ashbury . You would n't get him at the shop now , but if you call Jimmy Martin 's I think his wife would know where you could get hold of him . Tell Joe to get over to Receiving Hospital right away . They do n't think that his wife is going to live . " " Oh , " Lentz said , " so that 's how it is . Is n't that just lovely ? i laybe we can hang a **26;7343;TOOLONG charge around his neck before we 're through with this . " " Do n't worry about it , " Mary said . " I imagine Rita Sibley was driving her own car , all right . "  | " Well , we 'll see , " Lew said . " Do n't worry , I 'll have Joe over there by the time you are . " He put his arms around her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms from around her and walked to the door . As she went out he said to her caressingly , " Do n't hurry so , Mary . I hope you get there lots too late . " She ran out of the hotel and back to Ernie 's car . " Step on it now , " she said as she got in . Ernie needed no encouragement . He sent the car hurtling over the road toward Ashbury . " Receiving 's the big hospital this side of the city , ai n't it ? " " Yes , " Mary said . " They tell you anything about the accident ? " he asked . " No , just that it was an automobile accident , and that Kenny was badly hurt . There was a woman with him that they do n't think is gon na live . They have n't identified her yet , and they thought maybe she was somebody we knew . " " Jesus , I hope Kenny was n't driving the car , " Ernie said . After a moment he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " " Yes , " Mary said quietly , looking at him as she spoke . " The woman is Rita Sibley . " Ernie 's face did not change expression at all , nor did his voice . " Then I figure she was driving , all right . She drives something awful . It 's a wonder she has n't got smashed up before this . " He kept his eyes straight on the road ahead of him . " You know I been hearing some talk around about Kenny and her , but I never believed there was nothing to it . " " It 's true all right , " Mary said briefly . Ernie laughed his dry unpleasant laugh . " Well , what do you know ! So old Kenny made Rita , huh ? " Mary did not answer him and neither one of them spoke until they were at the hospital . They left the automobile in the parking lot and went in thep155door of the big hospital together . In the vast cool efficient interior , Ernie was plainly embarrassed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stated her name and business directly . The crisp , white-garbed woman behind the desk consultedher cards and looked at Mary curiously while she talked . " Your brother 's condition is not really serious , Miss Veech . he was unconscious when he came in here , of course . He has some smashed ribs and a broken collar bone and a bump on his head , that we ca n't be sure about until after the X-rays . " " Thank you , " Mary said coolly . " Is there a telephone around here that I could use , please ? " " Right over there , " the attendant said with her brisk smile . Apparently she enjoyed an opportunity to talk . " Your brother is a lucky fellow , Miss Veech , " she said . " The automobile , they say , is smashed to pieces and the young woman with him is in a very bad condition . Would you be able to give us her name and address ? Unless you have some idea who was with him , you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . Anyway , your brother can tell us as soon as he comes out from his anesthetic . " Mary evaded the question that had been asked her , but she walked back to the information desk at a sudden thought . " I wonder if you can tell me how my brother was identified ? " she asked . " Certainly , " the woman said . " From a hotel-room key in his pocket . It 's easy to identify a hotel-room key in a city the size , f this one . It was from a small hotel on Mechanic Street . I'he proprietor came over here and he identified your brother , and from the clothing that was on the woman when she came in he was able to identify her as a woman who visited Mr. leech often at the hotel . They had left the hotel together earlier tonight . " " I suppose all that was reported in plenty of time to make the morning newspapers , " Mary said softly . The woman 's bearing changed perceptibly and her voicep156became much crisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both our recordspertaining to accidents such as this and the records of the police are available to the city newspapers . I hope that you did not mean your remark the way that it sounded . " " I am not responsible for the way I sounded to you , " Mary answered . " I just asked you a question . " She turned away with Ernie following her and walked across the marble floor with her high heels clicking . " This is sure gon na make a sweet story for the papers , all right , " Ernie said as she entered the telephone booth . After she had sent a brief message to her mother reporting Kenny 's condition , they went to take the elevator to the second floor . But before they got to the lift they saw Joe Sibley come in the front entrance and stand a moment , uncertain in the large interior . Mary called out to him instantly . " Kenny 's on the second floor , Joe , " she said meaningly . " You can come up with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her oddly , a flush of color over his thin face . Then he stepped into the elevator behind Mary and Ernie . " How is she ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Mary said . " I guess we can find out up here . She has n't been identified for sure yet . I 'm afraid the papers are gon na make kind of a bad story out of this , and I do n't see what we can do about it . " Joe Sibley 's face was expressionless . " How did it happen ? How bad a story ? " " I do n't know , except that it was a bad automobile crash . " She looked at him hard for a moment . " The man that runs the hotel over on Mechanic Street where Kenny had a room , come over here and identified him , and shot off his mouth a lot . " " You mean . . . ? " She nodded . " Yeah , he identified Rita by her clothes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know the papers have got hold of that much for sure . " " Then I do n't see as we can do anything about it , " Joe Sibley said . " I 'll have to identify her and the papers will have to go ahead and print what they want to . " They stood together talking in front of the elevator on the second floor and Ernie kept staring at Joe Sibley covertly as he talked to Mary . Mary touched Joe Sibley 's arm . " If I had only got up here an hour sooner , " she said . " It is n't your fault , " Joe said . " There is n't a thing you could have done . " " Will this be bad for your work ? " Mary asked him . Joe Sibley looked at her with gratitude on his face . " It wo n't help it none , " he said . " It 'll give the papers a big chance to print a lot of dirt about me . They just wait for chances like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the papers are like in this town . " Mary and Joe walked up to the supervisor 's desk and faced the kindly , gray-haired woman . " I 'm Mary Veech , and I want to know how my brother Kenneth Veech is , please . He was hurt in an automobile accidenttonight . " " Oh , yes , " the woman said . " Your brother is coming along fine , Miss Veech . His injuries were n't serious and he is restingcomfortably now . He has been asking for you . You may see him for a few minutes if you like . " " If you please , " Mary said . " The nurse will show you to his room . " As Mary turned back to Ernie , she heard Joe Sibley say in a loud clear voice , " I would like to know how my wife is . Her name is Rita Sibley , and she is the woman that was in the same accident as Kenneth Veech . " The supervisor hesitated for just a moment . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate you . Mr. Veech gavep158us your wife 's name and address just a few moments ago . Her condition is very grave . You see ... " " I am going to see him for a minute , " Mary said to Ernie , and then she followed the nurse down the dimly lighted corridorbetween the clean closed doors . The nurse 's rubber soles made no sound at all , but Mary 's heels made a sharp decisive clicking . The air was saturated with a strong antiseptic smell . Mary looked at all of the doors along the corridor , plain closed doors , with so much suffering behind them . The nurse opened one on the left side of the hall and stepped aside for Mary to enter . The room , little more than a cubicle , was clean and cheerless . " Here is your sister to see you , Mr. Veech . But you must n't try to talk to her too much . " Kenny was lying slightly propped up on a high narrow bed . One of his arms was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were closed when they entered , but he opened them wide immediately and grinned at Mary . " Hello , kid , " he said . Mary went to the edge of the bed , stood close to him and touched her hand against his cheek . " How do you feel ? " " I feel swell . I got a little headache that 's all , I musta bumped my head and I 'm as hungry as all hell . You ought a see all the adhesive tape they got on me . I 'll leave it to the nurse they got about two yards of that stuff on me . " The nurse , hovering in the doorway , smiled slightly at his words . " Can I have a cigarette ? " he asked her . " Just one , please ? " " I think you might , if you want one , " she said . She withdrewfrom the room and as she closed the door she said to Mary , " I 'll come for you in a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . " Kenny grinned at Mary dolefully . " And they always tell stories about beautiful nurses ! " Mary struck a match for his cigarette silently . " Tastes good , " he said.  | " You 're doing all the talking , " she said . " I 'm the one that 's supposed to do the talking . " " Okay , shoot . " She smiled at him and lit a cigarette for herself . He looked away to the wall for a moment and at last he asked quietly , " How is she ? They would n't tell me nothing about how she was . " Mary hesitated . " I do n't know . " " Spill it , " he said . " Is she dead ? I do n't see myself how she could still be living after that . If I had n't got throwed out before that car quit rolling I would n't be here . That 's the last thing I remember , getting throwed out . " " She 's still alive , " Mary said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moved his head a little in a half nod , and inhaled his cigarette deeply . " Musta rammed that steering wheel right through her . Car musta struck hardest on her side too . " " She was driving then ? " " Hell , yes . If she had n't a been driving , I would n't be in the hospital . We 'd been drinking some , just enough so they probably will give it a nice drunk-driving write-up in all the papers . " She was drunk then , " Mary said slowly as if she was trying to reconstruct what had happened . " And she lost control of the car . " " She might have been drunk , but she was n't that drunk . She was mad , that 's mostly what was wrong with her . She was mad at me and driving like hell . She had a regular temper tantrum and she run the car into a cement bridge abutment . Because she got so mad she started screaming and shut her eyes . Shut her eyes , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . She went nuts . You can figure out yourselfwhat was burning her up . " Mary nodded . " Now look , " he said , hunching up a little on his pillows . " We got ta talk fast . That damn fool of a nurse is gon na bep160back here chasing you out in a minute . How come you got up here so soon ? How come they got me identified so quick ? " " Hotel key , " she answered significantly . Kenny whistled a little . " Jesus , God ! What a story for the newspapers ! " " Yeah . They 'll smear it all over the morning edition . If it tore the car to pieces they 'll even have pictures . " " Then there ai n't nothing we can do . Hell , when they asked me who she was I told ' em right away . I figured it would be worse if I did n't . Besides , I did n't know that damn son of a bitch from the hotel had been over here shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't your fault , " Mary said . He looked at the door anxiously , as if he expected to see the nurse coming in at any moment . " How about Joe ? " " He came up in the elevator with us . The trouble is they 'll give this a big smear in the papers on account of Joe being mixed up with the labor unions and stuff here in Ashbury . They 'll threw a lot of dirt just because she is his wife . " " Jesus , oh , Jesus , " Kenny said . " When the papers get done with this if she ai n't dead she 'll wish she had died . " Mary took hold of his hand and squeezed it hard , and just then the nurse opened the door . " I think you had better go , Miss Veech . Your brother needs rest and sleep . " Kenny clung to Mary 's hand and talked fast . " Do n't you worry about this none . It 's all over and done with , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm not worried . Hell , it 's too good to be alive to worry none about nothing . Tell Joe  --  you know what  --  and . . . " " Mr. Veech ! " the thin light-haired nurse opened her prominentblue eyes even wider . " You must not talk so much . You must n't let yourself get so excited . " " Yeah , I know . Take it easy , " he said to her impatiently , " and I 'll be outa here and home tomorrow afternoon . The doc said if everything was all right I could come home tomorrow.  |p161Just  got ta tote my arm in a sling on account of a crack in my collar bone . " Mr. Veech , I insist , " the nurse said . " If you are n't quiet and get some rest you wo n't be going home tomorrow . " " And do n't forget to tell Joe , and listen , maybe you better save all the morning papers for me , and . . . " Kenny and Mary smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on her heels , and slid into the old familiargesture , cocking her fist at Kenny in the bed . Kenny in return clasped his two hands together and shook them at her gently and solemnly . Mary was gone then , and while the nurse fussed around the bed , Kenny sighed deeply , still smiling , his eyes on the door through which Mary had disappeared . " No wonder you were so anxious to see your sister , " the nurse said conversationally . " She seems to be a charming and beautiful woman . I hope that her visit has n't tired you too much though . " " Oh , hell , " he said . " I feel fine . I can sleep now . " The nurse smiled at him warmly . " You really look better . I think seeing your sister was good for you . " She slid a thermometer into his mouth and while she waited she said , " You know , having a sister like that must make it hard for a young man . Finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Kenny looked up dumbly at the smiling , simpering nurse , with clouded eyes . Mary joined Ernie in the corridor again . " How is he ? " he asked . She smiled shortly . " He seems to be feeling pretty good . He says he 's coming home tomorrow . " " He does , huh ? " Ernie smiled appreciatively . " Well , it takes a lot to kill a Veech . " They walked toward the elevator and Mary hesitated a lit/tie . She saw Joe Sibley suddenly corning up from the other end of the corridor and she ' ; gent to meet him , while Ernie waited . " How is she ? " Joe looked at her wonderingly , his clear brown eyes looked more unbelieving than suffering . " God , she 's just broke all to pieces . The doctors say she has n't got hardly any chance at all . She 's broke up through here , " he passed his hand over his chest . " Even her jaws are broken  --  they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got cut awful bad too , all over her face and neck and head . She 's still unconscious . They just let me look in at her . Her whole face and head is covered with bandages . I do n't see how she breathes . No skull fracture , though . They say that she is strong and young and she 's got a better chance than lots of people would have . But I do n't see how she can . " Mary said nothing . After awhile she said , " Joe , Kenny wanted me to say something to you . I think you already know most of what he wanted me to say , yourself . " Joe 's face was strained and expressionless . " How is he ? " he said briefly . " He 's feeling pretty good . He says he 's coming home tomorrow . Joe made a funny noise in his throat that might have been a laugh . Mary looked down to the shiny toes of her shoes , very black against the plain white floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked at him again and her eyes were dark in the dim light . She put her hand out to his arm . " Joe , I 'm sorry . That 's all I can say . I 'm sorry . " " Thanks , " Joe Sibley said . " You 're all right , Miss Veech . I 'm not blaming you ; none of this is anything you could help . Your brother , a man like your brother . . . " Joe 's face showed anger suddenly , and more than anger , a kind of helplessness.  | " I do n't know what to say about him , a man like your brother . Why , it seems like he 's no good to society or himself or anybody . Oh , you need n't worry . I 'm not gon na beat him up , or anything ; it would n't do any good . He is n't even worth that . . . " Mary closed her fingers tight on Joe 's arm , and then she turned away . She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , I thought you was never coming , " he said . " I got ta get home and get some sleep . I 'm a working man . I ai n't used to staying up all night . " He nearly drove the wheels off the car going back to the village , yawning deep and wide from time to time . When Mary got home , as she expected , she found a sleepy anxious family waiting up for her . As soon as she came in the door they bombarded her with questions . " How is he ? Did they let you see him ? Did he tell you how it happened ? How does he feel ? Who was the woman with him ? Is she going to die ? Was he driving the car ? When can he come home ? " Mary took off her hat , threw it on the center table and loosened the hair back from her face . She selected some of the questions and answered them , speaking wearily , like a child reciting a piece that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feeling pretty good . They let me talk to him for a few minutes . The accident did n't seem to upset him much . He says he is coming home tomorrow , and I guess he can all right , unless he gets worse . " Molly noticed the fatigue in Mary 's face and she said , " Why , you look all tuckered out . It 's been hard on you going up there , and everything . The rest of you all keep still and quit asking her questions all to once . You set right down here , Mary , and let me get you a cup of hot coffee . That 'll make you feel better right away . " Mary sat down obediently and Molly bustled out to the kitchen , returning in a minute or two with a cup of steaming black coffee . Molly had a cup of coffee for herself too , and %he sat down in front of Mary and said to her , " Now tell usp164just what 's the matter with him ? He did n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm glad it 's no worse , " said Molly , after Mary 's recital . " He was n't driving the car was he ? " Sam asked anxiously . Mary shook her head . Josette could not curb her curiosity any longer . " Who was the woman with him , Mary ? Is she going to live ? Have they got her identified ? Is she anybody from here in town ? " Mary hesitated a little before she answered . " Well , I guess there is n't any use of trying to make a secret of it . Everybody in town will know it by tomorrow morning anyway , after the papers come out . The woman was Rita Sibley . " Molly caught her breath with a sharp whistling sound . " You see , " Mary continued , " the newspapers will make an even bigger story out of it on account she is Joe Sibley 's wife . Joe is n't very popular up to Ashbury right now , because he 's mixed up in the labor trouble . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of left-handed dig at Joe while they 're at it . " Molly stated her opinion conclusively . " Well , sir , I 'm awful sorry for Kenny mixed up in all of this , but I ai n't a bit sorry for her , not a bit sorry . The way she was doing , she ought a get smashed up like this . She had it coming to her . Her , a married woman , and older than he is , and then chasing after Kenny like that , and going right up to the hotel where he was staying to see him and everything . She ought a been ashamed . She never was extra what you 'd call good for anything . Lord , I 'm glad Ernie got rid of her when he did . She deserves every single bit of this , getting hurt , and the talk there 'll be about her and everything . Her a-chasing after Kenny , going to his hotel to see him , and carting him around in her automobile and smashing it up and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel sorry for a woman like that . " " Well , I think Kenny 's just exactly as much to blame for it  |p165as  she is , " Josette flared . " I suppose you think she did all the chasing . You ought a know Kenny better by this time . If there was any chasing done , Kenny Veech did his share of it , you need n't worry . I feel sorry for Rita Sibley , I tell you right now . " Molly was very angry , but the argument finally wore itself out and the family trooped off to bed , Molly going to her cot in the kitchen outside Jud 's door . And so it was that Carl 's eighteenth birthday was not destined to be a day set apart for him after all . It went down into the annals of family history not as " the day that Carl was eighteen years old , and we had the party for him when Jud was sick , " but instead as , " the day that Kenny got hurt in that automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly devoted as much print and as many pictures to the accident as had been anticipated . Rita herself , was well known in Ashbury ; and there was a certain news value in her very name . Nor did they neglect Joe in the reports of the accident . Several of the more outspokenlyprejudiced newspapers in the city referred to Rita openly as the wife of a labor agitator , who was stirring up trouble in the city . The Veeches read all the newspapers and went about their affairs . It was not the first time that one of the family had been a central figure in an unsavory story running all over the village . Mary had always figured in the town gossip . Kenny 's record had not been clean previous to this , nor Jen 's either , not to mention Ernie . The Veeches were not as annoyed by the situation as might have been expected . Although the village talked avidly and disapproved , in the main they did not condemn . Molly had a singularly busy day of it . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , who came ostensibly to inquire after Jud Higgins ' health , but who were eager for Molly to discuss the accident with them . In most cases Molly did discuss it freely and told everyone exactly what she thought of a woman like Rita Sibley , whose misdemeanorsplaced her beyond the range of anybody 's sympathies . The afternoon passed and while the family was at supperp167Kenny came in the front door unnoticed . He appeared suddenlybefore their eyes . He coughed a little , a dry hacking little half-cough in his throat and they all turned around and looked at him . " Hi , everybody , " he said smiling . He was looking much as usual , except that his right arm was doubled up in a sling . He was a little paler than normal perhaps , his mouth was a little pinched , giving his features a finer cast than they usually had . But his grin was wide and genial , his hair was tousled up over his eyes in blonde curls and at the moment there was a pronouncedodor of alcohol about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him immediately , half-laughing , half-crying . " Kenny boy , are we ever glad to see you , mister ? How do you feel ? How are you ? You sure it 's all right for you to be up around ? " " Hey , Mom , go easy , will you , " he said as she embraced him heartily . He coughed again , the little dry tentative cough down in his throat . " You good-for-nothing old bum , you , " his mother said caressingly . She hurried to pour him some coffee and set a chair for him at the table . " Do n't fuss around getting any supper for me . I ate before I left town . All I want is some coffee . " " Well , darling , " Jen said merrily , " we read about you in the papers . " Molly shook her head disapprovingly , but Kenny said genially as he sat down , " Say , was n't those papers fierce though ! " He coughed again as he spoke . Jen cupped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e table curiously . " Say , what 's the matter with you , anyway ? e thought you busted a collar bone . You 're coughing like u got T.B. ? " " Oh , hell , " Kenny said . " It 's the damndest thing . The doc lays my ribs where they got smashed are irritating on my pleura or something , what ever in hell my pleura is . He ex/plained all about it to me . It 's got something to do with my lungs . He claims while the ribs are healing they keep kind of tickling on there . I keep feeling just like I got ta cough all the time . But the doc says I got ta be careful . If I ever coughed real hard once , he says I would bust loose all of them ribs again . " He coughed again after he got done telling it . " Well , I tell you , " Molly said . " You 're lucky to be here , that 's what you are . Why them pictures in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just smashed clean to pieces . I never see nothing like it . " Kenny laughed softly , and relapsed into his cough . Sam who had been silent all the while suddenly burst out indignantly at Kenny . " By Jesus , I do n't know how you can set there and laugh with that woman dying up to the hospital right now . Let me tell you young feller , if I 'd ever pulled anywherenear the stunt you just pulled when I was your age my father would have took the horsewhip to me right . And then you come in here tonight acting big and smart like nothinghappened and laughing right in our faces , and smelling of liquor right this minute . By Jesus , it would seem to me that you 'd drunk enough liquor lately to last you for awhile . " Molly flew to Kenny 's rescue . " Sam Veech , you shut up your mouth , talking to Kenny like that . He 's a sick boy , just come home from the hospital , and then you jump all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's true , " Josette said with her face set . " Every word that Pa said is the truth . He ought to be ashamed . He has n't got any shame , or he could n't look us in the face after all that printed right in the papers ... " Kenny banged his fist down hard on the table before Molly could speak again . He coughed a little before he started to talk , and his voice was tight with suppressed anger . " Now just a minute , all of you . There 's a few things I want to get straight around here , and then I ai n't gon na say nothing more about it , so you better listen now . " He looked around at all of themp169with his face grim and set and coughed delicately . " Rita Sibleywas n't drunk when she crashed that automobile . We 'd been drinking all right , but she was n't drunk . If she hada been she would n't have been driving that car , I 'd a seen to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed . " Then how in the world ... " " Rita Sibley was having a regular temper tantrum when she crashed that car . She was so mad at me she could n't see straight , because she got it in her head that I was giving her the gate . She got so mad she like to went crazy . She did a lot of yelling and talking and driving faster and faster . She got so mad that she did n't know what she was doing , and then she lost control of the car in the gravel and run it smack into the cement abutment of that bridge over the gully . When the car hit , I opened the door on my side and if I had n't of , I would n't he here . You know more about the rest of it than I do . You hem reading the papers . " He had to stop talking then , his voice was strangling out , to cough . " There , sir , " Molly said triumphantly . " How anybody can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . It 'll be better for her if she dies , because I do n't see how she could ever hold up her head in this town again . Why , she liked to have killed Kenny , busting his collar bone and his ribs ... " Sam was almost crying with his helpless indignation . " You can talk all you want , you ca n't change it a bit . You was chasingafter some other man 's wife , or you would n't have got into all this trouble . " " Sam Veech , " Molly said warningly . " You heard what Kenny said . He do n't want to talk about it no more . You just shut up your mouth , right now . " Sam got up and fled away from the table back to the front porch . Josette gave Kenny a look of perfect loathing , and also left the table . A silence fell in the kitchen . The wind blew around the house , raining down crab-apples onto the roof . Kennyp170scowled moodily into his coffee cup . Jen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a clock was ticking in noisy unconcern . From the bedroom came the sound of Jud 's voice , talking incessantly , holding a confidential conversation with someone or other , visible only to himself . Dorothy hung around the back of Kenny 's chair , fascinated by his arm in the sling , the attention he was getting and particularly by his continual soft coughing . Finally Kenny got up from the table . His mother said anxiously , " Kenny , you ai n't going uptown or anywhere tonight , are you ? You had n't ought a go out . You ca n't tell me you feel good enough to ... " " I 'm going to bed . Where you think I 'm going ? " Carl heard his brother coming up the stairs , the drag of his Feet , the sound of his gentle coughing . Carl was in a panic at the thought of being alone with Kenny . He wondered what he should say to him , whether he should say that he was sorry he was hurt , or what . Kenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind outside was still blowing hard , driving the lace curtains out straight into the room . The green wormy crabapplesfrom the tree outside kept up a continual fusilage against the roof . There were no billion stars blowing in the sky tonight ; the night pressed close against the windows was black and full of mysterious unseen motion before the wind . " If you ai n't ready to sleep this early , you better take that book and go on downstairs , " Kenny said to Carl . " I 'm going to get some sleep . " Carl laid aside his book obediently and put the other pillow , doubled beneath his head and shoulders , over on the other side of the bed . He watched Kenny while he took off his shirt . He had to take his arm out of the sling , holding it carefully doubled in the same position , and work the sleeve down from it . He was awkward with it , left-handed , and Carl wanted to help him , but he did not dare to offer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose he should roll against him in the night .. . " Listen , " he said , fighting the embarrassment out of his voice , " do n't you want me to sleep downstairs on the couch ? I can , just the same as not . It do n't make no difference to me . I just thought that maybe you . . . " " Hell , no , you 're all right where you are . I 'll sleep on this side of the bed , though , then my shoulder and my banged-up ribs will be to the outside of the bed . You always stay on your own side the bed , anyway . " Kenny took an envelope from his shirt pocket , and spilled out a couple of white capsules . " Go downstairs and get me a glass of water , " he said to Carl . Carl resented his peremptory tone of voice but there was something definitely sinister about his brother , he thought . He remembered a movie he had seen once in which an exceedingly tough gangster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have to take medicine ? " Carl asked tremulously when he brought the glass . " Sleeping pills , " Kenny said laconically . He lay back on the pillow , settled his body and closed his eyes immediately . Carl listened to Kenny 's deep breathing and thought about the possibility of Kenny 's having taken an overdose of the medicine . He shuddered to think that Kenny might quite conceivably die in the night , and that he should sleep for hours in the same bed with a corpse and never know it . While he was still dwelling on this morbid thought a little screech owl close to the window emitted its peculiar cry . Carl jumped , then held his breath , fearful that he had awakened Kenny . Carl 's attention was turned now to the outdoors , the rustling of the leaves , and moan of the wind , the windows shaking in their frames . The very blackness , unbroken by any alien star or beam of light , was soothing . He discovered suddenlythat it was a comfort to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allayed ; he was safe because Kenny was here . With his mind so completely at rest , he turned in gratitude to the thought of the girl , the ideal girl , that he was going to meet some day . He fumbled with the skeins of his fancy , ready to weave himself a dream of her . The moment had become infinitely pleasant , infinitely precious to him . While he still fumbled for his dream he fell asleep and the moment was lost forever . The crab-apples rolled over the roof ironically and plunged off into the deep thick grass below.  |p175THE  carnival moved into town for the week , and Kenny 's accident was relegated to ancient village history . The street carnival was an annual affair , sponsored by the American Legion Post for the purpose of raising funds . The main street of the downtown area was roped off and a cheap carnival company brought in its trappings : the rickety ferris wheel , the merry-go-round which had lost its popularity with a more daring and enlightened generation of children , canvas booths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery , ball-throwing concessions ; penny pitching , roulette , refreshments , beer . From the moment that the first truck arrived , the village children fairly lived there , never tiring of running back and forth among the booths that transformed the quiet village street into something alien and exciting . The Veeches were pleasurably excited about the show and attended it in shifts in the evenings , since someone always had to remain at home to look after Jud . The responsibility fell more or less upon Sam and Molly , so they worked out a sort of agreement between them . Molly went up first , early in the evening . She never varied her procedure . Immediately upon arriving she went to the refreshment booth and drank a bottle of lemon pop , stopping to talk with everyone that she knew . Then she went directly to the large bingo concession , a table in the form of a hollow square with benches all around , andp176a long table in the middle where the prizes were displayed and the callers conducted the game . Molly would hoist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of corn off the table to use for counters , and play steadily sixty or seventy cents worth of cards , one after another . She never won . She always demanded a new card each time andlamented the fact that if she had kept the card that she had had the last game , she would have been able to bingo this game . Kenny went down the first night , and , surrounded by a group of his friends , his circle of friends in the village was particularly solicitous and admiring of Kenny at this time , he made a rapid circuit of the carnival , pointing out its obvious defects and deficiencies . He encountered Jen and Fran Cope wandering through the crowd arm in arm , smiling pertly at all and sundry , obviously out for whatever game they might encounter , and he good-naturedly admonished them to beware of riding on the merry-go-round with carnival men , at the top of his lungs over the heads of an appreciative crowd . Theshooting gallery was the only concession that he would condescendto patronize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was able to handle one of the light rifles . He was a good shot and he was proud of it . He ignored all of . the numbered boards and single cigarette packages and fired continuallyat a package of cigarettes with a dollar bill wrapped around it and secured by a rubber band . Each time he aimed at it , he hit it , and although , as he pointed out , he hit it low , it simply fell over backward on the shelf instead of being knocked off the shelf as by all the rules of fair dealing it should have been . He knocked the package over six times , pointing out each time to the crowd gathered around the concession that there was obviously something crooked about it . To prove his point he fired at an ordinary package of cigarettes the next time , and knocked it well off from the shelf and received its equivalent in fresh cigarettes . Then , over the protests of thep177man in charge of the gallery , he fired at the package with the dollar bill again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man in charge gave him a fresh package of cigarettes and a dollar bill , and Kenny departed in triumph , and was seen at the carnival no more . Josette had taken an unusual interest in the carnival from the beginning , to the surprise of her family . The cause of her interest dated back to a conversation with Midge Clark . Midge had informed her that several friends of hers from the East were coming to visit her at about the time that the carnival began , and she was sure that the carnival would amuse them . Josette must certainly meet her friends , Midge assured her , and she added that according to the last letter she had received there was a possibility that there would be an extra man in the party . Josette was excited by the prospect . She made plans for inveigling money out of her mother and Ernie with which she intended to buy some new clothes . But as the carnival drew nearer she saw and heard nothing from Midge . She worried about it , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would have no time to see her until her friends arrived . The first night of the carnival , Josette defiantly told Pat Thompson that she had another engagement , and dressed with great care , checking and rechecking each item and detail of her toilet until she was certain that she was suitably and attractively garbed for the occasion . Although she had heard nothing from Midge , she departed for the carnival alone in high spirits . Once there the crowds and lights and the cheapnessof it wearied her ; there was nothing about it to interest her . She walked alone among the crowd watching for Midge Clark and her friends . Josette made a rather attractive figure , tall and well formed , her head with the neat brown curls carried high . She was wearing a yellow dress with clean white accessories , stepping daintily in her high-heeled white sandals . Several men in the crowd attempted to approach her , butp178Josette met their loose-lipped inviting smiles with a stony face and hurried on . She walked back and forth past the various concessions without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a half hour of it her head ached and her feet hurt , and she was angry with herself . She should have waited at home for Midge to come after her , she thought , and she should not have come down here so early , anyway . She went over to the refreshment stand at last and ordered a bottle of pop and sat down on the bench to drink it . While she was still sitting there sucking on her straws dispiritedly and contemplatingthe stains and smudges already dirtying her white shoes , she saw them : Midge , another girl and three boys noisilybuying tickets for the merry-go-round . Josette stared at them . The girls wore slacks and sweaters and bright jackets that matched the bright sandals on their feet . They were all disheveled and talking too loudly , screaming with laughter as the slow old merry-go-round chugged around and around with them , the little horses bobbing up and down jerkily . The three boys were all tall and good-looking . They were all smoking , and one of the boys sprawled across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed protests at him to be good . They were the center of all eyes , and the village was frankly disapproving . Josette studied the girl with Midge , a short , dark-haired person and decided that she herself was much more attractive-looking . Although Josette did not approveof their loud and conspicuous behavior she was longing to be one of them . The merry-go-round stopped at last and they came tumbling off it , toward her , and Josette steeled herself , smiling already a cool pretty smile . They passed by her so near that the full swinging legs of Midge 's slacks brushed against Josette 's knees , but they did not stop . For one terrible moment , just as they passed , Midge looked squarely into Josette 's face , smiled and said " Hello . " They went on up the line , shouting and laughing , crowding together into the boothp179where photographs were taken for a dime and developed while you waited . Josette was stunned . She sat still on the bench with the crowd surging around her and the blare of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great wad of pink spun-sugar candy stumbled against her feet and smeared the candy over the front of her dress , but she hardly noticed . Her mother , and Jen , and all of them had so often prophesied that this would happen , but she could not yet believe it . The hurt and disappointment was welling up in her and Josette got up and fled for home . She ran away and left the light and noise of the carnival behind her . She ran all the way to the house until a stab of pain shot through her side . She went straight up the stairs to her own room and threw herself across the bed and cried into her pillow . The sound of insect voices filled the room , and , over it , the muffled sound of the music and laughterand shouting from the carnival up the street . Saturday , the last night of the carnival , was bound to be the biggest night of all . The concessions opened long before dark and they would remain open until very late . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already dressed , putting on make-up before the mirror . Except for the few minutes that she had spent there the night that it opened , Josette had not been near the carnival , but today she had promised Pat Thompson to go down with him in the evening . " You going down to the carnival ? " Jen asked her . " Yes . " " You going with Pat ? " Josette nodded . " Atta girl . You know I figured you was going with Pat . I see him about six when I went downtown after the groceries , and he was grinning from ear to ear . I think it 's a shame the way you been treating Pat lately . Pat is just crazy about you.  |p180I  wish some nice steady fellow like Pat was that crazy about me . Why , you ca n't get Pat Thompson to date another girl but you . " " If you did n't tear around so much , maybe some boy like Pat would get crazy about you , maybe Pat would even . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way you run around all the time with everybody in town . " " I know it , " Jen said seriously . " You know , it 's funny . I would n't like nothing better than to have somebody like Pat , some steady fellow with a good job get crazy about me . I 'd like to get married and have a house of my own and start having babies , and everything . I been wanting that ever since I can remember . But , my God , while I 'm waiting I ca n't help but run around with the kids and have a good time , can I ? " " But that 's just the trouble , " Josette said severely while she combed her curls over her finger . " You do so much playing and tearing around that no nice boy will ever get crazy about you . You ought to make up your mind what you want ; you ca n't have both . " " I 'm going to stop running around so much some of these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jen slipped a bright flowered print dress with a full swinging skirt over her head , and pulled it down smoothly over her hips . " How come you 're putting on your good dress to wear down there tonight ? " Josette said , looking at her in the mirror . " Oh , tonight is special , " Jen said , posing before the mirror and twisting so that the full skirt swung around her legs . " This is gon na be the last date I 'll have with Dick . " " Dick ? " Josette asked . " For heaven 's sakes , who is Dick ? " " Dick Meyers , a guy that travels with the carnival . This will be his last night in town . I 've got a date with him for until the carnival closes . Then they 're going to pack right up and move out . So after the carnival closes I 'm going out to Greenings Lake for the end of the dance out there with Clim Hawkins . "  | " There you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the nice boys in town to like you and then you pick up one of those carnival men and go running off out to GreeningsLake at twelve or one o'clock with Clim Hawkins . " " Well , any time you want to save me from Clim you know what you can do , " Jen said . " Honest , Clim is just dying to have a date with you . Clim thinks you 're the smartest and the best-looking girl in this town . I 've heard him say so lots of times . " The compliment did not please Josette . " Well , Clim Hawkinsdoes n't have to go around talking about me at all . " " Aw , do n't be like that , " Jen said . " Say , Jo , where are those hiffon stockings of yours with the black heels and seams up the back ? I want to wear my black pumps tonight , and them stockings would look swell . " " You ca n't have them , " Josette answered promptly . " You have been wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , wearing them down to that carnival . " At that moment Molly called up the stairs , " Hey , Josie , you ready yet ? Pat is setting down here waiting . " Josette picked up her purse and a clean handkerchief and went downstairs . With her sister gone , Jen sang softly to herself while she rummaged through the drawers of the bureau . She found the stockings with the black seams at last , done up carefully inssue paper and hidden away under a stack of underwear . he put them on carefully , and then tipped the mirror down end swung her skirt around her knees , admiring her well shaped legs in the sheer chiffon hose with the startling blackams going straight up the backs . Ever since the carnival had been in town Carl had been attracted to the tent of the gypsy fortune teller . He had never had his fortune told , and more than anything else in the world he wanted to have this gypsy woman forecast his future . Butp182as much as he wanted to consult the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly into her tent . He realized that if any of the family ever heard about his going to see her he would never hear the last of it . The trouble was that there were always some of the Veeches in evidence . With the idea of evading them , he had gone uptownright after supper . As he approached the tent , nervously , he came face to face with Dorothy . She looked at him hard , as if she was able to read his secret . He continued to walk past the fortune-telling tent . Next he came upon Josette and Pat Thompson . They had paused before a concession where baseballs were thrown at pyramided wooden milk bottles . Pat was earnestly throwing balls at the bottles while Josette stood by , cool and detached , carrying a particularly gaudy and befeathered doll , a large Scottie dog covered with brilliants , and two canes trimmed with bobbing monkeys on rubber bands , the rewards Pat had already earned for her by applying his strength and skill at various prize-offering concessions on the midway . The sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the family he especially wanted to avoid when he went to the gypsy woman , it was the cool and superior Josette . Carl turned away directly and went to the refreshment stand for a coca cola , feeling that he had had a narrow escape . By the time that Carl dared leave the refreshment booth , Jen , too , had appeared . She was walking arm in arm with the dark and fascinating carnival man , Dick Meyers , deeply engrossed in conversation with him . Jen was looking very lovely ; even Carl stared at her . Her hair was done up with a mass of curls on the top of her head , and the bright lights toned down her make-up to a becoming color . The flowered print dress that she wore showed off her figure to the best advantage , her full breasts , slim waist , and full hips , and every step she took the wide skirt swung becomingly around herp183very lovely legs with the triumphant startling black seams up the back . Dick Meyers was being appropriately sad as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her the story of his life , and all the misunderstandings that he had encountered until he had met her . And he was also pointing out the terriblehardships and disappointments and unstable features of the life with a carnival that made it utterly impossible for a man , out of fairness to the girl he loved , to marry and take  --  wife upon his travels . Jen was being appropriately reasonable and sweetly understanding about the whole thing . The point was that these lengthy conversations involved a great deal of walking up one side of the midway and down the other . Carl abandoned his project temporarily and went into the drug store and dipped into the county library books . When he came out into the street again it was much laterand the carnival was in full swing . After a few more familyencounters , he headed straight for the fortune telling booth , looking neither to the right nor the left . He fingered his fiftypiece and walked in , stooping to enter through the low Inside , the tent was more brightly lighted than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motioned Carlsit in another close in front of her . He sat down and mutelyndcd her his fifty-cent piece . She was smoking a cigarette , d she threw it down , stepped on it and took his hand inboth of hers . She looked incredibly old under the bright , unshadedlight bulb . Her voice was full and rather sweet ande spoke with no accent at all in spite of her dark skin . " Sot want to know the things that are going to happen to youin your life to come , my son , " she said to him , fixing him withher bright beady eyes while she stroked and smoothed hishand . Carl began to feel embarrassed and he wanted to runYou must not be afraid , " she said gently . " That is the most .  |p184im|portant  thing in all your whole life , you must not be afraid . " She read his face rather than his palm expertly . " You are not happy . There is a great unhappiness and sorrow always in you , here , " she touched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be afraid , then this trouble will go away . " She branched out into a more set pattern now . " I see an interesting life for you , a long happy life , with success . Things will not come easy , but you must work and not be afraid . Now you may ask me two questions . Whatever you want to know , I will tell you . " Carl was baffled and self-conscious . Any questions that he could think of , he could not bring himself to ask . She went on deftly , working on what he himself revealed to her so plainly . " You see , you keep things inside of you always , and that is bad . You must learn to let out the things that you carry inside of you , the things that make you unhappy . Speak them in words , do them in deeds , and then you will be happy again . You are not like other people , my son , you are soft , here , " again she touched his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you remember and they make you sad . But you will have a very interesting and successful life far away from this town . " She studied his long slender hand carefully . " You are not made for hard work , " she said . " You are never to work hard with your hands . You are an artist . I see great talent in your palm , it is  --  " she hesitated  --  " Yes , I see it . It is music . You have a great talent for music , is it not so ? " Carl , who could never carry a tune , and who had not even cared to learn to dance , shook his head at her stupidly . " Ah , yes , " she insisted . " I see it there in your hand , a great musical talent . Maybe you have not discovered it yet for yourself , but I see a great talent for music in your hand , and the hand tells everything and never lies , you know . " She changed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her ground . " You are very lonely , are n't you ? Tell me , am I not right ? "  |p185Carl  nodded to her as she fixed him with her bright small eyes . She nodded her head too . " Yes , you are very lonely . You have very few friends . You have not found any girl that you care for . There have been maybe one , maybe two , girls that you have met and at first you thought that you cared for them , but you found out you were wrong . They did not understand you . I am right ? You will meet another girl soon , but she will not be the one for you either . You must beware of her . You do what your heart says , but your heart is wrong . Your heart will be wrong many times , I see it in your hand . You must beware of the things your heart says to you . This girl will make you very unhappy . But some day , not so long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl that you will wally love , and she will love you . I see it in your hand . She will be a very beautiful girl , a blonde-haired girl . I see a long and happy marriage . " You would like to ask a question of me , now , maybe ? No ? Well , then , I can tell you no more . Good-bye , and God blessni . " And for the interests of her business , she added , " Do of discuss the things that I have spoken to you with anyone . " Josette and Pat Thompson had left the carnival somewhat rlicr than Carl did . Josette had been bored with it all . She d been thankful also that she had not had to encounter idge Clark and her friends there . Pat had gone about doingc carnival methodically , as he always did everything . Hed started on one side of the midway and worked down from ncession to concession , urging Josette to participate in everying , which she usually refused to do . He loaded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again on the other c and worked his way up to where they had started . They k the merry-go-round stolidly , and Josette consented too on the midget automobile ride and the ferris wheel . Shed declined to ride the " tilt-a-whirl , " however , and she hadp186not allowed Pat to stop at the roulette wheel . They did not talk much , nor have a conspicuously merry time of it . After they had covered all the attractions the carnival had to offer , Pat gravely escorted Josette into the drug store and bought her a chocolate soda . They ended the evening with playing bingo again , and Pat won a blanket . He presented it to Josette , but she declined to accept it , saying that he should keep such a valuable prize for himself . Pat folded the blanket , put it on the seat beside him and ordered three more cards . After spendingabout a dollar for bingo cards , he was able to win Josette a blanket of her own . They got up then , collected their various prizes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking old porch swing , rocking placidly back and forth in the darkness . Pat apparently was at a loss for words . " I have n't seen you so much lately , " he began . " I know , " Josette said . " I 've been awfully busy . It is n't easy to keep up all the school work I have to do this hot weather . " " I know it , " Pat said . " It 's the same way with me , and the work I 'm doing in the trade school . How are you getting along in business college ? " Josette did not dislike Pat . She rather admired his obvious good qualities , industry , steadiness , neatness , orderliness and good character . His interest in her and her affairs touched her . At the moment she felt kindly toward him , and she was seized by a desire to confide in him . " Oh , I 'm not getting along at all . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pretty good at typing , and business law , and things like that . But I 'm not a bit good in shorthand , and bookkeeping , and accounting . I just do n't know what I 'll do , if I do n't start doing better work pretty soon . I have n't got nearly enough credits to be admitted to the second class , and the time limit that you can stay on up there in the first class is just about over . I worry about it so , but I just ca n't help it . "  |p187Pat  nodded in the darkness , but the ready sympathy that she had expected was not forthcoming . " Well , I tell you , " he said hesitantly . " I do n't believe you were ever cut out to be a business woman anyway , Josette . " She was stung by his lack of sympathy and understanding . " I do n't see why you say that . I do n't see what you mean . Why am I not cut out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make good up there . I 've got to do something . I 've got to get some kind of a job , and I 'd rather work in an office than almost any other place . " " Why have you got to get a job ? " Pat asked baldly . " Oh , that 's a silly question . I 've got to get a job some place and be self-supporting . I want to get out of this town and away from here . " " Why , Josette ? " " Because I just ca n't stand it to live here another day , that 's why . Pat weighed her words carefully , and interpreted them after is limited understanding . " I know what you mean , Josette . I now how you must feel . It is n't pleasant for you living here t home . And then your family  --  the way they are , they . . . " he hesitated , floundering out of consideration for her . " Your mily  --  always  --  getting into trouble and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often criticized her family to herself , and anted them entirely for the unfavorable position she held in the town , she did not like to hear Pat Thompson speak of in disparagingly . She instantly switched off , cold and dish . She was sorry that she had confided to him her difficulties school . Pat went on talking awkwardly . " You know I got another se , Josette . I told you about it . It do n't amount to much , course , but I 'm going to get a better job up there to the ships . I 'm bound to . The foreman talked to me just the other y . I 'm to be transferred again the last of next month . That'llp188mean another raise . I wo n't be making so much , but every little raise like that counts up . In another year , I 'll be making pretty good money . " " That 's fine , Pat , " Josette said automatically , without thinking of what he was trying to say to her , only wishing that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I mean is , " Pat went on doggedly , " as long as I am all set the way I am , I do n't see what you have to worry about . If I were you , I 'd just quit up there to business college and come on home here for awhile . I think you 're working too hard , you look so tired and worried . I 'd a lot rather that you just stay home here and rest . I had n't really planned on anything before next year , but if you ca n't stand it to stay home here , why , we could do it sooner . We could buy all the furniturewe want right away , and pay for it on the instalment plan . I would n't like to do that so well , but we can , if you want to . I 've got quite a little money saved up in the bank , besides . We could get married any time you say , just as soon as you want to . Josette listened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to her possessively , taking their marriageas a matter of course , when never once had he openly asked her to marry him . She was so astonished that she spoke more sharply than she meant to . " Well , I wo n't do any such a thing , Pat Thompson . I wo n't give up going to school . I 'll get along up there , someway . I 'm not going to quit and come home here . And I do n't care how much money you 're making , nor how much money you have in the bank , nor what you are planning on doing next year . " " You see , " Pat said . " You 're so nervous and worried all the time that you do n't even talk and act like yourself any more . " Josette searched her mind for anything that she had ever done or said to Pat Thompson that gave him the idea that she was going to marry him . The whole thing seemed ridiculousp189and unromantic to her . " Pat , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said angrily . " I 'm not tired and worried , or , if I am , it does n't change the way I feel about things . I do n't know where you get such ideas about me . I would n't marry you if you were the last man on earth . " Once the words were out of her mouth , she was a little sorry . She had not meant to be so open and abrupt about the whole matter . She had not meant to make Pat feel hurt and angry . Pat got up out of the swing . " Well , there 's no use of us talking any more about it tonight . You 're just all tired out and upset from worrying . I wo n't bother you about it any more , osette . But you know the way I feel about you . I do n't thinknull be able to stay up there to school very much longer , andlien they wo n't let you stay up there any more , why , younow that all you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry , because I 'll take care of you then . " He touchedthe side of her face timidly with his hand , and then he walkeddown from the porch and up the street . He had left his blanketIn the bingo game in the porch swing . " Pat , you forgot your blanket , " Josette said mechanically. 1 Ic returned to the porch for it . " Good night , Josette , " he id gravely to her . After he was gone , Josette sat still in the porch swing . There s a sprinkling of rain coming down , rattling on the leaves , a cool breeze touched her face . She leaned back in the rig and closed her eyes . For a moment she felt bewildered close to tears . She would not admit the gratitude she felt ause he wanted to take care of her and make things easy her . But the anger , the bright blind anger came afterward. hated Pat Thompson , she thought , she hated him for the g way in which he disposed of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of business college , and then , wordless of how she felt about him , she would be only tooto marry him to solve her problems . And the worst of it s that in all probability she would flunk out of businessp190college just as he prophesied . Well , whatever she did in that eventuality , Josette told herself grimly , the very last thing she would do would be to marry Pat Thompson . She did not know what would become of her and she did not much care , but she would never , never marry Pat Thompson . She made the resolveover and over again . Never , never would she humble herself to him and come to him and say , " Pat , it is all as you expected it . I flunked out of school and I ca n't get a job and I ca n't stand it to live here to home any more with my family , so please will you marry me right away ? "  | SUNDAY was traditionally a day given over to sleep and rest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her accustomed hour to care for Jud , the rest of the family re rained in bed until almost noon . Sam came downstairs early and got the Sunday paper off the front porch and a handful of crackers and went back to bed again . Josette awoke early and passed the time away studying in bed . The bright clear morning lightened her mood considerably . She decided to get up and go to church , and take Dorothy along with her for the Sunday school hour . She dressed quickly , went downstairs and unfolded her plans toapproving Molly . At least once a month Josette was in thehit of attending church , accompanied by a silent , uncomplainingDorothy . Molly went about preparing the usual elaborate Sunday breakfast of eggs and bacon , coffee , cinnamon rolls , molasses kies and orange marmalade . When she had it on the table c called the family down . There was still another convention connected with Sunday morning breakfast . It was the one al of the week when it was permissible to come to the table almost any stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This morning , Mary appeared in a negligeeAnil mules , and Kenny and Carl did not bother to don shirts . As the meal drew to its leisurely close , Josette and Dorothy me in , carrying Sunday school quarterlies and papers and cards.  |p192Molly  got up to pour hot coffee for them , and to fry more eggs and bacon . Kenny and Mary lit cigarettes over second cups of coffee and everybody lingered at the table . " Well , where you been so early in the morning ? " Kenny asked Dorothy affectionately as the little girl slid into her chair beside his . " Church , " she said . " Well , ai n't that something , " Kenny said , sharing his amusementwith Mary across the table . " Ai n't that something . Did you pray for me ? " Before the child could answer Josette spoke sharply . " Now do n't tease her like that and make fun of it . It 's nice for her to go up there and be in the Sunday school class with the other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , listen to who 's here , " Kenny said sneeringly . " I supposeall Dorothy 's got ta do is go to church and grow up like her aunt and then she 'll be a regular angel with wings . " But Josette was in a rare good humor this noon . She did not bother to reply to Kenny . To his astonishment , she only laughed at him . Carl 's reaction was different . Josette had the power to make him feel choked and suffocated with helpless rage . He could not endure her flaunted superiority over the family . He sought around in his mind for something to say to her that would hurt her . The words sputtered out of his mouth . " Well , I hear Midge Clark dropped you cold now she 's got friends visiting her from east . " " That 's all you know about it , " Josette said triumphantly . " Midge is not the kind of a girl that drops anybody . I was talking with her just this morning when I came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . She invited me to meet her friends and go over to a dance at the Westbridge Country Club next Wednesday night . "  |p193The  family was properly surprised , and Josette smiled triumphantly at all of them . " For Lord 's sakes , " Molly said . " Are you gon na go ? " " Certainly I am . " " Well , I do n't see how you can , " her mother said practically . " You ai n't got no clothes swell enough to wear to such a place as that . " " You have been promising me the money all summer for a cw dress , " Josette said , talking rapidly . " And I do n't see whyca n't have the money now . I can get me a dress to wear , some afternoon up to Ashbury . I 've got to have a new dress , anyway . I have n't had a single new thing to wear all summer . en got a new dress , but I have n't had a thing . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I been intending to give you the money to get you dress , " Molly said , " but I do n't see no sense in letting you buy a swell fancy party dress just to wear over there , and en hang it away in your closet and not wear it again . " " I do n't have to buy any fancy party dress , just to wear to dance in the summertime , " Josette said . " I 'll just get an ordinary pretty dress that I can wear when I go out all the rest the summer . " " You ca n't go to no place like that in just any ordinary ss , " Molly said . " Why do n't you wear that dress you had the prom when you graduated from high school ? It 's just Bing up there in the closet rotting away . You ai n't neverit on since that prom . If you want a fancy party dress why ' t you wear that one ? " he vision of the peach-colored dowdy organdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in that dress any place . I ' t want to buy a long dress . I just want to buy an ordinary dress-up dress . You do n't have to have a formal just for a dance the summertime . " " Well , I guess you 'll find out , " Molly said.  |p194At  that moment Jen burst into the kitchen , all out of breath from running . She sat down immediately and began to cry loudly . " For Lord 's sakes , what is the matter with you ? " Molly demandedcrossly . " Mr. Higgins is sleeping . You want to wake him up ? What you bawling about ? " " Franny 's awful sick , " Jen sobbed . " She is ! Why , what 's the matter with her ? " " I do n't know . " Jen sobbed . " She was awful sick this morning . They took her up to Ashbury to the doctor right away and her father just phoned back and he said they took her right over to the hospital . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just about one thing that 's likely to be wrong with a girl like Frances Cope . " " Shut your mouth ! " Jen screamed at her . " For Christ 's sake , Jo , " Kenny said . He turned his chair around to Jen and put his hand on her shoulder . She sat doubled up in the chair with her face hidden in her hands . " There , now , " he said . " Quit crying so , honey , and tell us about Franny . I did n't even know there was nothing wrong with her . I seen her running around downtown pretty near every day . " Jen muzzled her face against Kenny 's bare arm , smearing off the tears , gratefully . She stopped crying and sat up straight in the chair . Her lips and her wet eyelids were still twitching a little . She had not bothered to put cosmetics on her face , and her hair was still pinned tight to the top of her head uncombed . She looked sad and wretched and altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , " she explained . " She 's been having the awfulest headaches , and everything . I could just tell she was feeling rotten , but I could n't get her to go see a doctor , or nothing . Last night we went to the dance after the carnival and Franny was n't feeling goodp195then . We come home late and went to bed and when we woke up this morning , Franny was bad sick . " " Well , how did she act ? " Molly asked impatiently . " What was wrong with her ? She was n't broke out or nothing , was she ? I sure hope she ai n't got something that 's catching , you over there all the time and sleeping with her . " Jen 's eyes widened and she spoke in a horror-stricken voice . " She was swelled up just terrible . All swelled up , her face and her neck , and her arms and legs and hands . It was awful , she looked just terrible . She was just about scared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away . And he just phoned back and said they took her right to the hospital , to put her under observation , he said . I 'm so worried about her that I do n't know what to do . " Jen 's words called up a peculiarly sickening vision to Carl 's eyes . He saw in a flash Fran Cope 's beautiful face and body bloated up like balloons . He thought it was monstrous that something like this should happen to her . " Oh , well , " Molly comforted , " it probably ai n't nothing very serious . It sounds to me like she 's got some kind of kidney trouble . There ai n't no sense you letting yourself get so upset over it . Come on here to the table and eat some breakfastbefore you get sick yourself . " Dorothy stared at Jen . She too had a bright mental imageFran swelled up into a grotesque balloon . She found it very interesting . It was on the tip of her tongue to ask if Fran had been drinking whiskey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , but the presence of her mother silenced her . Dorothy was afraid of her mother . She was afraid of herother 's long silences and of her infrequent scoldings . She thought of it , and kept her questions to herself . Jen began to eat listlessly and Josette reverted to the topic of the discussion that Jen had interrupted . " Well , are you goingto give me the money for a new dress , or are n't you ? " she asked her mother baldly. 195 " Lord , you still harping about a new dress ? Well , we 'll see . We got lots of time to talk it over yet . There ai n't nothing that has to be settled right this minute I guess . " Josette was uneasy about the matter of her new dress being shelved by her mother . She left the table and went up to her room , her mind still busy with various ways and means of raising money to buy the dress . Just at the moment that she was considering selling , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift from the family , she heard a tap on the door and it opened . Mary stood in the doorway . Josette stared at her in surprise . The light from the hall showed the outlines of her body through the filmy negligee that she wore , a beautiful garment , beige and topaz in color , almost the color of the unusual shadows around her eyes . " I was thinking about you going to that dance out at Westbridge , " Mary said , in her low even voice . " Ma 's right ; you could n't wear an ordinary afternoon dress out there . All the other girls will have summer formals . " " Will they ? " Josette said in spontaneous surprise . The next moment she was covered with confusion . It was never easy for Josette to be trapped into admitting that she did not really know all about everything that concerned her . In her confusionshe said , " I did n't know that . Of course , then , I had n't better go . I 'll tell Midge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't know it was a place like that . I 'll let Midge know about it right away . " " No , " Mary said surprisingly . " I think it would be a good idea if you went . But do n't say anything more to Ma about getting a dress . " Josette stared at her , amazed by her words . " Do you have classes tomorrow afternoon ? " Mary asked . Josette shook her head . " Well , then , tomorrow afternoon you go over to the Julia Forbes shop . Do you know where it is ? It 's a dress shop . " Josette shook her head again stupidly.  | " Well , it 's in the first floor of the Willis Hotel Building . You go over there tomorrow afternoon and tell Julia that I sent you , and she 'll help you pick out a dress . Maybe it will have to be fitted , so that 's why you better go over there tomorrow afternoon . " " But , Mary . . . " Josette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and the alterations to my accountthere . You can call it a birthday present from me , " Mary said gently . " I guess you 'd rather have a birthday present now than in November . " She went as quickly as she came , and Josette sat down weakly on the edge of the bed . Mary was the last person she would have thought of turning to in a crisis such as this . She was touched and pleased by Mary 's understanding and generosity . She could not explain how it happened that Mary was able to understand just how much it meant to her to be able to go to the dance with Midge and her friends appropriately clothed . Josette took it as a good omen . The fates were with Iwr , she thought . Perhaps this was to be some momentous turning point in her life . She wondered which one of the three young men she had seen with Midge would be the one that she was to be paired with . But as she thought about NI cry 's unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that compelledher to accept aid from Mary . It was nice of Mary to h , t the dress for her , Josette admitted , but it did not change what Mary was . She could not like and accept Mary . She supposed that Lew Lentz paid Mary 's bills and the thought sickened her . Her dress was not to come from Mary at all , but from Lew Lentz . She was somehow making herself a partythe unholy alliance between that man and her sister . Josette raged at the circumstances that left her no choice . But the dance was more important to her at the moment than was her pride.  |p198THE  next day Josette selected her dress from the shop Mary had sent her to , and after that the time crept by slowly . The day of the dance , Wednesday , turned out to be a busy one for the Veeches . Jud woke up early in the morning and insisted that he was dying . He poured a stream of abuse upon the family because they would not call a doctor and accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all day long , refusing to eat , lying with his eyes closed , and panting for breath occasionally , when he thought of it . By afternoon he began to demand a minister . He had never been baptized , he said , and with death at hand it was well to take care of things like that . Molly at last became unnerved by his performance . She telephoned the doctor from the neighbor 's , and the doctor assured her curtly that Jud was not dying . He suggested that it would be better for Jud if the family left him alone until his tantrum had spent itself . But Molly was a little doubtful . By supper time her mind was made up . Jen had gone up to Ashbury to the hospital that afternoon with the Copes and had not yet returned . Molly got supper herself , and while she moved silently and heavily around the kitchen , Jud continued to splutter and rage in the bedroom . When the family gatheredat the supper table , Molly announced her decision to them . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . After a moment 's silence Kenny turned to Josette . " Well , so tonight 's the night we step out in high society with all the swells , huh ? " Josette , of course , ignored him completely . " God , " Carl said , " we wo n't be able to live with her for two weeks after this . " " Well , sir , " Molly said . " I think Josie is an awful lucky girl . Mary bought her a beautiful dress , and shoes and a little spangled pocketbook and everything to go with it . I should think she 'd be awful nice to her sister after this . If it had n't been for Mary she could n't even have gone . " " Mary bought her a dress , huh ? " Kenny said interestedly . " Well , I 'll say she did , " Molly answered . " The swellest dress I ever laid an eye on in my life . " Jen came into the kitchen so silently that they never noticed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord , " Molly said to her . " It 's about time you was coming home here . I tell you , you 're gon na have to turn over a new leaf around here , young woman , gone all day long and every : light , too . If you 're just going to sit around and expect us to feed and clothe you , you 're going to help do the work around here . If that 's the way you 're going to do business , you might just as well take your clothes and go on up to Cope 's and stay there . " Jen put a spoonful of cold , greasy warmed-over potatoes on her plate silently , and a piece of bologna beside it . She was strangely quiet . She did not seem to hear a word that her mother had spoken to her . Her face looked pale and pinched under her bright make-up and there was a sort of frozen stillnessall through her . She handled her fork clumsily , as if she could not even feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing straight ahead of her . " Say , " Kenny said with concern in his voice , " how 's tinny ? " She turned to him listlessly and her voice was a low monoc . " They 're going to operate on her tomorrow afternoon . " 199 " Operate ! " Molly said . " Why , what in the world 's the matter with her ? Has she got to have her appendix out ? " " They 're going to operate on her head , " Jen said slowly . " They cut every bit of hair off from her head . They thought maybe they was going to operate this afternoon , but they had to send away for a special doctor , and he ca n't come till tomorrow afternoon . " " Her head , " Molly said in horror . " What they got to operate on her head for ? It ai n't a mastoid , is it ? " Jen looked at her mother , and her voice and face were expressionlessand numbed . " They say she 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus ! " Kenny said . " For Lord 's sakes , I never hearda such a thing , " Molly said . " You mean they 're going to cut her head right open and go cutting around in her brain ? " Kenny put his hand over Jen 's . " Oh , hell , them surgeons can do anything nowadays . You read about brain surgery all the time . I know a guy right up to Ashbury myself that 's running around just as good as ever with a great big silver plate up there in his head . " " They do n't think she can live through no such a thing as that do they ? " Molly asked . " They say she can , " Jen said wearily . " They say she ca n't live at all , if they ca n't get that tumor out of there quick . " " Poor little kid , " Kenny said . " They ai n't told her about it , have they ? " Jen nodded . " They explained it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about it than her folks do , even . " " How 's she taking it ? " Kenny asked curiously . For the first time Jen seemed to come alive and there was real feeling in her voice when she answered him . " She 's being just wonderful about it . I do n't see how she can be . If it was me , I 'd just die right there thinking about it . If she 's scared , she ai n't letting on . She says she wants to get well so bad thatP201if this is what they got to do to fix her up , why , it 's all right with her . Today she was even joking about ' em cutting her hair all off . She was laughing about that when we come away tonight . She says that it 's a good thing them baby-style hairdo'sare in style now , ' cause then she 'll look all right when she gets out of the hospital while her hair 's growin ' back . " " Atta girl , " Kenny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . That takes a lot of guts . Franny 's a swell little girl . You tell her tomorrow what I said . Tell her I 'm betting on her any time . " Jen 's face was softer and living again . " I 'll tell her . She was talking about you today , Kenny . She said that if you could go through an awful automobile smash like you did and walk out of ' it , why , she guesses no little old operation is going to get her down . " " Why , sure , " he said . " You just watch , she 'll come through this a-flying . They could n't kill off folks like Fran and me if they tried . " " Only the good die young , " Josette said hollowly from across the table . Kenny burst out into warm spontaneous laugnter , throwing his head back , and resting his hand on Jen 's shoulder in a comradely fashion . " Well , you said a mouthful that time ! " en joined in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Kenny made an effort to draw Jen out of herself . " Boy , willu look at your kid sister over there with her hair all done up on curlers , so 's she 'll look pretty . She 's stepping out in high Society tonight , right . " I le turned to Jen and spoke in a squeaky simpering voice With an exaggerated accent . " O0000h , Miss Veech , may I have e next dance ? " Jen stuck her chin up high in the air , pursed her lips , and answered him elaborately . " Well , I think that you might , Mr. Rockefeller , seeing that it 's you . " P202They got up and danced stiffly and sedately around the kitchen , Kenny holding her away from him at arm 's length , and Jen dancing with her head up high in the air and her eyes tight closed . Amid the laughter , Josette got up from the table , banged her chair back and walked out of the kitchen . " Hey , Josie , " Kenny yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them society boys do n't put knockout drops in your liquor tonight ! " A car stopped out in front and they all straightened up in their chairs nervously . But it was Ernie who came up the porch steps . ' Why , hello there , stranger , " Molly said to him affectionately . " Where you been hiding ? We ai n't seen you in a coons age . " Oh , hell , " Ernie said gloomily . " I been having the damndesttoothache , last couple of days . " " Toothache ! " his mother said attentively . " For Lord 's sakes , why do n't you lay off work and go on up there to Ashbury and have it out ? " " Well , I been meaning to , but we been so God-damn busy out there on the road . " " We got some oil of cloves around here , ai n't we ? " Sam said . ' Why do n't you put some of that on it ? That 'll cure a toothache quicker'n anything I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ernie said . " I like to burn the whole inside of my mouth out , and that tooth just kept right on a-jumpin ' and tearing right through my whole head . I never seen nothing like it . " " Well , it 's a shame , " Molly said . " I do n't see how you can stay out there and try to work with a tooth a-going it like that . " Immediately after supper , Molly went over to the neighbor'stelephone and called up the Reverend Mr. Bradley , whoP203told her that he would come over right away , that in such circumstances he was only too glad to do what he could . When Molly came back to the house with the news , the up still around the kitchen table disintegrated rapidly . ny left the house on the spot . Jen slipped away to her doom . Upstairs Josette turned and posed before the mirror overthe bureau while the light sparkled down the length and cadth of her long full skirt . Jen sat hunched on the foot of bed staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she id tremulously . " That 's the swellest dress I ever saw in mylife outside of the movies . Honest , Jo , you look swell . I can it . " Josette was warm and vibrant and softened with excitement . She turned this way and that , moving her arms , admiring her both bare back , admiring her skin and hair , admiring the im well-fitted lines of her gown . " Does the skirt hang all ht ? " she asked anxiously , preoccupied only with her reflec-n in the mirror . " Is the skirt even all the way around ? Itis n't too long , is it ? How does the skirt look ? " Jen stared at the skirt obediently . " Turn around , no , the nt again . The skirt 's all right . " Josette turned back to the mirror , and promptly lost herself her own reflection , spreading out the skirt with both hands , d standing on tiptoe , as if by so doing she would be able to bring the hem of her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau . " Gee , " Jen said forlornly from the bed , " I wish to God Franny could see you . Honest , she 'd go nuts if she ever saw as like this . She was always crazy to buy a formal . She used always say she wanted one just so she could put it on and look at herself wearing it in the mirror whenever she wanted Do n't it seem just terrible to think that maybe after to- P204tomorrow Franny wo n't never be . . . I just ca n't stand thinking about it . " " Look , " Josette said abstractedly , " are you sure the skirt 's all right ? It feels just like it 's longer in the front . Are you sure it 's all right ? " Jen sighed a little and got up from the bed . " Jo , will you take it easy ? I told you , that skirt looks perfectly all right . The whole dress looks swell . You look just beautiful , your hair , and everything . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers look sick . So for God 's sake , take it easy . You 're so nervous and excited you 're just about ready to fly to pieces . " Do n't be silly ! I 'm not the least bit nervous , " Josette said rapidly , peeping at her skirt hem . " I never felt better in my life . Why in the world should I be nervous ? Look , I 'm positive this skirt is just a little bit longer right in the front . " Jen stuck her hands out in front of her , palms upward , and rolled her eyes to the ceiling . " Baby , I 'm glad you do n't get invited out to Westbridge every night . " She brought the chair from across the room and put it in front of the bureau . " Here , Jo , " she said wearily , " if you stand on this you can see the bottom of the skirt . Be careful with your dress climbing up there . " Josette lifted her skirt carefully , and Jen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down her skirt again over the gleaming golden-bronze slippers . " Now are you satisfied ? " Jen said . " It does hang all right , does n't it ? " Josette marveled . " It fits just perfectly , does n't it ? " The sound of an automobile motor in front of the house sent Josette skipping down from the chair in front of the mirror . " For God 's sakes , " Jen said . " Be careful ! You want to rip that dress before you ever get out of the house in it ? " " Who 's out there ? " Josette said nervously , peeping around the window shade . " I heard a car . Is that Midge already ? " P205Both girls listened attentively . As a matter of fact , the automobilethat they heard was that of Reverend Bradley who wasjust making his departure . In the excitement of Josette'stoilet both of them had forgotten all about his visit . " No , it just must have been some car going by . Hear it ing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and fingered gain her sequined evening bag and the fluffy golden-colored ngora wrap that she had laid out in preparation for her derture . Then she returned to the mirror restlessly and dabbed wder onto the tip of her nose . " Do n't you think my hair ks awfully plain ? " she said to Jen anxiously . " Do you think could comb it any different ? You know I 've got that goldcoloredartificial flower that was on that brown dress I had st winter . Do you think I 'd look better if I pinned that in y hair , right here  --  or here , maybe . " " No , " Jen said decisively . " You do n't want to go sticking thing in your hair . Your hair looks just right , all plain and ft and shiny . You leave it alone . " " Lots of the girls wear something in their hair though , a Ivet bow , or flowers or clips or something . " " With this dress , you do n't want nothing in your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I can tell ? It 's like I ays do when I 'm dressing up for some special date or somengmyself . I always try to figure out what Mary would if she was wearing what I got to wear . It works every time. can just see Mary wearing this dress and I know she would n't sticking nothing in her hair . " Josette was not pleased by Jen 's words . She had a swifton herself of Mary wearing this dress , and the comparisont she instinctively made was not too flattering to herself. c wished suddenly that she could possess , just for tonight , Mary 's beautiful quiet poise . She was nervous , she admitted suddenly , and afraid . She made a great effort to steady her- P206self . She deliberately pushed the throbbing , quivering excitementout of her voice . " Do you suppose he 'll buy you a corsage ? " Jen asked her . " I 'm sure I would n't know , " Josette said coldly . She was herself again , she thought . This was far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you come on downstairs and show Ma and Ernie your dress and everything ? " " No , I do n't want to . They can see me when I leave . " This recaptured calm of hers was too precious to Josette for her to risk losing under the battery of family admiration or criticism . Josette folded her hands together and stared at herself in the mirror until her reflection blurred before her eyes . Jen took up a position at the window where she could look out to the front of the house . And as they both waited the two cars drove up together at last , tearing the soft summer darkness apart with blaring horns . " I guess there they are , " Jen said , her own voice trembling with excitement . Josette 's face paled a little , and the worry lines etched deeper across her smooth forehead . Her hands were clumsy and icy cold . " Here , " Jen said , " let me help you with that jacket . " Josette straightened it across her shoulders and grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Molly called up the stairway in a strange and artificial voice . The sisters exchanged amused glances of comprehension , and giggled together involuntarily . Jen squeezed Josette 's hand tight in her warm one as Josette flew toward the door . " Josie , you look swell . Be careful of your dress going downstairs . Have a good time , wo n't you ? " The family down below caught only a glimpse of Josette , the half dozen steps or so from the stairway to the front porch where Midge Clark and Johnnie Meredith waited , only a P207glimpse of the color and sheen of her gown and of her eager smile , and then she was gone . " Josie 's sure all togged out like high society tonight , ai n't she ? " Ernie said , incoherently , packing the cotton tighter around his aching tooth with a toothpick . " She sure is , " his mother said . " Lord , if she did n't look funny all dressed up like that ! Them long dresses make the girls so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful nice of Mary to buy her that outfit . Her heart was just set on going to that dance tonight right away she got asked , but if it had n't a-been for Mary she never could a-gone . " Ernie grunted a little , his eyes shut and his mouth open wide to facilitate the work with the toothpick around his tooth . Molly glanced at him quickly and went on talking over the leisurely squeak of her rocker . " Josie 's an awful lucky girl to have a sister and a brother to help her like she 's got . Sending her up there to business college is going to be a great thing for her , all right . " " Oh , hell , " Ernie said modestly , snapping the toothpick between his fingers . " Josie 's a smart kid ; she 's got a right to go to school . It ai n't nothing special for me to send her up there . " " Yes , it is too , Ernie , " Molly insisted . " It 's an awful fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'll tell you , " Ernie leaned forward in his chair close to Molly . " I figure it this way , Ma  --  some day me and you are gon na be real proud of Josie . " " You bet we are , " Molly assented . Sam moved the sheets of his newspaper noisily . " Say , where 's that feller from , that Josie 's gone out with tonight ? " " Well , sir , " Molly was saying , " I think Josie made a whole sight prettier and trimmer-looking girl than that Clark girl did in that blue dress without no shoulder straps she had on . " And in the corner , Dorothy walked up and down slowly , with her head up and the great full skirt of her imaginary gown trailing the floor behind her .  |p208Once  settled in the front seat of the roadster at Johnnie Meredith 's side , Josette relaxed a little . Johnnie Meredith was no terrifying person after all , she decided , studying his profile covertly . He was just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell that he came from a good family , and that he had money . He did not seem inclined to be talkative . He looked almost as if he were sulking , Josette thought . She attributed his mood to the fact that Midge was going to the dance with his cousin Philip , instead of with Johnnie himself , and that Midge looked particularly desirable and beautiful tonight . She felt a little sorry for Johnnie Meredith . She felt suddenly strong and sure of herself , and superior and poised . Tonight she was not just Josette Veech who was trying to run away from a down-at-the-heel existence , but insteadshe was just any girl meeting any man , just any girl like Midge or Sally , pretty and well dressed , a girl for a man to admire and respect . " You 're from the East , are n't you ? " she said to Johnnie Meredith , in a polite , well-modulated voice . " Uh huh , Massachusetts . " Josette tried another tack , experimentally . " Are you going back to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his eyes off the road and stared at her , surprised that even for conversational purposes she might doubt that he would attend his college in the fall again . When he looked at her , Josette smiled at him encouragingly . " You 're lucky to be having a vacation , " she said to him . " I go to business college , you know , and I 've been having classes all summer . Johnnie Meredith seemingly found her smile attractive . He smiled back at her and said , " Yeah ? Tough having to go to classes this weather , all right . I know . I took summer school the year I was a freshman . " He flapped open his cigarette case in front of her . " Cigarette ? " " No , thank you , " Josette said gaily . They were off to aP209good start , she thought . She had made him look at her and talk to her , and he was interested , she could tell . She felt excitedand confident . Ile was looking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her eyes drop along the breadth of his wide shoulders . " Do you play on the football team at college ? " she laid . Johnnie Meredith was obviously pleased . " No , I never wentt for football . That 's one game I do n't care so much about . f course , they 're always after me trying to get me to go outr the team , but I do n't care a thing about it . They have wful strict training rules , anyway . " " I imagine they do , " Josette said politely , wondering what to nature of training rules could be . She tidied her hair down , s the wind blowing in over the low windshield and the back f the roadster disarranged it . She liked the motion of the car . he had never ridden in a roadster before . She liked the looks Johnnie Meredith in a white coat behind the wheel , in the ft summer darkness . She liked to think that she , Josette screech , in a gold-colored dress , was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this , she told herself , was st a sample of the kind of life she had a right to , the kind of that she was going to have . This was the preview of the w world that she was to have ; the world where people had money and wore good clothes , and where everybody was goodd decent and had nothing to be ashamed of , the world here there was love and romance , and where life moved lily and smoothly . Because she felt so good , Josette did something that she had er done before in all of her life . She tipped her face up to the rush of air over the car , to the sky above , and pointed th one hand . " Oh , look , " she said in a warm glad voice to Johnnie Meredith , " there must be a million stars ! " " A million trillion , " he said cheerfully . He took his eyes ny from the bright strip of highway between the dark hills P210for a moment , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes on her face , and before her eyes all the stars flared up into victory torches , and bleared together in a flaming sky . What if Johnnie Meredith should fall in love with her , Josette asked herself excitedly . It had been known to happen before ; love at first sight . Suppose that he should really fall in love with her , why , then , tonight would be the real turning point in her life . She thought of Pat Thompson suddenly , with scorn . The joke was going to be on Pat , who thought that she belonged to him , that she would marry him because she could do no better . The bright scorn for Pat went through her as bitter and sharp as rusted needles . Come a rain storm  --  put your rubbers on your feet , Come a snow storm  --  you can get a little heat , Come love  --  nothing can be done ... " Johnnie Meredith was chanting over the smooth sound of the motor , driving with one eye on the will-o ' - the- wisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , ahead of them . When Josette and Johnnie returned to the car several hours later , Josette was in a different mood . The dance was a blur in her mind , a blur of a crowded , shining dance floor , several score of dresses at least as lovely as her own , muted rhythmic music . She had danced nearly every dance , most of them with Johnnie . She had found him the best dancer she had ever danced with , but he shifted continually from one new step to another , most of them unknown to Josette . It had required a great deal of concentration on her part to follow him . She had given up conversation altogether , and concentrated on her dancing , with the worry lines deep in her forehead . Several times they had traded dances with Ted and Sally . They had not , however , traded any dances with Philip and Midge , he cause after the first couple of dances Philip and Midge hadP211disappeared from the floor and did not reappear . Josette hardly noticed their absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she became more accustomed to Johnnie 's erratic style , so that she was free to observe and to think again , she began to wonder about their absence . Josette felt momentarily much older and wiser than Midge in the affairs of the world . She wished that she dared suggest to Johnnie Meredith that they go to look for Midge and Philip . Whenever Josette and Johnnie had not danced , they sat at one of the little tables in the crowded bar . Josette ordered ingerale each time , or merely sat and waited while Johnnie rank his cocktail . As the trips to the bar increased , Josette began to feel slightly apprehensive . It did not once occur to her that Johnnie might become drunk . She was aware that he was becoming very silent , very taut and contained , that his dancing was becoming more precise and complicated , that he had taken to holding her much tighter as they danced , but Josette did not think of attributing that to the liquor he had been drinking . She thought at first , romantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Philip . Then she came to the conclusion that , after all , she did not know Johnnie Meredith very well ; this might very possibly be his more normal personality . She was somewhat disappointed by the transformation in him , but at the same time it interested her . When Johnnie had suggested to her some time later that they go outside where it was cooler , Josette had consented gladly . They left the loud music and the lights behind them . They strolled down the length of the long verandah slowly , and down the steps into the shining white sand of the beach along the lake front . The country club was set on the very edge of the lake . It was a large lake with a wide strip of sandy beach and many trees behind the beach . The bright moon this night turned the gentle limpid water luminous . Josette saw none of thisP212beauty before her ; she was conscious only of Johnnie Meredithwho walked at her side . When he reached out and took her hand in his , she closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly in the thick sand , along the edge of the shining water of the lake . Here and there they caught glimpses of other couples who , like themselves , had deserted the blatant efforts of the sweating orchestra inside . They heard their voices , sudden words , low spoken , broken off , saw the rosy tips of their cigarettes . The air was soft and warm , and filled with the sound of the waves on the beach , and the insects of the night , the leaves of the trees stirring in the breeze , the faint sound of the music from inside . " You do n't want to get sand in your shoes . Let 's go over to where the car is , huh ? " Johnnie said suddenly , his voice tuned low , blended into the humming muted harmony of the sounds around them . " All right , " Josette said . There was a path from the beach to the top of the hill where the roadster was parked under the pine trees . They climbed together , hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the atmosphere of the night , the warm clasp of his hand , the uneven earth under her high heels that made her lose her balance and stumble against him , quick casual contacts of their two bodies ; the feel of her silken skirt in her hand as she held it up carefully so that she might not catch it on any of the underbrush along the path , and the thought constantly in the back of her mind that this place was Westbridge Country Club , and that she , Josette Veech , had come to dance here , in a golden dress down to the floor , like other girls did . Johnnie opened the door , and Josette got in , sitting carefully , so that her skirt would not wrinkle . He slammed the door , and went around to the other side and sat on the deep leather seat beside her . P213From the hill under the dark shadow of the pines , they could look down across the roof of the club building , across white sand , across water that was shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the great moon over them . " God ! " Johnnie Meredith said softly . " We 're sitting on top of the world . " Josette did not know exactly what he meant , and everythingbefore her eyes was a blur , waves of blur in rhythm to her heartbeats , and so she only nodded . Johnnie took his eyes away from the lake down below them and looked at Josette  --  looked at her for a long time . She stirred a little under his gaze , half uncertain , half embarrassed by his steady , unwinking eyes . He said to her softly , " What 's the matter ? I 'll bet you did get sand in your shoes , did n't you ? " " A little , " Josette said . " It does n't matter . " As a matter of fact she had no idea whether or not the sand had crept up into her sandals ; she could not tell . " Can fix that , " he said . He leaned down , his head and shoulder against her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the sandals off her feet . Josette sat quite still and let him do it , and felt his fingers , cool and delicate , against the arches of her feet . And , strangely enough , she thought again of Pat Thompson with bitter scorn . Never once in a million years would Pat have thought of sand in her shoes , or cared enough to take them off for her . She felt an unspeakable tenderness for Johnnie Meredith . Her thoughts turned into rhetorical theatrical phrases . She kept saying to herself over and over , " This night , this momentmust never end . This night is love . " Johnnie sat up again in the seat and put his arm around Josette and drew her firm up against him , bent her head back against his shoulder gently with his hand . His words were disjointed peculiarly . " Poor feet ! All tired out after all thatP214dancing . Now you can rest . just relax and rest here , and shut your eyes , and listen to the waves down there on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her ears , and his arms around her , Josette knew perfectly well what she should do . She knew that she must sit up straight and push him away , and smile at him and say some bright clever words , and then put on her shoes and go back to the lights and the music . She knew it quite well , but she had no will to do it . There was no harm in this , she told herself bewilderedly . There was a hunger and eagerness in her body that she had never before experienced . She felt in his arms a kind of warmth and security , a fool 's snatch at security that gave her release in these moments from the gnawing worries that made her life unbearable . And , besides , there was no harm in this , she kept repeating to herself , no harm at all . She let her body go limp and relaxed against his , and unconsciouslyher fingers fluttered against his chin , her hand along the side of his face , up into his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in the seat , and kissed her on the mouth and on the face many times . And Josette clung to him tightly while her whole world picked itself up and gyrated around her . Her body knew the beginnings of an ecstasy , her breathing came quick and deep , and the voices of warning in her mind were strange voices , voices only , for she did not listen to the words that they were speaking to her . All in one deft motion , with his mouth still against her face , Johnnie bent her over on her back along the seat , with his heavy solid body half on hers , and half upon the seat edge . The feel of the cool seat leather along her bare back came to Josette like electric needles crowding through her veins . And absurdly enough it was her dress that she thought of first now , her beautiful golden dress that must not be soiled or crumpled or torn . " No , do n't ! " she said to Johnnie Meredith . She struggled to sit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave no sign of it . She felt his breath against her throat and the pressure of his moving body . " Stop , please stop , " she whispered to him fiercely . She flung out her arms and legs desperately , one leg loose , from under him , her skirt doubled back , the moon shining along a long expanse of shining chiffon hose . And then his fingers on her leg , quick hot fingers like mice scurrying , at her knee , up her thigh , flesh that was quivering under his touch . She got hold of his wrist with her one free hand , but she had no strength to hold him . She did not scream . Oddly enough , she listened carefully to the music they were playing down below for the dancing , and she dug in all five fingernails into his wrist with all of her strength . He jerked his hand away then , and he laughed , the strangestlaugh , Josette thought , that she had ever heard , and it terrified her . She struggled desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her throat , her shoulders , and then the fingers again , the scurrying mice inside the bodice of her gown . She twisted and turned underneath him desperately , and at last she pushed his hands away from her , and when his hands came free there was a ripping sound , and the golden gown was slit in the front down to the waist . With that sound in her ears , Josette dug her free hand into that short crisp hair along the back of his head , and pulled . She lifted him up with the pulling , and once the pressure ofhis heavy body was gone from her , she opened the car door nod slid down from the seat onto the ground . She walked a%v steps from the car to the tree , and looked down to the blur I shimmering light that was the lake with the moon on it , unseeing . She was shivering a little , one of her arms felt as if It had been jerked out of its socket , and under her shoeless stockinged feet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shame came , and the anger and the disappointment . Josettedid not cry ; she only stood quite still . At last she reached outher hand blindly and pathetically against the rough cool barkP216of the pine tree , the fingers with the delicate , manicured nails over which she had spent so much time a few hours ago , the blind white fingers on the rough dark bark . Behind her in the automobile , Johnnie Meredith sat still for a few moments , and then he ran his hand down over his face , and shook his head sharp and hard . He sighed a little , smoothed his hair back with a comb , arranged his tie , and brushed at a little sand sticking along his trouser leg . Then he picked up Josette 's sandals from the floor and got out of the car and took them to her . " Come on , " he said gently and wearily , " let 's go back to the dance . Here are your shoes . " Josette did not turn around or speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go back now . Here are your shoes . Josette turned on him suddenly , with her voice choked and angry . " You go on back down there if you want to . I 'm not going . I ca n't . " She motioned to the crumpled soiled skirt , some of the gathers at the waist ripped loose . With her other hand , she was holding together the slit bodice of her gown . " I 'm sorry , " Johnnie Meredith said . Josette 's face was dark and furious with anger . " You ought to be . " His face darkened in the bright chromium of the moonlight , but he answered her smoothly . " What do you expect , " he said , " when you wear something like that to a wrestling match ? " Josette looked out down the hill again and did not speak . " I 'll take you home , " he said at last . He was still holding her sandals , and she turned around suddenly and snatched them from him . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car like a good girl and I 'll take you home . " " Do you think I 'd get in that car again with you ? " she said without turning around . P217He was quiet a minute , and then he said rapidly , " Look , you stay here and put your shoes on , and I 'll go down and get Ted . You 'd let Ted take you home , would n't you ? It would n't take him but a minute , and I could stay and dance with Sally . That would be all right , would n't it ? " Josette did not answer him . She walked by him and sat down on the running board of the car and began putting on ter sandals . Johnnie started down the path , and he turned around with e moonlight shining on his white jacket and called to her . ou stay there now . Ted 'll be up in just a second . " Josette watched him down the path in silence , and tightened the straps of her shoes around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and never see any of them again , and walk the way home by herself . But she also knew that she had to wait and accept the ride home that was offered . o she sat still on the running board with her head tippedick , resting against the side of the car , and her hands foldedquietly in her lap. ' red came then , and found her like that . He hurried up the t h out of breath . " Hello ! " he said . " I did n't see you for a minute . You scared me . I thought you 'd run off some place . " He handed her her wrap with the inner pocket sagging der the weight of her evening bag . She took it silently and imbed into the car . Ted closed the door , and got in beside her and backed the r out into the road . " Sally said to tell you good-bye , " he said to her at last , scowl-g ahead of him over the steering wheel . Josette gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried again , prefacing it with an awkward ugh . " Have n't seen a thing of Midge and Phil since we got re . Guess they pulled a real vanishing act . " Josette sat quietly beside him , a million miles beyond his reach . P218He slid the heavy car around a curve expertly . " Look , I 'm awfully sorry this had to happen , about your dress and every thing . I know Johnnie feels bad about it . Johnnie 's an awful good guy , but when he 's been drinking a little too much , why sometimes ... " " He ca n't use drinking for an excuse , " Josette said suddenly . " He was n't that drunk . " It was Ted 's turn to be quiet before her words . The white road wound away in front of the car , between dark swelling hills with every leaf of every bush and tree silveredby the moon . The little hard gravel stones splattered continually against the fenders . Ted scowled and wet his lips with the tip of his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke again over the rushing sound of the wind through the car , and the steady roar of the motor . " I mean it . Johnnie would n't have had this happen for anything . I tell you what , when you get home you change your dress and powder your nose and stuff and come on back with me . I 'll wait , and then you come on back to the dance . Johnnie was hoping ' you 'd change your mind and come back ; he said he was . I 'll wait and you come on back with me . " Josette smiled a little , grimly . As easy as that , change your dress and go back to the dance , put on another dress and put powder on your nose and comb your hair and smile and go back and never miss more than three or four dances , as simple and easy as that . " You will come back with me , wo n't you ? " Ted said to her . " No . " " I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you want to let it ruin your whole evening . " There was a shade of anger in his voice as he spoke . " Oh , do n't you ! " Josette said . " No , I do n't . Johnnie 's a good guy . Maybe he 'd been drink ing a little too much , but ... "   " Do n't talk to me about him ! " Josette said furiously . " Do n't try to make excuses for him . I never want to see him again as long as r live . " " Okay , " Ted said , and there was real anger in his voice now . " Okay , if that 's the way you feel about it . But I do n't see why you should get so mad about this . What did you expect ? Johnnie 's just human , and he 's been drinking a little . What did you expect ? " " What did you expect , " the words dinned themselves over end over against Josette 's ears , hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loudly and softly , urgently , insistently over and over again , " What did you expect ? what did you expect ? " And what was it that she had expected , Josette wondered . How could she say , " Why , I expected that Johnnie Meredith would fall in love with me , and that this would ' be the beginning of a whole new life for me , that he would marrye and take me away to the kind of a life I want to live . " " What did you expect ? " the very motor of the automobile took up the chant , and Josette said wildly , " Please keep still about it . I 'm not going back . I do n't want to talk about it . " ' led said no more , and in a few moments they saw the lights the village ahead of them . When he stopped the car in front the Veeches ' , Josette went weak with relief . The house waspletely dark . The whole family must be asleep . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " she said to Ted hastily . " I 'd rather you uld n't . " " Okay , " he said coolly . " I 'm sorry things had to go to smash e this . But it looks like this is the way you want it . If it is n't , better get wise to yourself . " " Good night , " Josette said politely . She almost added , " I had very nice time , " because the words came mechanically from ne spot in her bewildered brain where order and **26;7401;TOOLONG . She turned away toward the house , and heard the roar of the motor behind her as he drove away P220She tiptoed up the steps , into the darker shadows of the porch , past the porch swing to the door . She tried the screen experimentally , and found that it was not hooked . She took her sandals off , holding the straps firmly in her hands and slipped silently in the door . At that moment , her whole consciousnesswas absorbed by the idea of getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her family . Inside the living room , the moonlight lay along the faded rug and touched the glistening tinsel trimmings on the dolls and Scottie dogs on the piano top , the prizes from the carnival . Josette saw them and thought of Pat Thompson , and put the thought of him out of her mind . Two of the steps of the stairway squeaked loudly under her weight , and each time Josette stopped dead-still with her heart pounding , but there was no sound from above to show that anyone had heard it . Josette was not so expert at avoiding the creaking places of the stairs as Jen had become after years of experience . But at last Josette shut her bedroom door behind her , and leaned her back against it in the darkness . Her head ached , and her stomach was sick , and she felt weak , but most of all there was a vast hurt in her that as yet she had had no chance to analyze , only a great aching hurt , too great for tears . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only see the vague outlines of Jen sitting up in bed , with her hair wound around a dozen or so metal curlers all over her head . " My God , " Jen said . " You 're home early . I did n't think you 'd be home for a long time yet . How come you came home so early ? Do n't tell me your society boy has to go to bed early . " Josette did not answer . Jen stared at her curiously , her own eyes gradually accommodating to the bright light in the room . " What 's the matter with you ? What are you standing over there for ? " Jen sat up straighter in the bed . " Ca n't you say anything ? You look awful , and you musta ripped . . . Oh , Josie , your dress ! For God 's sakes , what happened to you ? It 's P221all wrinkles , and there 's some dirt on it , and the front 's all tipped open and ... " Josette walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She slipped her arms out of the fluffy brief angora ' rap . She was very careful not to catch a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror . Jen hopped around to the foot of the bed and leaned overthe footrail , wide-eyed and silent . Josette stood rooted to the nor with her arms at her sides , as if she were loath to take he dress off . " Josie , tell me what happened to you ! " Josette began to pull the long bedraggled skirt over her head without answering . " Gosh , that dress is sure a mess , " Jen said in an awe-stricken ice . " You better put it back in that box it came in . If Ma cr gets a look at it , she 'll raise the roof , after Mary went and ught it and everything . I wish you 'd tell me what happened . lease , Josie , tell me . " Josette put her dress away in the box without bothering tod it , and jammed the cover down over it . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tell you everything that happens to me , do n't I ? You know I 'm just dying to ow what happened . " Jen was becoming impatient . " Look , you do n't need to act c there was any secret about it . I could tell what happenedThe first good look I got at you . Your swell high-society date riled out to be pretty hard to handle , did n't he ? I bet he 'd n drinking too . " Jen 's voice turned soft and warm with pathy . " Aw , you poor kid , and you get all dressed up swell , and go out there to have a good time and then something like is . . . Aw , Josie , I 'm so sorry , honest .... " The sympathy and understanding in her sister 's voice broke vn barriers for Josette . She was too hurt yet for her pride to et defenses . The weak tears welled out of her eyes . " I never want to have another formal as long as I live , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never could put one on again without thinking about what happened tonight . " " Aw , Josie ! Honey , I 'm so sorry ! " Jen pulled her sister down onto the edge of the bed and put her arm around her . " Come on and tell me everything that happened . What did he do ? Gosh , it musta been something awful to make you feel like this . Come on and tell me . " Because there was more hurt in her than pride at this moment , Josette told the whole story , briefly and honestly , in a low , monotonous voice , leaving the dance hall , the walk on the beach , climbing the hill to the car , the removing of her shoes , the brief happiness she had felt in his arms , his kisses , and then the disastrous end of the affair , omitting , of course , the things that Ted had said to her on the way back to town . Jen listened to her story attentively , and , as she listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows , with a curious puzzled expression on her face . As Josette talked , her tongue loosened and the color came back into her face , and she grew angry . " And I never want to see Johnnie Meredith again as long as I live , " she finished . " I hate him . I wo n't speak to him if I meet him on the street . After doing a thing like that , the idea of him expecting me to go back to the dance like nothing ever happened , or to get into that car with him again and let him bring me home . I do n't see how anybody could be so ... " " Yeah , " Jen said reflectively . She leaned back along the pillows , her eyes lowered to the white bedspread , and tapped her teeth carefully with one long crimson fingernail . " Well , do n't you agree with me ? " Josette said . " Do n't you think it was a perfectly rotten filthy thing for him to do to me ? " Jen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread that made up the design of the thick worn old bedspread . " Oh , of course you would n't , " Josette said bitterly . " You 'd P223have stayed right there in the car and let him maul you and that would have been all right with you , but I 'm not that kind of a girl , and I ... " Josette got up from the bed abruptly and went to the bureau and began to comb her hair , jerking the comb through it fiercely over and over again . Jen sat silent in the middle of the bed and studied her manicure with rapt attention . Suddenly , Josette threw the comb down and turned around with her hands braced along the edge of the bureau . Her face was flushed with color now , and she spoke a little incoherently out of the very center of her hurt and her bewilderment . " How could he do something like that ? What made him do it and spoil everything ? How could a man like that do something so  --  so  --  cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . What made him do it ? " Jen stroked a red nail with a fingertip and carefully studied its hue and symmetry . She spoke softly without looking at Janette . " Well , I guess it just proves society boys ai n't no differentthan anybody else . It just proves men are all alike , that 's all ; whether they run around in tuxedos or overalls  --  it do n't make no difference . " That is n't so , " Josette said angrily . " Just because that tough gang of men you go around with all the time all make passes at you , is no sign that all men are like that . Do you suppose the men that Midge and Sally go around with in college all act around them like that ? Of course they do n't . You just say that because you do n't know any better , you never had a date with a decent man in your life . You and Frances Cope and girls like you do n't know what it is to have a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers flying , Jen jumped up onto her knees in the middle of the bed , her eyes dark and wide with anger . " Okay , " she said , " you asked for this . You make me sick enough to puke , always thinking you 're so damn much better'n anybody else on earth . Maybe Franny and me do n't elate with the four hundred , but you never see us coming home P224with our clothes half tore off , and yelling bloody murder about why in God 's name could Johnnie be such a louse , anyway . The trouble with you is you 're dumb , you do n't know any better . Jesus God , you better go to college for a couple years more , that 's what I say . " " Shut your mouth ! " Josette said . " Stop yelling at me . Do you want to wake up everybody in the house ? I wo n't listen to anything you say , anyway . " " Oh , you make me sick ! " Jen said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls like that do n't get pawed over on a date unless they want to . That 's because they got brains , and you ai n't . And then you make cracks about poor Franny when she 's laying up there in that hospital right this minute . " Jen hesitated over tears , but she choked them back and went on talking , with her voice rising higher and higher . " You come home here tonight , howling about this all being Johnnie Meredith 's fault . Well , the hell it was ! It was your fault , that 's whose fault it was ! " " Shut your mouth ! " Josette was pale with anger , and her fingers were splayed out pale and flat as she gripped the edge of the bureau . Her own voice rose out of control into a scream . " Shut your mouth ! " But there was no stopping Jen now . She crouched at the foot of the bed , hanging onto the chipped iron footrail with her two hands , looking straight up into Josette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go take a walk , ' you say okay . ' When he says let 's go sit in the car , ' you say okay . ' My God , you was either looking for trouble right then , or else you was leading with your chin . He kisses you a couple of times , and that 's plenty okay with you . Sure , you liked that . Well , then , what in hell did you expect the guy was gon na do next  --  take his knitting out of his pocket and start crocheting himself a pair of socks ? Oh , sure , blame it all on him ! You started something and then you get sore as hell because he tries to finish it . Oh , you make me sick , and all the nicey-nice girls just like you P225You like kissing and you like mugging around , every chance you get with any nice-looking guy that comes along , but then you want to stop right there . You play around and get a guy all worked up and then the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop right on the dot . Aw , you make me sick ! Jesus , there ought a be a name for girls like you . . . " " Stop ! I wo n't listen to you , " Josette said in a strangled voice . lcr face was white and she was shivering , gooseflesh all over her body , clad as she was only in brief brassiere and step-ins . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . You think that 811 girls are  --  are ... " " Shut up , shut up , shut up ! " Jen shook at the footrail like a ( lemon . There was the sound of bedsprings squeaking from adjoining rooms , but they were unheard here . " You was talking about respect a minute ago . Do you think Johnnie Meredith'sgot any respect for you right now ? The hell he has ! Respect ! That 's funny ! " Josette grabbed the box of kleenex tissue off the dresser and threw it at Jen , and Jen laughed and ducked , and Josette sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jen kept laughing . " He thinks you 're a cheat , that 's what he thinks of you ; a common little cheat , that 's been cheating around for years . Only he do n't know the half of it about you . You give him all the go-ahead signs ; he do n't stop just the minuteyou 're ready to , and then you come home here and holler like he 'd raped you ! " Jen dodged the heavy glass cold-cream jar , and it rolled crashing over the floor . Josette emptied the bureau top in her fury , and then Jen dove at her over the footrail . The crackedold mirror caught them in the flat two dimensions , Jen 's fullung body in the thin nightgown topped with the weird ' octal curlers on her head , suspended in the air , and Josette ushing her away , leaving red scratches in soft white flesh , d all the while her face white and detached and disgusted , the face of an onlooker rather than a participant . P226Molly flung the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lord 's sakes , what 's going on in here ? " Molly was out of breath from her hurried ascent up the stairs . Her big white nightgown billowed around her , and her big bare feet , solid on the floor , and lumpy with corns , stuck out below the hem . The space around her , in the doorway , was filled by bobbing heads , suspended against the darkness of the hall like balloons on strings , Sam and Kenny and Dorothy and Carl . Kenny , clad in shorts only , crowded into the room around Molly . " Cat fight , " he said cheerfully , with his delicate cough . He picked Jen off the bed , and stood her down on the floor , holding her struggling body in his arms . At his touch , the fight went out of her , and she put her arms up around his neck like a small child and began to cry . Josette stood alone in front of the bureau , in the midst of the havoc that they had created out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a cat fight ! " Molly said indignantly . She turned on Josette as the more composed and responsibleof the sisters at the moment . " You ought a be ashamed , a-hollering and yelling and throwing things and digging each other , right in the middle of the night , when everybody is trying to sleep , and sickness in the house and everything . It 's a disgrace , two great big girls like you a-fighting . You ought a be ashamed . " Kenny looked at Josette coolly over the top of Jen 's head . " From Ritz to roughhouse , " he said . But Josette paid no attention to any of them . She stood quietly in front of the mirror with her shoulders drooping and her eyes fixed and far away . " What was you fighting about ? " Molly demanded . Josette did not speak , and through her crying Jen answered incoherently . " All my fault . . . We got to arguing , and I got to talking nasty to her . But I do n't care . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to going crazy , just thinking about Franny up there in that hospital and that operation tomorrow , 226P227because if anything happens to Franny , why , I do n't know what I 'll do , or what will become of me , I just do n't know . " " Sure , we know it 's hard on you , but take it easy , honey , " Kenny said to her tenderly . " You got ta keep your chin up . You would n't find Franny a-crying and taking on like this . She 's laying up there braver'n a soldier . You would n't get a peep out of her . " " There 's no sense you getting all upset like this , " Molly said sensibly . " It do n't look like to me that Cope girl 's got much of u chance , and you might as well start getting used to it . Ai n't no call for you to let yourself go all to pieces . Lord , and Mr. Higgins so sick downstairs and everything , it would seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirled around suddenly on the interested audience in the hallway behind her . " Well , are you gon na hang around here all night ? Why doncha git back in bed and let somebody get a little sleep ? Dor'thy , you 're coming downstairs with Grandma and sleep on the couch , and then Jen can sleep in your bed . There now , hush up your crying , never come anythingyet that sniveling helped it any , " she finished as she led Jen out of the bedroom . All of them melted away , and the door closed , and Josette was alone in the room , under the merciless stare of the light bulb . Her bewilderment and her shame were complete ; she had done the one thing that she would never be able to forgive herself for , allowing herself to sink to the common level of the family , and indulging in a brawl , there was no other word , K reaming and throwing things , and scratching and clawing . Never would she forgive herself for this , or Jen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did was only perfunctoryand superficial . Her mind and emotions seemed to be clearing Out into a vacuum preparatory to the coming of a momentous realization , just as the stage of the theatre is cleared before the entrance of the protagonist to deliver his greatest monologue . P228Josette turned the light out , ignoring the litter over the floor , and slipped out of her clothes into her nightgown . She went to the window then , and put the shade up . The night was still , the insect voices were soft . The leaves over the limbs of the great tree against her window stirred a little with their breathing , in the moonlight . No automobiles , no trains , no people in the streets , no one left among the alive and the wakefulbut herself , truly the time for great decisions . She stood stiff and still by the window , looking out with blank unseeing eyes , and her mind was still also , and waiting . And after a while it came to her , and when it came it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice so deep that she could not hear the tone of it , but rather felt it , in a series of great vibrations like the tolling of a bell into the empty quiet air of a summer day . And what it said to her was short enough , and irrevocable and final . There was still another world , it told her , the gay good clean world , the world to which people like Midge and Sally and Ted and Johnnie Meredith and Philip belonged , the world where no one ever had anything to be ashamed of , and where life moved easily and charmingly , the world where things like tonight never happened . Oh , yes , there was such a world , all right , but it was not for her . And the reason was so amazingly simple ; so strange that she had never realized it before . That world was not for her , because , fundamentally , she was no different than any of the rest of her family . Their blood was her blood ; she was of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , or Jen , and this steady inexorable voice of her own logic told her that there was something about her , some mark , some stigma , unseen perhaps , but easily perceived , by which people could always find her out , as Johnnie Meredith had found her out this night . There was no such thing , the voice reminded her , as escaping your own destiny , running away from your own fate , avoiding your own doom ; it lay beyond your power of circumvention.  |p229And  then the voice stopped , and the last vibrations of it went on and on inside of her . Josette left the window , and crawled into her bed . She did not cry . She did not question her logic , or the premises upon which it was founded . She only thought in a pathetic wash of self-pity that it was too bad that she had not discovered this sooner . Incredibly she found no Incongruities in her logic . Weird as her thinking had been , it satisfied her . She contemplated the tragedy of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tragic heights , the breather of the rarefied thin air of arid peaks . She lay stiff and alone in the middle of the big iron bed , end the moon shone in the window , and sketched a jagged shadow from the footrail of the bed , across the smooth white bedspread . And there was her pride . P230THE next morning Josette got out of bed , dressed and wen to school . It was a day that seemed never to end for her , a torment and an agony . She went about classes and books and Ashbury streets all in a haze . There was a strange feeling always with her , a strange gnawing persistent feeling , a feeling o unreality , uncleanness that could not be dispelled . The day was for her a caricature of a nightmare of a day . But it ended at last , and she got out of Nina Warren 's car and walked into the lowering sun , up the uneven wooden front porch steps a home . She went through the house to the kitchen and ther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Moll held the broom in one hand , and broke straws off it and jabbe them down through the cake intently . She straightened u from the hot oven as Josette came in , her face streaming wit the heat . " Lord , " she said crossly , " I swear this is gon na be the la baking I do till the cool weather comes . It ai n't no sense in m baking this kind of weather . Hanging around this hot stov just tuckers me all out . It 's just exactly as cheap to buy yo knickknacks from the bakery as to bake ' em here to home thi weather . Besides , there ai n't enough of you to home here f meals to pay me the trouble . " " I saw Jen up to Ashbury this afternoon , " Josette said , fill% ing a water glass out of the pail of warm brackish drinking P231ter , indifferently . " She said to tell you that she would n't be till late , maybe not till tomorrow . " Molly shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gently , and then mopped her face . " Well , for Lord 's es , what is she . . . " Molly sat down hard on the old chair by the door . " Why , say , how did that Cope girl w out with her operation anyway ? " " Not so good , " Josette said . " Jen said they could n't remove tumor . When they got in to it they found out they could n't remove it , so they just had to sew her up again . The doctors she probably could n't live over a week or so . " Molly shook her head and sighed deeply . " Well , it ai n't thing more than I expected right along . You ca n't tell me t them doctors can go fooling around with the inside of ebody 's head and them still alive . It sure is a terrible thing ugh , when you stop to think , her just a little young girl1w that , and nothing they can do for her . Lord , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Josette set the water glass down , and looked out of the when door to the garden , and the trees and the sky . Someherein the neighborhood , a radio blared music into the quiet the day 's end . Molly continued conversationally , " And , you know , they y now that that Rita Sibley is a-going to pull through up re to the hospital . It sure beats all , do n't it , how somebody e that that ai n't no good to nobody will keep on living andsomebody like that little young Cope girl with her life all ad a-her has to go . Yes , sir , it beats all . " Josette felt a shadow of the familiar rage that she always t when her mother referred to Rita Sibley in this fashion , t only a shadow of it . She was too bound up in herself andapathetic tonight to take the energy to try to argue with r mother . " You want some supper now ? " Molly asked presently . " No , " Josette said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel  |p232like  eating ; it 's too hot . I 'm going upstairs and study awhile and as soon as I get cooled off I 'm going to bed and see if I ca n't get some sleep . " " Well , there you are ! " Molly said crossly , fanning herself with a corner of her apron . " It sure is the limit ! Here I build up a fire and heat the oven , and like to stew myself to juice , a-baking and a-fixing stuff for supper and everything , and now I 'd like to know who 's gon na eat it ? " She stopped for breath , listening to the sound of Josette 's feet on the stair steps . " What kinda cake you cooking out there ? " Jud called querulouslyout of the bedroom . " One of them black ones with cocoa , " Molly said indifferently , as she hoisted her bulk up out of the little wooden chair , scraping it along the warped floor boards . " Why , sure ye are , " Jud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't never been no hand at all for them cocoa cakes . Jesus Christ , what I would n't give for a hunk of one of them real old-fashioned molasses cakes right hot from the tin . I tell you , it 's an awful thing when folks wo n't give a dying man the things he likes to eat . " " Mr. Higgins , " Molly said , " you just hush up now . They ai n't no sense you being mean like this . Every time you open your mouth , seems like you 're trying to say something meaner than you did the last time . I swear you just lay in there in that bed a-thinking up mean things to say to us . Lord , did n't I bake a molasses cake last week and you would n't eat a crumb of it , and you kept a-harping about what you 'd give for one of my cocoa cakes . " " That 's a lie , " Jud quavered . " Every word of it , nothing but a God-damned lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . She broke off more broom splinters , and stabbed them into the moist brown cake on the oven door , viciously.  |p233Dawn  cracked the sky to the east , and a strange unreal gray light crept through to herald the sunrise . It was a peculiar time of the day , darker than twilight , but more luminous . There was a profound quiet every place , punctuated only by the distantsounds of cocks crowing . A breeze came up and ruffled the dark gray trees , turned the leaves inside out , like a flock of silver birds flying , and gone . Mary Veech lay very still in the middle of her white bed , and watched the dull light crawl over the floor from the window . It was a time of day when it is not good to be alone , half light , half dark , half day , half night . Mary Veech got out of bed abruptly , put slippers on her feet , and wrapped a robe about her . In the mirror she was as gray and ghostly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to sit in her chair by the window . The air that came in was damp and thick and mist-like . She shivered a little . She sat still then , and waited.  --  She heard feet at last , shuffling carelessly along the sidewalk . Then the sound stopped , and in a minute she heard them again , now cautious and soft , on the back porch . She heard the sound the door made , giving a little on the metal hook , as he tried to open it . She even heard the sound of the porch boards squeaking as he threw himself down on the porch ; and then the sound of his delicate little hacking cough . In the silence again , Mary got up and secured her robe around her . She held a match flame to a cigarette . The flame flickered small and pale . It was as if the still gray air swallowedup , it was gone so soon . She slipped out of the door andwn the stairs , without a single creaking of a board . Shent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ) k in her hand . Kenny was sprawled out face down across the porch boards , his head pillowed on his arms . He heard the faint click of thehook lifting , and he sat up and twisted around to the door. either one of them said a word , Mary in the door with theP234cold damp metal hook still in her fingers , nor Kenny on the porch . Kenny kept looking at her . He sat up very straight and made a futile weary gesture to smooth his hair back from his eyes . His eyes were bloodshot , his face pallid in the strange light . He was not drunk any more , but at the intermediate stage just before a hangover . " Hi , " he said at last , softly . " It was swell of you to come down . I was freezing out here . It 's funny . . . It 's funny . . . " But his thoughts and his words and his voice all got away from him and went off on tangents of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary opened the screen door and came out onto the porch . " It 's funny how cold it is early in the morning , " she said dispassionately . Kenny stood up beside her , with one hand against a post for support . He shook his head a little to clear it , and pressed his hand hard over his eyes and down the side of his face . And then he laughed silently . " Bum liquor , " he said . " Makes you feel like hell . " Mary pulled out the flat silver case from a pocket in her robe and stuck a cigarette into his mouth . She found a match while he was still fumbling , and struck it deftly . Then she steadied his cigarette in his mouth with her fingers , and lit it . " You must be cold , " he mumbled . He closed his big hand over her shoulder . " I 'm all right , " she said . " I want to talk a minute . " " Here , you better have my coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe is warm . We ca n't talk here . They went down the steps together and , as if by common consent , they walked across the little backyard to the used-ca lot wedged in between the filling station and the house . Th car lot was almost empty , except for one or two ancient , de .. - nuded wrecks of automobiles . It was a great expanse of hard . packed damp sand , littered with the matches and cigarette butts of many days , and on two sides the great catalpa trees , P235commense green leaves and immense white flowers , unreal in the dim light , like stage-prop trees . They walked across the car lot together , to a position out of ht and out of the wind behind two old cars at the back . ary leaned against the body of the car , and the wind ruffled r hair around her face . Kenny stood close in front of her . " I low 's everything , kid ? " he said to her gently . " So-so ; the same old thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wrist fitly . " Ken , you know a mug named Gitlo . " She did n't ask if it were a question ; she said it quietly and flatly . Kenny waited a moment before he answered . He closed his yid over hers , closed it tight and warm in his . " Sure , I know Gitlo . Great fellow this guy Gitlo . Gitlo 's the guy that bought  --  drinks tonight . Lousy drinks , but a great guy , Gitlo . " She wadded up a handful of his shirt tight in her hand . low long you known Gitlo ? " " Oh , I du n no  --  quite a while . . . I know Gitlo . Great guy , o. he shook him suddenly . " Ken . Listen . How long have you wn Gitlo ? Years , months , days  --  what ? " although her voice was cool and quiet as always , something seemed to sober Kenny . He pulled himself together visibly , made a great effort to concentrate on what she was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe three , I dunno. by ? " " How did you run into him ? " Kenny thought about it hard . " Robotelli . Robotelli does jobs Gitlo sometimes . I 've known Robotelli hell of a long time . week , week before , I du n no  --  Robotelli says to me , How Id you like to meet the boss ? ' I says sure , and then Robo - takes me over to Gitlo 's place . That 's how I meet Gitlo , tit have been two , three weeks ago . " Kenny looked at Mary expectantly , but she did not speak . P236She leaned back against the car , away from him . She said at last , " So you know Gitlo . " Kenny found a meaning beyond the words that she had spoken . He took hold of her shoulders and spoke to her ur . gently . " Mary , listen . You know me . I know Gitlo , so what about it ? I know a lot of guys . It do n't mean nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into , you know that . Gitlo knows that . He 's a good guy . " Mary looked away over the top of Kenny 's head to the bright sky to the east . He kept his hands on her shoulders an watched her face , coughing a little , quiet in his throat . When she spoke her voice was soft and flat as if she we only talking to herself . " Once Gitlo got in a bad jam . Lew g him the money to get out of it . Gitlo would n't be around he today , if it had n't a-been for Lew . " Kenny laughed exultantly , with his head flung back . " N I know what you got on your mind , " he said . " But you ain ' got a thing to worry about . You can take it from me . " She looked at him full in the face . He was still laughing . When he laughed he looked younger than Carl , young a strong and confident of everything and himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her chin . " I 'll tell you a secret , " he said . " Hell , know all about the deal Gitlo made with Lew . Gitlo told himself . But that do n't mean nothing . This is the secret . Gig hates his guts . He 's got it in for Lew right . Gitlo do n't around telling that to everybody , see , but he told me all ab it . He hates Lew 's guts . " Her face was expressionless . " I wish you knew Gitlo , " Kenny said . " You ought a m him . He 's a great guy , all right . " " Ken , watch him and go easy , will you ? " The mirth went out of his face . " Why , sure , if you say But you got the wrong idea on Gitlo . If Lew thinks Gitlo still his errand boy , Lew 's nuts . I know . "   " Yeah , sure , " she said wearily. ' flay stood together , and the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light to the east suddenly out of the sky , as if the sun had changed its mind bout another dawn . Kenny 's face was dark and brooding , and he said at last , " Iwhat you had on your mind , all right . God , ai n't Lew ntz never gon na rest till I 'm put away somewheres ? " " No , " Mary said . I le laughed unpleasantly then . " That 's fine . I do n't care at in hell he 's got up his sleeve . He ca n't get at me . He ai n't na get rid of me , the dirty son-of-a-bitching scheming old cr ... " Mary ! " his voice changed , rose higher , thin and high and r , " Mary , my God , I ca n't stand no more ! You ca n't go on ng with him . You got ta leave him ! " Mary drew her breath in sharply , and then her face was Idenly weary and still as if the breath and life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough on her shoulders . " Why , ... Why do yuh stay with him ? You been with now than you ever been with anybody before . Tell mehe did not look at him , and after a little she moved her with a great effort . Her voice was so soft that it was all lust in the wind . " Lew needs me , " she said tonelessly . Kenny laughed and coughed all at once , an odd , tragic , en sound . " Sure . Sure he needs yuh , but what about you ? God , Mary , what about you ? Do n't you ever think a-yourDon'tyou want nothin ' for yourself ever ? " SIR . did not look at him or answer him , and he shook her hard by her shoulders . " Mary , what about me ? I need you too . hat about us ? " ' I hen she did look at him , but her eyes were as lifeless and weary as her face . When she spoke it was as if the words she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless . " Us , Ken ? What about us ? This is all there is for us now . We both knew that a long time ago ! " His hands dropped from her shoulders to his sides , and his voice was still unnatural , high and thin . " Oh , Mary ! " Mary closed her eyes , and sat down on the running board of the car abruptly . The sky had clouded over , it was almost as dark as night now , except for that strange unearthly luminosity even in the gloom . The wind blew , and sent papers scudding across the used-car lot , tossing the catalpa leaves about like the ears of wild elephants on stampede , and the great white petals of the flowers rained down over the two below . Kenny swayed over her uncertainly in the gloom . He said her name again , " Mary ! Mary ! " with his agonized voice mixinginto the wind . And then he dropped to the ground at her feet and stretched his arms tight around her . He buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body , so that when he spoke his voice was muffled . " Mary ! Oh , Jesus , sometimes it do n't seem like I can stand any more of this ! " His whole body twisted against her knees ; he held her with all of his strength . Mary did not move . She held her cigarette case raised up in her hands over his head . Not a muscle of her face moved , only her hair , stirred by the wind . The gloom deepened around them . The wind chased great dark-brown mottled clouds across the sky . Still Kenny clung to her , and , after a little , he began to cry , dully , hopelessly . Mary lit another cigarette . She carefully avoided touching him with her hands ; she kept her eyes carefully averted from him . She leaned her head back against the side of the automobileand closed her eyes . She smoked the cigarette slowly . Gradually , his crying stopped . He still held her , his bodyP239twitching with nervous tremors . She threw the cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her sides ; her eyes were still closed . And when the tremors went through him her eyelids fluttered each time . Suddenly her body doubled over . She put her arms around him with her hands flat against his back , and pillowed her head down on his like a tired child . The wind blew and rattleda wooden signboard , some place inside its wooden frame . The wind blew and swept the scraps of paper up and down the lot , and lifted the full skirt of Mary 's robe around her feet . The wind blew and tangled Mary 's hair , caught full of theg creamy petals flung down from the catalpa trees abovethem. 239 THE wind was still blowing when Jen came home at the end of that gray day . She came into the house and the wind banged the door shut behind her . She stood still inside the door smoothing her hair and skirts . Her father was lying on the couch with his shoes off and a sweater buttoned over his blue shirt , reading a book in the glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jen asked him . He closed the book over his finger , and blinked his eyes aher . " Why , your mother 's out there with Jud , doing something for him . I du n no . Jen fidgeted on her tall heels uncertainly . " Say , it 's chilly out , ai n't it ? " her father said conversationally . He yawned deeply with his mouth stretched wide for a moment . " Sure is crazy weather we 're having . Hot enough on day to roast eggs , and cold enough to freeze ' em the next . " " Yeah , " Jen said . She moved into the room , laid her pun down on the table , and ran her hands through a pile of magazines . " Say , " her father asked her carefully , " how 's the little Colgirl , anyway ? " Jen shook her head and studied the cover of the magaziintently . " I 'm just as sorry as I can be , " Sam said awkwardly . " Shewas the prettiest , liveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P241never in too big a hurry to stop and talk and joke and laugh a little . I guess everybody 's gon na miss her . " Jen walked around the room restlessly while the wind ratedevery window in the house . She stopped before the big Aright piano , closed and thick with dust , and shoved the udy carnival prizes on the top into a precise straight line . Where 's Kenny ? " she asked . " Kenny ? " her father repeated . " Why , let 's see . He mustawent quite a while ago . Why , he ai n't been here since . . . Yes , e was too ! No , that was Carl . Carl come in just a minute ago , gilt after he got done working , but he went out again someheres . That was Carl that come in though . No , I ai n't seen ) thing a Kenny , he musta went quite a ways back . . . " Jen shoved the glittering carnival toys back and forth , and am searched his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of it , I ca n't recall right off . seeing Kenny today . His Ma was telling something though at she said Kenny said when he got home this morning , somusta been home here early for a little spell . But I ca n't just recall , he musta been here when ... " " Oh , Lord , " Molly roared out of the bedroom where she had . n listening to the entire conversation . " Anybody 'd ought a ow better than ever ask you anything about nothing . Kenny 's ht upstairs in his bed a-sleeping right this minute , that 's ere he is . That 's where he 's been all day long . " " Well , I knew I had n't seen him around here today , " Sam Misted . " Say , " Molly called , drowning Sam out , " I was supposed to I Kenny to get up before supper time . I promised him I  --  uld and then I went and forgot all about it . You wanta run tairs and wake him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . It 's supper time right now already . " " Okay , I 'll tell him , " Jen said . She moved toward the stair door , and Molly called after her out of the bedroom , " Say , hat did you want to know where Kenny was for ? There ai n't  |p242nothing  the matter , is there ? How come you was asking . . . Jen banged the door shut loudly on the sound of her mother'svoice . And at the bang of the stair door , as she started up the stairs , another door was slammed shut above her . It was th door to the room she shared with Josette , and it was a warnin that Josette was studying and did not wish to be disturbed Jen coming into the room unless it was absolutely necessaryAt the top of the stairs , Jen went directly to the room tha Carl and Kenny shared , and pushed the door open . The roo was dark and cheerless . One of the windows was half opened the ragged curtains were blowing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in its frame with continual rattling sound . The wind tugged the door away fro Jen and slammed it shut . She came into the room , and pulled the string that was tied from the chain below the electric-light bulb to the head of the bed . Kenny slept doubled up in the middle of the bed . The room was chilly and in his sleep he had pulled the sheet alight quilt up over his head , so that his bare feet stuck o below . Jen closed the window carelessly with another ban and plucked the covers down from his face . Kenny slept pea fully , oblivious to banging doors and windows and the inc sant rattling of the wind . His face was flushed and his h was tousled over his forehead in ringlet curls . Jen perched beside him on the edge of the bed . " Hey , wa up , " she said . She dug her fist into his chest a couple of tim " Wake up ! " He stirred a little and fumbled for the covers . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covers back over his head agai but Jen kept tight hold of them . " You gon na sleep all day ? You 're a lazy bum . It 's sup time . You better get up if you 're goin ' to . " Kenny gave up the struggle and relinquished sleep regret fully . He opened his eyes and grinned at Jen with drowsy good nature . " Hi ! " he said .   " You 're a lazy bum , " she scoffed . The hell you say , " Kenny marveled lazily . He stretched his ms out wide over his head . " Do n't know where the time goes ... " The cool air of the room struck his bare arms , and he Ile d them back under the covers again hurriedly and hunched ) wn farther in the bed . " Jesus , what kinda weather is this ? ' s cold ! " " It 's been cold all day , " she said . " We have winter enough , without having it in the summer b , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you , and saw the marster a nice hot bawth , and while you 're at it chase e moth-balls out of my red-flannel underwear . " Jen smiled briefly , and pulled her jacket sleeves down on r wrists and tucked her legs up under her skirt . " How 's everything ? " Kenny asked her , and then , his face her ing , " how 's Franny ? " Jc'n shook her head again , as she had shaken it before when er father asked her that question . " Kenny , " she said desirately , " I wanta talk to you . " " Okay , " he said . " Shoot . So Franny ai n't got a chance , huh ? " Jen shook her head . " They say she just ca n't get well . It 's ' his , I ca n't hardly stand to talk about it . " " Oh , it 's tough ! " Kenny patted her knee , and then jerked hand back out of the cold under the warm covers again . us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about Franny I want to talk to you . " Kcnny was peering around her out of the window . " Listen that wind blow , would you ! Whata night ! And what I wantais how in hell I 'm going to get up to Ashbury without zing my ass off ? " " Kenny , will you listen to me , please ? " " Take it easy . I 'm listening , ai n't I ? Go ahead , shoot , say something . " " Well , pay attention and I will . " Jen wrinkled her fore-P244head , and wadded up a handful of the sheet in her ban searching for the words to use . " Sure , now that 's just what I always say , " he mocked her . " Thanks for telling me . I sure appreciate it . You do n't me to say so . " " Kenny , please ! " her eyes were wet with tears suddenly . " Okay , okay , I 'm listening . Spill it . " " Kenny , Franny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush words . He was silent awhile before he spoke . Jen twisted the sh up into a knot in her hand , without looking at him . " How come Franny wants to see me ? " " You should ask , " Jen said angrily . " You know damn w why she wants to see you . " " I do n't know nothing about it , " he said shortly . " You ' telling the story , ai n't you ? How come Franny wants to see meThe wind blew around the house in gusts and Jen yank the knot out of the sheet so hard she tore a slit along the t of it . " You know the way Franny feels about you . She 's alwa been crazy about you . " " Oh , hell ! " he said . His face darkened . " I do n't believe How could she be crazy about me , I ai n't had ... " " Go on and say it  --  you ai n't had nothing to do with her f two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franny 's just fun that way , that 's all . I do n't mean she set to home and cried h eyes out over you all this time , but you know damn well h she felt about you . There was n't nothing she would n't ha done for you , any time . She was running around with lots different guys all the time , but she 'd have thrown ' em all o just like that , any time you 'd a-wiggled your little finger at h Do n't say you did n't know that . " " Okay , " he said sharply . " So what ? I could n't help I could I ? " " I 'm not saying you could , " she answered him angrily . " But244P245coulda been a lot nicer to her . I wish to hell you hada ten , now . " " Sure , Boy Scout . Make all the little girls happy . " " Well , you coulda done a lot worse'n Franny . " I ! c burst out laughing , suddenly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks . " I do n't seet you got to laugh about . None of it ai n't funny . " " I was just laughing to think about me and Franny . What you figure I ought a done , married her ? " he laughed again . Jen stared at him wonderingly . " I ca n't make you out , " she1 . " T never could make you out . You 're the funniest guy I r knew . You 're my own brother and I do n't know nothing but you that matters . I never met a guy yet I could n't tell pretty soon what makes him tick . Well , I do n't know yet what kes you tick . " le coughed delicately before he answered her . " Just so 's wo n't worry about it , I 'll tell you . I do n't tick . My wheels run backwards . I buzz . " he made a little gesture of exasperated resignation , with palms upward and her shoulders hunched , but the next ent her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't you ? " oh , hell ! Sure , I guess so , if she wants to see me. " hen are you gon na go ? " h , I do n't know , " he said . " I 'm kinda busy . I ca n't just First-a the week maybe . Her folks think it 's all right forto come to see her ? How you know they 'll let me in up ? . , you talk like you think you 'd have to sneak into the hospitosee her . " Jen said . " She already said to her folks she is to see you , and they asked me to ask you to come . They word to the hospital , any time you go , you can see her . " ' hat 's fine , " Kenny said . He sighed profoundly. hen you gon na go ? " Jen insisted .   " I told you . I do n't know . I 'm busy . First of the week maybe . " Jen compressed her lips and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " he asked . " God , you look just like Josie when you pull your face down like that . Cut it out . What's-a matter now ? I said I 'd go , did n't I ? " " You ai n't said a damn thing yet , " Jen burst out . " You ca n't just say maybe you 'll go the first of the week . You ai n't got forever to get there . The doctors say maybe any day , maybe tomorrow . How can you tell ? If you 're going , you got ta go . " " Okay , okay , take it easy , for Christ 's sakes . I 'll go tomorrow . I 'll go the first thing tomorrow afternoon , how 's that ? " " That 's swell , " Jen said . " And do n't let nothing make you put it off . " Kenny 's good humor had all vanished . " Listen , " he said sarcastically , " if it ai n't asking too much of you , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting outs here so I can dress ? It 's dark already , and I got ta date to seeguy up to Ashbury , and it 's gon na be one hell of a cold night to fool around looking for a ride . " Jen got up obediently , but at the door she hesitated , slidi the knob in her fingers . " Kenny , " she said carefully , " wh are you gon na say to Franny when you go up there tomorrowKenny sat shivering in the middle of the bed . " What in h you mean , what am I gon na say to her tomorrow ? " " I mean . . . You 're  --  you 're gon na be nice to her , arch you ?  --  " Oh , Jesus ! " Kenny lay back in the bed , and pulled t covers up to his neck and groaned . " She asks me if I 'm gon be nice to Franny . What do you think I am ? You think I ' going up there and have a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , " Jen said . " It ai n't gon na cost y a thing , and it 's gon na mean a lot to her . " Kenny sat up in the bed again . His face was impassive , P247of the easy careless mirth and banter was gone out of him . He ' piked older and harder , and like a stranger to Jen . His voices soft and impersonal , and prefaced with his coughing . " Ienough of this . Shut your mouth and get outa here . " Jen scurried out the door and ran into Carl at the top of theirs . She brushed past him and ran down the hall to her ownm . She burst in and closed the door behind her and leanedn it . Josette looked up from her studying and stared at herpprovingly . Jen 's eyes were big and round . You know , " she said woningly , " the screwiest thing , but sometimes I get scared to th of Kenny . " " Humm ! " Josette said . " No , honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or someg . He 'll be talking along , just as natural , like he always is , ghing and wisecracking , and then , all of a sudden , he gets erent , just like he 's some other guy . It scares yuh . Kenny 's awful funny guy . He 's different from anybody . I wonder hat'Il ever happen to him . " " Humm , " Josette said , wiping her red chilled nose efficientlywith her handkerchief . " Kenny does n't scare me . He ' t anything to be afraid of . He just thinks he 's smart . Noththatamounts to anything will ever happen to him , besehe 's no good . " " No , sir , " Jen said determinedly . " There 's something about Kenny you ca n't get . Until you can get that , you ca n't add him and make him come out even . " I can add him up and make him come out even , " Josette . " He 's nothing more or less than a lot of other good-for-nothhingfellows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , he rs , he drinks , he gambles , and he chases around withen all the time , married women , and tough women , and little young girls , or anything that will look at him . And that 's there is to Kenny Veech . " P248And in the room at the other end of the hall , just as Kenny got out of the bed , Carl came stumbling in the door . " What is this , " Kenny said bitterly , " a bedroom or a rail  --  road station ? " But Carl did not hear him . He walked past him and sat down on the edge of the bed , cradling carefully in his arms the worn volume of poetry that he had taken out of the county library . Carl had just found a poet who , he believed , understoodhim . His face was removed and rapt and ecstatic . Kenny stopped in the middle of his dressing to stare at hi brother . " What in Christ 's name is the matter with you all a sudden ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know you look just like a guy I used to see around , tall skinny guy name of Guts . Guts was a screwball , if there ever was on Somebody hit him on the head with something once yea ago , and Guts acted funny ever since then . It made him wron in the head , kinda . He used to hear voices , he claimed . Fun niest damn thing , you 'd be talking along to Guts , same as I 'm talking to you , and Guts would be nodding his head back an forth and pulling out on his lower lip like he always do when you was talking to him , and then alla once , just like tha he 'd be gone . He 'd hold up his head kinda funny like he w listening , and his mouth would go like he was talking back somebody . Give you the creeps to see him do it at first . In minute , though , he 'd be all right , and start talking to y again . Guts sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gu at that . Never heard a word what ever become of Guts . Som body said he had an accident . I du n no . " Carl was not listening to Kenny . His eyes were far away . I I cleared his throat noisily . Kenny stopped with a comb in his hand . " Oh , Jesus , God , he pleaded of the empty air . " They 're all nuts ; this who ! family is nuts . If I do n't get away from here pretty soon , ImP249going nuts too . " Carl did not move or look at Kenny or indicatein any way that he knew that he was in the room . Kenny cocked his head , watching him attentively , and then went quietly across the room and opened the window uphigh so that the wind blew in a gale . He came back and stoodin front of Carl . He stood there so long and so quietly t Carl 's attention was diverted at last and he stared at nny wonderingly . At that precise second Kenny emitted a-curdling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides of his head like enormous and elontedears . Carl was so startled that he shrank back upon the , his precious book tumbling onto the floor at his feet . The ent that Kenny hit the floor again he bounded across the m to the window . He sent the window screen spinning ay with one straight jab of his right arm , and then he dove ci first after it out of the window into the darkness . As his cis closed over the limb of the big tree close outside the dow Kenny emitted his mad banshee howl once more . He ng from the limb , and then dropped down to the grass erneath . With earth under his feet once more , he settled shirt collar , and walked around the house to the kitchen r . He walked into the kitchen with a jaunty swagger and , " Hiya , Mom . Whatcha having that 's good for supper ? " Molly stopped dead still in the middle of the kitchen floora stack of cups and saucers in her hands , and her big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " For ' s sakes , where did you come from ? " pstairs , Carl sat stunned upon the bed , clutching the iron rail with both hands so tightly that the knuckles paled. great dark wind roared in the open window , impatiently liked the curtains aside , and encircled him. enny 's laughter filled the house .   KENNY came out of the Third Avenue Pool Room in bury into the sunshine , and let the door bang behind him . H was grinning , and back in the pool room everybody was laud ing at some wisecrack he had made . Kenny felt good . H walked slowly with a slouch and a swagger . The sun was warm and full-bodied . The streets were full of people drifting along like himself . At the corner by the combination news paper and fruit stand , there was the strong rancid smell over-ripe bananas and plums , with a little cloud of fruit lull hanging in the air . Kenny ambled across the street with t traffic light . He felt a languor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth , and it was too early the afternoon to have a thirst . There was nothing on mind , nothing more than a teasing unidentified melody some song or other , turn te turn te tum  --  turn te turn turn t te turn . He felt fine . He had learned the value of times w he felt completely good and satisfied as he did now . So savored this moment like a connoisseur . He had a faculty being able to shut unpleasant things completely out of consciousness at times . He did not think now about where was going , Receiving Hospital on the other side of the el He had promised to go to see Frances Cope . He had not ticularly wanted to go , but he had promised that he wot4 go , and he was on his way and that was all there was to it . II would not think about it again until he walked up the wis- steps to the front entrance of the hospital . He had given himself over to a sensuous , contented enjoyment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let it all come in to him every pore . At the moment he was a man completely satisfied and happy . He ambled along jauntily with the little ascent metal heel plates pounded into the edges of the runnerheels of his shoes clicking against the cement . One of Its shoes was untied , and the metal tips of the laces over the sedewalk made a complete orchestral arrangement of the sound his walking . ' Turn te turn te turn , " he hummed under his breath . " turn I t urn turn turn te turn . . . " He came around a corner like that , and suddenly he pped still on the street , and froze back flat against the brick all of the building . It was a hotel building and at the end Rarest him there was a cocktail bar , probably the smartest and expensive rendezvous in Ashbury . The entrance to the was not three feet away from Kenny , and just as he came and that corner he saw them . They got out of a car drawn before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her of the car and she crossed the sidewalk on his arm , andwent in the door into the glittering interior , so near to nny that he caught a subtle hint of her perfume in the air she went by . The door closed behind them after emitting blast of air-conditioned coolness and soft music , and theygone . Kenny remained where he was for awhile , perlystill , flat against the wall , with his face blank and exsionless . His mind was quiet and empty too , but time r time he saw them go into the bar again as vividly as thetime . It was like a series of explosions in the quiet twi-t of his mind . He saw them again and again , Lew Lentzcably dressed , his blond heavy-lidded face under his brim ; and Mary , beautiful and cool and remote , anotheran in another world . She was wearing white that day , avery short white skirt swirling about her knees , and aP252tight-fitting high-buttoned jacket , and some sort of tiny ridiculoushat with a great bow of white net in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the exact shade of the big shiny leather purse that hung from a long strap over her shoulder . Seven steps or so those small shiny rose-colored pumps took across the sidewalk to the door , over and over again , seven steps or so , with a full white skirt swirling around her knees , and her white gloved hand tight in the crook of Lew Lentz ' bended arm , and her face turned to his face with a faint smile on her lips as he said something or other to her . Kenny was so angry that he did not know that he was angry ; the agony of desolation was so great in him that he could not recognize it . All that he recognized in himself was an old familiar and relatively easily satisfied need . Automatically he fingered the money in his pockets and estimated the amount , kind and brand of liquor best suited to his immediate financial condition . He started walking again , left the hotel behind him , and cut back down side-streets into a less polished section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor place , and spent what money he had on whiskey and soda , neat small glasses , one after another rapidly , getting no pleasure out of it . He drank in solitary splendor at the front table , and the proprietor himself , a man with a dirty white apron , waited on him . The proprietor was a taciturn thin-faced man with a prominent Adam 's apple and no taste for conversation . He read a detective-story magazine behind the counter , and Kenny brooded silently over his row of glasses . As the glasses marched across the table , and he began to feel the glow of the liquor in him , Kenny marveled that he could feel so disjointed and useless and unreal . Moods of deep melancholy were not commonwith Kenny . So now an excited hysterical voice inside of him kept chattering incessantly , " Pal , for the lova Mike , take it easy , why do n't you ? What 's getting into you lately ? ForP253God 's sakes , Pal , this ai n't no way for you to feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please ... " Kenny got sick of listening to that incoherent voice , so he drank down the rest of his liquor and left . His feet seemed to be heading for a definite destination , so he allowed them to take whichever way they willed . Although the sun still shone , he did not feel it now . He began to walk with a swift purposefulstride , and the perspiration came out on his face . When he found himself suddenly climbing the broad shallowsteps to the front entrance of Receiving Hospital , he was completely surprised , and stopped and stood still and wondered what had brought him here . He remembered Franny then , in that hospital some place in a bed , lying there and waiting to die , and that she wanted to see him , and that he had promised to visit her today . On his first impulse , he turned and started down the steps again . To hell with promisesand to hell with Frances Cope . If she was going to die , she was going to die , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to go and pay visits to corpses that lie in beds and talk ? And why must it be he that she wanted to come to her ? She had been with a lot of other men since she had been with him . And he remembered Jen 's story about it , that Franny was in love with him . He stood still and thought about that , and it seemed extraordinarily funny to him . He laughed silently and his raw bloodshot eyes danced in his face . He stopped laughing and coughed a little . Then he walked back up the steps rapidly , and straight in the front door to the information desk . He stated his business clearly and precisely , keeping himself in the meanwhile rigidly under control . From that desk a whole chain of motion was begun , involving several nurses , into elevators and out , and much walking down narrow , bare , unending corridors . The nurse brought him at last to a plain wooden door , exactly like so many other doors . They stopped there , and theP254nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was just coming out of the room . Kenny stood and waited , holding his body carefully erect and painfully still . In his mind he still saw them , again and again , Lew Lentz and Mary walking together across the sidewalk from the automobileto the door , smelled her perfume , felt the rhythm of her body , saw her smile into that smooth sleepy face . Kenny was tensed like a spring . He could not wait to get through that door into that room , with the nurses gone . Slow and dreadful music passed through his mind . He was damp with sweat and the palms of his hands prickled . There was a fierce sort of happiness in him now that cut away the smothering web of that indecisive melancholy . He felt now as he did sometimes when he was fighting with someone he did not like , and felt the soft yielding vulnerable flesh of his opponent under the bones of his hands . The nurse turned and spoke to him , rattling the doorknob in her hands . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him crisply , and she eyed him somewhat disapprovingly . " You may go in and see her now , Mr. Veech , " she said . " But remember , you must n't stay too long and tire her , nor must you say anything to excite her or upset her . She 's a very sick girl , you know . " " Yeah , sure , " Kenny said . He kept his eyes on the door , fascinated , like a cat waiting to pounce on a mouse . The nurse opened the door then and he walked into the room . White bare walls , and a window that the sun shone through , and a chair and a table beside the high narrow bed . Franny Cope looked at him with bright dark eyes from the pillow . " Hi , Kenny , " she said . " I was afraid that you was n't coming . . . " Her voice was low pitched and unnatural , as if her lips were so stiff that she could not move them . Her face looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was wound with white bandage . P255Kenny did not answer her . He pulled the chair back a little with a scraping sound on the floor and dropped into it . He sat sprawled out with his legs extended and his hands shoved deep in his pockets . He looked beyond her to the window , with his face relaxed and sullen and lowering . He coughed a little , but he did not speak . " Poor Kenny ! " Fran said tenderly , in her stiff unnatural voice . She even tried to laugh , an odd little broken sound . " You sure hated to come up here , did n't you ? It musta took a lot of beers . " He curled his lips apart over his teeth , but he still did not answer her or look at her . She looked at him fondly with her great dark eyes , studying him feature by feature , as if she photographed him now that she might always have the image of him . She laughed again , that peculiar soft broken sound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you to come , even feeling the way I do about you , if Jen had n't told me about the way you felt . I guess I musta been dumb or something . I never used to figure you cared nothing about me . " She watched him with her eyes liquid and soft and gentle with emotion . " It 's just about worth it , all this , to find out you cared about me . " He moved his body suddenly and impatiently in his chair . " I mean it , " she said , " I guess I wouldn'ta cared much about living anyway , if I couldn'ta had you . It makes it kinda hard now though , sometimes . . . " Her voice fumbled and broke over the words , " ... thinking about all we coulda had together if I did n't have to . . . " He sat up straight in his chair as if he was going to speak to her , and so she hurried on . " No , Kenny , I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel bad , I just wantcha to know how much this means to me . I know they done everything they could for me here , and it ai n't no use . But I ai n't worrying , and I ai n't scared much . You know why ? The doctors and all , around here , they 're all the time hollering about how brave I am and stuff . You know what makes me brave ? It 's because I 'm so happy I got you . I been wanting that so long . Now I know the way you feel about me , I ai n't scared of  --  kicking off . It ai n't gon na be like I 'm  --  dead  --  and  --  all alone some place . I 'll have you , so I wo n't be alone , never . And having you care about me  --  do n't you see  --  I 'll still be living  --  all the while you are , and after that I would n't want to anyway ... " " Oh , Jesus , God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You must n't feel bad about me , Honey , " Fran said to him tenderly . " I do n't want that you should . Do n't take on bad or nothing  --  after  --  it 's over . I want you should be happy , and after awhile marry some other girl and settle down and get a job and have kids and stuff . That 's the way I want it , Kenny , honest . And it 's always gon na be like I 'm . . . " Kenny got up out of his chair suddenly and let himself off leash , and felt all the savage joy of it . " Listen , " he said , " will yuh shut up that yawp , for God 's sakes ? " She stared at him wonderingly , her mouth a little open . He came nearer to the bed , coughing a little . " Look , " he said , " Jen musta been feeding you a lot of crap about me beingcrazy about you . Well , she was lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more nuts'n I figured you was . " " I do n't get it , " Fran said in an empty voice . " Jen said  --  she told me how ... " " Oh , sure , " he said , " I know . She give you the works . She told you just what you wanted to hear . Some folks believe in doing that , lying to folks before they die to make ' em feel good . Well , I do n't , see ? And I do n't want you shooting off your mouth up here all the while about me being in love with you . Hell , I do n't care nothing about you . I never did . I never woulda , so shut up your trap about it , see ? "
