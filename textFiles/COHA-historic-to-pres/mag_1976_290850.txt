" You 've got hope and you 've got life . " Such was the consolation offered to 15-year-old Caril Ann Fugate 17 years ago by her grandmother just after the sobbing teen-ager was sentenced by a Nebraska court to life imprisonment . The court had found her guilty of aiding Charles Starkweather in one of the most savage and sensational crimes of the 1950s : a two-day rampage of murder and violence that trailed blood across two states and left ten dead in its wake . True to her grandma 's sage prophecy , Caril last week was given her freedom . <P> The Starkweather murder spree , which inspired the 1974 movie Badlands , began in January 1958 , in Lincoln , Neb . For no apparent reason , the 19-year-old bandy-legged high school dropout shot to death Caril 's mother and stepfather and clubbed to death her two-year-old half sister in the family 's rundown frame house . The two teen-agers quickly went from killing to killing , all without motive . The victims : a 70-year-old bachelor farmer , a teen-age couple , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traveling salesman . The epidemic of shootings turned Lincoln into a horrified city under siege . People were afraid to go to work or even take out the garbage . Some townsmen were armed and deputized to patrol the streets . Eventually authorities nabbed the two desperadoes in Wyoming . <P> Loaded Guns . Starkweather was the first to stand trial ; he was found guilty of murder and was executed on June 25 , 1959-the last person to be electrocuted by Nebraska . Throughout her trial , Caril pleaded her innocence , insisting that she was held hostage by the crazed boy and feared for her life if she tried to leave him . Charlie , however , told the jury that she was a willing participant in the killings and could have escaped a number of times when he left her alone with loaded guns . The jury apparently agreed with Starkweather . <P> While Caril 's attorneys filed petitions requesting a new trial , she busied herself at the Nebraska Center for Women , completing her high school education , reading more than 1,000 books , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabby " column in the institution 's paper . Her spotless record earned her the privilege of going bowling , swimming and ( occasionally ) shopping in the town of York . After exhausting her remedies for retrial , Caril began seeking a reduction in her life sentence . Three years ago , the Nebraska Parole Board , citing " her age at the time of the tragic event , " recommended commutation of the sentence ; it was later cut to 30 to 50 years , thus making her eligible for the parole that was granted last week .
