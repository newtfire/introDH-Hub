At its best , pro football has become a beastly game , overgrown to the point that last season 's 263-lb. center for the Washington Redskins was summarily judged too small for the post this year . " Strength " coaches credit the Nautilus exercise machines , but not even Jules Verne could stand beside a modern lineman and imagine this is a product of natural nutrition . The rate at which these superhuman beings injure one another has gone beyond the level of an epidemic , and the extent of the owners ' compassion was expressed last week by the wife of Jack Kent Cooke . Asked if her husband gets upset when a Redskins player is injured , Suzanne Elizabeth Martin replied , " Certainly , yes he does , just as if one of our racehorses was hurt . " <P> Over the past two weeks , of course , pro football was not at its best . Nine- tenths of the regular players remained on strike for a principle  --  free agency , or possibly a larger dignity  --  while the richest few soldiered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough this time , the owners filled out their rosters with the ready surplus of football majors still nursing old college dreams on loading docks and in convenience stores . ( How many of them there are standing by ! ) Included were a prisoner or two , along with a couple of prison guards for competitive balance , but only one man under indictment for murder . <P> About 28% of the National Football League 's long-standing customers showed up to sample the first bogus games  --  as many as 38,494 in Denver , as few as 4,074 in Philadelphia  --  while the television audience started out curiously strong ( just three or four rating points off the normal 14 ) but dwindled as the afternoon bore on and the novelty wore out . In 17 years , only one Monday- night program ever summoned less interest than the sans San Francisco 49ers versus the new New York Giants , though the show contained one exquisite moment . Beginning the second half , 49ers Coach Bill Walsh inserted a running quarterback and abruptly switched to a college-style " wishbone " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parcells took a double look and exploded in laughter . <P> A lot of people were laughing at the bartender quarterbacking the Bears , the stockbroker directing the Packers , at eleven sacks against one offensive line and a kickoff mistaken for a punt . Four punts were blocked for touchdowns . But the football was not as demonstrably bad as all that , just demonstrably not the best . Competition may be relative , but excellence fairly requires the stiffest opposition of the day . And excellence is the fundamental allure of sport . At the same time , the damage to the integrity of the statistics and the standings is probably being exaggerated . Traditionalists at first appalled by Gary Hogeboom 's record-tying five touchdown passes in Colts livery were surprised to find out that the 22-year-old record did not belong to Johnny Unitas , as anyone might expect , but to a dentist who used to back him up , Gary Cuozzo . Anthony Allen 's record 255 yards ' worth of Redskins receptions left Charley Taylor 's and Bobby Mitchell 's historical places undisturbed ; Newcomer Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
