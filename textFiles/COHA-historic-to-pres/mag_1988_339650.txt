Willie Horton . Black . Murderer . Rapist . Most valuable player in George Bush 's no-holds-barred bid for the White House . <P> Of all the tactics used by Bush 's strategists to brand Michael Dukakis a gooey liberal out of touch with mainstream values , none worked better than the relentless pounding of Horton 's horrible tale . By the end of the campaign , scarcely a voter had not been exposed to the lurid details of the rapacious spree Horton committed while on weekend furlough from the Massachusetts prison to which he had been sentenced to life without parole for a brutal 1974 homicide . <P> Like most attack ploys , there was a grain of truth to be exploited : the prison-furlough policy used by Massachusetts went beyond the boundaries of common sense . Unlike other states and the Federal Government , which usually employ furloughs to gradually acclimate prisoners near the end of their sentences to living outside the walls , Massachusetts granted weekend leaves to convicts whom judges had condemned to remain behind bars until they died . Horton is precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say someone should lock him up and throw away the key . <P> It was one of Dukakis ' rivals for the Democratic nomination , Tennessee Senator Al Gore , who first unearthed the furlough policy as a campaign issue . The fact that it was inaugurated by Dukakis ' Republican predecessor is irrelevant . As Governor , Dukakis stubbornly resisted attempts to rescind furloughs for first-degree murderers until a drive to ban such leaves through a state referendum gathered steam . By then , the presidential-primary season was under way . <P> If the Republican assault on Dukakis ' furlough policy had stopped with making these valid points , Democrats and blacks would have no just cause for complaint . But the Republican attack did not stop there . Instead , Bush 's handlers tapped into the rich lode of white fear and resentment of blacks that the G.O.P. staked out more than 20 years ago , when the party of Lincoln recast itself as the embodiment of the white backlash . It started with Barry Goldwater railing against Earl Warren 's Supreme Court and civil rights legislation . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courted voters with a " law-and-order " harangue . Ronald Reagan kept it up with his allusions to " welfare queens " and the " strapping young buck " using food stamps to buy a T-bone steak . <P> The fear of crime is , to be sure , deeply implanted among Americans of all races . No group is more victimized by street thugs than the law-abiding citizens of the ghetto . Doubtless the G.O.P. would have exploited Dukakis ' furlough policy if Horton were white . Yet the glee with which Bush 's campaign team leaped upon the Horton affair belies its denials that it intended to tweak white prejudices . In Horton , Bush 's staff found a potent symbolic twofer : a means by which to appeal to the legitimate issue of crime while simultaneously stirring racial fears .
