There was a time when the lowly and cheap paperback tucked on a drugstore rack was lavished with high praise , ranked in the revolutionary stratosphere with the advent of the Pill , or at the very least , air-conditioning or color television . <p> Publishers gleefully compared the 1939 beginning of the contemporary American paperback revolution ( " Let them read paperbacks ! " ) to that earlier French revolution ( " Let them eat cake ! " ) . And students of the late 1950 's and early 1960 's were duly labeled " the paperback generation "  --  a baby boom of masses raised on Dr. Spock 's " The Pocket Book of Baby and Child Care " and inspired by copies of " Catcher in the Rye " that seemed engineered to fit in blue-jean pockets . <p> But today there is less room in those pockets or , perhaps , some top publishers speculate , the aging eyes of that generation are growing a little dim for the printed type of the purse-sized , mass-market paperbacks , which were once promoted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , the number of mass-market paperbacks sold in the United States has declined by almost 9 percent , falling to 484 million copies last year , about three times the percentage loss in consumer books over all . And the immediate future offers little comfort ; the publishers ' research arm , the Book Industry Study Group , is projecting continued slight annual declines for the paperback market over the next several years . <p> With the average price of a paperback climbing toward $7 , the $1.5 billion market for the books remains profitable . But it has increasingly been losing ground to discounted hardcovers , which chains and independent bookstores generally prefer to stock along with quality trade paperbacks , which are larger and more expensive than ordinary mass-market paperbacks . <p> The paperback has also been buffeted by other forces  --  the consolidation of the wholesalers who stocked mass-market paperbacks in the nation 's supermarkets and drugstores ; sagging public interest in paperback-friendly genres like westerns ; the general aging of the industry 's biggest group of customers , and the declining popularity of mall stores that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also enough unproved theories in the publishing industry to fill a paperback chapter . Are people devoting less time to casual recreational reading and more to books offering professional enrichment ? Are people simply reading less ? Or are they getting their reading fix from audio book tapes or the Internet ? <p> " You 've got a business that hit a wall ; it 's still a business , but no one can figure out how to make it grow , " said Jack Romanos , the president of Simon &; Schuster , which owns Pocket Books , the paperback publishing house that started the business in 1939 with the experimental publication of " The Good Earth " and " Wuthering Heights . " <p> " Culturally , " he said , " we should care because I believe that the paperback is the logical entry into the reading place . " <p> Since 1993 , the ubiquitous 4 1/4-by-7-inch mass-market paperback has slipped from 39 percent of book purchases in the United States to 36 percent in 1997 , according to the most recent report from the Consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while generally sluggish , rose to 31 percent of the market , from 28 percent . The same survey noted declines in paperback sales in outlets from supermarkets and drugstores to warehouse clubs and discount stores . <p> Confronted with that climate , paperback publishers have taken a variety of approaches , starting with the occupants of the top executive suites . Within the last two months , Gina Centrello , the president of Pocket Books , departed after 16 years with the company and reappeared as the new head of a rival paperback publishing house , Ballantine . Soon after , Pocket Books hired its new president and publisher , Judith Curr , a top executive from Ballantine who is taking over a unit which saw mass-market paperback revenues fall more than 4 percent last year . <p> Some paperback publishers have responded to reduced demand by trimming the number of titles that they offer and shipping copies more cautiously than in the halcyon days of paperback publishing , when shipments of a book like Jacqueline Susann 's " Valley of the Dolls " could reach 15 million copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grisham , marquee authors today are generally more likely to sell in the range of one million to three million copies . <p> That makes some publishers wistful for the volume that was . " I do think these changes have had an effect , " said Esther Margolis , the publisher of Newmarket Press and Ms. Susann 's former publicity representative , who believes that people were clearly reading more then . " Paperbacks were available , instantly available . If the covers were enticing , people who had never read books before read them . They were n't intimidating . They were little books that had pretty little covers and they were inexpensive and you could throw them away . It demystified the book for a lot of people . " <p> Avon Books , a paperback publisher owned by the Hearst Corporation , now ships 25 percent fewer copies of paperbacks than it did five years ago . At the same time , according to Avon 's publisher , Lou Aronica , it has cut the number of titles it publishes by 10 percent , to about 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner Books have also cut down the titles they offer . Some have tinkered with price reductions without making much difference in sales . And generally they ca n't reduce prices sharply because of fixed costs for paper , shipping , author advances and the expense of unsold books returned by booksellers . <p> " Twenty-five years ago , we used to sell 8 to 10 mass-market paperbacks for every hardcover that we sold , " said Laurence J. Kirshbaum , the chairman of Time Warner Inc. ' s trade publishing group , which includes Warner Books . " Now the ratio is a 2-to-1 relationship . So there 's been a tremendous transformation . <p> " The paperback market has settled in at a certain core , and it does n't seem to be growing , " he added . " And what we 've done at Warner is refine our distribution and cut . Something has been lost here in the sense that what used to be much more of a truly mass-market phenomenon has become more specialized and to some extent more elitist . " <p> The contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1939 , when Robert de Graff , an ambitious publisher , introduced a line of plastic-laminated books that sold for 25 cents each . <p> Within a few years , Mr. de Graff 's company , Pocket Books , and its kangaroo mascot , Gertrude , ushered in the paperback revolution , creating an alternative mass distribution network . It moved beyond the elite carriage trade of existing bookstores and turned to a sprawling network of magazine distributors who took books to where Americans walked  --  thousands of newsstands , candy stores , cigar shops and food stores . <p> But with consolidation in the 1990 's , these distributors have dwindled from a high of about 700 companies to a handful and the result is that they are stocking fewer books . <p> So if readers are buying fewer paperbacks , where has their attention been diverted ? One prevalent theory is that they are spending more time on competing diversions such as exploring the Internet . <p> Albert N. Greco , an associate professor of business at Fordham University who follows the publishing industry , said there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In 1997 , for the first time , consumers spent more on home videos than books , a narrow gap projected to increase through 2001 , according to figures from the Statistical Abstract of the United States . The same figures show that consumers have increased spending for on-line access to the Internet , but those expenses are still less than spending on home videos and books . <p> " This is how people are voting with their dollars , " Mr. Greco said , referring to the abstract 's data . " The average American spent $88.79 buying or renting videos and spent $88.09 on books . That 's less time and fewer dollars being spent on reading . " <p> But readers still spend enough on paperbacks to convince publishers that it remains a viable business . " Like Broadway , it 's that fabulous invalid , and every day there are rumors of its demise , but people keep showing up , " said Irwyn Applebaum , the publisher and president of Bantam Books . <p> At least one publisher has returned to the very roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zacharius , founder and chairman of Kensington Books , the second-largest publisher of romance novels , keeps searching for new sales outlets  --  the critical element that powered the growth of Pocket Books and the paperback revolution . <p> On Valentine 's Day last year , his company tried pitching romance-club memberships to a QVC cable television audience , an effort that did not succeed despite the heart-tugging efforts of one of his authors . <p> At age 75 , Mr. Zacharius has struck a deal to distribute a line of black romance books through distributors of cosmetics aimed at black women . He is also negotiating to stock his new line of Latino romance novels in bodegas through **26;369;TOOLONG distributors in California . <p> " I 've read this all the time that it 's tough to compete , " Mr. Zacharius said . " They 're crazy ! We 're competing . We 're growing . We 're more successful than last year . The truth is that this is garbage . I really think that people in the mass-market field can not forget two words . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantra in a scene from " The Graduate " : " Mass market . " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com
