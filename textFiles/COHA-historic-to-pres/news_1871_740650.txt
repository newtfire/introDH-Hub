The following letter has just been made Public : NAVY DEPARTMENT , t WASHINGTON . March 21. 1871. 5 To Rear-Admiral S. P. Lee , Commanding North Atlantic Fleet : ADMIRAL : I herewith inclose a copy of a letter which purports to have been addressed on the 24th day of February last by the officer commanding the Tennessee to Hon. BENJAMIN F. WADE , Chairman of the Commission . sent to San Domingo on that vessel , and which was published in the correspondence of the NowYork Tribune on the 17th day of the present month . As the orders to the commander of the Tennessee were simply to carry the Commission on their expedition to such points as they might desire , and contain nothing further of general instruction or direction . I naturally feel somewhat doubtful of the authenticity of this letter : but , as it has been published as authentic , and contains much which is calculated to mislead the people and authorities of San Domingo as to the true spirit and extent of the orders of the Executive to the naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers in command of those vessels , I have thought it right to correct the unfounded ideas therein contained through you , the commandant of the fleet in those waters . You will perceive that in this letter the writer assumes in effect that if any person connected with the Commission was taken prisoner by the opponents of the Dominican Government within their lines , he would be in reality a spy , and might , under the rules of civilized warfare , be treated as such , because the United States has , in the opinion of the writer , through the orders of its Executive to the naval vessels there , chosen to take part in the internal conflicts of the Dominican Republic . This statement is unfounded in fact and inference , and has evidently been made hastily , in ignorance of the real circumstances in the case , or in nueapprehension of their legal effect . The United States is dealing with the regularly-constituted Government of the Dominican Republic in a manner and for a purpose not inconsistent with international law ; and though the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheres in every people , vet the constituted Government is , until it is actually overthrown , the legal representative of the nation in all its relations to other people , and the right of revolution does not carry with it to the revolutionists , pending their contest , their right to treat the agents of other nations as enemies when not in arms against them , while they are acting , as they have an international right to act , in accordance with the laws of the existing Government . Such treat vent , without a formal notice , is contrary to the rules of civilized *warfare , and the notice , if given , is at the peril of the insurgents , and is justified only when the disturbance rises to the dignity of a revolution . But neither the United States nor its ExecuVve has chosen to take part , or has taken part , in the internal conflicts of the Dominican Republic . The situation is this : The President of the United States has , by the Constitution , the right to make treaties , subiect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , in 1866 , appropriated a considerable sum of money for the understood purpose of acquiring by lease or purchase a part of the Island of San Domingo . The Bay and Peninsula of Samana were considered most appropriate for our purpose as a naval station , and the Republic of San Domingo itself , with its favorable position and natural resources , its friendly Government and people seemed , for the purposes of commerce and civilization , far the most desirable for us of those fragments of our ' Continent which lie across the gateways of our : domestic commerce and shut up the entrance to our great inland sea . To initiate all treaties is the constitutional right of the President , and thus he had the constitutional power to negotiate treaties for the cession of Samana and the annexation of the Dominican Republic . It , upon proper consideration , be thought it right and for the interests of the country , whose interests are to this extent intrusted to his judgment , it was his constitutional right . He did negotiate such treaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government both de facto and de jure . These treaties were . of course , inchoate and subject to be confirmed or defeated by the action of the Senate of the United States and of the people of the San Dominican Republic , but by such treaties and pending such final action , the United States acquired an interest in the thing negotiated , from which he could not be rightfully disturbed by any other Power , and it was the plain duty of the Executive to protect , if need be , the integrity of this constitutionally acquired interest , so that the subject of the negotiation might remain intact until the final action of the ratifying powers could be properly had . This duty is plain and in every case of valuable acquisition , the execution of it will be expected and approved by the people . It was in the discharge of such duty that , in the early part of the present century , President MADISON marched the armies of the United States into , and actually took possession of , the territory then known as West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which territory negotiations were then pending , and afterward concluded and settled with Spain . This action was approved by Congress and the people , not as an exercise of war power , but as the protecting of an interest constitutionally acquired , and in which the Executive was bound to maintain intact while it remained in use . In the present case the President has hitherto only pursued , in relation to the Republic of San Domingo , this same recognized policy of our Government , and under the treaty and by means of an appropriation by Congress far such purpose . we took possession of the Bay and Peninsula of Samana . This possession we still hold , and while our flag flies there we must protect from every interference the interest which it represents . In carrying out this recognized policy , the Government of the United States has not tired a snot nor landed a man in hostile attitude on the Island of San Domingo , and has neither interfered in the internal conflicts or the Dominican Republic nor coercea any other Power . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such as appeared in a threatening attitude , itsdetermination to protect , until finally disnosed of , the interest it had acquired in that Republic from all attacks from without its boundaries , and from the interference of any foreign Power , so that , in the event of the treaty being ratified , there would be left the thing contracted for , with no hostile possessions intervening to destroy our right of preemption . To do this : s certainly not to make war . or to take part in the conflicts of a country , nor to coerce , nor to attempt to coerce , any Power . It is but the simple pertormance of a duty to Congress and to the nation in the preservation , in its existing condition , of what we have eonstitlitionally entered into negotiations constitutionally to acquire . Under the orders of the Executive , it is a part of the duty of those ships of your fleet which are at any time cruising in the waters of San Domingo to maintain this status against every Power , and while we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful Government , we can not concede that right event to the weakest .
