F Scott Fitzgerald told us there are no second acts in American lives . Fortunately , TV is not life . And ever since Ozzy Osbourne 's and Jessica Simpson 's comebacks , TV has been doling out second and third acts like Halloween candy . Eccentric Charlie 's Angel Farrah Fawcett , p.r . queen Lizzie Grubman and gossip-beset Britney Spears have done reality shows . Kirstie Alley responded to being the butt  --  so to speak  --  of tabloid fat jokes on Showtime 's sitcom Fat Actress . This summer scandal magnets Tommy Lee and Bobby Brown remind us who they are on NBC and Bravo , while next fall Martha Stewart further pays her debt to society on The Apprentice . <P> Then there 's Valerie Cherish , whom you 'll recall as the star of the seminal late- ' 80s , early- ' 90s sitcom I 'm It . O.K. , you wo n't recall her : she 's a character , played by ex-Friend Lisa Kudrow , on the HBO sitcom The Comeback ( Sundays , 9:30 p.m . E.T. ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity desperate to get back in the spotlight . She keeps her old TV Guide cover and a portrait of her Leno appearance framed in her house like a shrine to a former , dead self . She gets a chance to land a network sitcom  --  playing the prudish aunt on a lame-brained sex comedy  --  if she 'll also do a reality series about her comeback . She signs up because , she says , " Reality TV is the reality of TV . " <P> Kudrow has a different take . " Reality , " she says , " is humiliation TV . " Humiliation  --  how much of it a person will take for fame  --  is the point of The Comeback . Kudrow invented a similar character years ago , when she was in the Groundlings improv group . After Friends , she called Michael Patrick King , recently executive producer of Sex and the City . They decided to put Valerie in the two worlds most treacherous for a 40-year-old actress : reality and sitcoms . " The sitcom world is male-dominated , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Kudrow , 41 , only a year out of TV 's most popular sitcom , is not exactly a comeback candidate . But , she says , " I have had moments I worked through years ago where I felt I had to be sexier , to lose weight or that I was supposed to get on the cover of such-and-such magazine . " As King puts it : " Forty-year-old doctor ? Great . Forty-year-old professor ? Great . Forty-year-old TV star ? Dinosaur . " So Valerie 's hyper-self-consciousness  --  she 's constantly signaling " time out " to the cameras during uncomfortable moments  --  is like an animal 's defense reflex . Her image is her life . The reality crew manipulates too : the producer makes her repeat a line , suggesting , " I just think your reality could be a little more excited . " <P> The scenes will ring true to anyone who has wondered how much reality a celebrity reality show can actually reveal . It 's hard to imagine Martha Stewart relinquishing control of her pruning shears , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ; these shows succeed by offering at least the illusion of access and authenticity . Fans want to feel the celebrities have earned redemption by abasing and laughing at themselves ; we need to look down on them before we return them to their pedestals.
