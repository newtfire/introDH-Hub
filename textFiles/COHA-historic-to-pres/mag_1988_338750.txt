Farmer Charles Phelps knows he is lucky . His corn crop was days away from disaster when a pair of isolated rainstorms came breezing through Hastings , Iowa , dumping a bit more than 6 in. of rain on his parched fields . " Now it looks like we might have a crop after all , " says Phelps . Some 360 miles to the east , Herb Steffen of Cropsey , Ill. , laments that he has not seen enough rain " to settle the dust , " much less nurse his corn crop though its critical pollination period . " It 's heartbreaking to watch crops die in the field , " says Steffen 's wife Georgia . <P> And so it was throughout the U.S. Farmbelt last week . While a few fortunate areas were blessed with rain and even an occasional thunderstorm , most of the nation found little relief from the drought that began in the spring . Just how much damage the prolonged dry spell has already caused was the subject of a preliminary crop forecast issued by the U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 may be only 212 million metric tons , down 24% from 1987 . The corn crop is particularly hard hit  --  26% smaller than last year . The USDA pegged soybean production at 1.65 billion bu. , down 13% . Wheat output is expected to decline 13% , to 1.84 billion bu . That drop would be much worse were it not for the winter wheat crop . Planted last fall and almost completely harvested , winter wheat largely escaped drought damage . But the smaller , spring wheat crop has been devastated , and could be less than half its normal size . <P> Though discouraging enough , the USDA report may understate the problem . " The commercial surveys will doubtless be bolder , and lower , than those of USDA , " says Conrad Leslie , one of the nation 's leading private crop forecasters . Leslie predicts a corn crop of 4.4 billion bu. , 800 million bu. less than the USDA estimate . A survey by the National Corn Growers Association is even more pessimistic , predicting that this year 's corn yields will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The USDA estimates assume normal weather for the rest of the growing season , even though most long-range forecasts , including those of the National Weather Service issued last week , predict no break in the hot , dry weather . Chicago 's commodities-futures traders tended to believe the worst . Prices for corn , wheat and soybean contracts surged after the USDA forecast was released . <P> The impact will soon be felt at the supermarket , but it may not be too severe . The USDA estimates that retail food prices will rise no more than 5% this year . One reason : much of this year 's grain shortfall will be made up from stocks set aside during past bountiful harvests . <P> That will be little consolation for the farmers whose crops have been wiped out . Responding to their plight , Washington is rushing to pour money where too little water has fallen . A pair of drought-relief bills designed to distribute at least $7 billion is moving through Congress . Farmers who lose more than 35% of their normal crop would be reimbursed for 65% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put on the disaster benefits so that large corporate farms would not benefit disproportionately from the legislation . Drought relief has the full support of President Reagan , who last week visited the Midwest drought belt . Speaking at the fairgrounds in Du Quoin , Ill. , the President said , " We ca n't make it rain , but we can help ease the pain . "
