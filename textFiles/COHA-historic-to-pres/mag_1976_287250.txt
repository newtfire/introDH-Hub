By Latin American-or indeed any-standards , the Mexican peso has been a remarkably stable currency . Since 1954 its exchange rate has not budged from 12.5 to the dollar . Mexicans were understandably astonished , therefore , when Treasury Minister Mario Ramon Beteta suddenly appeared on their TV screens last week to announce a change . From now on , he said , the peso would float freely-in other words , its value would be determined by supply and demand . <P> Though Beteta was careful to avoid saying so , the move amounts to a massive devaluation . By week 's end the exchange rate sank below 20 pesos to the dollar . That might lure many more American tourists to sample the delights of Acapulco or poke around the Aztec ruins near Mexico City , since their dollars will buy more in Mexico . But it will also hurt the many other Americans who have poured investment money into Mexico , seeking interest rates of 12% or more . <P> Bankers and businessmen were not overly surprised by the news . Rumors of a peso devaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge Mexican trade deficit ( $3.7 billion in 1975 ) , stubborn 15%-a-year inflation and high foreign debt ( $13 billion ) . A devaluation was also sought by tourist operators , whose business declined 4% in 1975 , owing largely to price increases that had made once cheap Mexico City as costly for Americans as many European cities . Said President Luis Echeverra Alvarez : " In the end , there will be more jobs , more production , more exports and more tourism . " <P> Perhaps , but the peso 's sharp devaluation could also do harm in Mexico . Prices of the $6.6 billion worth of consumer and capital goods that Mexico imports will rise sharply in peso terms . In the wake of Beteta 's announcement , many sales clerks worked until midnight changing the price tags on merchandise . At the Puerta de Liverpool department store , for example , refrigerators went up 20% overnight , color TV sets more than 30% . To ease the burden , Echeverra has already promised raises for workers , civil servants and pensioners-a generous but inflationary move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the investors who have poured billions into peso-dominated bonds and savings accounts . At the old exchange rate , for example , $2,000 would have bought a 25,000-peso bond that at 12% would pay interest equal to $240 a year . At 20 pesos to the dollar , the bondholder 's principal has shrunk to $1,250 , and his interest to $150 a year .
