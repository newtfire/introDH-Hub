At 8:15 on the morning of Aug. 6 , 1945 , Dr. Fumio Shigeto was waiting in line for a trolley to take him to Hiroshima 's Red Cross Hospital . A nurse he knew waved to him , inviting him to join her near the front of the queue . Not wanting to push ahead of the people in front of him , Shigeto declined the offer . At that moment there was a blinding flash , followed by a deafening boom . Most of the people in the line were hurled to the ground , burned and bleeding . Shigeto , who was sheltered by the corner of a reinforced-concrete building , survived unscathed . <P> As one of the best-known of Hiroshima 's " atomic doctors , " Shigeto , now 72 , has spent the 30 years since that dreadful day caring for the victims of history 's first atomic attack . He has refused almost all requests for interviews . Last week , following his retirement ( to settle in a home on the outskirts of the city and " raise carrots with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME Correspondent S. Chang and reminisce about his escape-and the work it enabled him to do . <P> Flash-Boom . For Shigeto , the job of treating Hiroshima 's survivors began moments after pikadon ( Japanese for " flash-boom " ) . For a moment he paused , listening to the screams of pain that filled the air , and asked himself , " God , how on earth could a single doctor handle this mountain of patients . " Then , although stunned by the explosion , Shigeto knelt , opened his black bag and began to treat the man lying at his feet , only to yield to the victim 's pleas that his wife be treated first . After administering first aid to the couple , Shigeto turned his attention to the others in the immediate vicinity . Many of them were hideously burned ; the streetcar stop was only a mile from ground zero , well within the " zone of death " where the fatality rate exceeded 50% . <P> Shigeto worked his way toward the fringes of the holocaust in the center of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated that first day , but vividly remembers the feeling of frustration that overtook him as he emptied his bag of supplies , then began tearing up his shirt to bandage the injured . Says Shigeto : " I realized how terrible it is to be a doctor and to be unable to do anything at all to the hundreds of wounded and dying all around you . " <P> Late that night , Shigeto reached home to find his wife and two children safe . But his reunion was a brief one . Five of his 27 colleagues at the hospital had been killed in the blast ; for the next two months Shigeto was so busy treating survivors that he could not return home to visit his family . <P> Deadly Radiation . Like most Hiroshimans , Shigeto wondered what kind of a weapon could have wrought such havoc on his city . But unlike most , he had an idea . On the second day after the explosion , he had some X-ray plates brought up from the hospital 's storeroom , still in their lead case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remembered an article he had once read in a science magazine and concluded that his city had been hit by an atom bomb .
