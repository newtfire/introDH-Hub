As Aeroflot Flight No . SU 229 prepared to take off from Moscow to Amsterdam last week , Russian Writer Andrei Amalrik tucked his Siamese cat Disa under his arm while his artist wife Gyusel accepted a farewell bouquet of red peonies . KGB agents darted in and out of the small crowd assembled at Sheremetyevo Airport , snapping pictures of the couple taking leave of their desolate friends . <P> The scene marked the end of a historic decade of dissent in the Soviet Union . Since 1965 the KGB had conducted a campaign to fragment Russia 's " democratic movement for human rights " by imprisoning or exiling its members . Amalrik , 38 , was the last of his generation of celebrated protester-intellectuals to succumb . At Moscow airport , Physicist Valentin Turchin , a longtime Amalrik friend , explained that although a whole new group of lesser-known dissidents had sprung up to replace the old , " Andrei 's departure is a pity for us ; he is able to draw much attention to our movement . " <P> Amalrik electrified Western readers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , which prophesied the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. as a result of internal upheaval and war with China . Over the past decade this and other writings published only in the West cost Amalrik two terms in concentration camps and two stretches of Siberian exile . After his return a year ago from eastern Siberia , he was offered the choice of publicly repudiating his book or exile . Refusing to do either , he was placed under constant KGB surveillance , frequently picked up , interrogated and threatened . Finally he agreed to go West . His departure , originally scheduled for late June , was delayed when he balked at demands by the Soviet Ministry of Culture that he pay a $5,400 export duty on various art objects , including paintings by his wife , whose work was officially unauthorized . <P> On his arrival in Amsterdam , Amalrik said he looked forward to a " normal life , " planned to write a book on political terrorism and to lecture in Holland and the U.S. He also expressed fears for the new crop of dissidents he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , " he said , citing the recent fatal mugging of Poet Konstantin Boga-tyryov , the Russian translator of Rainer Maria Rilke who had protested against Soviet civil rights violations . While the scholar was dying of a fractured skull in the hospital , Amalrik went on , KGB agents ordered the doctors to " fix him so he will come out an idiot , " then threatened the physicians when they refused to comply with their order . Still , Amalrik expressed hope that he could continue to struggle against repression . " My leaving the Soviet Union is not exactly a victory , " he said . " I would call it a tactical retreat ; I have retreated in order to strike back in the future . "
