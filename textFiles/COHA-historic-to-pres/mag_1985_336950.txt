Comedian John Belushi . Gangster John Dillinger . Nobel Biologist Francis Crick . All are classic Type T personalities , and so , fittingly enough , is television 's Mr. T. <P> As Psychologist Frank Farley of the University of Wisconsin tells it , many of the world 's daredevils , doers and delinquents share a common personality , Type T ( for thrill seeking ) . Whether scientists or criminals , mountain climbers or hot-dog skiers , says Farley , all are driven by temperament , and perhaps biology , to a life of constant stimulation and risk taking . Both the socially useful and the socially appalling Type Ts , he says , " are rejecting the strictures , the laws , the regulations  --  they are pursuing the unknown , the uncertain . " <P> Farley , 48 , has spent 20 years of study to reach his Type T theory . In one series of tests with student volunteers at Madison , Wis. , he made a connection between drinking and thrill seeking . While non-T personalities may drink to grow numb , Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruptively while under the influence . Says Farley : " It 's experimenting with forbidden fruit . " He finds that Type Ts have twice as many automobile accidents as non- Ts , and many even make a point of driving while drunk for the added excitement and risk . " We have become accustomed to the idea that Type A individuals are dangerous to themselves , " says Farley , referring to the shorthand designation for hard-driving people who have a tendency to heart attacks . " Type T individuals are doubly dangerous  --  to themselves and others . " <P> Farley 's work is in a field of research known as arousal studies . A major assumption of researchers is that a broad curve traces the susceptibility to stimulation in the general population : at one end of the spectrum are those who need excitation ; at the other end are people who feel so overwhelmed by the normal stimulation of everyday life that they devote themselves to avoiding any further stress , risk or adventure . This avoidance group would include those who are comfortable with routine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might belong in the non-T category as well , although available evidence is inconclusive . <P> Farley , who classifies himself as a moderate T , thinks there is a physical predisposition toward risk taking and says a few studies of identical twins support the notion . Another psychologist , Marvin Zuckerman of the University of Delaware , also proffers a physical explanation : Zuckerman says sensation seekers may have distinctly different brain chemistry . Despite their various emphases , researchers in the field generally reject the idea that risk takers are acting compulsively out of a neurotic need or a desire to solve a psychological problem . <P> Farley also believes that the U.S. has developed into a Type T nation . Since the country is largely made up of the descendants of immigrants who took the supreme risk of uprooting themselves to come to the New World , he says , the nation 's genetic stock and national culture should be heavily Type T. " If I 'm right on that , " Farley conjectures , " we should be an enormously vital nation with both T-plus , creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrepresented . " He adds , " We should  --  and do  --  have very high crime rates relative to many other countries of the world . "
