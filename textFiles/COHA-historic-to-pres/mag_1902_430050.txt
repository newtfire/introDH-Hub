N reaching the Mobile corn pany , then playing in Montgomery , Alabama ( 1858 ) , I found Mrs. Stoddart delighted with the South . Humphrey Bland was the stage-manager and Mr.and Mrs. George Pauncefort werethe leading man and woman . The company was a good one . It was arranged that I should begin as Max Harkaway in " London Assur ance . " My wife brought the part to me , and with it a letter telling me of the death of my mother , a sufferer for years , without hope of recovery , from the dreadful malady of cancer . The letter told me how thankful she was to be released , and how , at the end , she had blessed her three sons and my father , who had stood by her bedside , and had desired her blessing to be conveyed to her " boys " in America , and while expressing the assurance that she knew the separation would be but brief , she passed away . A better woman was never called to a better place . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her years of misery I ought to have felt relieved that she had done with it all , but I could not feel so . I cried like a child , and it was in this state of mind that I had to take up my new charac ter , and endeavor to learn the words for the following night ? a breezy , laughing , jolly part , for which I was in but poor humor Many actors have been similarly placed , and upon like occasions have had to take up a laughing part with a sad and heavy heart . I have omitted to say that my father 's corn ing to America , so late in life , proved to be a mistake . He played for a short time in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia : He had acted with Miss Agnes Robertson , befor she became the wife of Dion Boucicault and , when a company was made up by Mr Boucicault to play in New Orleans , my fathe was engaged in it . At the end of the New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw my mother again . WITH EDWIN BOOTH IN BALTIMORE . WE accepted an engagement for the next season with Mr. John T. Ford at Baltimore , and , in the meantime , went to Montreal for the summer . Mr. Buckland , who had managed the Montreal theater for many years , was accustomed to begin his seasons at the close of the theatrical season in New York . Buckland 's season having ended , we returned to New York , and from there went to Baltimore to enter on our engagement with Mr. Ford . Edwin Booth was the first attraction . This was the first time I had ever met him , and I had the pleasure of acting with him afterward at the Winter Garden in New York . He played a long time in Baltimore that season , and I acted with him in all his plays . For a person so eminent and so greatly admired , he was the mast gentle , unassuming , unostentatious man I had ever met . During this season I participated in an exceedingly interesting performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his younger brother , John Wilkes Booth , as Richmond . Both performances were superb . I shall never forget the fight between Richard and Richmond , in the last act , an encounter which was terrible in its savage realism . Our season was nearly over when Mr. Dion Boucicault and his wife Agnes Robertson came . I was cast for important parts in all their plays , and , I suppose , must have acquitted myself satisfactorily , as Mr. Bou'cicault told me , toward the end of his engagement , of his intentidn to build a theater in New York , and offering to engage Mrs. Stoddart and me in his coln- pany . Mrs. Boucicault , who had acted s much with my father , was kind to me dur ing these days . On one occasion she said o me , in the hearing of Mr. Boucicault , " Mr Stoddart is very good in this part , and h puts me in mind of his father . " I thought i a great compliment . I had seen my fathe when he was acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired his acting , not alto gether , I hope , from the fact that he wa my parent . AN ATTEMPT TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE . MR . BOUCICAULT caused me to feel a little less cheerful by remarking that , in his opin ion , my principal fault lay in the fact tha I was " always the same " in everything I did . " Stoddart , " said he , " is always Stod dart . " He then said that an artist , a true artist , should sink his personality , even leav ing the audience in doubt as to his identity There was some truth , I suppose , in his remarks regarding " Stoddart always being Stoddart , " but , having been a stock actor all my life , and having , as a stock actor , of necessity played many different kinds of roles , it was not very gratifying to be told that I turned up the same old six and eightpence on every occasion . I took this criticism to heart , and tried hard to metamorphose myself somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in my personal appearance , were not altogether successful , the following incident may serve to illustrate . At the old Union Square Theater , during the run of " Ferreol , " in which I played Martial , a gamekeeper who has cornmitted a murder , there is a fine trial scene , in which another person is accused of the crime . The gamekeeper , during this scene , is seated down the stage . He has not many . words to say , but can , by looks and facial expressions , convey much to the audience . On the first night I put on a heavy beard . After the performance , Miss Ida Vernon , who had seen the piece from the front , said to me : " Oh , Mr. Stoddart , what did you wear that abominable beard for ? It took away all your expression . " The next night the gamekeeper was beardless . Again , when we played " Alabama " at the Madison Square Theater , I was Colonel Preston . I remember discdssing the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How do you think you will be in your Southern dialect ? " said one . " Well , I do n't know , " I replied . " You know I have been in Mobile . " " Well , " said my son , " you can alter your face a little this time , anyway . As this character is a colonel and a Southerner , why not appear , for once , in a mustache ? " And so I was persuaded to wear one , thinking that it would alter me and be much in character . I made Preston a very old man , wearing a bald white wig and a heavy white mustache . Before the production I dressed at home , as was my custom , and presented myself , in costume , to my family . " By Jove ! " said my son , " I should n't know you . " I believed him , for I scarcely knew myself . Upon the opening night , and before the curtain went up , I had adjusted my wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the play , came into my room . " Ah , governor , " he was just beginning , when he noticed my make-up . " Good Lord ! " said he , " what have you got on your face ? " I ventured to explain that my family were of the opinion , which had also lately become my own , that in every part I undertook I always looked the same , and that , " Alabama " presenting a favorable opportunity to alter my face a little , I thought it advisable to wear the mustache . Mr. Thomas would have none of it , and insisted that I should take it off , saying : " God bless you ! the people want to see you just as you are . " So off it came . I have often seen one or the other of my associates thoroughly disguised in acting , so that recognition was difficult . I am afraid , though , I should have to change myself to a great extent before I could conceal my identity . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women of my profession , and I recall that many of them . had unmistakable mannerisms and marked personalities ; some of them were wonderfully talented , but no one of them ever left the observer for a moment in doubt as to his individuality . So I have tried not to worry over the fact that I am so much like myself . A REAL-ESTATE COMEDY . I REJOINED Laura Keene in 1862 . By this time we had saved a few hundred dollars , and , Scotsman-like , I had made up my mind , as soon as circumstances would permit , to try to buy a home for ourselves . Miss Julia Gould , a professional friend of my wife 's , had bought land at McComb 's Dam , near High Bridge , over the Harlem River , which at that time was far out of town . Here she had intended to build , but circumstances had prevented her doing so , and we  | bought the property . I went to look at it , and was delighted with the location ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , gloating over our new purchase , the site of our prospective home . There was an old woman living in a shanty on a lot next to ours , who was most anxious to sell . After my mother 's death my father had again come to America , and was living with us in Hudson street , at the corner of Leroy . Many and many a time we walked together to the High Bridge property , admired it , and then walked back . My father , in his sanguine way , would say : " Jim , if you can only raise enough money to secure that old woman 's lot , you will have an ideal home , and I do n't see why you can not act , and live in it all the year round . The Eighth Avenue cars will take you a long way out , and then the walk for the rest of the way is trifling , I have n't forgotten my trade , my boy father , it will be remembered , had been apprenticed to a carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had agreed with the old woman on a price for her property , my father had prepared a plan for a house , and we were very enthusiastic and confident . In a most cheerful frame of mind , away we went to select a site for the house . My father had just finished pacing off the number of feet , when there appeared upon the scene an uncouth young person who said to my father , " Look here , old man , what are you doing ? " My father said , " Jim , you had better talk to him . " I endeavored to explain that it was our intention to build a small house , but he interrupted me with : " Yes , I have been watching you both bobbing around here for some time , and trying to get my mother to sell you her lot ; but that lot ai n't hers . It 's mine , and it ai n't for sale . You will ha 've a high old time if you try to put up any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old scalawag " ? indicating my father ? " coming around my mother , trying to get that lot away from me , I ' 11 put a bullet into the pair of you . " I do not remember our reply to this polite young gentleman , but I do recall that we lost little time in leaving High Bridge and its beautiful surroundings . My father , when we had reached Eighth Avenue , said , his views regarding the desirability of High Bridge as a residential district in the meantime having completely changed : " Jim , I do n't think it will do . That fellow means what he says . Besides , it is really a long way " out ; I do n't see how you could possibly act , and live so far from the theater . " How 1 characteristic of the man ! Some years after , 1 I sold the lots to Mr. Charles Hale , in those days a well-known actor . ALL THE DELIGHTS OF A HOME . I HAD , however , no intention of giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one morning , soon afterward , we read in a newspaper an attractive advertisement , from which it appeared that a Mr. William Elton had purchased a portion of the estate of Gouverneur Morris , of the well-known New York family of that name . This he had laid out into lots , which he purposed selling on the instalment plan . He called his property " Wilton , " and it comprised five or six acres of land , situated between One Hundred and Thirty-sixth and One Hundred and Thirty-eighth streets , and bounded on the east by what is now the Southern Boulevard and on the west by St. Ann 's Avenue , then known as Cherry Lane . Through it , at that time , flowed a pretty little stream , which has now become Brook Avenue . Mrs. Stoddart and I went out to see Mr. Elton . I thought myself in luck , he met us so pleasantly . I made known to him my plan , and was advised to take six lots in One Hundred and Thirty-eighth street . He would let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill overlooking Port Morris , the cream of the property . Mr. Elton walked with us to show the lots . I do not think I had ever seen a more beautiful site . The time was spring ; the roads and lanes were lined with cherry-trees , all in bloom . Gouverneur Morris 's mansion stood on the right , and Mr. Crane 's villa on the left , with the little St. Ann 's Church near by . The Brother Islands showed in full view in the Sound . It was all very beautiful , and a sight long to be remembered . It was from here that we saw the Great Eastern after her first trip . We lost no time in buying the property . I think we were to pay two hundred and fifty dollars per lot . As we had only one hundred dollars , Mr. Elton kindly agreed to accept that amount , and to receive the rest in instalments , giving us a little book in which he would credit the sums we should pay as the payments were made . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoicing , and week after week I journeyed out to Wilton and gave Mr. Elton as much money on account as I could spare . My wife had a friend who had advised us to build , and he offered to meet the payments neces- sary for that purpose as they fell due , taking a mortgage on the property as security . I availed myself of his kind offer , and made my contracts for building . I was to pay two thousand dollars for the work . I also made a contract to dig a well , at seventy-five cents per foot for excavating dirt and five dollars per foot if excavation should have to be made through rock . When the house was under way , and the first payment due , my wife 's friend wrote to say that circumstances would make it impossible for him to advance the money as agreed , and at the same time wo was sent to us that after digging out a few feet of earth the contractor had encountered rock in the well . Here was disappointment . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure , but also that I should find myself deeply in debt . But " it ' s a long lane that has no turning , " a=A honesty of purpose usually comes out all right in the end . On explaining our position to Mr. Elton , he told us to go ahead with our house , and that he would foot the bills . He did so , and thus in the spring of 1860 we were enabled to move into our new home . I was happy in being able in a small way to repay Mr. Elton for his kindness , for I was instrumental in bringing others of my profession to Wilton . Milnes Levick bought property and built there , as did also Edwin Eddy , Mark Smith , Henry F. Daly , Mr. and Mrs. France , and others . I being the pioneer , Mr. Elton gave me the credit of bringing them all to his property . We lived in Wilton for seven years , part of my Winter Garden career , and a great part of the time while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey from the theater to my home was long , and in those days tedious . It took an hour and a half to reach Wilton by way of the Third Avenue street-cars , from Bleecker street to Harlem Bridge , which was of itself , in the old horse-cars , a long journey , added to which was the discomfort of frequently having to stand up all the way . On reaching the bridge , the worst of our journey was yet to come , for , there being no means of conveyance on the other side of the river , we had a walk of about a mile and a half before reaching our house . I thought very little of it at that time , but now , as I look back upon those days , I wonder how we ever accomplished the task . We had to face this journey in all sorts of weather . Mrs. Stoddart for a time was also obliged to endure a like hardship , but , as my position improved , we decided that it was better she should leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the road alone . In all weathers , by moonlight , in darkness , in rain and snow , for seven years , I nightly pursued my pilgrimage to and from the theater . I was resolved that nothing should stand in the way of accomplishing my purpose of having a home of my own , and not being able to afford it in the city , this was the best thing I could do . UP AND DOWN MANHATTAN ISLAND IN HORSE-CAR DAYS . DURING this time I encountered two very disagreeable experiences . One was in the month of March , 1862 . I was with Laura Keene , and one night there was a tremendous snow-storm . After the performance the storm had become so fierce and the snow so deep that no cars ran upon the Third Avenue line . I stood , with Charles Peters , James G. Burnett , and Miss Couldock , who all lived in Yorkville , at the corner of Bleecker street and Third Avenue , waiting , but in vain , for a car . At last we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but none came , and we kept on until we reached Yorkville , looking as though we had arrived from the arctic regions . We saw Miss Couldock to her home , and Burnett and Peters did all they could to persuade me to remain with them until the morning . I knew , however , that my wife would be worrying . about me , so I pushed on , and walked the remainder of the distance to Wilton . I arrived at home at four o'clock in the morning , and was a sight to behold . I had on a loose talma coat , which stood out as stiff as a board , and my hair and eyebrows were covered with ice . After having taken a glass of hot grog , I felt little the worse for my venture , although many people would think it an undertaking to walk from Bleecker street to One Hundred and Thirtyeighth street even on a pleasant day . The next morning the sun came out in all his glory , the sky cleared , and soon scarcely a vestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , during my stay at Wilton , while I was going home on a dark night , I heard footsteps approaching me from behind , a thing that always made me uncomfortable . I accelerated my speed , and so did the person following me . It was so dark and lonely that I did not know exactly what might obcur , and I thought I would get rid of my pursuer by crossing to the  | other side of the street . He dogged my footsteps , however , never speaking a word , nor did I , until we came to Cherry Lane and the burying-ground of St. Ann 's Church . Then he crossed over to my side of the way and approached nearer . I must say I felt very creepy . He was tall , with a pale face , and be wore a slouch-hat , and had his arms crossed upon his breast , his hands in the inner pockets rattling something that sounded like keys . For some time he did not speak , but at last he said , " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt my hair gradually rising , but managed to say that , as I had never done any one any wrong , I ought not to fear . He then told me that he had been confined in an asylum , and that people thought him mad , but that he was not . I now made sure that the supposed keys were fetters . However , by this time I had reached my own gate , which , as I opened , he tried to enter . I succeeded in getting inside and closing the gate , but he still persisted in endeavoring to get in . I told him that he could not , as he would frighten my wife . " Ask her if I ca n't come in , " he said . I eluded him , however . The door of the house was opened ; I bolted in , and quickly fastened the door . For more than an hour he walked up and down on the piazza , to our great discomfort . My wife 's brother , who was visiting us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years at sea , and therefore bolder than I was , volunteered to get rid of the intruder , and going out with a stout stick , drove him away . Next morning we learned that the houses of two of our neighbors had been broken into and robbed , and although we had no positive proof , we suspected that my road-companion was the burglar . This was my early experience of Wilton . In time the place grew a little , Mr. Levick building next to me , Mr. Eddy below him , and Mr. France putting up a house , as did Mr. Daly . Mark Smith sold his lots . There were others of the theatrical profession who located there , and the place came to be known locally as " Actorsville . " In the course of time my cottage became , in its modest way , a beautiful place . I planted trees and many shrubs and vines , and had a little orchard of dwarf pears , and a trellis of grapes around three sides of the house . Moreover , the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self miles and miles from New York . My two little chaps were born here . The house stood on a hill overlooking the Sound , and , despite the long tramp from Bleecker street , I always felt well repaid for my fatigue on seeing the light in the window , which served as a beacon to guide me to the home I had struggled so hard to obtain and so greatly loved . That I was the owner even of so modest an estate filled me with pride . I thought I should never leave it , but , ah , how little we know of the future ! Mrs. Stoddart 's health began to fail , and as the doctor told me that the salt air from the Sound was injurious to her , she suffering from asthma , I decided that we must leave the place . A person living at West Farms had taken a fancy to our property , and was anxious to purchase it . At first I scouted the idea , but as my wife 's health was now the main consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to New York . A HIT IN THE CHARACTER OF " MONEYPENNY . " I REMAINED with Laura Keene until she retired from the theater , and Mrs. John Wood became the new manager . After Mrs. Wood retired , Mr. Leonard Grover took possession of the house , and several members of the company continued with him , of whom I was one . Following " The Master of Ravenswood , " Boucicault 's drama of " The Long Strike " was produced . I had some disagreeable words with Mr. Grover , in consequence of his having cast me for the part of Moneypenny in this play . I had read the criticisms on the London production of the piece , and Mr. ? Emery , who played Noah Learoyd , was highly commended . As he occupied in London the same position that I did with Mr. Grover , that of characteractor , I considered that it was not proper for Mr. Charles Wheatleigh to play the part of Noah , for which he was specially engaged . I thought it unjust , and said so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first performance I was glad that he had not done so . In searching for some means of making the part of Moneypenny as effective as possible , I hit upon a nervous , crabbed , and fidgety way of playing it , that made the character stand out and did me more good , in the way of advancement , than anything I had previously done . Mr. Wheatleigh was capital as Noah Learoyd , and so it turned out that Mr. Grover knew better how to cast the play than I did . " The Long Strike " was a success . McKee Rankin , James Ward , Charles Vandenhoff , and Kate Newton played in it , and contrib- uted largely thereto . Our manager had ar ranged to bring in his opera company , and we had to give place . It so happened tha Mr. Tilly Haynes , the proprietor of the theater in Springfield , Massachusetts , wit snessed a performance of " The Long Strike , and being pleased with it , he sent a note to my dressing-room , inquiring if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the play to Springfield for a week . Our season a the Olympic having been brought thus abruptly to an end , we were all glad of this chance to prolong it , so we gob togethe and agreed to start out on our own account as a sort of commonwealth . We opened in Springfield , and played to fine business for a week . Afterward we visited all of the New England cities , making a long season , and returned to New York rather better off than if we had been employed there all the winter A COUNTRY HOME IN NEW JERSEY . AFTER leaving Wilton , and in pursuance o my ruling passion , I had made another ven ture and bought a small farm near Rahway in New Jersey . I was still bent on having a country home , but this time we had decided on living in the city during the winter months . We had not resided long in the city when we lost our elder boy , and having an idea that had we remained in Wilton we might have escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befall our other children , we determined to make the country our permanent home . We therefore took up our residence at " Avenel , " as the farm was called , where we remained for twenty years . I rejoined Mr. Wallack in 1867 , remaining with him for seven years , and all that time living at Avenel . My opening part at Wal lack 's ( the house afterward called the Star , and recently razed ) was Marall , in " A New Way to Pay Old Debts , " in which E. L Davenport was the Sir Giles Overreach ? a masterly performance . When a youngster in Aberdeen , I had played Marall with Gus tavus V. Brooke , and his performance made a great impression on me ; but Mr. Davenport 's impersonation , I think , was equally great with that of Brooke . Mr. John Gil bert played all the principal old men , and therefore I found myself allotted to a line of eccentric characters , splendid parts , but such as I never expected to be called upon to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr. 011apod in " The Poor Gentle man , " and Dr. Pangloss in " The Heir-at Law . " Not having had the advantage of a classical education , I dreaded Pangloss , filled as it is with quotations from the dead languages ; however , I obtained a letter of introduction to a skilled linguist , who coached me in the pronunciation and meaning of the Greek and Latin quotations , and , as no fault was found with my efforts , I presume I could not have been altogether bad . I often wonder how I succeeded in mascering the words of all my parts . Living as I did in the country , I was a commuter on the railroad , and , during all the time , attended to my duties at the theater , including rehearsals , after which I went by streetcar to the ferry for Jersey City , and then nightly by train to the station at Rahway , which was distant from my home about two miles . There my man would meet me , sometimes with a carriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an extra saddlehorse , on which I would ride home , often arriving there as late as two o'clock in the morning . And this I did for twenty years . Many of my associates at the theater frequently said that they would not go through such an experience for all the farms in Jersey . Alas ! many of them are dead , and I scarcely need say that I am much alive yet . AN EXCURSION INTO HORTICULTURE . I HAD been so fortunate with my few peartrees at Wilton that now , being in possession of about forty acres , the opportunity presented itself to go into it " big , " and I resolved to do so . I read all sorts of agricultural literature ? " Ten Acres Enough , " and " Pear-culture for Profit , " written by Mr. Quinn , who lived on Professor Mapes 's old place at Waverly , New Jersey . I understood that Quinn had a splendid pear-orchard , and as pear-culture was my ambition , off I went to interview him . He took me through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in bloom . I was enchanted . As Mr. Quinn was a theater-goer , he knew me , and I having told him of my ambition to become a pear-grower , and having asked his advice , he gave me good counsel as to what varieties to plant . I explained that it was my purpose , when the orchard became sufficiently remunerative , and I had reached the age of sixty years , to leave the stage , and to pass the evening of my days in attending to the marketing of my fruit , in communion with my family , and at peace with all mankind . Mr. Quinn thought my plan an excellent one , and advised me to plant only two  | varieties of pears , the Bartlett and the Duchesse d'Angouleme , telling me that I could grow the latter as easily as potatoes and that in the ' market they were worth five dollars a barrel . I was delighted and flew home to Mrs. Stoddart , growing enthusiastic over my interview with Mr. Quinn . She thought there might be something in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter th1tt I did . It was her idea that I should plant a few at first , and see how they turned out . " Why , my dear , " I said , " that would be of no use at all ; it is the great quantity planted , and all coming into bearing at the same time , that is going to do the trick . " Mrs. Stoddart was always the treasurer , and seeing my anxiety , she fell in with my views , dear soul , as she always did , and surrendered what cash we had on hand available for my project . I ordered pear-trees by the thousands . We planted our orchard on a beautiful eastern slope , where we could overlook it from our veranda , and when all was completed , I surveyed the work with satisfaction , saying to my wife , " There , my dear ; by the time I am sixty our orchard will be in full bearing , and then I need act no more . " Ah , the fallacy of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? well , the orchard has gone . I pitched in manfully every moment I could spare , and was always to be seen , hoe in hand , among my trees . Year after year it was my custom to leave the farm early in the morning for rehearsal at the theater , after which I would return home , remaining there only a short time , and again retrace my steps to the city for the evening 's performance , closing my day 's work by the midnight trip home again . I had by this time an important position in the theater , long parts in nearly every piece , and a frequent change of program . I have of late so often been nervous and ill at ease , in spite of having ample time for study and weeks of preparation in rehearsal , that I have wondered how I got through the work in those days under the circumstances that I have mentioned . Perhaps it was because I was then forty and in the prime of life . T00 LATE AT THE THEATER . IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those long journeys , I never failed but once of being on time for duty at the theater . This was during the run of " Rosedale " at Wallack 's , in which I was playing Bunberry . Cobb , a part originally acted by Mr. George Holland . My train was on time , but something happened to the ferry-boat that caused us to flounder and float about in the North River . It got to be a quarter to eight , then eight , then half-past eight o'clock , and I was distracted . I rushed first to the captain , then to the engineer . " I am , " I said , " an actor ; I belong to Wallack 's . Oh , ca n't you do something to get me ashore ? My absence may interfere with the entire performance . " The captain was too busy about his boat to listen to me . The engineer did , however , and laughed . We eventually reached Desbrosses street after half-past eight . As I found no car at the ferry-house , I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally reached the theater , at Thirteenth street . Charles Fisher and I dressed together , and we had a dresser known as " old Edward . " Fisher was not acting , and Edward had neglected to report my absence from the theater , so that my cue to go on had been given , and I was not there . I was in my dressing-room , and all excitement , when Mr. Wallack came in and began to blow up poor old Edward for not reporting my absence from the theater . I interceded for him , saying that I alone was to blame . Mr. Wallack interrupted me by saying : " I wo n't say anything to you , Stoddart ; see the state you are in ; but , d ? n it , you should n't live in the country . " I dressed and played the remainder of the part , and the incident closed . Lester Wallack , like his father , conducted his theater on the most liberal principles . Fora whole season James W. Wallack and E. L. Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking , and all in the most agreeable way . Charles Mathews also played an entire season , and without more prominence being given to him than to the most minor member . A lady of my acquaintance was talking to me , not long ago , about the old days at Wallack 's , and of the plays produced there . she mentioned particularly Robertson 's plays , saying she should never forget the performance of " School , " the beauty of the stage setting , not so often seen then , with its rural landscape and fountain of real water , the young school-girls , etc . Then she went on to name the players in the cast , calling them all " dear . " There was " dear Mr. Gilbert , " " dear Mr. Fisher , " " dear Owen Marlowe , " and " dear Mrs. Vernon , " " dear Mrs. Jennings , " and " dear Effie Germon " ; and there was Mr. Stoddart as the hateful old teacher Krux , who , she said , was not dear  | at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compan ions ! I was glad to hear they were not for gotten by my friend . A TWENTY YEARS ENGAGEMENT . WHEN I returned to New York after a luck less starring tour which began in the fall o 1873 , I happened to go to the Union Squar Theater to see " Led Astray . " During th interval between the acts I met Mr. A. M Palmer in the lobby , and he asked me if had as yet had enough of starring . I tol him that I had not found it profitable . " Yo had better come to me , " he said . The relsul was that , after some discussion regardin terms , I was engaged as a member of th Union Square Theater Company , and th association thus begun lasted for nearl twenty years . It was thus that I dismisse the notion of being a star . In this matter of starring , I often thin how conditions have changed since the ol days . It is not now so much the ability o the reputation of the aspirant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at tractiveness of the play in which he appear ? not so much the individual as the materia in which he appears : now , as never before " the play ' s the thing . " I suppose if I ha been provided with a new a'nd attractiv vehicle for my venture the result might hav been different . However , what I lost in dol lars I have certainly made up in comfort I have been enabled to remain almost con stantly in New York , the haven for whic we all strive ; I have had the longest metro politan career of any actor now upon th stage , and I have had the pleasure of bein associated with the best companies ; I hav also served the best managers , from the elde Wallack to the present time ; and , above all I have been enabled to pass a long life a home , in domestic happiness . So , when look backward to the beginning of my caree in New York , I feel that I have much caus for gratitude as that career draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I HAD been thrust into eccentric comed with Wallack , and upon my advent in th Union Square Theater Company I wa obliged again to change my line of business for Mr. Stuart Robson was the comedian o the company , and therefore I was put on fo character work . In the old days you had t try to make yourself like the part allotte to you , whether you were really suitable o VoL . LXIV. ? 35. not , so that my early training helped me at this time . " Rose Michel " was the play in which I appeared at the Union Square . In this I was Pierre Michel , a character of the class known as " heavy villains . " I told Mr. Palmer I thought the part somewhat out of my line , but he thought otherwise , and circumstances eventually proved that he was right , for I received much credit for my performance . I have an impression that I was largely indebted to the coat I wore for any success which I achieved . I had been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I described to the costumer what I wished , directing him to make a long gray coat which should reach down to my heels , explaining that my part was that of an old miser , and that I wished my dress , as far as possible , to convey the character of the man . So I said , " Make it loose and heavy , so that I can slip out of it in a second . " He professed to know exactly what I wanted , and set to work to make the garment . When I received it I was disgusted . It was a clean modern overcoat , with a bright muslin lining . However , I determined to make it what I wanted , so I took it out to my farm and spoiled its beauty with Jersey mud . Mrs. Stoddart then tackled it , lined it with some heavy old material , jagged it with her shears , and then threw it into the cellar and made a mat of it until it was required . There is no difficulty in obtaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will have the appearance of great wear and look old , moldy , and weather-beaten , such as was necessary for the miser Pierre Michel . When we got through with that coat it was all I could desire , and afterward it was much extolled when I used it in the play . I sent my costume ahead from the country to the theater the day before our opening . We had no rehearsal , so I did not go in until evening , On reaching the theater , what was my consternation to learn that my clothes had not arrived ! I was almost distracted ; the overture was about to be rung in , and I had nothing to wear . I went to Mr. Palmer and explained my plight . He said : " Keep cool ; do n't excite yourself . You do n't go on until the second act . Hunt it up . If nothing else can be done , some one must lend you a wig , and you must get what you can out of the wardrobe . " The things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rushed to the company 's office , some distance from the theater . There I was told that the packet had been delivered . I flew back to the  | theater almost maddened . It was my first appearance in New York since I had left Wallack 's . I had a new part and a new mana ger . I had played only comedy parts , and was now to appear in an entirely different character , so I was naturally nervous ; and I had no costume . At the theater my costume was nowhere to be found . I tried the Morton House without success . I do not know what possessed me to look for it at the Union Square Hotel , but ? I did look for it there , and there I found it . The packet had been delivered at the wrong address by the express company ? a mistake occasioned by the similarity of names . The porter at the hotel volunteered to send it to the theater for me , but , once having recovered it , I would not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater , and luckily was able to get myself dressed in time . Mr. Palmer was glad to see me , and the company congratulated me on the recovery of my " props . " The play made a great hit , and my part went well , my reception being generous . And oh , that beautiful coat ! It proved all that I could have wished . Before committing the murder I threw it from my shoulders , and it slipped down to the ground and lay at my feet like a bundle of old rags . Mr. Nat Goodwin , who afterward played imitations , gave an excellent one of the way . I used to throw this coat from my shoulders during my performance . A DRAUGHT OF KEROSENE FOR STAGE WINE . MY contracts with Mr. Palmer at first were for a period of three years each . I think this arrangement was renewed three or four times , until Mr. Palmer said that he thought formal contracts between us were unnecessary , and so they were discontinued . I needed no written documents from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : his word was enough for me . I always tried , during my long service , to be as honest and straightforward with him . On January 23 , 1878 , " A Celebrated Case " was brought out . This was a notable production , and had a long and prosperous run . It enlisted the services of Charles Coghlan , Frank Hardenbergh , Parselle , Agnes Booth , Linda Dietz , Sara Jewett , and Mrs. G. H. Gilbert . I played Sergean O'Rourke . I have reason to remember this character . In the prologue I had a scene with Mrs. Booth , who played the wife of Jean Renaud , the hero , in the course of which she was supposed to give me , as the Sergeant , a cup of wine , which I had to swallow . It so happened that the property-man had been using kerosene on the stage during the day , and had left the bottle containing that liquid upon the dresser , where Mrs. Booth was in the habit of finding the drink for the Sergeant . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handed it to me , and I swallowed the contents at a gulp . " O Lord ! " I said , as I received the potion . " What have I done ? " said Mrs. Booth , under her breath . I could only gasp out , " Kerosene , " and made a hasty exit . For almost a week every one avoided me , owing to the presence of the noxious fluid . I drank such a quantity that the odor and taste remained with me until I thought I should never be rid of it . Otherwise it did me no injury , and my physician even said that it did me good . COURTESY FROM THE PULPIT . " DANIEL ROCHAT " was produced October 15 , 1880 , and ran until December 14 . Thorne in the title role and Miss Jewett as Leah each contributed a notable performance . The other parts afforded fine opportunities , and were well played by the principal members of the company . This play , which is religious in its character , concerns itself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Christian faith depicted by Leah , and it caused considerable discussion among clergymen as well as laity . We performed it in San Francisco , and when there the rector of Grace Church and the members of his vestry came to see it . I forget the clergyman 's name , but we all received invitations to attend his church on the Sunday following his visit to the theater . These invitations were addressed , not to us by name , but to the characters we represented , mine , I remember , reading , " To Dr. Bidache , " which was my name in the play . I availed myself of it , as he said in his note that it was his intention to make a few remarks by way of comment on the play . After hearing him I was glad that I had attended . He spoke of the great literary merit of the play , and how ably the argument between the Christian and the freethinker was handled by the author . He also drew our attention to what each had done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed , he said , to benefit his fellow-men . He then went on to point out that all institutions of a charitable nature every- where were undoubtedly the work of the Church , and owed their life and origin to Christianity , which is truly the case . He concluded by saying that he was almost as much interested , when at the theater , in the demeanor of the spectators as in the performance itself , and was much gratified to notice that alt the approbation and all the sympathy of the people were gained by the Christian girl . His remarks laid such hold on me that on every future occasion when I visited San Francisco I regularly took my place in Grace Church . HOW MANSFIELD WON FAME IN " A PARISIAN ROMANCE . " " A PARISIAN ROMANCE " was produced on January 10 , 1883 . Baron Chevrial , a striking and peculiar part , has since become well known as one of Mr. Richard Mansfield 's strong impersonations . The peculiar attributes of the part caused Mr. Palmer some doubt , for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr .. Mansfield had been engaged , but as he was comparatively untried in legitimate work , his position in the theater was thought to be a minor one . After the reading of the play , the company were unanimous in their opinion that " A Parisian Romance " was a one-part piece , and that part the Baron ; and all the principals had their eye on him . After some delay and much expectancy , the role was given to me . I was playing a strong part in " The Rantzaus , " and my friends in the company congratulated me upon the opportunity thus presented of following it up with so powerful a successor . Miss Minnie Conway , who was a member of the company and had seen the play in ' Paris , said that she thought the Baron a strange part to give to me . " It ' s a Lester Wallack kind of part , " she said . This information rather disconcerted me , but I rehearsed the part for about ' a week , and then , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Palmer and told him I felt very doubtful as to whether I could do him or myself justice in it . He would not hear of my giving it up , saying that he knew me better than I did myself . that I was always doubtful , but that he was ; willing to take the risk . He also read a letter which he had received from some one in Paris , giving advice regarding the production , in which , among other things , it was said that Baron Chevrial was the principal . part , that everything depended on him , and that " if you can get Stoddart to look well in full dress , he is the man you must have play it . " I left Mr. Palmer , resolved to try again and do my best . Mr. Mansfield was cast in the play for a small part , and , I discovered , was watching me like a cat during rehearsals . A lot of fashion-plates were sent to my dressing-room , with instructions to select my costume . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vagabonds , villains , etc. , I think those fashion-plates had a tendency to unnerve me more than anything else . So I. again went to Mr. Palmer and told him I could not possibly play the Baron . " You must , " said Mr. Palmer . " I rather think Mr. Mansfield must have suspected something of the sort , for he has been to me , asking , in the event of your not playing it , to give it to him . I have never seen Mr. Mansfield act ; he has not had much experience here , and might ruin the production . " At Mr. Palmer 's earnest solicitation I promised to try it again . I had by this time worked myself into such a state of nervousness that my wife interfered . " All the theaters in the world , " said she , " are not worth what you are suffering . Go and tell Mr. Palmer you positively can not play the part . " Fearing the outcome , I did not risk another interview with my manager , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a message to Mr. Palmer that I positively declined to play it . The result was that Mr. Mansfield was put in my place ; he rehearsed the part next day , and , with only a brief time for study and few rehearsals , made his appearance in it on January 10 , 1883 . The result is well known . His success was instantaneous and emphatic , so much so that , from then until now , Baron Cherrial has remained one of his strongest embodiments . ' Mr. Palmer was delighted , and I consoled myself with the thought that my refusal of the part had proved not only far better for the interests of the production , but was also the immediate cause of giving an early opportunity to one who has since done much for the stage . IN RECOLLECTION OF CHARLES COGHLAN . OUR next season at the Union Square began with Bartley Campbell 's play called " Separation , " a good production and a long run . During this season Mr. Palmer went abroad , and the firm of Shook &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took possession e the theater . They retained  | it for nearly two seasons , but were not as successful as they deserved to be . Sheridan Shook had been long associated with the theater . He was a straightforward , goodhearted man , bluff and without polish , but generous to a fault , and many were beholden to him for frequent kindnesses that have never become known . It was my privilege to be intimately acquainted with him in those days . When " Separation " had run its course Mr. Coghlan left the company , and it was our last professional meeting . 1 do not know that I ever met an actor that I admired more . During the run of " A Celebrated Case " I had frequent long talks with him . He was kind enough to speak well of my efforts on more than one occasion . I knew he was sincere , so regarded it as a compliment . " Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed . " I remained with Shook &; Collier until they gave up the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to America and resumed the management of the Madison Square Theater , . in Twentyfourth street . He had arranged with Mr. Henry Arthur Jones to bring out his play of " Saints and Sinners . " He sent for me and offered me an engagement , which I accepted , as I had ascertained from Mr. Shook that he meant to retire from the theatrical business ; so I signed a three years ' contract with Mr. Palmer for the Madison Square Theater Company . A HUMOR OF THE DOUBLE STAGE . THE Madison Square Theater at that time was fitted with a practical or double stage , the invention of Steele Mackaye , which worked upon the elevator principle . As each act ended , . one stage descended and the other , that had been set for the next act , came down and took its place , thus obviating the necessity of long waits . One evening , during the most pathetic scene of the play , that in which the minister hears of his daughter 's flight , when I was plunged in the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage upon which we were acting began to descend , and it continued to do so until only my head and shoulders were visible to the audience . I kept up my grief , hewever , until the mistake was rectified , and by the time I had reached the climax the stage was in its proper position . Of course the seriousness of the situation was done for . The other members seemed to enjoy it all from the wings quite as much as did the audience ; I think I was the only one who did not see the joke . STALLED IN THE GREAT BLIZZARD . WE produced a very pretty play called " Heart of Hearts " at the Madison Square on January 16 , 1888 . I had a long and very good part in it . I remember this play more vividly than any other of my experience , for it was played in the year of the great blizzard . I was living at the time on my farm in New Jersey , and on a Monday ? afternoon , in the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some hours be ' fore my usual time , fearing difficulty in reaching the city . The snow , however , was so deep , and the sleet and snow were drifting in such a furious and blinding manner , that I could scarcely see a rod before my face , and the cold was intense . I had a splendid , strong man with me who had been a Danish soldier and feared nothing . We started for the station at Rahway , two miles away , in a two-wheeled cart , thinking that the best sort of vehicle to get through the drifts . We had proceeded only a short distance when , in plunging through the drifts , the shafts of the cart broke short off . Nothing daunted , we returned to the stables , and directing the man to saddle two of my horses , I determined to endeavor to get through on horseback . So mounting , we started a second time . The drifts of snow were up to the horses ' shoulders , but being strong animals , they plunged through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer , about half-way to the village , the animals gave up and could go no farther . I can not begin to describe the difficulties and the pain we suffered . I wore a huge comforter about my shoulders and face , and that , together with my gloves , and in fact all my garments , were as stiff as a board with ice and snow . The horses being completely fagged out , we were obliged to put them into the farmer 's stable . As I was determined , however , to reach the theater at all hazards , I directed my man Hans to remain with the horses at the farmer 's until he could get them home again , and I started alone to reach the railwaystation on foot . I will not try to describe my difficulties on the way . The distance was about three quarters of a mile . I was frequently up to my waist in drifts of snow , holding on to the top of the picket-fences as I crawled along . finally I reached the vil7 lage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rail had stopped . The telegraph wires were all down , and communication with the city was therefore cut off ; so I could do nothing . I went to the hotel , where I remained for two days , being able to reach neither the city nor my home , and when at last I reached New York I could scarcely recognize it . Broadway looked like the arctic regions , with its mountains of snow , which in many places were tunneled , and fires built underneath to get rid of the enormous drifts . The theater was closed one night , so I missed only one performance of " Heart of Hearts , " and reported for duty the third . day after the storm . About this time I made up my mind that amateur farming and fruit-growing were not the most rapid way of obtaining fortune , so I parted with my farm . My pear-orchard had proved sadly disappointing ; but anticipation of a better result was for many years a fruitful source of pleasure . My love for the country has , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon a smaller scale , so even now I may be seen wending my way to Sewaren , another home place in New Jersey , where I have ? at least I think so ? a charming cottage overlooking Staten Island Sound , of course a garden , t yacht , and dear friends with whom I hope still to pass many pleasant days . On February 3 , 1892 , The Broken Seal " was produced . It had been played by Mr. Beerbohm Tree , in London , under the title of " The Village Priest , " and I believe suecessfully . It did not fare sie well in America . It was in this play that Miss Julia Arthur made her first appearance with the company , and it was also the occasiontof the first appearance of Mr. James K. Hackett in a part of any prominence on the professional stage , although as an amateur he had been well known for some time . In April of this year , and during the run of this play , I received the saddest blow of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my necessary absence from the performances gave to Mr. Hackett an opportunity which he much desired , for he was put in my place . On New Year 's eve of 1894 the drama of " The Fatal Card " was produced at Palmer 's Theater . I was loaned for this production by Mr. Palmer . I had heard rumors that Mr. Palmer would give up his theater and that he would retire from management , so I sought an interview with him , and found that the reports were true . Mr. Palmer told me that he found it impossible now to secure new and attractive material for his theater , and so thought it better to withdraw . He had been my manager for more than half of my American career ; during all this time he had been uniformly kind and generous with me , and however great his regret may have been in parting with me , I am sure it could not exceed mine in saying good-by to him . A LOVING-CUP . THE following season I was engaged by Mr. Charles Frohman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sporting Duchess . " During its run at the Academy of Music , Mr. Henry Mann , the business manager , came into my dressing-room one evening , and informed me that Mr. Frohman and my associates contemplated presenting me with a loving-cup , and wished to ascertain from me a few facts about my career , how long I had been on the stage , and so on . As I have never forgotten my debut in " The Rent Day , " when I was five years old , I told Mr. Mann that I had been sixty-three years on the stage . " Good Lord , man , " he said , " how old are you anyway ? " Of course I explained that I was not actually as old as the statement would seem to indicate . The episode of the presentment of the cup was an unexpected compliment . Mr. Frohman 's kind consideration in having my old manager Mr. Palmer make the speech of presentation , and his invitation to all the ladies and gentlemen of the various theaters to meet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our long association , together with Mr. Jefferson 's kind gift inscribed " For Auld Lang Syne , " are incidents in my life which will never be forgotten . " BESIDE THE BONNIE BRIER BUSH . " DURING my engagement with Mr. Charles Frohman , a friend of long standing had been reading with a great deal of pleasure the tales of Ian Maclaren , and was particularly interested in " Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush . " He came to see me at my cottage at Sewaren , and said : " Mr. Stoddart , before you end your theatrical career I want to see you play old Dr. MacLure . He is a great character . " I told him I thought it would be difficult to get Dr. Watson 's consent to having his stories put into dramatic form and produced . " Oh , " said my friend , " I know MacArthur of the Bookman . ' He ' s a Glasgow chap and a friend of Dr. Watson 's , and I am sure he can arrange it . " But MacArthur , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scotch minister , would scarcely consent to having his stories reproduced for theatrical purposes . My friend was persistent , however , and at length prevailed upon MacArthur to write to Dr. Watson , and we were all surprised and delighted at receiving his reply . It was to the effect that if the story could be dramatized effectively and well , he had no objection . On receipt of this letter , MacArthur , in conjunction with Tom Hall , set to work and produced a manuscript , which , when completed , Mac Arthur brought out to my cottage and read to my daughter and me . We liked it . It read well . It was the intention to make MacLure the prominent character of the piece , and the part was written for me . And he certainly is the most delightful person in the story but in the play he lacked situation , and the dramatic worth of Lachlan Campbell . I told the authors so , and for some time it remained a disputed question which of the two parts I should play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor . Since its produc tion , I feel that I did not err in my judgment It was pointed out to me , and I realized the truth of the remark , that during my long career I had wept over many daughters tha had proved disobedient and sometimes worse in fact , one of my friends , quite an ad mirer , had said : " Poor Mr. Stoddart ! I never see him act but he is heartbroken over the misconduct of some wayward and disobedient child . The last time I saw him , in The Sport ing Duchess , ' he was in a most forlorn con dition regarding the fate of his daughter Mary Aylmer ; and the time before he was completely upset at the imprudent behavior of his child in Saints and Sinners . ' " A little of " the same old man again , " I confess , but I console myself with the reflec tion that in my time I have played so many rogues and vagabonds , with quite a sprin kling of cutthroats and murderers , that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prudent to make my final bow in something of a more respectable nature Besides , Lachlan Campbell is not altogether a sympathetic or lovable person ; before his transformation he is quite the reverse . I had that fact brought home to me in Lancaster , Pennsylvania . One of the stagehands , watching the progress of the piece was highly incensed when in the second act I erase my daughter 's name from the Bible and forcibly eject her from the house . " Oh the old devil ! " said he to one of my associ ates . " Them religious fanatics are the worst I 'd like to knock the old villain on the head . ' In the third act , when Lachlan sorrows over the loss of his child , he found a better place in that critical gentleman 's esteem , and at the end of the piece , where he takes his daughter lovingly in his arms , was heard to exclaim , " The old man is not so bad , after all . " " The Bonnie Brier Bush " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple story , and its atmosphere is peculiarly congenial to me , reminding me of that part of Scotland ( Perthshire ) wherein its scenes are laid , and where as a boy I began my career as an actor . And if Lachlan Campbell is to be my last effort , what better vehicle than " The Bonnie Brier Bush , " which reminds me so lovingly of the beginning ? of it . THE OLD TIMES AND THE NEW . I HAVE been frequently asked for my opinion regarding the relative merits of performances and performers of the present day as compared with those of the old times . In fact , very recently a friend said to me : " Mr. Stoddart , you are an old-timer ; I remember you when you used to be at the Broome Street Theater with Wallack . Why ca n't we have such performances and such companies nowadays ? " I was unable to make a satisfactory reply . I endeavored , however , to explain that , although my long experience and my age truly classified me as an oldtimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1854 , trying always to keep abreast of the times and the younger element , and as far as possible to avoid being considered antiquated , I scarcely thought myself a proper judge . The scenical part is now much better than in the old days . The same old stock scenery , formerly used year after year , would be looked upon as a poor apology in these days of grand stage sets . The same advancement has been made in incidental music , and in fact in all the details connected with the conduct of the theater . To those , however , entering the theatrical profession , I say that I think the old system immeasurably better than that of the present time . As in all occupations it is well to be grounded in the rudimental portions of the work , so no less does this rule apply to the theatrical profession . There was no royal road to position in the old days , but most people had to begin at the bottom of the ladder and gradually ascend it ; and if one never climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself gave to him that re- pose , that ease of deportment , essential in the actor . Such discipline was formerly deemed necessary , and if , after submitting to it , you were not found particularly brilliant , you were at least experienced , which sometimes means much . In reviewing my career I see much to condemn , but , as an old-timer , having to try to keep pace with my younger companions , and thus to assume many parts of a varied character , it is scarcely to be ex pected that I should have proved satisfactory in all . I think , however , I can in all truth fulness assert that to whatever has been allotted to me I have endeavored always to bring sincerity of purpose , and whether good bad , or indifferent , have tried to serve the public to the best of my ability . Upon the eve of a new production I have often left home muttering over the words of some long part , and very doubtful as to the result of my efforts , and on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous for me than I for myself ? would say , " Well , how did you get on ? " And if I answered , as I frequently did , that I feared I had not done very well , " Nonsense ! " she would say . " How did your part go with the audience ? " When I would reply that I had received a good deal of applause , " Then , dear , " she would add , " you are all right . " And it is that thought of being all right with the public , that kind consideration and indulgence on its part under all circumstances , ever lenient toward my faults and quick to show appreciation of any merit I might possess , that has ever been my main support during a career of many years . So I said to my friend that although I endeavored to avoid being what is known as stilted or stagy , yet the old times , the many brilliant comrades who have left me behind , and the old days must ever hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger makes , As streams their channels deeper wear .  |
