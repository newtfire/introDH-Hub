DECEDENT ESTATE LAW . It Should Cover Wills of Persons Dying After Aug. 31 , 1930 . To the Edam of The Nctc , York . Times : Noting the editorial in THE TIMES of April 3 in which you comment favorably upon the new revision of the decedent estate law , and particularly point out the fact that under the new law the surviving husband or wife may choose his or her share in the estate regardless of the will , I am constrained to call your attention to the fact that this new law in this respect applies only to wills made after Aug. 31 , 1930 , and that consequently all wills now in existence or made prior to that time are not affected by it . The surviving widows in such cases will be denied this privilege which their more favored sisters may enjoy whose husbands ' wills are executed after that date . The injustice of this discrimination is apparent . It means that countless thousands of wives in this State whose husbands ' wills have already been made , or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied this right of election , and it means that for the next thirty years or more the wills coming on for probate will be grouped into two classes  --  those dated prior to Sept. 1 , 1930 , in one class and those dated thereafter in the other ; and during this long period of years we shall be operating under two laws so far as the right of election to the surviving widow is concerned  --  the widows in one group being denied this right , while those in the other group may exercise it . No existing will of a living testator is affected by this new law , and their wives must be satisfied with a legislative gesture and content themselves with the shadow rather than the substance of any supposed benefit . It certainly appears as if the members of the Legislature who voted for this bill first assured themselves that their own wills already made could not be upset by their wives . This law should be amended so as to apply to all wills of persons dying after Aug. 31 , 1930 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 1929.
