American farms will be better fertilized this year than ever before . The men who produce food for plants forecast that 18 million tons of nitrates . phosphates and potash will be put into the ground to grow sturdier . more abundant crops . Some see a 20 million ton market in a year or two . Last year the total was 16 million tons ; prewar consumption ran about 8 million . Fertilizer men contend the recent decline in farm crop prices wo n't discourage fertilizer use . Demand for food is so great and prices the farmer gets for his products remain very high . Confidence of the plant food folk is encouraged by what amounts to a revolution in the use of fertilizers . Not so long ago , they depended chiefly on cotton and tobacco growers for bread and butter business . Maine potato farmers in Aroostook county also were hungry consumers . But , surprisingly enough , the major farming areas of the country , the corn belt . for example , used comparatively little . Corn Is Foremost User . Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped to fourth place and corn has become the greediest single devourer of plant food . This is partly due to the fact that hybrid corn , now so widely grown . needs more fertilizer than other varieties . It produces more ears of corn , but takes more nourishment from the soil . Big new customers of the fertilizer mixers not only include farmers in the IllinoisIndiana-Iowa corn belt , but wheat farmers in Kansas . sugar beet growers in the great plains east of the Rockies . truck farmers and citrus orchards in Florida . California and Texas Thousands of scattered farmers feeding beef cattle on their pastures also have stepped up their buying . High crop prices , of course , have made it possible for everybody to use more fertilizer . But since pre-war years , farms in the east and south have increased their buying only about one third . Midwestern and western . farmers who once got along with little or no sto.e-bought plant food have jumped their buying four to 10 times . Illinois , for example , is using eight times the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much . Kansas three and a half times as much and Florida about double . High Prices Are Incentive Lofty prices provide the great incentive to produce bigger crops . Whether the corn belt farmer sells his corn or feeds it to his hogs , every extra bushel is worth two or three times what it was before the war . Farm labor is scarce and costly . This encourages the farmer to get the biggest crop possible from his acreage . A nationwide drive to educate the farmer to the benefits of using more plant food has helped the fertilizer business , too . State agricultural colleges , county agents , government experiment stations , and even local bankers and farm equipment makers have been preaching the gospel Recent government studies show , for example , that corn grown without fertilizer yields an average of 20 bushels an acre at a production cost of 69 cents a bushel . Proper plant food doubles the yield to over 40 bushels an acre and cuts the output cost to 32 cents a bushel . Fertilized pastures on an average add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed to about one quarter . Emergence of the middle west as a major new plant food buying area is bringing a shift in location of fertilizer factories . Most fertilizer mixing plants in this country used to be along the east coast and the Gulf of Mexico . There they could benefit from cheap water transport of the heavy tonnage of phosphate rock mined in Florida . nitrates imported from Chile or made synthetically in Virginia , and potash once brought from Germany . Three States Get 23 New Plants . Now new mixing plants are springing up all over the western hal : of the country . Since the beginning of the war 23 new ones have been built in Illinois , Indiana and Iowa and 15 in California . Sixteen have gone up in Florida . Three of the biggest fertilizer makers . American Agricultural Chemical Co . International Minerals &; Chemical Co. and Virginia Carolina Chemical Co .. all have new corn belt plants . New factories have been built in Idaho , Oklahoma , Nebraska and Utah . Fortunately fertilizer men do n't have to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , thanks partly to American chemical brains and engineering skill . The United States has more reserves of plant food materials than any other nation . World War I stimulated the U. S. to develop its own potash deposits : World War II improved cheap synthetic nitrate output here . The three chief raw materials for chemical fertilizers are phosphates , nitrogen and potash . Blended , they make the mixed fertilizer the farmer buys Phosphate Most Widely Used The biggest item is phosphates , with use running around 8 million pounds or more annually . These are made by treating phospl  --  ate rock , found chiefly in Florida and Tennessee , with sulphuric acid . Reserves are almost unlimited ; half the state of Florida , some fertilizer men say , conlains phosphate rock . Phosphates supply phosphorous to growing plants : this stimulates root growth , hastens ripening of grains and fruits and seed formation . Nitrogen is the next biggest seller . It gives the healthy dark green color to flourishing plants . improves leafy crops and provides nourishing proteins . Nitrogen itself is the inert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to the farmer in the form of compounds , such as nitrates or ammonia . The biggest source of nitrogen used to be natural deposits of sodium nitrate in Chile . Another big source is ammonium sulfate , made by the steel industry in its batteries of by-product ovens which produce coke for steel furnaces along with chemical by-products . Allied Chemical Sc Dye Corp . has a huge synthetic sodium nitrate plant in Hopewell , Va . Since the war the United States has acquired some huge new chemical sources . Enormous additional supplies of nitrogen were needed for explosives so new plants were built to make ammonia an a combination of nitrogen in the air and hydrogen from natural gas . The cost of production is very low . Since the war these plants have been turning out ammonia for the American farmer and also exporting 250,000 tons a year . Potash From New Mexico Potash is the third important material . It strengthens plants and helps them resist disease . Potash also assists plants to produce starches , sugars and oils . Before World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then new mines in New Mexico were opened up by U. S. Potash Co .. International Minerals and Chemical Corp . and Potash Co. of America . In 1939 the United States produced only about 200.000 tons of potash , roughly half of annual requirements . Today this country is turning out about a million tons , about all that is needed . The fertilizer industry is able to move west because it now can get supplies of two of its main raw materials out in the new territory . Fertilizers are bulky and costly to ship . That 's one reason why Kansas farmers . for example , formerly used less than eastern farmers . Many war built ammonia ( nitrogen ) plants are out in the center of the country . Lion Oil Co .. for instance , has a big one in Arkansas . There is also plenty of phosphate in the west . J. R. Simplot Co. is producing it in Idaho and Westvaco Chlorine Products in California . Other plants are planned for Montana . New ammonia plants may be located near Houston , Tex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " planning . " At the end of the war they had two fears . One was that this country would have a burdensome surplus of nitrogen , because of the huge war-horn increase in ammonia plants . The other fear was that foreign potash would compete in price with our comparatively new and expanded industry . But today there is a shortage of nitrogen and foreign potash costs about double the domestic product . During World War 1 . scarce potash sold as high as $500 a ton . Today potash brings $22.50 a ton at the plant , the same price it sold at 10 years ago Super-phosphate sells for about $10 to $15 a ton , varying in different areas . It is cheapest in Florida where it 's made . The 1940 level was around $7.50 to $10.50 a ton . American-made synthetic soda nitrate sells for $37 a ton and imported Chile nitrate of soda for $44.50 a ton . In pre-war 1939 and 1940 both sold for $27 a ton .               @ @ @ @ @ @
