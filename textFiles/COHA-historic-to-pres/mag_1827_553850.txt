ART . 1. - The Debates , Resolutions , and other Proceedings zn Convention , on the . fldoption of the Federal Constitution , as recommended by the General Convention at Philadelphia , on the 17th of September , 1787 ; with the Yeas and Nays on the Decision of the main Question . Collected and revised by JONATHAN ELLIOT . Vol . I. Containing the Debates in Massachusetts and New York . 8vo. pp. 358 . Washington . 1827 . THE increasing interest , which is daily manifested by the people of the United States , in the history of our political institutions , is one of the best evidences , that they understand and value their privileges . It is in the common course of nature for time to sanctify past events , and particularly such as have had an influence on the condition and destiny of mankind . This is a wise provision in the order of Providence , since it is the basis of experience and the guide to action . To emulate the noble deeds of ancestors , who have been instrumental in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally the dictate of patriotism and gratitude ; and the character of such ancestors is the richest inheritance , that any nation can receive . In the distractions of party , or faction , it is the polestar to which all may look for safety , as presenting an object to be regarded with the same respect and confidence by all . However discordant or repulsive the different branches of our republican // family may be among them selves , here is an unchangeable centre of union , an attractive power that draws every part to jiseif with an irresistible force . The virtues and sacrifices , the wisdom and integrity , the labors and successes of the authors of our independence , and the founders of our government , constitute a theme , that calls forth the involuntary and undivided admiration and applause of every inhabitant of this land . On this topic there is a unanimity arid a fellowship , which the ephemeral politics of party can neither weaken nor turn from their purpose . Viewed in this light , the spirit of inquiry that prevails so extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the incidents of our revolutionary history , is a favorable omen . It is a safeguard for the present , and augurs well for the future . All efforts to gratify and cherish this zeal in the community deserve commendation and encouragement . The field for research is a wide one , containing treasures that will amply reward the most ardent inquirer , and which the industry of years will not exhaust . The manuscript materials are more numerous , than could be conceived by any one , who has given but a casual attention to the subject . It would be an idle waste of time , indeed , to write the history of this country , in any stage of its progress , from printed books alone , and above all the history of that brilliant era , in which our national exist* ence , independence , and glory were achieved . The papers , which have been left behind , in public archives and private depositories , by the actors themselves , are not only the most copious , but the surest fountains of historical knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of rescuing these precious remains from the fate , to which from their perishable nature they must ere lon b be destined , and of selecting for the public eye such parts , as are worthy to be held in perpetual remembrance . Societies , individuals , and even our national and state legislatures , might honorably contribute to the execution of such an enterprise . Next in importance to an undertaking of thi* sort , is that of republishing the more rare and valuable pamphlets , and works of higher dignity , which appeared at the time when the events they recount were taking place . There are many revolutionary records of this description , which have become scarce , and in some instances almost unattainable , but which must be consulted by every one , who would make himself familiar with // events , and the spirit that led to them . The work before us comes under this class , and pertains to the closing period of our revolutionary history , that is , the formation and adoption of the Federal Constitution . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish in a series of volumes the Debates in the Conventions of all the States for adopting the Constitution . The first volume is occupied with the Debates of Massachusetts and New York , as they were reported at the time . The editor 's project we deem of 6reat public utility , not merely as perpetuating important facts of history , but as collecting into one body the opinions entertained by the framers of the Constitution , and other statesmen who approved it , in regard to the construction and sense of its various parts . It is impossible to peruse these debates with attention , and have any doubts on this head , for every point was fully discussed in each of the thirteen conventions . Talents of the first order , experience , and knowledge , were arrayed on both sides in favor of the Constitution and against it ; e very imaginable objection was raised and answered ; not a flaw escaped its enemies , nor passed without an elaborate explanation by its friends . In short , these debates afford a complete commentary on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak by implication , constructive license , legislative enactments , or judicial decisions , there can hardly be a shadow of doubt as to the meaning affixed to any of its essential parts by those who formed and adopted it . The voice of the whole nation is uttered with the utmost distinctness , in these records of the deliberations and solemn acts of the several states . On many accounts it is deeply to be regretted , that the debates of the grand Convention at Philadelphia have not been preserved . The advantage , which might have been derived from the arguments of the members , was thus lost to the public . The Journal of Proceedings , as recently published , is meagre beyond description , and hardly fills a blank in history . Yates 's volume of the proceedings and debates of the convention , together with Luther Martin 's speech , supplies the deficiene but very imperfectly . These gentlemen were warm opposers of the Constitution , and wrote and spoke as partisans . The expediency of a secret sessioii of that body is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reported daily in the newspapers , we apprernnd no evil , but much good , would have resulted . The fact // however , that nearly all the delegates to the general convention were afterwards members of the conventions of the states , to which they respectively belonged , diminishes in some degree the magnitude of the loss , that might otherwise have been sustained . It is probable , that these members shed around them all the light , which they had acquired at the first convention , repeated the arguments there advanced , and cornmunicated the views received by them during a protracted discussion of every topic involved in the Constitution . Yet if these arguments and views had gone out to the people from the original fountain , it can not be doubted , that they would have had a better understanding of the principles of the Constitution , and been better prepared to accord with them , when that instrument came to be acted upon by the states . Our present purpose is not to examine the history of the Constitution , however curious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce a few particulars throwing some light on the general subject , and touching especially the conventions of Massachusetts and New York , the debates of which are contained in the volume just referred to . Having in our possession several original letters of the highest authority , bearing directly on the points in question , we shall use them freely , not presuming that any matter of our own would be equally acceptable to our readers . The defects of the Old Confederation , entered into by the states in the year 1778 , were soon discovered , and seriously deplored . Common sufferings , and a pressure from without , that operated with nearly equal force on all the states , contributed to cement the confederacy during the war , but as soon as these causes ceased , the structure began to crumble to pieces . The federative principle was too weak to sustain itself ; the states were jealous of a sovereign power over them , and took care to impose upon it so many shackles , as almost to deprive it of the ability of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with the terrifying phantom of a standing army , which seemed to haunt the minds of all classes of persons throughout the country , nearly paralyzed the strongest efforts that were made for prosecuting the war , and was unquestionably a chief cause of protracting the contest . Congress was cautious and wavering , fearful of encroaching on the prerogatives of the states , doubtful of its own power , and tardy m exercising the little which it claimed , and which the people // were disposed to allow . This state of things is feelingly described in a letter from General Washington to his brother in law , Mr Fielding Lewis , dated on the 6th of July , 1780 , two years after the confederation had gone into effect . He first alludes to the evils , which the army and country had sustained , from the narrow and jealous policy of Congress in filling up the ranks by short enlistments ; and then says , To these fundamental errors may be added another , which I expect will prove our ruin , and that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the business is now attempted , for it is not done , by a timid kind of recommendation from Congress to the states ; the consequence of which is , that instead of pursuing one uniform system , which in the execution shall correspond in time and manner each state undertakes to determine , first , whether it will comply or not ; secondly , in what manner it will do it ; and , thirdly , in what time ; by which means scarcely any one measure is , or can be executed , while great expenses are incurred , and the willing and zealous states ruined . In a word , our measures are not under the influence and direction of one council , but thirteen , each of which is actuated by local views and politics , without considering the fatal consequences of* not complying with plans , which the united wisdom of America in its representative capacity has digested , or the unhappy tendency of delay , mutilation , or alteration . I do not scruple to add , and I give it decisively as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full and well chosen representation in Congress , and vest that body with absolute powers in all matters relative to the great purposes of war and of general concern ( by which the states unitedly are affected , reserving to themselves all matters of local and internal polity for the regulation of order and good government ) , we are attempting an impossibility , and very soon shall become , if it is not already the case , a many headed monster , a heterogeneous mass , that never will or can steer to the same point . The contest among the different states now is not , which shall do most for the common cause , but which shall do least ; hence arise disappointments and delay ; one state waiting to see what another will or will not do , through fear of doing too much , and by their deliberations , alterations , and sometimes refusals to comply with Congress , after that Congress have spent months in reconciling jarring interests in order to frame their resolutions , as far as the nature of the case will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief reiterated the same complaints ifl letters to Congress , to individuals high in office , and to // his orivate friends . In answer to Dr Gordon , the historian , who had congratuL*ted him on the ratification of the preliminary articles of peace between France and Great Britain , and on the prospects then opening to the country , he wrote as follows , in July , 1783 . It now rests with the confederated powers , by the line of conduct they mean to adopt , to make this country great , happy , and respectable ; or to sink it into littleness ; worse , perhaps , into ar*archy and confusion ; for certain I am , that , unless adequate powers are given to Congress for the general purposes of the Federal Union , we shall soon moulder into dust , and become contemptible in the eyes of Europe , if we are not made the sport of their politics . To suppose that the general concerns of this country can be directed by thirteen heads , or one head without competent powers , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has had the practical knowledge to judge from , that I have , is fully convinced of ; though none perhaps has felt them in so forcible and distressing a degree . The people at large , and at a distance from the theatre of action , who only know that the machine was kept in motion , and that they are at last arrived at the first object of their wishes , are satisfied with the event , without investigating the causes of the slow progress to it , or the expenses which have accrued , and which they now seem unwilling to pay ; great . part of which has arisea from that want of energy in the Federal Constitution , which I am complaining of , and which I wish to see given to it , by a convention of the people , instead of hearing it remarked ,  --  that , as we have worked through an arduous contest with the powers Congress already have ( but which , by the bye , have been gradually diminishing ) , why should they be invested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has conducted us through difficulties where no human foresight could point the way , it will appear evident to a close examiner , that there has been a concatenatioa of causes to produce this event , which in all probability will at no time , nor under any circumstances combine again . We deceive ourselves , therefore , by this mode of reasoning , and what would be much worse , we may bring ruin upon ourselves by attempting to carry . it into practice . We are known by no other character among nations , than as the United States . Massachusetts , or Virginia , is no better defined , nor any more thought of by Foreign Powers , than the County of Worcester in Massachusetts is by Virginia , or than Gloucester County in Virginia is by Massachusetts ( respectable as they are ) ; and yet these counties with as much propriety might oppose themselves to the laws of the state in which they // are , as an individual state can oppose itself to the federal government , by which it is or ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , its local policy and interests . These should be attended to and brought before their respective legislatures , with all the force their importance merits ; but when they come in contact with the general interest of the state , when superior considerations preponderate in favor of the whole , their voices should be heard no more . So should it be with individual states , when compared to the Union . Otherwise I think it may properly be asked , for what purpose do we farcically pretend to be united ? Why do Congress spend months together in deliberating upon , debating , and digesting plans , which are made as palatable , and as wholesome to the constitution of this country , as the nature of things xvi 11 admit , when some states will pay no attention to them , and others regard them but partially ? By these means all those evils , which proceed from delay , are felt by the whole ; while the compliant states are not only suffering by these neglects , but in many instances are injured most capitally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the united effort . A hundred thousand men coming one after another can not move a ton weight ; but the united strength of fifty would transport it with ease . So has it been with great part of the expense , which has been incurred this war . In a word , I think the blood and treasure which have been spent in it , have been lavished to little purpose , unless we can be better cemented ; and that is not to be effected while so little attention is paid to the recommendations of the sovereign power . ' In Washington 's circular address to the governors of the several states at the close of the war , so remarkable for its wisdom , its sound policy , and the deep concern expressed by the author for the welfare of the nation , he urges an indissoluble union of the states under one federal head , as essential to the well being , and even the existence of the United States . ' He was then in habitual correspoudence with Hamilton , who had left the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress from New York . To Hamilton he laid open his mind with perfect unreserve , and from him received in return a cordial interchange of feelings , opinions , and confidence . They were both equally impressed from experience with the feeble and decaying state of the federal compact , and used all their influence with Congress to bring about a more energetic system of action , and a more prompt use of the powers necessary for discharging the duties incumbent on that body , particularly so far as to render justice to the claims , and // relief to the sufferings of the army . But their arguments and eloquence were unavailing . Hamilton had indulged the hope , that some salutary change might be produced through the instrumentality of Washington , by a direct appeal from him to the people , on resigning the command of the army . Before communicating his thoughts to him , however , Washington had in part anticipated his purpose in the circular letter to the governors of the states , though not to the extent which Hamilton had desired . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 30th , 1783 , and bearing on this subject . In a letter which I wrote to you several months ago . I intimated that it might be in your power to contribute to the establishment of our Federal Union upon a more solid basis . I have never since explained myself . At the time , I was in hopes Congress might have been induced to take a decisive ground , to inform their constituents of the imperfections of the present system , and of the impossibility of conducting the public affairs with honor to themselves and advantage to the community , with powers so disproportioned to their responsibility ; and having done this in a full and forcible manner , to adjourn the moment the definitive treaty was ratified . In retiring at the same juncture I wished you , in a solemn manner , to declare to the people your intended retreat from public concerns , your opinion of the present government , and of the absolute necessity of a change . Before I left Congress I despaired of the first , and your circular letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be without effect , though I am persuaded it would have had more , combined with what I have mentioned . At all events . without compliment , sir , it will do you honor with the sensible and well meaning , and ultimately it is to be hoped with the people at large , when the present epidemic phrenzy has subsided . ' Notwithstanding the evils which were felt , from the defects of the Old Confederation , while the war lasted , these became increased tenfold after the peace . A sense of common danger no longer acted on the states , to induce them to comply with the recommendations of Congress , or make any sacrifice to promote the interests of the Union . It was the spirit of that compact , that Congress could recommend certain measures , but had no power to compel obedience . The war had hardly ceased indeed , when it became a question whether Congress could raise troops in time of peace . In May , 1794 , Knox // wrote to Washington from Annapolis , where Congress was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , and nothing of importance has been decided upon , owing to the contrariety of sentiments concerning the powers vested in Congress to raise troops in time of peace for any purpose . There appears but one sentiment respecting the necessity of having troops for the frontiers , but the difficulty is how to obtain them . The southern states are generally of opinion , that the confederation vests Congress with sufficient powers for this purpose , but the eastern states are of a different opinion . The eastern delegates are willing to recommend the raising of troops for the Western posts , but the gentlemen from the southward say , this would be giving up a right , which it is of importance to preserve , and they can not consent to recommend , when they ought to require ; so that for this cause it is to be feared , that there will not be any troops raised . ' What could be expected from a system which thus failed in a fundamental principle , that of providing against foreign invasion ? Among the primary objects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the encroachments of foreign powers ; secondly , a defence against local and internal commotions ; thirdly , the encouragement of commerce , agriculture , and manufactures . if each of these objects could have been attained as well by the states in their separate capacity , as when acting with their united strength , it is obvious that a union could have conferred little benefit . But no argument is necessary to show , that such could not have been the case ; and hence the union was desirable , just in proportion as it secured the advantages above enumerated . We have seen , however , that the first could not be secured , because it was a disputed point whether Congress had power to do it . The second was equally unattainable , for if a force could not be raised to resist invasion , neither could it to quell insurrections . The same principle applied to each of these acts of sovereign power . A government , which carried with it such marks of imbecility , whether federative or independent , must in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the confederation rapidly tending . If we look at this form of government in its facilities for promoting commerce , we shall find its deficiency still more remarkable . The general government had no power to adopt regulations of commerce , which should be binding on the // states . The consequence was , that each state made its own regulations , its tariff , and tonnage duties . These clashed with each other in the different states ; one nation would be more favored than another under the same circumstances ; and one state would pursue a system , that would be injurious to the interests of another. * Hence , the confidence of foreign countries in our commercial integrity and stability was destroyed ; they would not enter into treaties of commerce with the confederated government , as these were not likely to be carried into effect . What , ' said Mr Davie , in his speech to the convention of North Carolina , what was the language of the British Court on a proposition of this kind ? Such as would insult the pride of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements , but you can not compel your citizens to comply with them ; we derive greater profits from the present situation of your commerce , than we could expect under a treaty ; and you have no kind of power , that can compel us to render any advantage to you . " This was the language of our enemies ; and while our government remains as feeble as it has been , no nation will form any connexion with us , that will involve the relinquishment of the least advantage . What has been the consequence ? A general decay of trade , the rise of imported merchandise , the fall of produce , and an uncommon decrease of the value of lands . ' This is a gloomy picture , but it was drawn in colors more or less impressive by the principal speakers in all the conventions , particularly by Ames in Massachusetts , and Hamilton in New York . Some states infringed the rights of others , and violated the articles of the confederacy , by granting exclusive privileges to their own vessels . Others again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sixth article of the confederation . Virginia and Maryland united in such a compact , and also Pennsylvania and New Jersey . When the war ceased , there was a heavy national debt , which it was incumbent on the states to pay , each in its due proportion . For a view of the laws of the several states regulating commerce , their mischievous tendency and unlucky interference with each other , especially as relating to the commercial intercourse with Great Britain , see a Report of the Lords of the Comiaittee of Privy Council , appointed for all Matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations , 28th of January , 1791 ; ' published in *1teheson 's Gollection of InteresU *ng and Important Reports . p. 55. // 1827 . Federal Constitution . Requisitions were accordingly made by Congress , but with small effect . Even during the war , similar requisitions bad been tardily complied with , when the salvation of the country depended on them ; and now that the danger was past , neither gratitude nor justice afforded a motive sufficiently strong to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not one came up to the full demand . Congress was obliged to borroxv money to pay the interest of its loans , and what rendered this state of things peculiarly alarming , the aspect of affairs grew every year worse and worse . The habits of self government and disobedience in the states had become so much confirmed , as to be no longer regarded in the light of an offence against the Union ; and the powers of Congress , originally curtailed and inoperative , were so enfeebled by these encroachments , that no hope of a remedy was left , except by a thorough change and renovation of the system . We again quote , with great satisfaction , a letter from General Washington on this subject , written in January , 1784 , to Governor Harrison of Virginia . That the prospect before us is , as you justly observe , fair , none can deny ; but what use we shall make of it is exceedingly problematical ; not but that I believe all things will come right at last ; but like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance , we shall wanton and run riot , until we have brought our reputation to the brink of ruin , and then like him shall have to labor with the current of opinion when compelled , perhaps , to do what prudence and common policy pointed out in the first instance , as plainly as any problem in Euclid . The disinclination of the individual states to yield competent powers to Congress for the Federal Government , their unreasonable jealousy of that body , and of one another , and the disposition which seems to pervade each , of being allwise and allpowerful within itself , will , if there is not a change in the system , be our downfall as a nation . This is as clear to me as the A , B , C , and I think we have opposed Great Britain , and have arrived at the present state of peace and independency to very little purpose , if we can not conquer our own prejudices . The powers of Europe begin to see this , and our newly acquired friends , the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely too , if we are determined to persevere in our folly . They know that individual opposition to their measures is futile , and boast that we are not sufficiently united as a nation to give a general one ! Is not the indignity alone of this declaration , while we are in the very act of peacemaking and conciliation , sufficient to stimulate // Conventions for adopting the Oct. us to vest more extensive and adequate powers in the Sovereign of these United States ? For my own part , although I am returned to , and am now mingled with the class of private citizens , and like them must suffer all the evils of a tyranny , or of too great an extension of federal powers , I have no fears arising from this source in my mind ; but I have many and powerful ones , indeed , which predict the worst consequences from a half starved , limping government , that appears to be always moving upon crutches , and tottering at every step . Men , chosen as the delegates in Congress are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breath , nay , they are so much the creatures of the people , under the present constitution , that they can have no views , which could possibly be carried into execution , nor any interests , distinct from those of their constituents . My political creed therefore is , to be wise in the choice of delegates , support them like gentlemen while they are our representatives , give them competent powers for all federal purposes , support them in the due exercise thereof ; and , lastly , to compel them to close attendance in Congress during their delegation . These things , under the present mode of elections and termination of them , aided by annual , instead of constant sessions , would , or I am exceedingly mistaken . make us one of the most wealthy , happy , respectable , and powerful nations , that ever inhabited the terrestrial globe ; without them , we shall in my opinion , soon be everything which is the direct reverse of it . ' Many other private letters from General Washington , written between the ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be quoted , which enter feelingly into these subjects , and indicate alike the purity of his patriotism , and his deep concern for the welfare of his eountry. * The calamities brought on the people by the disordered state of the government , and the darkness that hung over the future , were the unceasing burden of his thoughts . To his former compatriots in arms , to his intimate friends , to persons high in station and of commanding influence in different parts of the United States , he made known his apprehensions and sentiments without reserve , calling on them to be wakeful and active in the good cause of reformation . The time at length came , when the public mind gave tokens of being prepared for a change . Evil had accumulated upon evil , till the mass became too op // pressive to be endured , and the voice of the nation cried out for relief . The first decisive measures proceeded from the merchants , who came forward almost simultaneously , in all parts of the country , with representations of the utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedy and efficient remedy . It was shown , that the advantages of this most important source of national prosperity were flowing into the hands of foreigners ; that the native merchants were suffering for the want of a just protection and a uniform system of trade ; and , in short , as expressed in the speech of Mr Davie , that everything presented to view a spectacle of public poverty and private wretchedness . ' The wise and reflecting were convinced , that some decided efforts were necessary to strengthen the powers of government , or a dissolution of the union , and perhaps a devastating anarchy , would be inevitable . The first *step towards a general reformation was rather accidental , than premeditated . Certain citizens of Virginia and Maryland had formed a scheme for promoting the navigation of the Potomac and the Chesapeake Bay , and commissioners were appointed by those two states to meet at Alexandria , and devise some plan of operation . These persons made a visit to Mount Vernon , and while there , it was proposed among themselves , that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view , and that the state governments should be solicited to appoint other commissioners with enlarged powers , instructed to form a plan for maintaining a naval force in the Chesapeake , and also to fix upon some system of duties on exports and imports in which both states should agree , and that in the end Congress should be petitioned to allow these privileges . This project was approved by the legislature of Virginia , and commissioners were accordingly appointed . The same legislature passed a resolution recommending the design to other states , and inviting them to unite by their commissioners in an attempt to establish such a system of commercial relations , as would promote general harmony and prosperity . Five states only , in addition to Virginia , acceded to this proposition , namely , Maryland , Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and New York . From these states commissioners assembled at Annapolis , but they had hardly entered into a discussion of the topics , which naturally forced themselves into view , before they discovered the powers with which they were intrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from effecting // any purpose that could be of essential utility . On this account , as well as from the circumstance that so few states were represented , they wisely declined deciding on any important measures , in reference to the particular subjects for which they had come together . This convention is memorable , however , as having been the prelude to the one which followed . Before the commissioners adjourned , a report was agreed upon , in which the necessity of a revision and reform of the ' articles of the old federal compact was strongly urged , and which contained a recommendation to all the state legislatures for the appointment of deputies to meet at Philadelphia , with more ample powers and instructions . This proposal was eventually carried into effect , and , in conformity with it , a convention of delegates from the several states met at Philadelphia in May , 1787 , at which the new constitution was formed , and a foundation laid for the permanent liberty , union , and happiness of the American people . The history of this convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the space now at our command . The causes which led to it , may be easily ascertained and traced out , but the opinions and private movements of the great political leaders of the day , the precise share of merit due to each for the part he acted in enlightening the public mind , and preparing it for the issue of events , the previous interchange of thoughts and sentiments , the exposition of motives , the ultimate hopes , and above all , the proceedings of the convention itself , the views , arguments , and designs of individuals , and the general voice of their constituents , as expressed by them ; all these topics and numerous others are yet in the dark , and must remain so , till the papers left by the departed actors in the scene , and such as are still held by the few venerable worthies that remain of that dignified assembly , shall come under the eye of the faithful historian , and receive a patient inspection , and a discriminating award . It is to aid in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many original papers , which relate to the periods and events in question , and which have proceeded from the highest sources . We are now about to insert a document , which we possess , in General Washington 's handwriting , and which is a summary of three letters received by him from Jay , Knox , and Madison , not long before the convention at Philadelphia . It will show at the same time the opinions of these eminent persons , as to // the plan of a constitution , and the earnest attention , which Washington bestowed on the subject . After obtaining the views of others in detail , it was his custom to draw out , arrange , and note on paper the prominent points , that he might bring them into a compass , which his mind could more easily grasp . The following quotation is an exact transcript of such a summary . Ma JAY Does not think the giving any further powers to Congress will answer our purposes , Because some of the members will have partial and personal purposes in view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , will always embarrass those wh*o are well disposed . Because secrecy and dispatch will be too uncommon , and foreign as well as local interests will frequently oppose , and sometimes frustrate , the wisest measures . Because large assemblies often misunderstand , or neglect the obligations of character , honor , and dignity , and will collectively do , or omit , things which an individual gentleman in his private capacity would not approve . The executive business of sovereignty , depending on so many wills , and those wills moved by such a variety of contradictory motives and inducements , will , in general , be but feebly done ; and Such a sovereign , however theoretically responsible , can not be effectually so in its department and officers , without adequate judicatories . He , therefore , Does not promise himself anything very desirable from any change , which does not divide the sovereignty into its proper departments . Let Congress legislate ; let others execute ; let others judge . Proposes A Governor general , limited in his prerogatives and duration ; that Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former appointed for life , the latter annually ; that the Governor General ( to preserve the balance ) with the advice of a council , formed , for that only purpose , of the great judicial officers , have a negative on their acts . What powers should be granted to the government so constituted , is a question which deserves much thought ; the more powers , however , he thinks , the better ; the states retaining only so much as may be necessary for domestic purposes , and all their principal officers , civil and military , being commissioned and removed by the national government . Questions the policy of the Convention , because it ought to // Oct. have originated with , and the proceedings he confirmed by , the people , the only source of just authority . GENERAL KNOX . It is out of all question , that the foundation of the government must he of republican principles , but so modified and wrought together , that whatever shall be erected thereon should be durable and efficient . He speaks entirely of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one government , instead of an association of governments . Were it possible to effect a government of this kind , it might be constituted of an assembly , or lower house , chosen for one , two , or three years ; a Senate chosen for five , six , or seven years ; and the executive under the title of Governor General , chosen by the Assembly and Senate for the term of seven years , but liable to an impeachment of the lower house , and triable by the Senate . A judiciary to be appointed by the Governor General during good behavior , but impeachable by the lower house , and triable by the Senate . The laws passed by the General Government , to be obeyed by the local governments , and if necessary , to be enforced by a body of armed men . All national objects to he designed and executed by the General Government , without any reference to the local governments . This is considered as a government of the least possible powers , to preserve the confederated government . To attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republicanism , and to subject us either to a division of the European powers , or to a despotism arising from high handed commotions . MR MADISON Thinks an individual independence of the states utterly irreconcilable with their aggregate sovereignty , and that a consolidation of the whole into one simple republic , would be as inexpedient as it is unattainable . He , therefore , , proposes a middle ground , which may at once support a due supremacy of the national authority , and not exclude the local authorities whenever they can be subordinately useful . As the ground work , he proposes that a change he made in the principle of representation , and thinks there would be no great difficulty in effecting it . Next , that in addition to the present federal powers , the national government should be armed with positive and complete authority in all cases which require uniformity ; such as the regulation of trade , including the right of taxing both exports and imports , the fixing the terms and forms of naturalization , &amp;c . Over and above this positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislative acts of the states , as heretofore exercised by the kingly prerogative , appears to him absolutely necessary , and to be the least possible encroachment on the state jurisdictions . Without this defensive power he conceives that every positive law ? , which can be given on paper , will be evaded . This control over the laws would prevent the internal vicissitudes of state J ) olicy , and the aggressions of interested majorities . The national supremacy ought also to be extended , he thinks , to the judiciary departments ; the oaths of the judges should at least include a fidelity to the general as well a.s local constitution ; and that an appeal should be to some national tribunals in all cases , to which foreigners or inhabitants of other states may be parties . The admiralty jurisdictions to fall entirely within the purview of the national government . The national supremacy in the executive departments is liable to some difficulty , unless the officers administering them could be made appointable by the supreme government . The militia ought entirely to be placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested with the general protection and defence . A government composed of such extensive powers should be well organized and balanced . The legislative department might be divided into two branches , one of them chosen every - years by the people at large , or by the legislatures ; the other to consist of fewer members , to hold their places for a longer term , and to go out in such a rotation as always to leave in office a large majority of old members . Perhaps the negative on the laws might be most conveniently exercised by this branch . As a further check , a council of revision , including the great ministerial officers , might be superadded . A national executive must also be provided . He has scarcely ventured as yet to form his own opinion , either of the manner in which it ought to be constituted , or of the authorities with which it ought to be clothed . An article should be inserted expressly guarantying the tranquillity of the states against internal , as well as external dangers . In like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the resources of commerce in hand , the national administration might always find means of exerting it either by sea or land ; but the difficulty and awkwardness of operating by force on the collective will of a state , render it particularly desirable that the necessity of it might be precluded . Perhaps the negative on the laws might create such a mutual dependence between the general and particular authorities as to answer ; or // perhaps some defined objects of taxation might be submitted along with commerce to the general authority . To give a new system its proper validity and energy , a ratifica* tion must be obtained from the people , and not merely from the ordinary authority of the legislatures . This will be the more essential , as inroads on the cxisting constitutions of the states will be unavoidable . ' In connexion with these opinions respecting the principles of a constitution , it may not be amiss to state some of the chief features of Hamilton 's plan of government , as presented by him to the convention . He proposed , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be vested in two distinct bodies of men , the one to be called the Assembly , the other the Senate . That the assembly should consist of persons elected by the people to serve three years . That the senate should consist of persons elected to serve durin , , good behavior , their election to be made by electors chosen for that purpose by the people . That the supreme executive authority of th' United States should be vested in a governor , to be elected to serve during good behavior ; his election to be made by electors , chosen by electors , chosen by the people in the election districts ; and that he should have a negative upon all laws about to be passed , and the execution of all laws passed . That the senate should have the sole power of declaring war , and the power of advising and approving all treaties . That all laws of particular states , contrary to the constitution or laws of the United States , should be utterly void ; and the better to prevent such laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be appointed by the general government , and should have a negative upon the laws about to be passed in the state of which he is governor or president . ' * Thus we may be led by degrees to the elements , the first germs of that constitution , which was perfected by the united wisdom of the men , who adorned the nation , and which has stood firm and gained strength amidst the concussions of parties and the trying perils of war . Such an experiment of forty years may safely be taken as a pledge of its durability , and of its fitness for the great ends of a free government . One thing * For Hamilton 's Plan of Government entire , see Journal , Acts , and Proceedings of the Convention assembled at Philadelphia , May 14th , &amp;787. ' p. 130. // should be treasured up in perpetual remembrance , as reflecting the highest honor on the patriots , who signed the constitution in the convention , and that is , the readiness with which they abandoned their former individual prepossessions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence and support of the constitution , as it went out to the world . Notwithstanding the differences in the original impressions of Madison , Jay , and Hamilton , as they appear in the above abstracts , yet this illustrious trio were the joint authors of the FEDERALI5T* a work which this nation to its latest posterity will regard as a legacy , next in value to the instrument itself , of whose principles it affords so beautiful an elucidation and so masterly a defence . If we look into the conventions of the states , we shall find the same liberal and self denying spirit , the same active and unwavering patriotism , the same union of purpose and exertion , on the part of those , who approved the constitution in the main , although they objected to some of its particulars . It was by this sacrifice of private feeling and opinion to public good , that the constitution was at last adopted ; for , after all , this great charter of our liberties was never pretended to be the best , that human wisdom could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which small points were yielded ' to secure large ones , till the whole structure was as perfect as imperious circumstances would admit . Mr Jefferson was absent in France during the whole period in which the constitution was agitated , but his opinions were communicated freely in letters to his friends . The result was , that he differed from others on some of the principal features of the constitution , but after it had passed the general convention , he no longer urged these differences as essential , but was a strenuous advocate for its adoption by the states . While he was secretary of state under Washington , it is known that he was accused of having been hostile to the constitution ; and the rage of party magnified this charge into a suspicion of his patriotism and political integrity . Thinking the president might be influenced hy reiterated assertions to this effect , he wrote him the following letter , dated at Philadelphia , on the 17th of October , 1792 , soon after his return from a short journey to Virginia . In a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I should return here , where my letterbooks were , I would take the liberty of troubling you with the perusal of such parts of my correspondence from France , as would show my gen // uine sentiments of the new constitution . When I arrived at Philadelphia , the 5th inst . I found that many of my letters had been already put into the papers , by the gentlemen possessed of the originals , as I presume , for not a word ol it had ever been communicated to me , and the copies I had retained were under a lock of which I had the key . These publications are genuine , and render it unnecessary to give you any further trouble , than to see extracts from two or three other letters , which have not been published , and the genuine letter for the payment of the French debt . Pardon my adding this to so many troubles as you have . I think it necessary you should know my real opinions , that you may know how to make use of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be misknown to you . I hope it is the last time I shall feel a necessity of asking your attention to a disagreeable subject . ' Washington 's reply to this letter is contained in the fifth volume of Marshall 's Life p. 359 , in which the president expresses himself perfectly satisfied on the point in question , and assures Mr Jefferson that he did not require any testimony to be convinced of his attachment to the constitution . The extracts are here inserted merely as memorials of Jefferson 's opinions . We transcribe them from the originals in his own hand . The first was written to Mr A. Donald . Paris , Feb. 7tk , 1783 . I wish with all my soul , that the nine first conventions may accept the new constitution , because this will secure to us the good it contains , which I think great and important ; but I equally wish that the four latest conventions , whichever they be , may refuse to accede to it till a declaration of rights be annexed . This would probably command the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole fabric , per haps as much perfection as any one of that kind ever had . By a declaration of rights , I mean one which shall stipulate freedom of religion , freedom of the press , freedom of commerce against monopolies , trial by juries in all cases , no suspensions of the Habeas Corpus , no standing armies . These are fetters against doing evil , which no honest government should decline . There is another strong feature in the new constitution , which I as strongly dislike , that is , the perpetual reelegibility of the President . Of this I expect no amendment at present , because I do not see that any body has objected to it on your side of the water . But it will be productive of cruel distress to our country , even in your day and mine . rrhe importance to France and England to have our government in the hands of a friend or a foe , will occasion their interference by money , and even by arms . Our President will be of much more consequence to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care , however , that neither this nor any other objection to the new form produce a schism in our union . That would be an incurable evil , because near friends falling out never reunite cordially ; whereas , all of us going together , we shall be sure to cure the evils of our new constitution , before they do great harm . Paris , lJJiay 27th . To Colonel Edward Carrington.  - -  My first wish was that nine states would adopt it , in order to ensure what was good in it , and that the others might , by holding off , produce the necessary amendments . But the plan of Massachusetts is far preferable , and will , I hope , be followed by those who are yet to decide . There are two amendments only , which 1 am anxious for . First , a bill of rights , which it is so much the interest of all to have , that I conceive it must be yielded . The first amendment proposed by Massachusetts will in some degree answer this end , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too little in others ; it will cripple the federal government in some cases where it ought to be free , and not restrain it in some others where restraint would be right . The second amendment , which appears to me essential , is the restoring the principle of necessary rotation , particularly to the senate and presidency ; but most of all to the last . Reeligibility makes him an officer for life , and the disasters inseparable from an elective monarchyrender it preferable , if we can not tread back that step , that we should go forward and take refuge in an hereditary one . Of the correction of this article , however , I entertain no present hope , because I find it has scarcely excited an objection in America , and if it does not take place ere long , it assuredly never will . The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield , and government to gain ground . As yet our spirits are free , our jealousy is only put to sleep by the unlimited confidence we all repose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . After him , inferior characters may perhaps succeed , and awaken us to the danger , which his merit has led us into . For the present , however , the general adoption is to be prayed for , and I wait with great anxiety for the news from Maryland and South Carolina , which have decided before this , and wish that Virginia , now in session , may give the ninth vote of approbation . There could then be no doubt of North Carolina , New York , and New Hampshire . Paris , July 8th . To J. B. Cutting. - The first vessels will probably bring us news of the accession of South Carolina and Virginia , to the new confederation . The glorious example of Massachusetts , of accepting unconditionally and pressing for future amendment , will , I hope , reconcile all parties . The argument is unanswerable , that it will be easier to obtain amendments from nine states , under the new constitution , than from thirteen after rejecting it . ' // Notwithstanding the constitution had been carried through the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members present , yet there were names of weight in the opposition , who refused to sign it , and much anxiety was felt re-. specting the manner in which it would be received by the states . It was required to pass through the ordeal of nine states , and be approved by them , before it could go into operation , and its adversaries were extremely active in concerting measures to procure its defeat . Among the members of the convention , who did not sign the instrument , were George Mason , Wythe , Edmund Randolph , Luther Martin , Ellsworth , Yates , Lansing , Gerry , Strong , Davie . It was presumed that these men would feel bound to resist its adoption in their respective states , and for the most part such was the result . An exception is to be made , however , in favor of Strong and Davies for they were both warm advocates of the constitution in the state conventions , the former in Massachusetts , and the latter in North Carolina . Before the general convention was dissolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a recommendation that it should afterwards be submitted to a convention of each state , composed of delegates chosen by the people . This course was approved by Congress , and the request was formally communicated from that body to the legislatures of the states , by whom the people were authorized in each respectively to choose delegates to meet in convention , for the purpose of deliberating on the constitution , and determining whether it should be accepted . Within a year the constitution was adopted by eleven states , and ratified by Congress , as the national bond of union . These eleven states were Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Georgia , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Maryland , South Carolina , New Hampshire , Virginia , and New York , in the order in which they are here enumerated . North Carolina did not come into the confederacy till nearly two years after the general convention ; Rhode Island , two years and a half ; and Vermont , more than three years . Seven states ratified the constitution unconditionally , that is , Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , and Vermont ; the other six proposed amendments for the future consideration of Congress ; and four , namely , Virginia , New York , North Carolina , and Rhode Island , urged the importance of a bill of rights . Such a bill was drawn up // in due form by Virginia , * and the same was literally adopted by North Carolina . This was modelled anew by New York and Rhode Island , but the substance was retained in a different arrangement of parts . The amendments proposed were nearly the same in the several states . In the form of expressing them , New Hampshire followed Massachusetts very closely ; and North Carolina adopted the same language as Virginia , adding four or five articles to the list , which had been reported by that state . The entire proceedings and debates of the conventions of of Massachusetts and New York , are contained in the volume whose title is placed at the head of this article . From the eminent names comprised in the list of members , it may be presumed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated with as much force and ability , as are to be found in any other statement of them . The convention in Massachusetts was looked upon with solicitude , by the friends of the new system of confederacy , as it was supposed the decision would have an essential influence on New Hampshire and New York . The recent disturbances in Massachusetts had also thrown a cloud of uncertainty over the real state of things , and made it doubtful what turn they would take . Public opinion had become unsettled to such a degree , and the spirit of disorder had run so high in open rebellion to the laws , that the wisest did not venture to predict the events of the future , and none to confess himself free from the apprehension of an unfavorable issue . So deep a concern did General Washington feel in the subject , that scarcely a mail arrived , during the deliberations of the convention , which did not bring him intelligence of its proceedings from two or three sources . Mr Madison was then at the Congress in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the Massachusetts convention . Copies of the letters , which he received , he forwarded immediately to Washington . We select one written on the twenthfifth of January , 1788 , which depicts in lively colors the aspect of the convention in the first week of its session . The information from Boston by the mail , on the evening before last , has not removed our suspense . The following is an extract of a letter from Mr King , dated on the 16th inst. // " We may have three hundred and sixty members in our convention , not more than three hundred and thirty have yet taken their seats . Immediately after the settlement of elections , the convention resolved that they would consider and freely deliberate on each paragraph , without taking a question on any of them individually , and that on the question whether they would ratify , each member should be at liberty to discuss the plan at large . This resolution seems to preclude the idea of amendments ; and hitherto the measure has not been suggested . I , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hereafter occur . *f he opponents of the Constitution moved that Mr Gerry should be requested to take a seat in the Convention , to answer such inquires as the convention should make concerning facts , which happened in the passing of the Constitution . Although this seems to be a very irregular proposal , yet , considering the jeaiousies which prevail with those who made it , and the doubt of the issue , had it been made a trial of strength , several friends of the Constitution united with the opponents , and the resolution was agreed to , and Mr Gerry has taken his seat . Tomorrow , we are told , certain inquires are to moved for by the opposition , and that Mr Gerry under the idea of stating facts is to state his reasons , &amp;c . This will be opposed , and we shall on the division be able to form some idea of our relative strength . By the men , who are in favor of the Constitution , every reasonable explanation will be given , and arguments really new , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be produced in its support . But what will be its fate , I confess I am unable to discern . No question ever classed the people of this state in a more extraordinary manner , or with more apparent firmness . " ' The method of discussing the constitution by paragraphs , which was agreed upon in the first stage of the proceedings , had an excellent effect in the end , as it kept the violent opposition members to a definite point , and prevented a repetition of all the imaginary dangers and alarms , that were supposed to lie hid in the constitution , ready to break forth with destructive sway , as soon as this new yoke of bondage should be once fixed upon the people 's necks . Armies of monsters were conjured up , but they were arrayed with so little concert and skill , and brought into action in such detached parties , that they were easily discomfited . Two or three weeks passed in this kind of skirmishing , before any probable conjecture could he formed , how the conflict would terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was any time when the opposition had grounds for doubt , they made up in confi // dence what they lacked in the deficiency of their forces . The leaders could detect no good thing in the constitution , hut saw , or fancied they saw lurking in it , a host of enemies to the rights , liberty , peace , and happiness of every well disposed citizen . A letter from Mr Madison to Washington , written nearly four weeks after the former , touches upon the subject as unfolded in its progress . Another mail has arrived from Boston , without terminating the conflict between our hopes and fears . I have a letter from Mr King of the 27th , which , after dilating somewhat on the ideas in his former letters , concludes with the following paragraph . " We have avoided every question , which would have shown the division of the house . Of cnmsequence we are not positive of the numbers on each side . By the last calculation we made on our side , we were doubtful whether we exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , say , that they have a majority of eight or twelve against us . We by no means despair . " Another letter of the same date from another member gives the following picture . " Never was there an assembly in this state in ; ) possession of greater ability and information , than the present Convention ; yet I am in doubt whether they will approve the Constitution . There are unhappily three parties opposed to it . 1 . All men who are in favor of paper money and tender laws . These are more or less in every part of the state . 2 . All the late insurgents , and their abettors . In the three great Western Counties they are very numerous . We have in the convention eighteen or twenty who were actually in Shays ' army . 3 . A great majority of the members from the Province of Maine . Many of them and their constituents are only squatters upon other people 's land , and they are afraid of being brought to account . They also think , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate state , will be defeated . Add to these , the honest doubting people , and they make a powerful host . The leaders of this party are Mr Widgery , Mr Thompson , and Mr Mason , from the the Province of Maine , Dr Taylor from the county of Worces .. ter , and Mr Bishop from the neighborhood of Rhode Island . To manage the cause against them are the present and late Governor , three Judges of the Supreme Court , fifteen members of the Senate , twenty from among the most respectable of the Clergy , ten or twelve of the first characters at the Bar , Judges of Probate , High Sheriffs of counties , and many other respectable people , merchants , &amp;c. , Generals Heath , Lincoln , Brooks , and others of the late army . With all this ability in support of the cause , I am pretty well satisfied we shall lose the question , unless we can take off some of the opposition by amendments . I do not mean such VQI , * XXV. - NO. b7. 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but recommen* datory only . Upon this plan , I flatter myself we may possibly get a majority of twelve or fifteen , if not more . ' Among the persons in favor of the constitution , who made strenuous exertions in the convention to procure its adoption , may be named Rufus King , Ames , Cabot , Dawes , Dana , Gore , Gorham , Sedgwick , Parsons , Sumner . These gentlemen spoke frequently , and answered with great ability the objections advanced by their opponents . The debates continned on the separate sections and articles of the constitution for about three weeks , when a motion was made to ratify it , and its general merits came under discussion . The result was still doubtful . Till this period Hancock , who was president of the convention , had been prevented by ill health from attending its sessions . He took his seat just as the debate was brought to bear upon the main question , and immediately proposed what was called a conciliatory proposition , ' by which the constitution was to be adopted xxith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warmly seconded by Samuel Adams , who had thus far remained silent , contrary to his usual custom in deliberative bodies , for , as be said , having doubts and difficulties respecting some parts of the proposed constitution , he chose rather to be an auditor than an objector . ' He thought a door was now open , however , for reconciling all serious difficulties , and , as only five states had ratified the constitution , he believed the others would be influenced by the example of Massachusetts , and that ultimately the desired amendments would be effected by the method pointed out in the constitution itself . This proposition was not cordially relished by either party . Each had taken too decided a stand to be willing to meet the other on a middle ground . The friends of the constitution fell in with it , as the less of two evils , for they wisely deemed it better to accept the constitution with this incumbrauce , than to run the hazard of having it rejected altogether . A few of the opposition may possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small . The point was gained , however , in the deciding vote , and the motion for ratification was carried by a majority of nineteen . The conjecture of Adams , as to the effect of this proposition on the other states , was verified . Two of the states only adopted the constitution after M ; *ssachusetts , without a similar recommendation ; and it was doubtless owing // to this general expression of the public mind , that the early amendments were introduced . The success of the constitution in New York was not less doubtful than it had been in Massachusetts . The convention assembled at Poughkeepsie on the seventeenth of June , 1778 . The following letter from 1*Ir Jay to General Washington , written two weeks before , will show that the friends of the cons&amp; tution were by no means sanguine in their anticipations . I was two days ago favored with yours of the fifteenth instant . It gives me pleasure to find that the probability of Virginia 's adopting the proposed Constitution rather increases . Such an event would undoubtedly disarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we may count on South Carolina , and the New Hampshire delegates assure me that their state will come into the measure . there is much reason to believe , that the majority of the convention of this state will be composed of antifederal characters ; but it is doubtful whether the leaders will be able to govern the party . Many in the opposition are friends to union , and mean well , but their principal leaders are very far from being solicitous about the fate of the Union . They wish and mean , if possible , to reject the constitution with as little debate and as much speed as may he . It is not , however , certain that the greater part of their party will be equally decided , or rather equally desperate . An idea has taken air , that the southern part of the state will at all events adhere to the Union , and if necessary to that end seek a separation from the northern . This idea has influence on the fears of the party . I can not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , or even to those the most probable , as to have united in , or formed any system adapted to them . ' To this we subjoin another letter written shortly after the convention had met . The complexion of our convention is such as was expected . They have hitherto proceeded with temper and moderation , but there is no reason to think that either party has made much impression on the other . The leaders in opposition seem to have more extensive views , than their adherents , and until the latter perceive that circumstance , they will probably continue combined . The greater number are , I believe , averse to a vote of rejection . Some would be content with recommendatory amendments ; others wish for explanatory ones to settle constructions , which they think doubtful ; others would not be satisfied with less than absolute and previous amendments ; and I am mistaken if there be not a few , who prefer a separation from the Union to // any national government whatever . They suggest hints of the importance of this state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its taking its own time , and fixing its own price , and they intimate that an adjournment may be expedient , and that it might be best to see the operation of the new government before they receive it .. The people , however , are gradually coming right , notwithstanding the singular pains taken to prevent it . The accession of New Hampshire does good , and that of Virginia would do more . ' The debates in convention were condueted in some respects differently from what they had been in Massachusetts . The speakers were much fewer in number , and more discursive in their harangues . It was agreed to discuss the constitution by paragraphs , and this plan was followed as a general guide in the order of debate , but not so rigidly as to rcstrict any speaker from taking into his argument the whole ra*mge of topics , when such a method suited his convenience . Chancellor Livingston opened the discussion by an elaborate speech on the preamble to the constitution , in which he brought under notice the main principles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was followed by Mr Lansing , the leader of the opposition in debate , whose range was not more limited than that of his predecessor . Ground was now fairly broken , and the contest was kept up by the different speakers for mere than a month when every topic had been fully canvassed , and all the light seemed to have been derived from this collision of opinion and intellect , which the subject would admit . The members , who took a chief part , were Hamilton , Jay , . Chancellor Livingston , George Clinton , Duane , Lansing , and Melanethon Smith . Among these Hamilton was the moving and guiding spirit , thoroughly possessed of the merits of the case , and prompt to explain , vindicate , or confute , as occasion might require . Lansing and Clinton were decidedly in the opposition ; and Melancthon Smith found himself embarrassed with innumerable difficulties , although he voted for the ratification at last . Another of Jay 's letters to Washington will not be unacceptable in this place . July 4th . I congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution by Virginia . That event has disappointed the expectations of opposition here , which nevertheless continues pertinacious . The unanimity of the Southern District , and their // apparent determination to continue under the wings of the Union , operates powerfully on the minds of the opposite party . The constitution gradually gains advocates among the people , and its enemies in the conveition seem to be much embarrassed . July Sth . We have gone through the constitution in a committee of the whole . We finished yesterday morning . The amendments proposed are numerous . How we are to consider them is yet a question , which a day or two more must answer . A Bill of Rights has been offered , with a view , as they say , of having it incorporated in the ratification . The ground of rejection , therefore , seems to be entirely deserted . We understand that a committee will this day be appointed to arrange the amendments . From what I have just heard , the party begin to divide in their opinions ; some insist on previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent conditional amendments , or , in other words , they are for ratifying the constitution on condition that certain amendments take place within a given time . These circumstances afford room for hope . ' Intelligence of the ratification by New Hampshire and Virginia arrived previously to this date , and essentially affected the prospects of the opposition , for it rendered certain th' requisite number of nine states . However New York might decide , therefore , it could have no weight in frustrating the ultimate adoption of the new constitution in its actual form , as a pledge and bond of a national confederacy . To dismember the Union by deserting its ranks , or to follow the example of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Virginia , and ratify the instrument with the recommendatory amendments , was now the only alternative . The latter was chosen , but with no approach to unanimity . When the motion was put to insert the words in full confidence , instead of on condition , it was carried by only two votes , even after the bill of rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last effort , which was to obtain a resolution , that unless the proposed amendments should be submitted to a general convention within a certain number of years , New York should reserve the right to secede from the Union . The motion was lost . The constitution was finally ratified , on principles similar to those that prevailed in Massachusetts , by a majority of only three votes , there being thirty in the affirmative , and twentyseven in the negative . Fortunately every important end was gained by this sanction , partial as it was in New York and some of the other states , and after // a thorough trial the constitution has proved itself a monument of the wisdom of its framers , the bulwark of our liberties , and The dispenser of happiness to millions , who have submitted to its guidance and control .
