From 24 nations , a muscular army of 10,000 descended on Stuttgart , pitched their tents in public parks , and ate the city out of fresh fruit . Their weapons were the Indian club , the skipping rope and the trampoline ; their uniforms were the leotard , the sweatshirt , and the bloomer ; their hearts were uncompetitive and simon-pure . It was amateur night all week . In Stuttgart 's commodious Nechar Stadium ( capacity 90,000 ) and in 15 overflow halls around town , the third world festival of amateur gymnasts , the Gymnaestrada ( the " way to gymnastics " ) , was under way . <P> For five days and nights , the jumping , grunting , lifting , leaping and writhing went on . An 80-woman corps from Norway , the youngest among them 50 years old , performed precision calisthenics to the strains of Now Is the Hour . A shorts-clad German woman contingent got a big hand for an exhibition of ball throwing , even though they several times knocked the medicine ball into the orchestra seats . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 lovely young women from the Unifed Arab Republic banged sticks in unison ; a troupe of muscle-flexing Danish maids rolled about the stage so sensuously that some of the crowd , reminded of other occasions , were moved to encouraging shouts of " Take it off . " If not everyone was professionally proficient , they all were amateurishly enjoying themselves . And the best were good ( see cuts ) . <P> Predominantly a European phenomenon , the Gymnaestrada is amateur athletics at its purest . All 10,000 participants paid their own way to Stuttgart , and their own expenses while there . No one was judged , and everyone was eligible : the age of the participants ranged from 7 to 74 . " It 's the cheapest form of exercise I can get , " explained a German housewife of 38 . " I need only a pair of gym shoes and shorts to work out . It 's a family sport . My husband and children and I all enjoy it together . Now we like it so much we follow gymnastic events all over Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
