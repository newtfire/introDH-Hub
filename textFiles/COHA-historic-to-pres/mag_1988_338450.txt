Was all the world 's news last week taking place within taxi-hailing distance of Red Square ? One might have thought so from the TV networks ' saturation coverage of the Moscow summit . The main event , of course , was the face-to-face meeting between President Reagan and Soviet Leader Gorbachev . The most fascinating sideshow : Raisa and Nancy playing a catty game of one-upmanship . But there was more  --  much more . Religion in the Soviet Union was suddenly a hot topic for TV reporters , as were Soviet rock music and the effect of glasnost on the Soviet press . There were tours of the Moscow subway , a visit to the first Miss Moscow beauty pageant and an interview with artists who , in honor of the summit , made plaster casts of people shaking hands . <P> With all three evening newscasts ( and a good portion of the morning news shows as well ) transplanted to Moscow for much of the week , summit news squeezed out all but the briefest wrap-up of other news . Monday night 's CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . It was , to be sure , a slow news week apart from superpower summitry . But the blanket coverage raised questions of TV overkill . With little substantive news expected from the summit , and the network news divisions already facing severe budget constraints , some wondered whether the extensive TV effort was journalistically warranted . <P> Actually , network executives claimed , the TV armada was comparatively lean this time .

Though the summit dominated regularly scheduled newscasts , none of the three networks aired a prime-time or late-night special on the subject . And except for CNN ( which devoted about 50% of its schedule to the doings in Moscow ) , live coverage was relatively sparse . When Reagan appeared at Moscow State University on Tuesday for an extraordinary question-and-answer session , CNN carried the event live in its entirety , but of the networks only ABC did so . <P> Still , the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one former network executive ; shipped in 50 tons of equipment ; and showcased star correspondents . All three evening news anchors  --  Dan Rather , Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw  --  were in attendance . Also along were Washington heavyweights like ABC 's Sam Donaldson and a morning anchor from each network : Today 's Bryant Gumbel , Good Morning , America 's Charles Gibson and CBS This Morning 's Kathleen Sullivan . The networks built temporary studios on a balcony at the Rossiya Hotel . Soviet officials even lighted up the onion domes of St. Basil 's Cathedral on Red Square every night for the cameras .
