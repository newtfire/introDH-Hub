Somebody knocked on my door . I opened it , and there stood Cat . I had n't seen her in ten years , not since we were both sixteen . But this was Cat , all right . In the flesh . In the flesh and a blue silk bathrobe and apparently nothing else . Her feet were bare . She did n't even carry a purse . Cat ? ' I said . A corner of her mouth tipped up . How are you doing , Sammy ? ' I was barely able to stay on my feet . That 's how I was doing . Come on in , ' I told her , and staggered out of the way . She stepped into my apartment , swung the door shut , then leaned back and rested a hand on the knob . It 's been a long time , ' she said . I responded with , It 's great to see you . ' Which may have been the understatement of all time . I was shocked . I 'd loved Cat Lorimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone off to live in Seattle with her parents all those years ago , I 'd dreamed about her plenty . I 'd daydreamed about her plenty . I 'd even toyed with fantasies of looking her up going on a Cat Lorimer hunt a pilgrimage in quest of my one-and-only true love . And here she was . Right in front of me , appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the night , wearing a royal blue silk robe that matched her eyes . You 're lookin ' good , ' she said . You , too . You look great . ' She also looked tired and a little too thin . My God , ' she said , we were just a couple of kids ... ' Eyes fixed on me , she did her half-smile again and shook her head . You recognized me right away , did n't you ? ' Of course . ' Amazing . ' You have n't changed much . ' She 'd changed a lot , but not in ways that made her difficult to recognize . She still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pale slit of a scar like a nick on her right cheekbone . Her face was more defined , more mature in some ways more beautiful but it was still the face that had haunted my life for the past decade . I would 've known it anywhere . And cherished it . You look better than ever , ' I said . You , too , ' she said . You turned into a man . ' Yeah ? ' Yeah . ' One of her shoulders hopped up and down , sliding the silk against her breast . What 've you been doing with yourself ? ' she asked . Not much , ' I said . Married ? ' Nope . You ? ' Not anymore . ' So she had been married . I 'd suspected as much . Every guy wants a girl like Cat , so it only made sense that one had gotten her . I despised him . But apparently he was no longer in the picture , which pleased me . Divorced ? ' I asked . He was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled as if troubled by the news . I 'm so sorry . ' Thanks . ' She raised her eyebrows . You have n't been married at all ? ' Not yet . ' Never found the right girl ? ' The question slugged me . She seemed to know it , too . Some answers popped into my head . Things like , I found her , but she got away . ' And , I 've never wanted anyone but you , Cat . ' Only a guy does n't say stuff like that . Not unless he wants to look like a jerk . All I said was , Nope . Guess not . ' She made her shoulder hop again . So you 're basically unattached at the moment ? ' Basically . ' So you could ... come with me ? ' Come with you ? ' Over to my house . ' When ? ' Now . ' Now ? ' Are you all right ? ' she asked . Sure . I think so . ' I think you 're in shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said . My car 's out front . Maybe you should get your toothbrush and whatever else you might need for the night . ' I 'm staying overnight ? ' Is that all right ? ' Sure , ' I said . Do you have a job , or anything ? ' No . Yeah . But it 's summer vacation . I teach . So I 'm off till September . ' Great . This 'll work out great . If you 'd like , you could pack some things and maybe stay for a few days . ' I nodded . And just stood there , gaping at her . Nothing seemed quite real . But real enough . Even though the past three or four minutes seemed like a wish-fulfillment fantasy , I was n't dreaming . I was awake . Only a lunatic ca n't tell the difference . What 's going on ? ' I asked , surprising myself that I was able to come up , at last , with a sensible question . I need your help , ' Cat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need to hear that . I would 've gone with her , no matter what her answer had been . You are n't in some sort of danger , are you ? ' I asked . You might say that . I 'll tell you about it on the way over . ' Okay . I 'll go get a few things . ' When I left the living room , Cat was still leaning back against my door . My first stop was the bathroom . Instead of just grabbing my toothbrush , I used it . I could n't avoid the mirror ; it was straight in front of my face while I scrubbed my teeth . My hair was shaggy and mussed . I had a two-day growth of whiskers . My T-shirt was coming apart at the seam in front of my left shoulder , and its faded front showed a turkey vulture looking dour . The caption under the vulture read , Patience , my ass . I 'm gon na kill something . ' I looked like a bum . The last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit from the only girl I 'd ever loved . Sprucing myself up would 've taken too long , so I only brushed my teeth . Then I took my toilet kit into my bedroom , dragged an overnight bag out of my closet , and started to throw things in . Do n't bother to change , ' Cat called from the living room . You 're fine the way you are . ' I was n't so sure about that . But maybe a nasty old vulture T-shirt and ragged blue jeans were appropriate attire for whatever brand of help ' she required . Socks were not , so I put sneakers on over them . Then I pocketed my wallet and keys , and hauled my bag into the living room . Cat was standing in front of my bookshelves , her back to me . She did n't look around . I see you 're still a reader , ' she said . Yeah . ' I remember that . You never went anywhere without a paperback . ' Turning her head , she smiled and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here in your pocket . Even when you took me out . You wrote such beautiful poetry . ' I 've mostly switched to prose . ' She turned around . Do you still have that old copy of Dracula ? ' Sure . Somewhere . I never get rid of a book . ' It got all wrecked by the rain . ' I still have it , ' I said . There was a tightness in my throat . Because she remembered . We got soaked , too , ' she said . She tilted her head to one side . Remember ? ' she asked . Sure . The Santa Monica Pier . ' We ate fried clams . ' And got caught in a downpour . ' Drenched . ' Head still tilted , she smiled a little sadly . And then we went under the pier to get out of the rain . Do you remember that ? ' Yeah . I do . ' It was the first time we ever kissed , ' she said . Standing in the sand under the Santa Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Her smile suddenly lost its sadness , and she laughed softly . You kept telling me the trolls were gon na get us . ' I had to smile , too . Did I ? ' I guess that 's why I 'm here . ' Huh ? Trolls ? ' Shaking her head slightly from side to side , she walked toward me . Because I felt Safe with you . I always felt safe with you , Sam . But especially that night under the pier when we were drenched and the rain was coming down and ... the trolls were all around us . And we kissed . ' Stopping just inches in front of me , she stared up into my eyes . She smelled the same as when she was a teenager : like cotton candy and Wrigley 's Spearmint Chewing Gum . And you had Dracula in your back pocket , ' she whispered . Yeah , ' I said . My heart was thundering . I put my bag down on the floor . I want to feel safe again , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought she wanted me to kiss her . I wondered if her lips would feel the way I remembered them . They were slightly parted , the lower lip full and pursed out a little . I was about to kiss them . But she said , Take a look at this , okay ? ' And fingered open the front of her robe , sliding the glossy blue silk sideways to the left , exposing a sliver of bare skin all the way down to the sash around her waist . Just as her left breast started to show , she cupped it with her right hand to hold the robe in place . Her other hand slid the fabric almost to her shoulder . She tilted her head to the right , giving me a good , clear view of the left side of her neck . She had a pair of holes down low where the curve was . As if she 'd been stabbed there a day or two ago with an ice pick or a freshly sharpened pencil . Neat little punctures , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dried fluids . What do you think ? ' she asked . You 're not going to tell me a vampire did this , ' I said . Think again . ' A vampire ? ' Gazing into my eyes , she said , He comes into my bedroom at night , bites me and sucks my blood . What would you call him ? ' Lucky , I answered in my mind . And felt like a jerk for thinking it . Let me feel , ' I said . She hoisted an eyebrow . Go ahead . ' I used the tip of my forefinger . Her skin was slightly puffy around the edges of each hole . I really could n't feel the punctures ; they were too small . They 're real , ' Cat said . Yeah . They are . ' Real , but possibly self-inflicted . A decade had gone by . At thirteen , fourteen , fifteen and for the small part of her sixteenth year before I 'd lost her Cat had been impish , tender-hearted , innocent , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old the young Cat remained ? Had she turned strange , gone mad ? Though her sudden arrival in the middle of the night dressed in nothing but a robe was very odd , she did n't strike me as nuts . Drawing her robe shut , she said , I want you to stop him , Sammy . I just ca n't stand it anymore . I 've tried to kill him myself , but he 's too strong . I thought maybe you could hide and take him by surprise the next time he comes . ' You want me to kill him ? ' Would you ? ' I do n't know , ' I said . Just come over and be with me , okay ? Can you do that ? ' Sure . ' Chapter Two Cat 's car was parked on the street in front of my apartment building . On the way out to it , we did n't run into anyone . I walked behind her , carrying my bag . It was a warm July night . A breeze was blowing softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . If you wanted to be wandering outside in nothing but your robe , this was a good night for it . At the rear of her car , Cat took the keys out of her pocket . She unlocked the trunk . I swung my bag in . The trunk lid made a good , solid thunk when I shut it . We split up . I walked to the passenger door , and she went around to the driver 's side . It is n't locked , ' she said . When I opened it , the overhead light came on . We both climbed in . Cat had a difficult time keeping her robe closed . I looked away to avoid embarrassing either of us . We shut our doors and the light went out . After taking a couple of seconds to straighten her robe , she started the engine . I should 've gotten dressed , ' she said . It 's a nice robe , ' I told her . She put on the headlights and swung away from the curb . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't even know where I was going . I threw on my robe , grabbed my keys and ran . And ended up at your place . ' You knew where to find me ? ' Sure . I 've known for a while . ' For a while ? ' She turned her head . I looked over at her . Actually , ' she said , I 've always known . I 've never lost track of you . ' Her words stunned me . She faced forward again to watch the road . You 're ... like my safety hatch , ' she said . The one person I figured I could count on , no matter what . So I always had to know where you were living . Just in case . ' That must 've been a pretty good trick . ' I 've stayed in touch with Lynn . '
