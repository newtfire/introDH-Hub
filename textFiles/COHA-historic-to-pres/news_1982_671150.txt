" We ' ve got a nine-month inventory of new cars backed up here in the lot , " says Mr. Mancini , a salesman for the last 15 years with a Tucson Chevrolet dealership . " I never thought I ' d see it , but even here in Arizona people are scared these days. " // Like much of the nation this autumn , the sour state of the economy is the No. 1 issue among voters in the race to represent Arizona ' s Fifth Congressional District , a new seat carved out of the high desert and arid mountains in the state ' s southeast corner . Two experienced Arizona politicians , James McNulty , a Democrat , and James Kolbe , a Republican , are campaigning to represent the district in the House of Representatives. // But with the campaign in the final stretch , there is still no clear measure here of just what impact that frustration over the economy will have among voters on Election Day , or whether it will translate into a protest vote against Republicans like Mr. Kolbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Even Mr. Mancini , who says he is a registered Democrat , says he has not made up his mind between Mr. McNulty and Mr. Kolbe . While some public and private polls have given a slight edge to Mr. McNulty , a 57-year-old lawyer from rural Bisbee and a former State Senator , they also show that , like Mr. Mancini , as many as 30 percent of the voters have not decided how they are going to vote in the Congressional contest. // " I know a lot of people who are upset about the economy , who have lost their jobs , " said Dave Snyder , a teacher of American government at Flowing Wells High School in northwest Tucson , where the two candidates appeared at a patriotism rally earlier this month . " But they also have a negative feeling about the whole political process . And the end result is that they will probably just stay away ; they won ' t even vote. " // The contest has been given high priority among Republicans and Democrats in Washington . Luminaries from Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the list of campaigners for the local candidates. // But among voters here , the race seems to have generated only moderate interest . Part of that reflects the fact that the Fifth is a new district , carved out of the Congressional stronghold of Representative Morris K. Udall , the popular Democrat who has represented the area for the last 11 terms . <> <> Uncertainty on New District // Indeed , some people in Tucson , which has been splintered into two jagged halves by the redistricting , say that they are still uncertain whether they belong in Mr. Udall ' s reconfigured Second District , or the new Fifth District. // At the same time , the two candidates have waged a low-key and scrupulously polite campaign that has produced few fireworks . As a result , both are perceived among voters as decent men whose principal difference is their party affiliation. // Mr. McNulty has refused to make any direct assault in his campaigning on either President Reagan or Reaganomics , the political shorthand for the President ' s troubled economic program . That tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s labor supporters , who would prefer the Democratic candidate to come out slashing. // " I realize that it ' s just not Jim ' s style to be that way , " said Eddie Jackson , vice president of Local 937 of the United Steelworkers , which represents 2 , 800 copper miners in the Tucson area , nearly half of whom are unemployed . " But I think we ' ve got to convince people that Ronald Reagan is not the kindly old gentleman they see on TV . He ' s a good actor but a rotten President. " // But if Mr. McNulty is not attacking the President , Mr. Kolbe is not defending him . Though the 40-year-old Republican , the majority whip of the state Senate , says Mr. Reagan ' s economic policies should be given more time to work , he insists the election next month is not a test of those policies. // " Ronald Reagan is not running for Congress in the Fifth District of Arizona , " said Mr. Kolbe in a recent televised debate . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense , the new Fifth District is a classic Sun Belt seat , its very existence a direct product of the large shift in population that has gained new Congressional seats for the West and Southwest at the expense of the Middle West and East. // Though there are some 30 , 000 more registered Democrats here than Republicans , 23 percent of the voters have lived in the area less than five years , recent emigres who have come to take jobs in the district ' s high-technology or defense-related industries . When the new Fifth District was carved out , the conventional thinking was that population trends favored the Republicans. // Most of the district ' s population of 544 , 000 is concentrated in the Tucson area , amid the affluent subdivisions and neighborhoods east of downtown where the largest share of the new Sun Belt arrivals have settled . But the district also includes the copper mines along the New Mexico border , where unemployment rates have been among the highest in the nation. // In Greenlee County , for example , unemployment in September was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some 2 , 200 copper miners. // North of Green Valley , at the rural crossroads of Suhuarita , Bill Brannen , a convenience store owner , grouses that , like the weather , a lot of people in southern Arizona are complaining these days about government , but no one seems to want to do anything about it. // Mr. Brannen has been lobbying hard among customers to vote down a statewide ballot measure that would require cash deposits on beverage containers . " But you start to talk politics with people and - zip - they ' re outside the door , " said Mr. Brannen. //
