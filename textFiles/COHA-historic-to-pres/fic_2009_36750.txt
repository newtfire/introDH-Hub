From the Beginning <p> " Okay , Yoshi , it 's your time , " I whispered to myself . I ran my hands over my Chanel pencil skirt to smooth out the wrinkles . Then I turned toward the large bathroom mirror and checked my ass-along with my silver tongue and beautiful face , it was one of my best assets . I stood in the old-fashioned marble courthouse bathroom , making sure I looked as stunning as always before I made my way to the courtroom . My assistant had just texted my Black-Berry to tell me the jury was back with a verdict . The jury had only deliberated for one day . For a defense attorney , that could spell disaster . But that rule stood for regular defense attorneys-and I 'd like to think that I was in a class by myself . <p> The trial had had its moments , but through it all I shined like a star . On the second to last day , I had all but captured the jury in the palm of my hand . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the two second-generation Asian jurors . My mother would 've been so proud . As a proud Korean , she always wanted me to forget that I was half Black . She spoke Korean all the time . It had everything to do with the volatile relationship she had with my father before he packed up and left New York to go back to his hometown in Virginia when I was only eight years old . Him leaving the family devastated my mother , but I was okay with it . I got tired of listening to them fuss and fight all the time . And it seemed like it always got worse on the weekends when he came home drunk . <p> That was n't the life my mother 's parents had in mind for her after they emigrated all the way from Korea to Brooklyn , New York . I 'm sure they felt that if she was going to struggle , then she needed to struggle with her own kind . Not with some African-American scumbag , alcoholic , warehouse worker from Norfolk , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of making it big in the music industry . My mother , unfortunately , picked him to father me . When I got old enough to understand , my mother told me that as soon as my grandparents got wind of their relationship , they disowned her . But as soon as my dad packed his shit and left , they immediately came to her rescue and wrote her back into their will . They were so happy that nigga left , they got on their knees and started sending praises to Buddha . <p> I could n't care one way or the other . I mean , it was n't like we were close anyway . From as far back as I could remember , I pretty much did my own thing . After school I would always go to the library and find a book to read , which was why I excelled in grade school . After graduating from high school , I thought about nothing else but furthering my education in law . I had always aspired to be a TV court judge , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show was to become an attorney first . So here I was defending my client , the alleged leader of the Fuc-Chang Korean Mafia , who was on trial for murder , bribery , and racketeering . Now I knew he was guilty as hell , but I pulled every trick out of the bag to make the jury believe that he was n't . <p> " Ms. Lomax , the jury returned its verdict after just one day of deliberation . Are you worried ? " a reporter called out as I made my way down the hallway toward Judge Allen 's courtroom . A swarm of reporters surrounded me , shoving microphones in my face . I never turned down an opportunity to show up on television . <p> " A fast verdict is just what I expected . My client is innocent . " I smiled , flashing my perfect white teeth and shaking my long , jet black hair . And right after I entered the courtroom , I switched my ass as hard as I could down the middle aisle toward the defense table . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning my entire body . My red Chanel suit was an eye-catcher . It showed off my curves and it made me look like a million bucks . When potential clients approach me for representation , they are not surprised to learn that I charge a minimum of $2,500 an hour . They do n't even blink when the figure rolls off my tongue . The way they see it , you never put a price on freedom , and with my victory rate , how can they lose ? <p> Right before I took my seat at the defense table , I looked at my client , Mr. Choo , who was shackled like an animal and guarded by courtroom officers . He appeared cool , calm , and collected , unlike the men in black across from him . The prosecutors sat at their table and fiddled with pens , bit nails , and adjusted ties . They looked nervous and frazzled , to say the least . I was just the opposite . In fact , I was laughing my ass off on the inside because I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior court officer moved to the front of the jam-packed courtroom , ordered everyone to stand , and announced Judge Allen . I looked up at Judge Mark Allen , with his salt-and-pepper balding head and little beady eyes . Mark is what I call him when he 's not in his black robe . As a matter of fact , it gets really personal when he and I get together for one of our so-called romantic interludes . Last week was the last time he and I got together , and it was in his chambers . It was so funny because I let him fuck me in his robe with his puny five-inch wrinkled dick . He thought he was the man , too . And when it was all said and done , I made sure I wiped my cum all over the crotch of his slacks . Shit , Monica Lewinsky ai n't got nothing on me . I wanted him to know that I had no respect for his authority or his courtroom . After I let him get at me , and I bribed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom went my way . The prosecutors never had a chance .... It was amusing to watch . <p> The judge cleared his throat and began to speak . The courtroom was " pin drop " quiet . <p> " Jury , what say you in the case of the State of Florida versus Haan Choo ? " Judge Allen boomed . <p> The jury foreperson , a fair-skinned Black woman in her mid-fifties , stood up swiftly , her hands trembling . " We , the jury , in the matter of the State of Florida versus Haan Choo , finds as follows : to the charge of first-degree murder ... not guilty . ' " <p> A gasp resounded through the courtroom . Then the scream of some victim 's family members . <p> " Order ! " Judge Allen screamed . <p> The foreperson continued without looking up from her paper . " To the charge of racketeering ... not guilty . To the charge of bribery ... not guilty . And to the charge of conspiracy ... not guilty . ' " <p> Mr. Choo jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoshi , you greatest , " he whispered in broken English . <p> " Order ! " the judge screamed again . " Bailiff , take Mr. Choo back to booking so he can be released . " He had to go through his motions to set Mr. Choo free . I looked over at the prosecutors ' table and threw them a smile . I knew they all wished they could just jump across the table and kill me . Too bad they had n't taken what I had offered them after the preliminary hearing . Both assistant district attorneys were new to the game and overeager to take on their first high-profile case . Out of the gate they wanted to prove to their boss that they both could take me on , but somebody should 've warned them that I was no one to fuck with . With a smile still on my face , I strutted by them and said , " Idiots ! " just loud enough for only them to hear . Then I threw my hair back and continued to strut my shit out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head administrator ten crisp one-hundred-dollar bills , it only took about an hour to process Mr. Choo 's release papers . Money talks and bullshit runs the marathon ! And before anyone knew it , Mr. Choo and I were walking outside to greet the press . He and I both were all smiles , because he was a free man and I knew that in an hour or so , I was going to be $2 million richer ; that alone made me want to celebrate . But first , we needed to address the media . Cameras flashed and microphones passed in front of us as we stepped into the sunlight . Mr. Choo rushed to the huddle of microphones that all but blocked his slim face from view . " Justice was served today . I am innocent and my lawyer proved that . I no crime boss , I am family man . I run my business and I love America , " he rambled , his horrible English getting on my nerves . I waited patiently while he made his grand stand and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told everyone my client was innocent . Mr. Choo came to the United States from Korea to make an honest- " Bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang ! The sound of shouts and then screams rang in my ears . Then I heard someone in the crowd yell in Korean , " You fucking snitch ! " The shots stopped me dead in my tracks ; my words tumbled back down my throat like hard marbles , choking me . I grabbed my arm as heat radiated up to my neck . <p> " Oh shit , I 'm hit ! " I screamed . I dropped to the ground , scrambling to hide ... and saw Mr. Choo , his head dangling and his body slumped against the courthouse steps . His mouth hung open and blood dripped from his lips and chin . Before I could figure out what to do next , someone snatched me up from the ground . I did n't know where we were headed-my thoughts were on my throbbing arm and my racing heart . Then suddenly my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My career changed after Mr. Choo 's trial . Shit , after having almost lost my damn life , I would not accept anything less than the best . <p> After the shooting , the law firm of Shapiro and Witherspoon was thrown into the media spotlight like never before . I became known as the " ride-or-die bitch attorney " that would take a bullet to get a client off . I became the most sought-after criminal defense attorney in Florida . Sometimes I did n't know if that was good or bad . But one thing was sure , my life changed and my appetite for money and power grew more and more intense . I started living each day as if it were my last . <p> Years ago , I never thought I would have turned out to be the way I was today . When you look at it , I had become a heartless bitch ! I could not care less about anyone , including my own damn mother . Even when having a nightcap with my flavor of the night , I never let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him , I reminded myself that it was only business and that my client 's freedom was on the line , so everything worked out fine . That 's how I kept men in line . After the shooting , I vowed that my heart would remain in my pocket forever . <p> Chapter Two Baller Status <p> My life was great . Hands down , I was really doing it big . After my brush with death , I was propelled into the firm 's million-dollar club . Yes , I did say million-dollar club-a club at the firm that was usually reserved for prestigious White men . But I broke through that glass ceiling . I had become a giant and I was continuously growing . <p> After the incident and the media rush , I was promoted to junior partner at the firm , which sent my bank account swelling . I was waiting for senior partner , but this would do for now . I purchased a split-level penthouse for $5.2 million , right in the heart of Collins Avenue . I had a beautiful view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given one of the best offices in the building-an executive suite . My office was like a second home , complete with a dressing room and a granite-tiled full bathroom . I could sleep there if I wanted . There were a lot of haters at the firm after that . <p> My reputation spoke for itself . Not only did I have a 98 percent acquittal rate , most of my clientele were rich , I mean fucking wealthy-and most , if not all , were high-level crime heads . I was n't representing any petty thugs or hand-to-hand street hustlers ; they could never afford to pay even my retainer . Trust me , I had my shit together and I could n't be touched , because I maintained a license to practice law in New York , Arizona , Florida , and Nevada-not bad for a thirty-four-year-old daughter of a Korean immigrant . I was single , but I got my fair share of dick . I was married to dead presidents ; I did n't need a fucking man locking me down or trying to share my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . Speaking of which , I had my brush with almost becoming a mother ; but I got rid of that fucking baby so fast , it was n't even funny . I was n't about to let a baby slow me down . I had a lot of shit going on , so a newborn baby did not fit into that equation . Not only that , the asshole I was pregnant by had a wife , so that would not have worked anyway . I am not into sharing someone else 's husband and calling the bastard my fucking baby daddy . Come on , now , how does that shit sound ? Ridiculous , if you ask me , so I was n't about to take myself through that unnecessary drama . <p> Shit , I was Yoshi Lomax . Wherever I went , I commanded attention . Everyone and their mother knew who the fuck I was . And it was n't because I was a fucking beautiful woman ; it was because I was a TV whore . I was one bad bitch and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the firm of Shapiro and Witherspoon that I could either work hard or work smart . Needless to say , I chose to work smart . I 'd see these little lawyers running around doing tons and tons of research for a case , but I said the hell with that ! I mean , what the fuck was the point ? I 'd rather go to the judge , DA , or police officer , and offer them a big payoff in exchange for my client 's acquittal . And if they 're attractive enough to fuck , I 'd throw in a quickie or a one-nighter , depending on how high the stakes were . Speaking of which , half of everyone I had working on my team preferred to fuck me over the cash , so I 'm like , hey , that works for me . Shit , I did n't mind keeping the cash in the bank . I was all for it . And since that was how the game was played , I played my cards very well . <p> * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach penthouse and inhaled the fresh scent of the ocean . It was the middle of January and I watched the sun rise ; the hint of orange and streaks of purple that laced the sky and glinted off the sea 's horizon made me feel good inside . The seventy-degree air was brisk and blew open my silk and lace La Perla bathrobe . I flinched as the air brushed across my rock-hard nipples . I started to rush to close my bathrobe but decided to let my perfect C-cup breasts catch the sunrise . <p> I turned and peered through my glass patio doors just in time to see Paul stirring in my bed . My stomach turned . I hated his fake tanned body and his jet black greasy hair . A fake-ass Al Pacino is what he looked like . I watched him stroke his dick , getting it ready for yet another round with me , which was something I was totally dreading . Not only was his fuck game on zero , this guy 's dick was a mess . If Viagra was n't on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a paddle . <p> Paul Shapiro was my egocentric boss at the law firm of Shapiro and Witherspoon . He wielded his power like an ax , chopping down anything that got in his way . When I first arrived at the firm , fresh out of law school , I could not get a break to save my life . Although I had been assigned some of the most challenging cases and had an almost perfect acquittal rate , I still could not get the respect I deserved . My praises were minimized to meager bonus checks and a pat on the back . It seemed like I could n't break into the good ole boy network that dominated the firm 's culture . Hard work was a curse at Shapiro and Witherspoon . I learned that lesson very quickly . <p> After I rebuffed thousands of sexual advances , sleeping with Paul was not a decision I made easily . My career relied on it . I finally obliged and gave him some ass , but I had other things in mind when I did it ... like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " By any means necessary ! " I was a true believer in that shit , especially if it meant keeping me in the most expensive jewels , designer clothes , cars , and vacations . A few minutes of sweaty fucking meant a lifetime of money , jewelry , cars , and trips . It also meant making my mother proud . She 'd worked like a slave cleaning up after people-just like Paul-to send me to college and law school . <p> I walked inside and flashed a halfhearted smile at Paul . " Listen , I have a meeting with a new client , so we have to cut this short , " I lied . <p> " What , you gon na leave me and him high and dry ? " Paul asked , pointing to his hard dick . <p> I sighed . " Look , Paul , I have a meeting , " I said dryly , walking into my master bathroom . I clicked on the twenty-seven-inch flat-screen TV that hung over my Jacuzzi tub ; I wanted to drown his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gumption to tell his silly ass that our fucking sprees had come to an end . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
