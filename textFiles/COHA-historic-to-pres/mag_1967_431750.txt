. Madagascar ISLAND AT THE END OF THE EARTH WHENEVER I APPROACH an island from the air , I think the Wright brothers went too far . Seeing the land suddenly appear beneath you is nothing like watching a high tropical island grow up out of the ocean . From a ship you see first a white mass of cumulus clouds piled high on the horizon . Then the clouds detach themselves from the sea , and the tips of the highest peaks , small and remote , stipple the edge of the sky like separate islets . Finally , as the land slowly comes up over the curve of the earth , the peaks grow together and rise green and brown on a writhing line of white where the surf splinters on the shore . But Madagascar is really more of a continent than an island . I was glad , then , to have my first view of La Grande Ile from the pilot 's compartment of an Air France jet flying at 1,000 feet . The thousand-mile-long island-continent lies off the southeast coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean ( map , page 453 , and supplement painting ) . There is nothing between the southernmost tip of Madagascar and Antarctica but 3,000 miles of heaving gray sea and howling winds . This is truly the landau bout du monde , at the end of the earth , as Malagasy poet Flavien Ranaivo calls it . Home of the Lemur and a Giant Bird The 13th-century Venetian traveler Marco Polo never saw Madagascar . Nevertheless , he spoke the truth when he wrote , " You must know that this island is one of the biggest and best in the whole world . " And , he might have added , one of the most singular . Only three islands on earth ? Greenland , New Guinea , and Borneo ? exceed it in size , and none surpasses Madagascar in the oddity and variety of its plants and beasts . Whatever Madagascar 's origin , the island must have been isolated for a very long time Strange animals and plants found there exist nowhere else on earth ( pages 474-7 ) . Lemurs , the great-eyed monkeylike creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groping toward man , lead the peculiar fauna But subfossil bones of creatures that lived until comparatively recent times reveal a pygmy hippopotamus no bigger than a dog . a lemur the size of a small pony , and a gigantic bird that laid the largest known eggs . When I was a boy , I read a short story about that bird . It was called " AepyorniIsland , " a fantasy written by that master of English prose H. G. Wells . The story tells of a professional collector who went to Madagascar to search for aepyornis eggs . Although the birds have been extinct for several centuries , in the tale one of the eggs hatches , and the chick grows 15 feet high . I never forgot that story . One of my principal reasons for coming to Madagascar was to try to find an egg of this titanic bird . Now the plane 's pilot lightly pressed his hands forward and the horizon rose to meet us , a long coastline colored like Mars , ocherous red with touches of green . Dead ahead lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Betsiboka . From the river 's mouth spread a fan of red , staining the blue Mozambique Channel as though the lifeblood of Madagascar poured from some deep laceration where man had grievously wounded the earth . Man the Destroyer has slashed and burned most of the great forest that once covered nearly all Madagascar , exposing the bare  | earth . Eroding rains have washed away much of the organic matter in the denuded soil , leaving a very high proportion of oxidized aluminum and iron salts . As we flew southward toward Antananarivo , the capital ( the French spell it Tananarive ) , the ocher hills , dusted with yellow green , rose toward the mountains that run the length of Madagascar . In folds between the hills lay dark wedges of forest . Pockets of water caught the light as we passed ( page 457 ) . Malagasy Ancestry Lies to the East It was December , the beginning of the austral summer , and the rice fields of the high valleys were flooded with rain . The tender green of the young rice lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread rectangles of vivid color on the valley floors . At the airport I was struck by the appearance of the Malagasy ( pronounced MAHL-aGAHSH-y ) . Brown-skinned and fine-boned , with straight black hair and large luminous eyes , many of them would have passed unnoticed on the streets of Bangkok or Papeete . The highland Malagasy , though close to Africa , are not of it . They call themselves Malayo-Polynesians , and their ancestors came , according to linguistic , cultural , and anthropological evidence , from somewhere in southeastern Asia . How and when they came to Madagascar is one of the major enigmas of the " Mysterious Island . " In the taxi I took to Antananarivo a sign in French read : " City , 100 francs . Upper city , 150 francs . Corteges , Marriages , Funerals , Exhumations , Price to be Debated . " I asked the driver about the exhumations . " We Malagasy , " he said , " open the tombs of our ancestors every now and then , and wrap the bodies in new shawls , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from America ? If a man has plenty of money , and likes the busy life , that 's the place . But if he wants a tranquil life , on little money , let him come to Madagascar . " I was going to take a job in your country . When the American consul gave me the papers , I read the address ; it was 4500 Something Street in Chicago . When I saw that , I tore up the document . Any place that has street addresses in four figures is not for me . " Antananarivo , 4,000 feet above sea level , rises theatrically from the plain and is built on hills ( following pages ) . The houses of the old town , like overlapping rectangles of pink , brown , and blue in a cubist painting , cluster round and beneath the austere outline of the century-old gray stone Palace of the Queen . Today Tana , as the French call it , is bursting at the hills , and surrounding rice fields are being drained to build housing developments for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower 451 by pullulate with people and vehicles . Great uses belching clouds of black diesel fumes block the way of motorcycles , two-cylinder Citroen taxis , Renault station wagons , oxarts , rickety rickshas on their last wheels , and throngs of pedestrians . I bought a secondhand Renault from a firm called Madauto . That name aptly describes the driving in Antananarivo . Taught by the wheel-mad French , the Malagasy outdo their teachers . They come rocketing out of obscure side streets into the busiest avenue in town . After two or three near misses that left me shaken , I began to get the hang of the thing , and soon I was in there expressing myself with my car like all the rest . Strong Ties Still Link Isle to France Under the arcades on the broad Avenue de I'Independance , cafe terrasses recall the sidewalk cafes of France . Signs everywhere are in French , and many of the Malagasy are bilingual . The city and its people reflect the years of French influence that have shaped their special character . The French attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did not really establish themselves as the dominant influence until the end of the 19th century . In 1895 , to " protect the rights " of French citizens , France sent an expeditionary force to conquer the island . The French dominion in Madagascar lasted 63 years and 14 days . On October 14 , 1958 , Madagascar declared the Malagasy Republic . Gallic culture has always left a deep imprint on the people of France 's overseas possessions ; the world is full of dark-skinned " Frenchmen . " The first President of the Malagasy Republic , His Excellency M. Philibert Tsiranana , emphasized this in an interview . " We think French , " he said . " The rapport that exists between us and France is first of @# all the rapport of friendship . And France is the biggest customer for Malagasy products . But above all , the most valuable heritage France left us is French culture . That will always link us closely to France . " The President is a robust , brown-skinned man with a round , open countenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the Tsimihety tribe , a lowlander from northern Madagascar . M. Tsiranana spoke of the origin of the Malagasy peoples . " We are the only true Afro-Asians , " he said . " Geographically we are an island of Africa , but our people are of diverse origins , principally Asian with some African and even Arab influence . " We are separated from Africa by a channel only 250 miles wide . Our ancestors , who probably came to Africa from Southeast Asia by way of India , must have crossed the channel to settle on our shores . " Nobody really knows . The most any  | scientist will venture is that by the end of the first Christian millennium man was already well settled on the island . Although there are only six million people ? and ten million lyre-horned cattle ? in all Madagascar , the population is exploding geometrically . Having read that the President was against " the Pill " and all other forms of birth control , I asked him why . Families Urged to Have 12 Children " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our country has plenty of uncultivated plains and valleys ; it is manpower that we lack . I want every Malagasy to have at least 12 children . " Many of them already do . Although Madagascar 's chief crop is rice , which is seemingly planted everywhere , the government has had to import rice for the past three years as the population growth has outstripped the harvests . When I left the President 's palace , I drove higher up the ridge to the summit and the Palace of the Queen . Against the somber stone structure , a square building with a tower at each corner , a sad wind blew trumpetshaped jacaranda blossoms into drifts like pale violet snow . The stone palace , built by a Scottish architect in 1866 , completely sheathes an earlier edifice of wood . The original palace was built in 18 ? 0 Queen Ranavalona I , a virago of the Me dynasty who , turning against the Chris ized Malagasy and all European influe had five thousand of her subjects put to de Near the palace stands the single-r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Andrianampoinimerina , famous of the dynasty . The light-skin Merina , most Polynesian of Madagasc peoples and its largest tribal group , inh the highlands . Andrianampoinimerina was the first unify by conquest the people of the hplateaus , achieving this in the early 18 His ambition looked beyond the horizon , he used to say , " Ny riaka no valamparihik The sea is the limit of my rice field . " dominion never reached the sea , but successors continued his conquests until . 1860 , they ruled nearly all Madagascar held most of the other peoples in tribute , a even slavery . Since independence , lowlands have gained political ascendancy . Like the Polynesian dialects to which it is related , the Malagasy language speaks metaphors and poetic imagery . And here still another mystery of Madagascar : Although its peoples are subdivided in 17 major tribes , varying in appearance from Asian to African , all speak the same tongue , with minor variations . Foreigners find the polysyllabic language , which combines whole phrases in worth of inordinate length , difficult to pronounce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information as well as a poet . that I had seen some exceed -+ ingly long names in the list of Merina kings . M. Ranaivo looked over my list . @#  | @# " Those are n't really long , " he said . " Here is one for you . " After writing for what seemed to be half a minute , M. Ranaivo handed me a slip of paper . I read : ** " It means , " said M. Ranaivo , " The Beloved Prince of Imerina Who Surpasses the Reigning Prince . ' That was too long even for the Malagasy , so they shortened it " ? he smiled slightly ? " to Andrianampoinimerina . " Remembering that the Malagasy make sacrifice to Andrianampoinimerina as a revered ancestor , I later asked a Malagasy friend about religious beliefs . He said , " The missionaries did their work well here . Most of the highlanders are Protestant Christian . The Catholics have more strength in the south , where the Lazarist Fathers came in 1648 with the Sieur de Flacourt . " But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely vaccinated with Christianity . There is not one Malagasy , no , not one , not even among the evolved Europeanized people , who would think of building a house without consulting the soothsayer as to the auspicious day to start . The old beliefs are not dead . " We Malagasy believe in a single deity ; we call him Andriamanitra , the Perfumed Lord , or Zanahary , but we also believe our ancestors will intercede with God for us if we make sacrifice and pray to them " ( pages 464-5 ) . This reverence for ancestors , and the sense of their nearness even after death , explain the preoccupation with death , the tombs built half below and half above ground , and the rejoicing with which the ancestors are taken up into the sunlight periodically . , " The greatest insult that can be offered to a Malagasy , " M. Ranaivo told me , " is to wish that his skull may never lie alongside those of his ancestors . If a Malagasy dies far from home , it is the filial duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his body back to the ancestral tomb . " When the time comes , the mpanandro , an astrologer , stands before the tomb and addresses the dead one thus : O you who rest in this place , we come to tell you that tomorrow , when the Eye of Day is half along its course . we will take you and lead you to the Land of Ancestors , where you will lie forever with your family . Therefore be not absently gazing at yourself in the spring , nor captive to the charms of the valley ; be at the meeting-place upon the hour . ' " When a body has lain in a tomb so long that the silken lambamena , the shawls in which it was wrapped , have disintegrated , it is time for the family to replace the wrappings . The tomb is opened every four or five years and the remains taken out and carefully enveloped in new lambamena . The people dance and sing on the way to the village , tossing their burden up and catching it again . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a happy reunion with the beloved ancestors . After the body has lain under a special awning while cattle are sacrificed and there is more dancing , they carry it back and replace it in the tomb , which is sealed until the next famadihana , the turning of the dead . " Pacific Paradise in the Indian Ocean When I remarked-to M. Ranaivo that the Malagasy reminded me of Polynesians , he said I should visit their own Tahiti . He meant Nosy Be , a small island off the northwest coast ( map , page 453 ) . I found nearly all the classic South Sea enticements at Nosy Be : coral reefs and vivid fish , outrigger canoes. coconut palms , magnificent beaches . The little postcard port , with red and white houses facing a semicircular bay , bears the singularly inappropriate name of Hell Ville , after one Admiral de Hell , who in 1841 accepted cession of the island to France . As I disembarked from the aircraft , I felt as if I were walking into a warm , sweet- . scented lagoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a yellow-green flower that yields one of the basic oils used in perfumery . Along the shaded , hilly roads from the airport , pollarded trees , heavily cut back to keep their height within reach of the ylangylang gatherers , drooped gracefully like bowing ballerinas . Farther on , pepper vines bearing clusters of green peppercorns encircled the trunks 455  | of shade trees . Glossy-leaved coffee bushes bent under their burden of berries . In succession I passed groves of clove trees , stands of aromatic lemon grass , and plantations of vanilla . I visited the largest ylang-ylang distillery with the proprietor , M. Fidahoussen Kakal , a gentleman of Pakistani origin . In a dim shed a double row of potbellied gleaming copper stills steamed with a powerful scent that was pleasant at first , but so strong it soon gave me a headache . Men tipped wire cages filled with tens of thousands of flowers into the stills in a yellow cascade . " It takes 100 pounds of flowers to produce two pounds of essence , " said M. Kakal . " The oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it under my nose . The concentrated essence was so pungently sweet it made my eyes run . " Ylang can be used as a fixative , as well as for its own scent . You might say , then , that in one form or another our oil goes into nearly all perfumes . Nosy Be produces about 45 tons a year , and France takes most of it . " At one end of the island I saw vast fields of sugar cane . So much rum and alcohol is distilled here that plantation vehicles sometimes burn the alcohol in lieu of gasoline . What an island , where all the perfumes of Araby scent the air and automobiles run on rum ! The DC-4 that stops at Nosy Be makes a circular run from Antananarivo around the north coast and back . I flew clockwise to the north and Diego Suarez , where in a great bay named for a 16th-century Portuguese sea captain , the French Navy has based continuously since 1895 , today under @# 456 EKTACHROMt lY ALHLO . MULL ) VAV. v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltli  | agreement with the Malagasy . From there I turned south along the east coast toward Antalaha , vanilla center of the world . It is fitting that a chief export of this strange land should be an orchid . Or , more properly , the seed pod of an orchid , Vanilla planifolia . Antalaha , where these orchids have flourished since their introduction in 1890 , is a steaming-hot little port in the manner of Madagascar 's east coast settlements . There is no harbor , no breakwater , nothing to stem the nervous march of Indian Ocean waves that break incessantly on the uncompromisingly straight shore . There are only navigation lights and a string of lighters to take the vanilla offshore to the uneasily anchored ships . Back of the town the dense , primeval forest clothes the hills . In this region of blood heat and heavy rains grow the finest remaining trees of rosewood , ebony , and a dozen other precious cabinet woods . Nearer town , planted trees furnish leafy shade for climbing vanilla plants that wrap each trunk in a clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bees In vanilla 's native Mexico , a melipona , a small stingless bee , helps to fecundate the orchid in its quest for pollen . But Madagascar has no melipona , and the flowers must be pollenated entirely by hand . The yellow-green vanilla orchid opens in the morning and lasts only one day . During the Madagascar flowering season , from October to December , women go from flower to flower before noon , lifting a little tongue with a small stick , and pressing stamen and pistil together . A woman busy as a bee can pollenate as many as 2,500 flowers in a single day . Of the 32 vanilla exporters in Antalaha , most are French , the rest Chinese and Indian . With M. Fabien Tortel , vice president of the Syndicate of Exporters , I walked through a plantation . In the dappled light of a grove , M. Tortel gently lifted a hanging bunch of seed pods from a tangle of lanceolate leaves . " They 're thin and green because they 're immature . It takes nine months for a vanilla pod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to harvest . " I could smell the processing shed even before I saw it . In the sweet fragrance inside , women were sorting pods . " The first thing we do with the freshly picked pods is to plunge them into hot water to arrest further ripening and prevent splitting , " M. Tortel said . " Next we spread pods out in the sun , taking them in at nig for eight to ten days . Finally the vanilla dri indoors on racks for about ten weeks , befo we pack the pods in metal boxes for shipment M. Tortel showed me a bundle of pods ti with linen thread ( opposite ) . At one end , nute white spicules glistened like hoarfro " That 's pure vanillin , crystallizing as oozes out of the pod , " he said . " Shows it 's t highest quality . " In your country the importers prepare extract from the vanilla pods by cutting them up and steeping them in alcohol . Your housewives use the extract a few drops at a time . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut it into bits , and put them in desserts . They also bury cut bits of vanilla pod in the sugar bowl . Tell your American housewives these things . " Railroad Takes a Spiral Route The aircraft that flies south from Antalaha lands at Tamatave , Madagascar 's chief port Here two coral reefs and a man-made breakwater shield the port from the winds and waves of the Indian Ocean . Only here and at Diego Suarez , on this coast , can ships come alongside . There were five vessels under the loading cranes when I landed at Tamatave . Both a motor road and a narrow-gauge railway run to Antananarivo from the port . but I recommend the train ride . It takes about 15 hours , but it is worth it . The line follows the coast at first , then turns inland at Brickaville and begins to climb through the primitive forest of the Great Island in switchback loops to reach the height of Antananarivo. almost a mile above the sea . At one place beyond Perinet the track makes a complete spiral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on itself like a snake holding its tail in its mouth . Early one morning I drove south out of Antananarivo along the road to Antsirabe . At the crest of a hill I stopped to look out over a valley of terraced rice fields . White egrets. gilded by the yellow light of morning , nearly touched wing tips with their reflections as they flapped across the flooded rice fields . In a feathery-topped clump of papyrus a kingfisher , streaked in electric blue , fixed a beady eye on the water . The asphalted road climbed steadily toward the Ankaratra range , skirting valleys green with rice and noisy with rushing water . The
