Six o'clock in the evening . Mrs. Hawkins , forty , and her daughter Minnie , almost sixteen , are sewing and knitting . At the back is a door into the hall and beside it a table on which is a telephone . MRS . HAWKINS Irish stew does n't seem right for Sunday dinner , somehow . ( Pause ) And your father does n't really like roast or veal . ( Pause ) Thank Heaven , he 's not crazy about steak . ( Another pause while she takes some pins from her mouth . ) I must say it 's downright strange  --  his not being here.He has n't telephoned for years , like that  --  that he 'd take a later train . MINNIE Did he say what was keeping him ? MRS . HAWKINS No something at the office , I suppose . ( She changes pins again ) He never really did like chicken , either . MINNIE He ate pork last week without saying anything . You might try pork chops , Mama ; I do n't really mind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He eats what 's there .  --  Oh , Minnie , men never realize that there 's only a limited number of things to eat . MINNIE What did he say on the telephone exactly ? p. 3 MRS . HAWKINS " I 'll try to catch the six-thirty . " ( Both look at their wristwatches . ) MINNIE But , Mama , Papa 's not cranky about what he eats . He 's always saying what a good cook you are . MRS . HAWKINS Men ! ( She has put down her sewing and is gazing before her . ) They think they want a lot of change  --  variety and change , variety and change . But they do n't really . Deep down , they do n't . MINNIE Do n't what ? ! MRS . HAWKINS You know for a while he read all those Wild Western magazines : cowboys and horses and silly Indians two or three a week . Then , suddenly , he stopped all that . It 's as though he thought he were in a kind of jail or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie . He may be coming down the street any minute . ( Minnie rises and , turning , peers through a window , back right . ) MINNIE No.  --  There 's Mr. Wilkerson , though . He came back on the five-twenty-five , anyway . Sometimes Papa stops at the tobacco shop and comes down Spruce Street . ( She moves to the left and looks through another window . ) MRS . HAWKINS Do you feel as though you were in a jail , Minnie ? p. 4 MINNIE What ? MRS . HAWKINS As though life were a jail ? MINNIE ( Returning to her chair ) : No , of course not .  --  Mama , you 're talking awfully funny tonight . MRS . HAWKINS I 'm not myself . ( Laughs lightly ) I guess I 'm not myself because of your father 's phone call  --  his taking a later train , like that , for the first time in so many years . MINNIE ( With a little giggle ) : I do n't know what the five-twenty-five will have done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all those hoodlums he plays cards with every afternoon . MINNIE And all the jokes they make . ( Mrs. Hawkins has been looking straight before her  --  through a window  --  over the audience 's heads , intently . ) MRS . HAWKINS There 's Mrs. Cochran cooking her dinner . ( They both gaze absorbedly at Mrs. Cochran a moment . ) Well , I 'm not going to start dinner until your father puts foot in this house . MINNIE ( Still gazing through the window ; slowly ) : There 's Mr. Cochran at the door They 're arguing about something . p. 5 MRS . HAWKINS Well , that shows that he got in on the five-twenty-five , all right . MINNIE Do n't people look foolish when you see them , like that  --  and you ca n't hear what they 're saying ? Like ants or something . Somehow , you feel it 's not right to look at them when they do n't know it . ( They return to their work . ) MRS . HAWKINS Yes , those men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes . ( Minnie giggles ) I declare , Minnie , every year your father makes worse jokes . It 's growing on him . MINNIE I do n't think they 're awful , but , I do n't understand all of them . Do you ? Like what he said to the minister Sunday . I was so embarrassed I did n't want to tell you . MRS . HAWKINS I do n't want to hear it  --  not tonight . ( Her gaze returns to the window ) I ca n't understand why Mrs. Cochran is acting so strangely . And Mr. Cochran has been coming in and out of the kitchen . MINNIE And they seem to keep looking at us all the time . ( After a moment 's gazing , they return to their work . ) MRS . HAWKINS Well , you might as well tell me what your father said to the minister . p. 6 MINNIE I I do n't want to tell you , if it makes you nervous . MRS . HAWKINS I 've lived with his jokes for twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brown had preached a sermon about the atom bomb and about how terrible it would be and at the church door Papa said to him : " Fine sermon , Joe . I enjoyed it . But have you ever thought of this , Joe "  --  he said  --  " suppose the atom bomb did n't fall , what would we do then ? Have you ever thought of that ? " Mr. Brown looked terribly put out . MRS . HAWKINS ( Puts down her sewing ) : He said that ! ! I declare , he 's getting worse . I do n't know where he gets such ideas . People will be beginning to think he 's bitter . Your father is n't bitter . I know he 's not bitter . MINNIE No , Mama . People like it . People stop me on the street and tell me what a wonderful sense of humor he has . Like like ( She gives up the attempt and says merely ) Oh , nothing . MRS . HAWKINS Go on . Say what you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There we sit for twenty years playing cards on the five-twenty-five , hoping that something big and terrible and wonderful will happen  --  like a wreck , for instance ? " p. 7 MRS . HAWKINS ( More distress than indignation ) : I say to you seriously , Minnie , it 's just self-indulgence . We do everything we know how to make him happy . He loves his home , you know he does . He likes his work  --  he 's proud of what he does at the office . ( She rises and looks down the street through the window at the back . Moved ) Oh , it 's not us he 's impatient at : it 's the whole world . He simply wishes the whole world were different  --  that 's the trouble with him . MINNIE Why , Mama , Papa does n't complain about anything . MRS . HAWKINS Well , I wish he would complain once in a while . ( She returns to her chair ) For Sunday I 'll see if I ca n't get an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . The telephone rings . ) Answer that , will you , dear ?  --  No , I 'll answer it . ( Minnie returns to her work . Mrs. Hawkins has a special voice for answering the telephone , slow and measured . ) This is Mrs. Hawkins speaking . Oh , yes , Mr. Cochran . What 's that ? I do n't hear you . ( A shade of anxiety ) Are you sure ? You must be mistaken . MINNIE Mama , what is it ? ( Mrs. Hawkins listens in silence ) Mama ! Mama ! !  --  What 's he saying ? Is it about Papa ? p. 8 MRS . HAWKINS Will you hold the line one minute , Mr. Cochran ? I wish to speak to my daughter . ( She puts her hand over the mouthpiece ) No , Minnie . It 's not about your father at all . MINNIE ( Rising ) : Then what is it ? MRS . HAWKINS ( In a low , distinct and firm voice ) : Now you do what I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look up at me and do n't show any surprise . MINNIE ( A groan of protest ) : Mama ! MRS . HAWKINS There 's nothing to be alarmed about  --  but I want you to obey me . ( She speaks into the telephone ) Yes , Mr. Cochran No Mr. Hawkins telephoned that he was taking a later train tonight . I 'm expecting him on the six-thirty.You do what you think best.I 'm not sure that 's necessary but you do what you think best.We 'll be right here . ( She hangs up and stands thinking a moment . ) MINNIE Mama , I 'm almost sixteen . Tell me what it 's about . MRS . HAWKINS ( Returns to her chair ; bending over her work , she speaks as guardedly as possible ) : Minnie , there 's probably nothing to be alarmed about . Do n't show any surprise at what I 'm about to say to you . Mr. Cochran says that there 's been somebody out on the lawn watching us  --  for ten minutes or more . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage , just looking at us. p. 9 MINNIE ( Lowered head ) : Is that all ! MRS . HAWKINS Well , Mr. Cochran does n't like it . He 's he says he 's going to telephone the police . MINNIE The police ! ! MRS . HAWKINS Your father 'll be home any minute , anyway . ( Slight pause ) I guess it 's just some some moody person on an evening walk . Maybe Mr. Cochran 's done right to call the police , though . He says that we should n't pull the curtains or anything like that  --  but just act as though nothing has happened .  --  Now , I do n't want you to get frightened . MINNIE I 'm not , Mama . I 'm just interested . Most nights nothing happens . MRS . HAWKINS ( Sharply ) : I should hope not ! ( Slight pause . ) MINNIE Mama , all evening I did have the feeling that I was being watched and that man was being watched by Mrs. Cochran ; and ( Slight giggle ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAWKINS We 'll know what it 's all about in a few minutes . ( Silence. ) p. 10 MINNIE But Mama , what would the man be looking at ?  --  Just us two sewing . MRS . HAWKINS I think you 'd better go in the kitchen . Go slowly  --  and do n't look out the window . MINNIE ( Without raising her head ) : No ! I 'm going to stay right here . But I 'd like to know why a man would do that  --  would just stand and look . Is he a crazy man ? MRS . HAWKINS No , I do n't think so . MINNIE Well , say something about him . MRS . HAWKINS Minnie , the world is full of people who think that everybody 's happy except themselves . They think their lives should be more exciting . MINNIE Does that man think that our lives are exciting , Mama ? MRS . HAWKINS Our lives are just as exciting as they ought to be , Minnie . MINNIE ( With a little giggle ) : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ; and do n't you forget it . ( The front door bell rings . ) Now , who can that be at the front door ? I 'll go , Minnie . ( Weighing the dangers ) No , you go .  --  No , I 'll go . ( She goes into the hall . The jovial voice of Mr. Forbes is heard. ) p. 11 MR . FORBES Good evening , Mrs. Hawkins . Is Herb home ? MRS . HAWKINS No , he has n't come home yet , Mr. Forbes . He telephoned that he 'd take a later train . ( Enter Mr. Forbes , followed by Mrs. Hawkins . ) MR . FORBES Yes , I know . The old five-twenty-five was n't the same without him . Darn near went off the rails . ( To Minnie ) Good evening , young lady . MINNIE ( Head bent ; tiny voice ) : Good evening , Mr. Forbes . MR . FORBES Well , I thought I 'd drop in and see Herb for a minute . About how maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's come into all that money . MRS . HAWKINS Come into what money , Mr. Forbes ? MR . FORBES Why , sure , he telephoned you about it ? MRS . HAWKINS He did n't say anything about any money . MR . FORBES ( Laughing loudly ) : Well , maybe I 've gone and put my foot in it again . So he did n't tell you anything about it yet ? Haw-haw-haw . ( Confidentially ) If he 's got to pay taxes on it we figgered out he 'd get about eighteen thousand dollars .  --  Well , you tell him I called , and tell him that I 'll give him nine hundred dollars on that Chevrolet of his  --  maybe a little more after I 've had a look at it . p. 12 MRS . HAWKINS I 'll tell him .  --  Mr. Forbes , I 'm sorry I ca n't ask you to sit down , but my daughter 's had a cold for days now and I would n't want you to take it home to your girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Well , as you say , I 'd better not carry it with me . ( He goes to the door , then turns and says confidentially ) Do you know what Herb said when he heard that he 'd got that money ? Haw-haw-haw . I 've always said Herb Hawkins has more sense of humor than anybody I know . Why , he said , " All window glass is the same . " Haw-haw . " All window glass is the same . " Herb ! You ca n't beat him . MRS . HAWKINS " All window glass is the same . " What did he mean by that ? MR . FORBES You know : that thing he 's always saying . About life . He said it at Rotary in his speech . You know how crazy people look when you see them through a window  --  arguing and carrying on  --  and you ca n't hear a word they say ? He says that 's the way things look to him . Wars and politics and everything in life . ( Mrs. Hawkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better be going . Tell Herb there 's real good glass  --  unbreakable  --  on the car I 'm going to sell him . Good night , miss ; good night , Mrs. Hawkins . ( He goes out . Mrs. Hawkins does not accompany him to the front door . She stands a moment looking before her . Then she says , from deep thought : ) p. 13 MRS . HAWKINS That 's your father who 's been standing out by the garage . MINNIE Why would he do that ? MRS . HAWKINS Looking in.  --  I should have known it . MINNIE ( Amazed but not alarmed ) : Look ! All over the lawn ! MRS . HAWKINS The police have come . Those are their flashlights . MINNIE All over the place ! I can hear them talking ( Pause ) Papa 's angry Papa 's very angry . ( They listen . ) Now they 're driving away . MRS . HAWKINS I should have known it . ( She returns to her seat . Sound of the front door opening and closing noisily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything unless he mentions it first . ( They bend over their work . From the hall sounds of Hawkins singing the first phrase of " Valencia . " Enter Hawkins , a commuter . His manner is of loud , forced geniality . ) HAWKINS Well  --  HOW are the ladies ? ( He kisses each lightly on the cheek . ) MRS . HAWKINS I did n't start getting dinner until I knew when you 'd get here . p. 14 HAWKINS ( Largely ) : Well , do n't start it . I 'm taking you two ladies out to dinner .  --  There 's no hurry , though . We 'll go to Michaelson 's after the crowd 's thinned out . ( Starting for the hall on his way to the kitchen ) Want a drink , anybody ? MRS . HAWKINS No . The ice is ready for you on the shelf . ( He goes out . From the kitchen he can be heard singing " Valencia . " He returns , glass in hand . ) What kept you , Herbert ? HAWKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He walks back and forth , holding his glass at the level of his face . ) I decided to take another train . ( He leans teasingly a moment over his wife 's shoulder , conspiratorially ) I thought maybe things might look different through the windows of another train . You know : all those towns I 've never been in ? Kenniston  --  Laidlaw  --  East Laidlaw  --  Bennsville . Let 's go to Bennsville some day . Damn it , I do n't know why people should go to Paris and Rome and Cairo when they could go to Bennsville . Bennsville ! Oh , Bennsville  --  MRS . HAWKINS Have you been drinking , Herbert ? HAWKINS This is the first swallow I 've had since last night . Oh , Bennsville breathes there a man with soul so dead  --  ( Minnie 's eyes have followed her father as he walks about with smiling appreciation. ) p. 15 MINNIE I know a girl who lives in Bennsville . HAWKINS They 're happy there , are n't they ? No , not exactly happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Bennsville they kick the hell out of life . MINNIE Her name 's Eloise Brinton . HAWKINS Well , Bennsville and East Laidlaw do n't look different through the windows of another train . It 's not by looking through a train window that you can get at the heart of Bennsville . ( Pause . ) There all we fellows sit every night on the five-twenty-five playing cards and hoping against hope that there 'll be that wonderful , beautiful  --  MINNIE ( Laughing delightedly ) : Wreck ! ! MRS . HAWKINS Herbert ! I wo n't have you talking that way ! HAWKINS A wreck , so that we can crawl out of the smoking , burning cars and get into one of those houses . Do you know what you see from the windows of the train ? Those people  --  those cars  --  that you see on the streets of Bennsville  --  they 're just dummies . Cardboard . They 've been put up there to deceive you . What really goes on in Bennsville  --  inside those houses  --  that 's what 's interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk like Shakespeare . Children , Minnie , that can beat Einstein . Fabulous things . p. 16 MINNIE Papa , I do n't mind , but you make Mama nervous when you talk like that . HAWKINS Behind those walls . But it is n't only behind those walls that strange things go on . Right on that train , right in those cars . The damndest things . Fred Cochran and Phil Forbes  --  MRS . HAWKINS Mr. Forbes was here to see you . HAWKINS Fred Cochran and Phil Forbes  --  we 've played cards together for twenty years . We 're so expert at hiding things from one another  --  we 're so cram-filled with things we ca n't say to one another that only a wreck could crack us open . MINNIE ( Indicating her mother , reproachfully ) : Papa ! MRS . HAWKINS Herbert Hawkins , why did you stand out in the dark there , looking at us through the window ? HAWKINS Well , I 'll tell you I got a lot of money today . But more than that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the dead . There was this old lady  --  I used to do her income tax for her  --  old lady . She 'd keep me on a while  --  God , how she wanted someone to talk to I 'd say anything that came into my head I want another drink . ( He goes into the kitchen . Again we hear him singing " Valencia . " ) p. 17 MINNIE ( Whispering ) : Eighteen thousand dollars ! MRS . HAWKINS We 've just got to let him talk himself out . MINNIE But Mama , why did he go and stand out on the lawn ? MRS . HAWKINS Shh ! ( Hawkins returns . ) HAWKINS I told her a lot of things . I told her  --  MINNIE I know ! You told her that everything looked as though it were seen through glass . HAWKINS Yes , I did . ( Pause ) You do n't hear the words , or if you hear the words , they do n't fit what you see . And one day she said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time : why do n't you do it ? " " Do what ? " I said . " Really stand outside and look through some windows . " ( Pause . ) I knew she meant my own Well , to tell the truth , I was afraid to . I preferred to talk about it . ( He paces back and forth . ) She died . Today some lawyer called me up and said she 's left me twenty thousand dollars . MRS . HAWKINS Herbert ! HAWKINS ( His eyes on the distance ) : " To Herbert Hawkins , in gratitude for many thoughtfulnesses and in appreciation of his sense of humor . " From beyond the grave It was an order . I took the four o'clock home It took me a whole hour to get up the courage to go and stand ( He points ) out there . p. 18 MINNIE But Papa , you did n't see anything ! Just us sewing ! ( Hawkins stares before him , then , changing his mood , says briskly : ) HAWKINS What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ! HAWKINS ( Pinching her ear ) : Buffalo steak ? MINNIE No . HAWKINS I had to live for a week once on rattlesnake stew . MINNIE Papa , you 're awful . MRS . HAWKINS ( Putting down her sewing ; in an even voice ) : Were you planning to go away , Herbert ? HAWKINS What ? MRS . HAWKINS ( For the first time , looking at him ) : You were thinking of going away . HAWKINS ( Looks into his glass a moment ) : Far away . ( Then again putting his face over her shoulder teasingly , but in a serious voice ) There is no " away . " There 's only " here . "  --  Get your hats , we 're going out to dinner .  --  I 've decided to move to " here . " To take up residence , as they say . I 'll move in tonight . I do n't bring much baggage .  --  Get your hats . p. 19 MRS . HAWKINS ( Rising ) : Herbert , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time .  --  Minnie , run upstairs and get my blue shawl . HAWKINS I 'll go and get one more drop out in the kitchen . MRS . HAWKINS Herbert , I do n't like your old lady . HAWKINS ( Turning at the door in surprise ) : Why , what 's the matter with her ? MRS . HAWKINS I can understand that she was in need of someone to talk to .  --  What business had she trying to make you look at Minnie and me through windows ? As though we were strangers . ( She crosses and puts her sewing on the telephone table . ) People who 've known one another as long as you and I have are not supposed to see one another . The pictures we have of one another are inside .  --  Herbert , last year one day I went to the city to have lunch with your sister . And as I was walking along the street , who do you think I saw coming toward me ? From quite a ways off ? You ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't see me . And you passed by without seeing me . I did n't want you to see me in those silly clothes we wear when we go to the city  --  and in that silly hat  --  with that silly look we put on our face when we 're in public places . The person that other people see . p. 20 HAWKINS ( With lowered eyes ) : You saw me  --  with that silly look . MRS . HAWKINS Oh , no . I did n't look long enough for that . I was too busy hiding myself .  --  I do n't know why Minnie 's so long trying to find my shawl . ( She goes out . The telephone rings . ) HAWKINS Yes , this is Herbert Hawkins .  --  Nat Fischer ? Oh , hello , Nat Oh ! All right . Sure , I see your point of view Eleven o'clock . Yes , I 'll be there . Eleven o'clock . ( He hangs up . Mrs. Hawkins returns wearing a shawl . ) MRS . HAWKINS Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me all right .  --  I might as well tell you now what it was about . ( He stares at the floor . ) MRS . HAWKINS Well ? HAWKINS A few minutes ago the police tried to arrest me for standing on my own lawn . Well , I got them over that . But they found a revolver on me  --  without a license . So I 've got to show up at court tomorrow , eleven o'clock . MRS . HAWKINS ( Short pause ; thoughtfully ) : Oh a revolver . p. 21 HAWKINS ( Looking at the floor ) : Yes I thought that maybe it was best that I go away a long way . MRS . HAWKINS ( Looking up with the beginning of a smile ) : To Bennsville ? HAWKINS Yes . MRS . HAWKINS Where life 's so exciting . ( Suddenly briskly )
