Recitals of chamber music are usually serious functions , attended by serious souls , with cultured dignity at heart . Generally there is only discreet applause ; high enthusiasm is taboo , also encores . <P> But such rules and precedents are not made for masters ; they are made by them , and may be broken by them at will . Last week Ignace Jan Paderewski appeared at Carnegie Hall , Manhattan , jointly with Efrem Zimbalist ( violinist ) , Felix Salmond ( ' cellist ) and Harold Bauer , " who turned the pages , " in a performance of Beethoven 's Trio in B-flat . <P> The audience rose , cheered , stamped , shouted , whistled , howled . They patiently endured intermediate numbers by Salmond and Zimbalist , only to burst forth again at the reappearance of the idol of two generations . Then the stage lights were lowered , just as Paddy first had them lowered in the same place early in the 90 's . Then-the Schubert-Liszt Hark , Hark , the Lark , the melting melody of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etudes , hurled like glittering lances , and a Scherzo that stung , bit and cooed seductively . Then encores-until the approach of the zero hour when gendarmes forcibly dispersed the immovably enraptured diehards . <P> Next morning , the coldly critical verdict of the press : <P> " As an ensemble player of chamber music in combination with other artists , Paderewski remains a great soloist . " <P> " It was a gracious act of self-effacement for Efrem Zimbalist and Felix Salmond to assist Mr. Paderewski in <P> rendering the trio . Evidently the <P> mighty Pole attached no higher importance than did Beethoven to the parts for violin and cello , for his Olympian thunders almost completely drowned out the none too insistent playing of Messrs . Salmond and Zimbalist "
