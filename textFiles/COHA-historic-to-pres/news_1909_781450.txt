Mrs. Warner was *married to Elmer E. Warner , an electrical engineer employed by the city , in HOU . She was then a writer of school textbooks . With the money she made , she purchased several plots of land in Clarkstown County , N. Y. , and in Kings County , on the latter Di which , she said , they had planned to build their hpme .

Gaynor 's Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Warner yestere day , " my husband brought two strangers to our home at Clarkstown , whom I later learned to be physicians connected with the insane , pavilion at Bellevue . They questioned me for barely fifteen minutes on various topics , and then went away . On the very next day , July 14 , 1904 , they issued a certificate declaring me , in their opinion , of unsound mind . On the strength of this certificate , strengthened by the petition of my husband , Justice William I. Gaynor issued a commitment for my confinement in the Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital for the Insane . It seems very strange now , " she added , " to hear this same Justice protesting against the arrest of ! arsons on suspicion , who could thus doom a woman to such a place without hearing her or any of her neighbors , but only the petitioner and his physicians . The first I knew of my fate was wheo I was bundled into a closed cab with two men and two nurses and driven to the asylum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the strength ' of a certificate from Dr. , Morris C. Ashley . Superintendent of the hospital , declaring her of absolutely sound maid , she was released , and on Jan. 19 , 1005 , Justice Gaynor acceded to her petition to nave the original order of commitment vacated . 1 During her confinement at the asylum , however , she alleges , ner husband had been able to dispose of her ' property- and she charges that he defrauded her of the greater part of it . Shortly after her release , on Feb. 0 , 1905 , her husband , according to Mrs. Warner , committed suicide in a New York hotel , leaving a brief note in which he assigned his despondency to land troubles . " " He was an honest man and of good family , " she said very calmly at her home on Washington Heights yesterday , " until this delusion took possession of him . Then , as is characteristic of the insane , he turned against those dearest to him and began to suspect them of insanity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Warner brought action in the Supreme Court of Rockland County against Drs . Packer and Wilgus , charging that they had made " ' a false , pretended , and grossly negligen , examination of the plantiff 's sanity , certi-fied her to be insane , and in need of restraint ; whereas , she never was and is not now insane : and that the defendants ' neglected ' to use reasonable and ordinary care to ascertain her true mental condition , and wilfully failed to make prudent inquiry , but based their opinions on the false statements of her husband . " She set forth also that her business as a writer of school textbooks had been ' ruined by her incarceration . At that very time , she said , a series of her books Were in press ; and these were destroyed .
