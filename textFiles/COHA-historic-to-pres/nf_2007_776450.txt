INTRODUCTION : Race // On a broiling hot day in June I was standing on line with one of my sons at the community pool , waiting to buy an ice cream and a drink . We were all sweating and impatient . But the line did not move . Why ? Crowded around the order window was a knot of young black males , all about eleven to thirteen years old . We , the rest of the mainly white parents and younger kids , were in a line . They , an ever-changing huddle of boys , were coming and going , arguing and laughing , dashing in and out to get money or change an order , but never moving on . I was mad  --  it was like being on the school lunch line and having kids cut in , over and over again . Suddenly the order taker accused one of the kids of taking a bill out of the tip jar . // Did he ? Yes , I was sure he stole the money . Teenage boys in a pack do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was guilty did not come because he was about the same age as I was when I grabbed a drink from a grocery store and strolled out . I felt angry at him right away . Hard as it is to admit , I believed he was guilty because he was black . // Prejudice . I am prejudiced . As in a nightmare , a boy I have never met suddenly looms as a monster . Everyone knows that it is wrong to be ruled by that kind of feeling . But that is useless in that flash of an instant when we see another person and form an opinion about him or her . It happens to all of us , all the time . // I wrote this book to help understand why I , why we , Americans of every background , experience race as such a powerful force , even as we dutifully state that it is just a difference of skin color and has no significance . Because I am a historian , not a biologist , this book is not about cells and DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astonishingly short history of the idea of race . // People have always noticed differences in skin color , hair , eye color , language , and religion . But the idea that human beings are members of three , or five , or fifteen biologically distinct races is extremely new . In fact , it was invented in the 1700s , precisely the same time period when Americans struggled their way toward independence . Not until the late thirteenth to sixteenth centuries did the English word " race " ( and its equivalent in some other European languages ) begin to take on its modern meaning . Before that it implied speed  --  as in a " horse race "  --  or lineage  --  as in a " race of kings . " // What exactly is race ? In this book I borrow a clear definition given to me by Margot Minardi , a thoughtful and generous scholar who is studying the development of ideas about race in the 1700s . " Race " is a way of explaining human difference and organizing people into categories . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " : // 1 ) Physical differences matter . The color of our skin , the curl of our hair , the size of our nose or lips  --  these are important . How we look is not just a personal matter ; it identifies us as part of a larger group . // 2 ) These differences in our bodies can not change . They are given to us at birth and remain fixed . // 3 ) That is because they are inherited . Our personal features are actually the characteristics of our group , which are passed down from one generation to the next . // 4 ) Each group has a distinct level of brain power and moral refinement , thus they are naturally and unchangeably ranked . Groups can be rated from more primitive to more advanced , more animal to more thoughtful , more savage to more civilized . // This whole book is devoted to tracing out how , in the Western world , these four ideas grew , developed , were linked together and came to be regarded as true . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that our ideas have changed over time . In fact , today " race " has become such a standard way of viewing people , we do n't even have to think about it . // We " know " that people are the same , under the skin . Yet we " know " that the best athletes are black . We " know " that , in America , the real , deep , terrible racial division is between black and white . And yet Japanese Americans were put into internment camps during World War II for being neither black nor white . Jews were forced to remain in Europe , to be gassed and fed into ovens , because of their " race . " Race is an uncomfortable reality , and yet the most brilliant scientists , doctors , and professors can not agree on whether there are any races // at all . // Perhaps a decade ago the whole question of race seemed settled . Beginning in the 1970s scientists announced that close studies of genetics proved that racial terms were meaningless . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation within , say , the group called " white " than between those labeled " white " and " black . " By the 1990s national magazines ran cover stories on how intermarriage and immigration were blurring the racial boundaries in American society . Hispanics , which the Census Bureau says " may be of any race , " replaced blacks as the largest minority in the country . We could all breathe a sigh of relief : Race was a dead old idea . And if we no longer believed in race , what possible justification could there be for racism ? // More recently , though , ever more sensitive genetic studies have found shared patterns in populations of peoples who married within their groups for generations . Shared patterns of what ? Some peoples have been shown to be susceptible to the same diseases . Some may have demonstrated similar levels of intelligence . Some may tend to share common physical features . How far is that from the old idea of race ? And to many black Americans , saying that racism is fading or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone can see , whether in images of blacks driven out of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the troubling statistics of the persistent " achievement gap " in our schools , that the deep racial divisions in America remain real , and present . Even as I write these words , racial thinking looms behind the latest headlines , whether they are debates over legal and illegal immigration or analyses of wars that seem to pit Muslims against Christians and Jews . // I believe race is our modern way of handling emotions that go back to the very beginning of human evolution . That is one reason why race is so hard for us to deal with . In one way , race seems as current as science ; in another it taps our oldest fears . Yet if I were sitting with a group of college professors and said that out loud , I 'd soon be in the midst of a raging argument . Here 's why : // I see the past somewhat in the way it plays out in Civilization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies to more complex and modern ones . I also share a view that you might most often hear in songs or poems : the idea that the human mind is a battlefield in which our better natures constantly struggle with our darker , more destructive impulses . Both of those views were once common , and are now questioned by fine scholars . Many anthropologists , for example , reject the whole idea of " primitive " groups , and view the most destructive effects of prejudice and hatred of strangers as the products of modern societies . They believe that if we change our society , we can change ourselves . I am more inclined to believe that if we recognize the destructive urges in ourselves , we have a chance to improve the world around us . This book , then , follows the track that made sense to me . I am tracing out a story , one possible pathway through thousands of years of history . Where I am going against strong counterviews , I will let you know in the main text , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . // I say " race , " but I mean racism or racial prejudice . Even though the idea of race is a recent invention , fear and hatred of those who strike us as different is extremely ancient . That bears repetition : " Racial prejudice " and " hatred of difference " are not the same . For the great majority of human history we have taken slaves , slaughtered enemies , looked down on those who are different , without believing our victims were of different " races . " Instead , we despised others as savages or barbarians ; as weaklings or strangers ; as pagans , Muslims , or Jews , Protestants or Catholics . I think that our deep feelings about race are the latest version of a mind-set that begins in infants and probably took shape at the very beginning of human evolution . // But why ? Why should fear and hatred of others have such a deep hold on all of us that we have reinvented it in new forms , over and over and over again throughout history ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I soon realized that I could not jump right into the story in the 1700s . I needed to know something about the older , deeper drive in all of us  --  the urge to hate those who are different . // Historians are like engineers  --  we like figuring out the connections , the links , that bridge from one era to another . But in order to understand race and racism , I knew I would have to go beyond any known history . Only by following this journey back into the minds of babies and the languages of a people who live by hunting and gathering , and then out through the stages of Western civilization , could I finally understand why , when race was invented , it answered so many needs and seemed to make so much sense . So this voyage through thousands of years of history begins in New York City , today . // Where Do Prejudices Come From ? // The Mind // One of the world 's best authorities on how prejudice forms in our minds is a bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elisabeth Young-Bruehl is a psychologist who treats patients in the East Village , a section of lower Manhattan where Europeans wearing Prada share a sidewalk with the homeless . In the East Village you can never predict who will sashay by , or the age , color , or gender of his or her companion . Whatever biases people have inside , they are eager to display their tattoos , piercings , and hairstyles as well as their open-mindedness . This is a good setting for Dr. Young-Bruehl . She has straight , short , graying hair , dresses modestly in comfortable clothes , and has the reassuring aspect of a person who has seen and heard everything . No story from these streets would surprise her . But she has the sharp mind and weighty judgment of a scholar who has read thousands of studies and hundreds of books on prejudice . // Dr. Young-Bruehl believes that it makes no sense to speak of prejudice in general  --  as if it were a form of bad weather . She sees each kind of prejudice as its own story . Racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of mental disease . Of course , a racist may also dislike Jews or be cruel to women . But if , like Dr. Young-Bruehl , you really listen to each form of prejudice , you find that they do n't sound the same . // Very often people who dislike Jews want to eliminate them entirely  --  as Adolf Hitler tried so hard to do . Jews are described as germs , as infections to be destroyed before they sicken everyone else . Those who feel superior to Africans generally have a different goal . They want blacks to stay alive , but as slaves or mistresses , in an inferior role . Blacks are spoken of as animalistic , as subhumans to be controlled and used . And even the most crazed male knows women are necessary : Without mothers we would n't have children . So those most threatened by women insist that females be silent , invisible , and exactly echo the views of men . Eliminate Jews , dominate blacks , silence women  --  three versions of prejudice . // These hate-filled views do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped in childhood , or even infancy . Dr. Young-Bruehl recounts the story of one white American born in the segregated South in the 1920s . As an adult he was having problems in his personal life , and so for a time he talked about himself with a psychologist . A revealing story emerged . // The boy grew up in a home with a cold , distant mother and a frightening father whom he hated . The one sweet presence in his life was the black woman who cared for him . But it was too terrifying to the boy to be so alone in his family , and // so drawn to his nanny . Instead , in his dreams and fantasies he shifted things around . He imagined that black men , such as his nanny 's husband , were everything that he hated in his father . He pictured those men attacking him or his mother . In his mind the world was divided into dangerous , criminal black men and vulnerable white people . The boy 's real problem was with his parents , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invented an enemy he could fight : the black male criminal . // This is a true story , about a man who went on to devote his life to severely punishing blacks and preventing racial integration . He kept seeing the black men from his nightmares all around him . He could feel them nearby , about to rape his mother or to assault him . He felt the threat like heat shimmering off of a sidewalk . Throughout his life he remained on guard , to keep them at bay . // A frightened son turned his cold mother and severe father into hateful images of black men . That was his personal drama . Yet the fantasy of the dangerous black male is extremely powerful . I shared it at the pool . And , as we will see in chapter , a boy whose childhood has some similarity to the segregationist I just described wrote a play that spread negative images of black men throughout America . If racial prejudice is born in the family circle , it is nurtured in the surrounding society . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made use of anthropology . // Where Do Prejudices come From ? // The Tribe // Readers , here is a big divide . What I sketch out on the next few pages runs directly against the views of many anthropologists who carefully study the kinds of groups I describe . These scholars insist that peoples living in small groups , who hunt for food , are not filled with fear and hatred but instead take pains to make connections to others . For example , many make sure to marry outsiders , or have well-established ways of trading to get the food they need . I have a great deal to learn about modern anthropology . And yet even the quickest search shows that , for example , there is great debate on what " marrying outsiders " means . Many groups have a custom of a man capturing a woman he likes from another group . Is that similar to kidnapping or rape ? Or is it a kind of ritual all have agreed to in advance ? Anthropologists are not in agreement . I invite readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take these debates as an invitation  --  precisely because experts are in conflict , your fresh insights may be all the more valuable . // According to one group of thinkers , called evolutionary psychologists , this is how fearing and hating others began , in the earliest days of human evolution : // Picture a clan of human beings a hundred thousand years ago somewhere in Africa . As they move along each day searching for water , for food , their senses must always be on the alert . The leaves rustle : Is it wind , an animal , or an enemy ? In order to survive , each person must make an instant , accurate judgment : friend or foe . There is no time to think ; a second 's hesitation may cost you your life . What we now call prejudice was once a strategy for survival . We can see this even today , deep in the heart of the Amazon rain forest , home of the Munduruku. // The words of the Munduruku speak to us from those ancient times when terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . A native group that lives along the Tapaj ? s River in Brazil , the Munduruku have adjusted to contact with Europeans . But their language recalls their earlier life , when men took the heads of their enemies as prizes , for it splits the world into two parts . They have one word for themselves , the Munduruku , the human beings . Everyone else is pariwat . Pariwat means " strangers , " but also " enemy , " " those who are unlike us . " Pariwat are not human and , in fact , are most similar to the animals the Munduruku hunt for food . // This is prejudice in perfect form : We are human and you are not . Glittering eyes watching you pass through the jungle do not see you as a fellow human being but as game . This is the language of the earliest tribes , our most remote ancestors . // For an individual , hating others often begins with childhood fears . But for human beings in general , it may have taken root at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hatred of strangers so strongly because , at one time , it was the line between life and death . // But human beings did not remain in the forest forever . Once we began to tame the Earth and to live in cities , we left written records . And so to understand the new shape of prejudices in the earliest days of human civilization , I turned to history and literature . // Where Do Prejudices Come From ? // City Walls // Imagine the moment when the entire population of the world could be divided into two groups : the fortunate few who lived in cities , and all of the rest , scrambling to survive in the surrounding hills , wastes , and wildernesses . Andrew Sinclair wrote a book on the history of the idea of the " savage . " He believes that one of the most ancient of stories describes the moment when a great city was at its height , and the new form of prejudice it inspired . Sinclair thinks the Epic of Gilgamesh recounts the clash of savage and civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to visit the entire Earth , from pole to pole , he would have found just one great city : Uruk in Sumer . It is not just that other cities were smaller . Only a few other cities existed at all . Cities were as new as today 's most high-tech devices  --  some people had heard of them , but few had actually seen them . Except for the lucky citizens of Uruk . The reputation of Uruk lives to this day : The modern nation of Iraq is named after this ancient city that was once the center of civilization . // It is easy to understand why Uruk became the greatest city in the world . Once the people of Uruk figured out how to build irrigation ditches from the Euphrates River , they turned the nearby land into lush fields of grain . This land was so fertile that the harvests of the ancient Sumerians rivaled those of modern farmers . Year after year of fabulous crops allowed people to stop worrying about how to find food . Uruk flourished  --  by 2700 b.c. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A city in which well-fed people could gather together produced an explosion of marvelous inventions . Craftsmen made objects that merchants traded far and wide . Potters learned to shape one vessel after another on a wheel in a kind of ancient factory . Then someone had the brilliant idea to take the wheel off , set it on the ground , and use it to help move things . Scribes even learned to capture the words that disappear from our lips . First they made slits in wet clay to count animals and record trades for merchants . Then they invented written language . If any place in the world could claim to be the home of the arts of civilization , it was Uruk. // The citizens of Uruk knew that other people were not pariwat . A large city of farmers and potters , priests and traders , could not divide the world with the same frightening clarity as the head-hunting Munduruku of the rain forest . The scribes of Uruk recorded something new : prejudice with a reason . That is what we can see , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king named Gilgamesh built walls to encircle Uruk , his magnificent city . On their clay tablets the wise men of Uruk recorded the deeds of their king . The Epic of Gilgamesh , as it is called , is one of the very oldest stories ever written down , and yet you can see its traces in the most recent fantasy quest . // The story tells us that Gilgamesh was a difficult , even terrifying , ruler . No one was safe from him . The people of Uruk pleaded with the gods to find a way to tame him , to challenge him . Their prayers were answered , for one of the gods created the perfect rival for Gilgamesh . This was Enkidu . Enkidu was a kind of wild man . His body was covered with hair that was never cut , so that it was as long as a woman 's . He wore no clothes , and lived in the wilderness . He : // Ate grass with gazelles , and when he was thirsty // He drank clear water from the waterholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The perfect enemy of the arrogant ruler of the world 's largest city is the savage man of the woods who eats and drinks like a four-legged creature . Enkidu destroys animal traps and frees animals  --  he is closer to them than to human beings . // The two men are exact opposites : Gilgamesh of grand Uruk , where people dress in elegant clothes and every day there is a festival ; Enkidu of the wild , who does not even know how to eat bread . Though they are well matched physically , Gilgamesh outwits Enkidu by introducing him to a sensual woman who seduces and then weakens him . Enkidu is " the strongest man in the world , with muscles like rock . " But Gilgamesh knows his weakness , and Enkidu falls for the trap . // It is not hard to read this tale as showing that those who filled the streets of the bustling city believed they were " better " than those who still lived like animals in the wild . Unlike the Munduruku the citizens of Uruk were not acting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a rational judgment : We are smart , while those who live outside of the walls are dumb , slow , destined to serve us . How could the people of Uruk have felt any other way ? If you invented things as magnificent as writing , bread , pottery , and the wheel , why would n't you assume you were superior to people who ran around naked and lapped up water next to the antelope ? This is prejudice with a reason , prejudice confirmed by observation . It hints at the concept of ranking , which would be so important in the idea of race . // And yet there is something strange and interesting in this ancient epic . After their first battle Enkidu becomes Gilgamesh 's closest friend , his best companion . Gilgamesh easily defeats Enkidu , but he also needs him . The proud king needs his savage brother . A master always needs a slave to confirm that he is a master , just as a bully feels strong only because he has weaker kids to intimidate . This strange bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on having inferiors beneath them , runs through all of human history . // A baby screams , terrified that the dark men in his dreams will attack him . In the rain forest , warriors see only their group as human . The people of Uruk glory in their superiority to savages and show their wisdom in recognizing that they also need their defeated neighbors . From birth to the formation of jungle tribes to the glory days of the first great cities , human beings have carried sharp swords in their minds , splitting the world into me and you , us and them , advanced and primitive . As we grow more civilized , we also find new ways to be ever more cruel and harsh . // The next section of this book follows this dual pattern through eras in which the most basic , most central , ideas of Western civilization were invented . That is a daunting task . In writing this section , I continually felt like a guest visiting a magnificent museum . But the road from Uruk to " race " passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . // Chapter 1 // Slaves , Hebrews , God // When Gita , a girl , turned thirteen , her father took her to the only store in their tiny Himalayan village  --  and sold her . He received a few hundred rupees for his daughter  --  enough perhaps to feed the family for a year . In exchange , Gita would travel to the distant city to work as a maid . After she had worked off what was paid for her , she was told , she would be free to return . But after the six-day journey from her home , Gita realized that her father had unwittingly traded his daughter to a trafficker  --  a prostitute too sick to continue working ; Gita would be her replacement . Gita 's life had been traded for hers . // Gita was locked in a brothel in Calcutta ; beaten , starved , and drugged when she refused to have sex with customers . She was not allowed to use a condom or to communicate with the other girls there . And the brothel owner charged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes  --  even for the abortion she had to have to continue working  --  that Gita could never repay her debt . // When I met Gita in 2003 , she was living in a shelter with other girls who had been rescued from the brothels of India or who have been thrown out on the streets when they become ill . She is one of an estimated eight hundred thousand girls and women who are sold into sexual slavery every year . Millions more , boys and girls , are sold into domestic servitude each year , millions of others are consigned to sweatshops and factories around the world . None of these children ever see a penny from their labors . They are modern-day slaves . //  --  Patricia McCormick , author of Sold // Slavery exists today , and slavery is as old as human civilization . // The very first step in uncovering the history of race and racism is the hardest . For it involves overturning what you think you know . Today in America using the word " slave " means African slavery , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume slavery is necessarily built on racism . In turn we often say that racism played such a powerful role in history because of slavery . But both of those ideas are completely misleading . // long before Columbus sailed or the idea of " race " was invented , Africans enslaved Africans , Asians enslaved Asians , and Europeans enslaved other Europeans . As late as the end of the eighteenth century , the time of the American Revolution , two thirds of all of the people on this planet performed some form of forced labor . Slavery flourished for thousands of years without any theory of race . // But is all slavery the same ? Here we enter another of those big debates . Take the matter of slavery in Africa before the Europeans arrived . In parts of West Africa , slaves grew up with the families of their owners . Indeed , the children of slaves were often freed . Some scholars believe that only when the slave ships came calling did this mild , temporary form of slavery transform into the brutal system of bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , I am making a simpler point here : You do n't need an idea of race in order to enslave people . Indeed , enslaving people you defeat in battle has been a common practice on every continent throughout most of human history . // Slavery did come to be linked with race , but that was a very recent development . That insight is the key to this whole book , for it allows you to look at slavery and race by themselves , and then trace out their connections . Doing that is like " getting " the crucial clue in a mystery , or figuring out how to create a glowing new liquid in your test tube . Suddenly , you can see the world in new ways . In fact , when scholars have looked closely at the history of slavery , they have come to the most unexpected conclusion : Slavery has been the source of some of the most humane , liberating ideas in all of human history . // A slave is a person robbed of his humanity , turned intoan object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it , it is also a nightmare for his master . The slave master lives in a world of zombies , of humanlike beings who are no longer human . He is filled with fear . Even the pleasure he enjoys inhis freedom to abuse his property is a hellish , sadistic satisfaction . In a slave-filled world , how certain can a master be that he will not lose a battle and be enslaved himself ? // In Philip K. Dick 's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ( which was made into the film Blade Runner ) , human beings invent perfect androids to labor for them but get scared when the " replicants " begin to filter into society . To keep humanity " pure , " they set out to kill the artificial creatures who have become too human . Who then is the soulless monster , the human or the android ? This is precisely the slaveholder 's problem . If his property is human , it is not property . So he must convince himself that the living beings he owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like himself  --  are not like him at all . But if he succeeds in not caring for them , how human is he ? // According to Orlando Patterson , one of the most insightful modern scholars , this is such a deep and powerful dilemma that it inspired slave masters , whether in ancient Athens or in the days of the American Founding Fathers , to become the great defenders of freedom . Owning slaves forced them to recognize how precious a thing is freedom . // Sadly , when we live calm , quiet lives , we rarely feel the need to question our beliefs . Only the most horrible experiences challenge us to think in new ways . Slavery is one of those tragedies that inspired brilliant ideas , in two different ways . // Every day , a slavery owner sees workers who look human yet are treated as animals or machines . For a thoughtful person , like Thomas Jefferson , this is such a violation that it makes him look deeply at his own life . Seeing the misery of a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // he is himself . He realizes he must do everything he can to guard his freedom ; he must create a government of the free with no kings or nobles above him . He assumes that slavery itself will never go away  --  it exists everywhere and always has . But seeing slavery gives him the absolute conviction that he must be free himself . In effect he says , " I can never let that happen to me , so I must create a government that ensures my own freedom . " // Thomas Jefferson looked out of his window at people he owned and wrote the most eloquent declaration of liberty and equality . That is one important way in which slavery inspired slave owners to become advocates of freedom . But the really // astonishing contribution slavery made to Western civilization may have come through the thoughts and beliefs of slaves . If the Bible is to be believed , out of the terrible condition of slavery came one of the most liberating , most crucial ideas in all of Western history : monotheism . One god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral behavior everyone must follow . This is the belief that the Bible says the Hebrews forged in slavery and brought to the world . // The idea of one god is now so familiar , it is hard to capture how startling it once was . In the 00s b.c. pharaoh Akhenaton tried to replace the many Egyptian gods with just one . But as soon as he died , Egyptians returned to their older beliefs and did their best to erase him from their histories . His story illustrates how resistant people were to giving up the gods they knew and loved . Whether his ideas influenced the Hebrews is impossible to say . // The new idea of one god meant that you could no longer pray to the god of the spring for good crops , to the god of love for a mate , to your family god to protect a mother in childbirth . For the first time in human history , God was not an ally to be bought off with sacrifices and rituals . There was just one god for all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // This is one of the two most basic ideas in Western civilization , and the Bible tells us that it was directly linked to slavery . // The origin of the Hebrews as a distinct people dates back to the age of the great cities of Sumer . The Bible says that Abraham was the leader of a clan of wandering herdsmen who preferred not to settle down and join city life . He smashed the idols of the many gods others worshipped and devoted himself to the one god of his tribe . Still , there were other clans and tribes that worshipped their own special gods . According to the Bible , the great step forward in Jewish thought came approximately one thousand years after Abraham . Around the year 1220 b.c. the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt . // Generations of scholars have pored over Egyptian hieroglyphs and sifted through archaeological remains to learn more about the Hebrews in this period .

Uruk and the other great cities of Sumer were no longer at the forefront of Western civilization . Stretching along the fertile lands of the Nile , the kingdoms of Egypt now held that honor . The book of Exodus tells us that the enslaved Jews struggled simply to retain their dignity and pride . And it was worse than that .

Inspired by this fearless prophet , the slaves defied their masters , rose up , and followed Moses out of Egypt . He led them forward across a sea of reeds , into the forbidding desert , on toward " a land flowing with milk and honey .

But only so long as God permits it . A slave who deals justly with his fellow man taps into a power infinitely greater than the whip . // Ever since then , anyone who was in pain , who was abused and mistreated , could look back to that story and see hope in it . Slaves in the American South would sing : // When Israel was in Egypt land , // Let my people go , // Oppressed so hard they could not stand , // Let my people go . // Go down , Moses , // Way down in Egypt land , // Tell ol ' Pharaoh , // Let my people go . // Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same story to speak up for the rights of the oppressed ( see page 243 for one famous example from American history ) .

It can be explained in a single sentence : " What is hateful to you , do not to your fellow man . This is the // law : All the rest is commentary . " // This is the Christian Golden Rule , and is echoed in hadith , or sayings and stories , attributed to Muhammad , as well as in other faiths of all descriptions around the world . Here is the way past fear and hatred : You do not divide the world into us and them . You do not kill strangers . You treat all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudices of the dark forests , the proud walls of Uruk , the grand temples of Egypt . // How then could we , today , still be so afflicted with prejudice , and so bedeviled with the problem of race ? // This is how the Golden Rule could turn into the bloody sword : The Hebrews saw themselves as chosen , selected by God to live by his laws . He would punish them if they failed , reward them for being faithful and obedient . The Book of Isaiah spells this out most clearly . God has selected the Jews to be " a light unto nations , to open eyes deprived of light . " Yes , other peoples could obey God 's laws as well . The blind could be led to see . But Jews were not concerned with them . The Jews were like students selected for an advanced class : It was going to be very hard , they were sure to fail at times , but they had the opportunity to get it right . // What could possibly be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such high standards ? For one thing , it was easy for others to resent the Hebrews , to see them as stubborn and arrogant . This was especially true because theHebrews made little or no effort to win converts . They were concerned about their own relationship to God , not anyone else 's . The surrounding majority might well be tempted to crush a small , proud minority that kept its distance andclaimed it was special to God . But there was also a danger within Judaism , which would have its most poisonous effects with the growth of Christianity and Islam . For if there is but one God and one Chosen People , it is easy to adopt an even more dangerous form of the mind-set of the Munduruku . For now the world can be divided into God 's people and his enemies . // Hebrews , who had been held as slaves , developed the brilliant new idea of a single god , and with it the ethical idea that all human beings are equal under him .

But the belief in one god also laid open the road to thousands of years of new prejudice , war , and enslavement based on God 's will . // We have reached a crossroads , a tragedy that I believe stands at the dead center of human history . Doing the research for this book showed me that whenever human beings have taken a stride forward away from hatred , we have found waysto build new barriers . Opening our doors , opening our hearts seems to inspire a profound terror in us . So much so that each time we ease one prejudice , we rush to reinforce another . As I see it , the tribe thinks only it is human . The great city accepts that others are human , but believes only it is civilized . The Jews invent one god , one law , for all humanity , but define themselves as special to God . // Scholars who disagree with me see almost the opposite picture . They believe human beings are basically good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for specific reasons . When you study the terrible ways we human beings have treated one another , you can not help thinking about big questions : Who are we as human beings ? What drives us ? How can we ever change ? These issues are so important , so deep , I knew I needed to present my own conclusions , even though they are sure to be controversial . Readers , I am not asking you to agree with me , but to think with me . We need to face this history , and use it to learn about ourselves . // Trust in reason , in logic , is the only other strand in the history of Western civilization that was as influential as monotheism . We owe that to the Greeks . The Greeks completely rejectedthe idea of a single god . In fact , you could say that no matter how many gods they had , the Greeks really worshipped mankind . Out of their close observation of human differences the Greeks added another step toward the idea of race . // Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History . // Racism  --  History . //
