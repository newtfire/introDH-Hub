French politics may be subject to ups and downs , but French production is going in one direction-up . In May the official index for industrial production climbed to an alltime high of 158 ( on a scale in which 1938 production is 100 ) . Automobile output in April rose 33% , textiles 11% , chemicals 20% , electricity 15% over the same month in 1953 . Altogether France 's total industrial output is nearly 8.2% higher than a year ago . The difficulty is that higher production has yet to reflect itself in substantially lower prices or higher wages for the average Frenchman .
