On a moonlit street in the heel of Italy a British soldier uttered a cry of pain , fell with a stab wound in his back . Angry Tommies beat through the dark village , could not find the assailant . Next day a gang of Italian youths pummeled a tipsy British soldier . Again Tommies rushed to the rescue . Shots rang out , hit some bystanders , dispersed a defiant mob . <P> This vignette of violence had a moral : it happened in a town where a Fascist still held office . Here , as in most of the liberated land turned over to King Vittorio Emanuele and Premier Pietro Badoglio , things were not going well . As U.S. officers had testified ( TIME , April 24 ) , Allied prestige had fallen low . <P> Paragon 's Job . But there was hope . Old Marshal Pietro Badoglio belatedly consulted southern Italy 's six anti-Fascist parties , gave them seven of 13 cabinet portfolios in a broadened government . The cleanup of known Fascists , at first very slow , had been speeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The AMG in Italy , largely staffed by British and U.S. businessmen with no nose for Fascists , had been absorbed by the better-run Allied Control Commission under British Lieut . General Mason-Macfarlane . In particular , an Italian-American from New York had brought to bear a great deal of political savvy , a great ability to personify democracy to Italians who had never seen it in action . This paragon is Lieut . Colonel Charles Poletti , ex-Governor and Lieutenant Governor of New York , Regional Commissioner for Naples , Salerno , Benevento and Avellino . <P> Colonel Poletti took hold last February . He began by renovating his four-story , red-painted , Renaissance prefettura near the Naples waterfront . He had bomb debris cleaned up , plumbing repaired , elbow grease applied to slick up the place . Explained one of his subordinates : " You ca n't sell democracy in an outhouse . " <P> Then Lieut . Colonel Poletti began selling democracy to Italians . He saw all callers . In wrinkled uniform , slouched behind a huge desk , he listened to complaints , cracked jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pep talk reminding Italians of their responsibilities and opportunities . Visitors were flattered by hearing their own language , by the deft touch . <P> It did not take long for Lieut . Colonel Poletti to put war-shocked Naples on the way toward recovery . Now the city gets regular street washings . Over the radio the Regional Commissioner appeals to Italian patriotism to help stamp out black markets . He has granted labor unions collective bargaining , encouraged a manufacturers ' association . In Naples he has installed veteran anti-Fascist administrators . In the suburbs , too , he has restored democratic forms of government , helped industrialists , workers and peasants get representation on local councils , prodded the average Italian into talking over public problems in public meetings . <P> For his fellow administrators , he has done another service . Reasoning that many of them literally did not know how to define or detect a Fascist , he spelled out a complete but simple list of definitions . General Mason-Macfarlane liked the Poletti list so much that he made it a standard guide in all of Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
