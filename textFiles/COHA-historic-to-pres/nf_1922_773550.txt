the stations is often a feeble alternating current having a frequency from perhaps 100 cycles per second to 3,000 cycles per second , considerably higher than the frequencies used for commercial lighting purposes . ( See Sec. 50 . ) These frequencies , in fact , correspond to the frequencies of the sound waves impressed upon the transmitter diaphragm . Thus the note " middle C , " which corresponds to a sound wave having 256 vibrations per second , causes an alternating current having a frequency of 256 cycles per second . It should be noted , however , that the wave forms produced by speech or by musical sounds are by no means as simple as the sine wave shown in Fig. 71 . In the case of some kinds of telephone systems the wires may transmit a pulsating direct current of several tenths of an ampere , whose pulsations correspond to the impressed sound waves . The electrical transmission of speech is more fully described in connection with radiotelephony . ( See Sees . 206-212 . ) Speech transmitted by telephone instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both electrical and mechanical , of the telephone equipment used produce distortions during the transmission of the sound . In the early days of telephony , when the causes of distortion were not well understood , serious effects of this kind occurred when talking over very short distances . At the present time it is possible to talk from New York to San Francisco by wire . This result has been attained only after years of experience and investigation and the development of instruments involving principles only recently discovered . Successful transmission over such long distances requires ninny refinements in the design of every device used . It is possible at the same time to transmit both telegraph and telephone messages over the same line ; such a line is often called a " composite " line . With the currents used in ordinary telephony , it is possible at the same time to transmit three telephone messages over two pairs of wires by adding at each end a " phantom " circuit , which is an additional circuit balanced across the two main circuits through suitable impedances . For information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next paragraph . The operation of a telephone system so that // one pair of wires carries more than one message is called " multiplex telephony . " Besides the use of the phantom circuit , multiplex telephony can be attained by the use of alternating currents of the high frequencies used in radio communication . ( See Sec. 212 . ) For further information regarding wire telephony , the reader may consult G. D. Shepardson , " Telephone Apparatus " ; K. B. Miller , " American Telephone Practice " ; or H. R. Vandeventer , " Telephonology . " In a book by David P. Moreton , " Drake 's Telephone Handbook , " may be found an elementary exposition of the principles of telephone apparatus , and detailed information regarding practical methods of construction and operation of various kinds of telephone systems , which may be of particular interest to tl e beginner . Circular 112 of the Bureau of Standards , " Telephone Service " ( 1921 ) , gives detailed information regarding the operation of various kinds of telephone systems , and will be found valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Generators and Motors. ? In the preceding chapter some laws of electric and magnetic circuits are discussed , and attention is directed to the relations between electric currents and magnetic fields . In the present chapter certain practical applications will be described , in which use is made of all those laws , but which are based particularly on three experimental facts , namely , that1 . When a conductor is moved across a magnetic field , an emf. is induced in the conductor . 2 . When a current flows in a conductor in a magnetic field , a cross-push is exerted on the conductor . 3 . When a current is sent around an iron core , the core is magnetized . The forces involved are not necessarily small , as is sometimes imagined , but may run into hundreds or even thousands of kilograms . Such forces can be used for power applications on a large scale , by means of machinery , called " dynamoelectric " or , for short , " electrical " machinery . Electric machines are used for conversion of power from mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some sort of prime mover like a steam engine , gas engine , or water wheel , they convert mechanical power into electrical power and are called " generators . " If supplied with current and used to drive machinery , vehicles , or other devices , thus converting electrical power into mechanical power , they are called " motors . " While there are various types of motors and various types of generators , the difference is more in the use than in the construction or appearance ; in fact , the difference between most motors and the corresponding kinds of generators is so slight that the same machine can be used for both purposes with no changes , or only minor ones . Electric machines may be built for either direct or alternating current . 152 // A. The Alternator. 62 . Production of Emf. by Revolving Field. ? It was pointed out in Chapter 1 , Section 45 , that the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field causes an electromotive force in the conductor . This is true whether it is the conductor or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there shall be relative motion of one with respect to the other . One way in which such relative motion may be secured is illustrated by Fig. 94 . Suppose the magnet NS is made to rotate continuously in a vertical plane about the axis mn . The loop of wire ab is stationary . Its ends are connected to some external part of the circuit X. As the field from the N pole sweeps across a , an electromotive force is induced in it to the right and at the same time an electromotive force is induced to the left in b by the passing of the S pole . Thus the emf. produced tends to send a current in a clockwise direction around the loop ab , as indicated by the arrows . When the magnet has made half a revolution the poles have exchanged places with respect to a and b and the electromotive forces are counter-clockwise around ab . As the magnet continues to be rotated , there are thus two pulses of electromotive force ( and of current if the circuit is closed ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device described constitutes a simple " alternating-current generator " or " alternator. " 1 63 . Direction of Emf. ? The direction of the electromotive force induced in a straight conductor moving across a magnetic field can be determined by the " right-hand rule . " This rule as generally stated assumes that the magnetic field is stationary and that the conductor moves across the magnetic field . Using the right hand , the thumb , the first finger , and the second finger are so placed that each is at right angles with the other two , the first finger being extended directly out . Then if the thumb Is pointing in the direction of motion , and the first finger is pointing in the direction of the magnetic lines of force ( from north pole to south pole ) , then the second finger will point in the direction of the induced emf ; that is , in the direction in which the induced current will flow . // If the magnetic field is moving , and the conductor stationary , the rule is readily applied by recalling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 94 the effect of having the north pole move toward the reader , passing the conductor a , is the same as if the conductor were to move away from the reader , passing pole N. A similar left-hand rule can be used for determining the direction in which a straight conductor carrying a current will move if placed across a magnetic field . Using the left hand , the // thumb , the first finger , and the second finger are so placed that each is at right angles to the other two , the first finger being extended directly out . Then if the first finger is pointing in the direction of the magnetic lines of force and the second finger is pointing in the direction in which the current is flowing , the thumb will point in the direction in which the conductor will move . The reader may compare these rules with the rule for the direction of the magnetic field about a straight conductor carrying a current , as stated in Section 4 , page 30 , and with the rule for the polarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emf . Curve. ? If the electromotive force is called positive when to the right in a , and negative when to the left , the changes in it may be shown by a curve like Fig. 95 . Successive moments of time are taken along the horizontal axis , and the corresponding electromotive forces are shown by the height of the vertical ordinates . When the north pole is in position 1 , Fig. 94 , no emf. is induced . This is shown by the point marked 1 , Fig. 95 . A short time afterward , in position 2 , Fig. 94 , a certain maximum emf. is induced , shown by point 2 on the curve . When the pole has moved to position 3 the electromotive force has decreased to zero , and in position 4 it has reached a negative maximum . It then decreases again to zero and the whole series is repeated . A curve like the one in Fig. 95 is often called an electromotive force curve or wave . The emf. curves generated by commercial alternators have a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sine curves , and for reasons given in Chapter 1 are usually t muted as such . 65 . Cycle , Period , Frequency. ? A regularly recurring series of values of electromotive force , from any point in the series to the corresponding point in the next series , is called a " cycle . " The portion of the curve in Fig. 95 from 3 to 7 represents a cycle ; similarly , the portion from 2 to 6 . The time required for one cycle is the " period . " The number of cycles per second is called the " frequency . " In American commercial practice , 60 and 25 cycles per second in the most common frequencies for alternating current circuits . The corresponding periods are To and of a second . // Other frequencies , for example , 50 cycles , are used in Europe . For certain purposes in radio telegraphy , 500-cycle generators are used . Quite recently , special machines have been developed for generating frequencies as high as 100,000 cycles per second , to be applied directly to the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3,000 meters : 66 . Multipolar Magnets. ? To produce a frequency of 60 cycles per second by the use of a single magnet with two poles requires a speed of rotation of 60 revolutions per second . Such a speed is not practicable for large machines . To get 500 cycles would require 500 r. p. s. , or 30,000 r. p. m. ( revolutions per minute ) . By arranging a number of similar north and south poles alternately , as in Fig. 96 , and providing corresponding conductors , a lower speed of rotation may be used . As in Fig. 94 , the magnet is supposed to be made to rotate , while the conductors a , b , c , d , e , f remain stationary . When the upper north pole is coining toward the reader , electromotive forces will be induced in the several conductors in the direction of the arrows . The conductors are all connected in series , except between f and a , where connection is made to an external part of the circuit , X. All are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their electromotive forces are equal , and in the case shown , the total is six times as great as the electromotive force in any one conductor . For every revolution of the magnet , each conductor is passed three times by an N and three times by an S pole . Each pair of poles gives rise to a cycle , so for each revolution there are three cycles of enif. in the conductors . Thus , for a given speed , the frequency is three times as high as it would be if there were but one pair of poles . 67 . Field and Armature. ? The magnets ( NS , in Fig. 96 , p. 116 ) which produce the magnetic field of an alternator are called the " field magnets . " If there is but one north and one south pole , the machine is said to be " bipolar " ; if there are several pairs of poles the machine is " multipolar . " The conductors in which the electromotive forces are induced constitute the " armature winding . " The winding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated , on an iron or Wave length is explained in Sec. 125 . High-frequency alternators are described in Secs . 95 and 173. // steel core called the " armature core . " Winding and core together constitute the " armature , " though this term is also used , loosely , when the armature winding alone is meant . 68 . Coil-Wound Armature. ? The electromotive force developed in one conductor of an ordinary generator is only a volt or two , not enough for practical use . Armature windings , herefore , consist of a large number of conductors , usually combined into coils ( see Fig. 97 ) of several turns each , which are pushed into slots in the face of the armature core and then connected by soldering . The joints have to be carefully covered with tape or other insulating material . // The coils are made of copper wire covered with insulation ( usually cotton ) wound to the proper shape on a form , wrapped with tape , and finally covered or impregnated with an insulating compound . The core slots are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After being placed on the core , the coils are held by wedges of fiber or wood driven into the tops of the slots . The core is built up of thin , fiat sheets of soft iron or steel , ring-shaped , with teeth on the inner edge ! See Fig. 9S . Enough sheets are stacked up to make a cylinder of the length desired . Occasionally a separator is included to provide air ducts through the core for ventilation . The three dark rings around the core in Fig. 97 show where the ducts are . The teeth are carefully lined up , and the spaces between them become the troughs or slots for the windings . How the era. increases and decreases in such a winding can be studied from Fig. 99 . Here the coils are drawn as if the armature were unrolled and opened out flat . The magnet poles are supposed at the given instant to be over the rectangles 2 See section 78 , p. 173. // marked N and S. Each of the numbered lines in the figure may represent either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of the armature winding is represented . Imagine the poles in Fig. 99 to be moving toward the right , the conductors 1 , 2 , 3 , etc. , remaining stationary . Starting at the instant when a north pole is just approaching conductor 1 , and a south pole conductor 5 , electromotive forces will be in duced in the directions shown by the arrows . As conductors 2 and 6 , 3 and 7 , etc. , are reached , additional electromotive forces are induced . The maximum comes when the N pole covers 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and the S pole covers 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 . After that the resultant electromotive force begins to decrease , falling to zero end then beginning to increase in the opposite direction . In this manner an alternating emf. is gotten in which the changes occur gradually as conductors get into or out of the magnetic Id one by one , or at least coil by coil . In addition the edges f the poles are usually tapered off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoother . M. Concentrated and Distributed Windings. ? Sometimes all tarns for one pair of poles are combined into one coil , doh is put into a single pair of large slots , one for each pole . eh a winding is a " concentrated " winding . ( See Fig. 10:1. ) um the portion of the core under each pole face contains a haler of slots in which the coils are placed , the winding Is distributed . " ( See Figs. 97 , 99 , 100. ) // 70 . Magnetic Circuit .  --  It is important to get an understanding of the magnetic path in an electric machine . Various shapes are possible , but an understanding of one makes all others easy . rig . 100 is a diagram indicating the parts of a typical magnectic circuit , with their names . It is not intended to show &Bills; of mechanical construction . The fine lines in the upper post of the figure show the path of the magnetic flux for one // pair of poles . The paths for the other poles are similar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Field Excitation. ? Thus far nothing has been said as to how the magnetic field is produced . While permanent magnets might be used , they are not satisfactory for practical purposes , except in the very little machines called " magnetos . ' " Electromagnets are therefore used . The poles are fitted with coils or spools of wire , usually of a large number of turns , through which direct current is sent from some external source . The coils are connected to a pair of metallic rings , called " slip-rings " or collector rings , which are in contact with conducting strips , called " brushes , " connected to the source of current . As the entire field structure rotates , current is brought to the coils through the sliding contacts of the stationary brushes with the revolving slip-rings . The source of direct current is usually a separate small direct-current generator , which when used for this purpose is called an " exciter . " If used for one alternator alone its output will range from 1 to 3 per cent of the rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like those used in the Signal Corps portable radio sets , the exciter is larger by comparison . 72 . Stator and Rotor. ? When it is desired to refer to the stationary and rotating members of a dynamo-electric machine without regard to their functions the former is called the " stator " and the latter the " rotor. " 73 . Arrangement of Parts. ? A good idea of the parts of a revolving-field alternator is obtainable from the pictures in Fig. 101 , which show a complete machine , as well as views of the most important parts . The general view shows how the parts fit together . Through the holes in the ventilated iron frame of the stator the outside of the core is visible . On the inside of the core the laminations can he dimly seen . The two dark rings which seem to divide the core into thirds are ventilating duets . Where the windings lie in the slots they are concealed by the wedges , but the ends of the coils are in plain view . Note that // the coil ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four terminals at the left of the stator indicate a twophase machine ( Sec. 75 ) . The right-hand end shield shows one brush holder in place , . to the left of the bearing ; the little hole to the right of the bearing is for the stud on which the other brush holder ( lying in front ) is to be mounted . The brushes of one set slide on one collector ring , and those . of the other set on the other ring . Two brushes are used in each set , in this particular machine , in order to have a large and reliable contact . The ends of the cables leading to the brushes are in view on the right of the complete generator . On the rotor the pole shoes are noticeable , held on by six screws . One of the connections between field coils is seen between the upper pole shoe and the one just in front of it , near the center of the shoe . The massive ring to which the pole cures are attached is also visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little difficult to distinguish them in the picture . 74 . Other Forms of Alternator. ? Thus far we have considered alternators of which the field magnets revolve , while the armature is stationary . That is the construction generally used on large machines , one reason being that it makes the armature ouster to insulate . But it is also possible to have the field magnets stationary while the armature is made to revolve . Small // machines are often built this way . The principle is shown in Fig. 102 . The magnetic field occupies the space between the poles N and Al of the stationary field magnet . The turn of wire ab is made to revolve about a horizontal axis in this magnetic field . T T When a is passing under the N pole , coming toward the reader , the electromotive force in it is to the right , and that iu b which is cutting through the same field ( the direction of the magnetic flux is from the N pole into the S pole ) , but moving away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow in the turn of wire , and by way of the collector rings and brushes in the external circuit , as shown by the arrows . When the loop has made half a revolution , a is passing in front of the S pole and the electromotive force in a is toward the left . In b it is toward the right . In the external portion , X , of the circuit the flow of current will then be opposite in direction to the arrows . The continued rotation of the loop thus causes an alternating current to flow in the circuit . The simple bipolar magnet of Fig. 102 may be replaced by it multipolar electromagnet consisting of a massive cylindrical frame called the " yoke , " from which poles project radially inward . Direct current is sent through coils or spools on the magnet poles . The same kinds of windings are used for the revolving armature as are used for the stationary kind ; the only difference is that they are put on the outside instead of on the inner face of the core . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the conductors , in which the electromotive force is induced are rotated , is said to be of the " revolving-armature " type . A diagram of such a machine , used in one form of radio pack set , is given in Fig. 1032 The armature winding in this case is of the concentrated type . A picture of a generator very much like it appears in Fig. 122 . It has previously been shown that , when the field is made to revolve , slip-rings have to be used in the field circuit . Similarly , when the armature is the part that revolves , there must be slip-rings in the armature circuit to provide connection with the external portion . Such rings are shown at RR in Fig. 102 . Inductor Alternator . Another type of alternator is ' of especial Interest in connection with radio telegraphy . It is called the " inductor alternator , " and is used particularly for the generation of continuous high-frequency currents , say , around 100.000 cycles per second , but is also used for lower frequencies . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form in Fig. 104 . The field magnet and the armature are both stationary . A considerable gap separates the armature core from the faces of the field poles . In this gap are masses of iron , I , free to revolve in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the paper about the axis ma . These masses of iron . are called " inductors . " Imagine them made to revolve by an external force . When the inductors are in the position shown , between N and C , , and S and C , , there is a certain magnetic flux , due to the d. c. excitation . When the inductors are not in that position , there are long air gaps in the magnetic circuit , which have a very much smaller permeability than the iron conductors . The flux is consequently less . The increase and decrease of magnetic flux in the coils A A sets up an alternating emf. , because any change in the flux inclosed by a circuit sets up an emf. in the circuit ( Sec. 45 ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction while it is decreasing . In this typo of alternator , the passing of each mass or inductor causes a complete cycle of emf. , whereas with alternators of either the revolving field or the revolving armature type it requires the passage of two poles to cause a cycle . 75 . Polyphase Alternators. ? Suppose that in Fig. 94 , p. 154 , another loop similar to ab , but entirely independent of it , were // placed at right angles to ab , as shown at cd in Fig. 105 . The rotation of NS would induce in the second loop an alternating emf. identical with that in the first , , having the same frequency and the same series of values . The sole difference would be that they would reach corresponding points in the cycle at different instants of time , for at the moment when the poles were in line with the conductors of one loop , and it was having maximum emf. induced , the other loop would have none . Suppose the emf. wave of the first winding is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will represent the emf. of the other winding . The two curves are first shown separately and then combined into one diagram . They are alike in shape , showing that the two oafs. go through the same series of values , but I Lis always a quarter of a cycle behind I ( see Sec. 53 ) . Suplose the distance 0 ? 4 represents second . Then whatever happens in I , at any instant , happens in II just Asa second biter . This is expressed by saying that there is a " phase difference " of a quarter cycle between them , or that the two ends . differ in phase by a quarter cycle . Two ends . which differ in phase by a quarter of a cycle are said to be in quadrature . A generator giving such a pair of ends . in quadrature is called a " two-phase " alternator . The two windings considered separately are called " phase windings , " or , somewhat loosely , the " phases . " Either one may be thought of as phase I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain why the pictures of Fig. 101 , show four terminals at the left . Two belong to one phase and two to the other . There may be more than two phases ; in fact , modern powergenerators usually have three phase windings . Definition. ? A machine for a simple alternating current is called a " single-phase " machine . Generators used exclusively for radio communication are generally single-phase . A machine for alternating current of two or more phases is Culled a " polyphase " machine ; polyphase generators are either Iwophase or three-phase , almost without exception . They are Wed for power purposes . Arrangement of Windings. ? An idea of the way the windings of a polyphase generator are arranged may be obtained by re168 DYNA3I0-ELECTRIC MACHINERY . ferring back to Fig. 99 . Suppose another winding to be added identical with the one shown , but occupying the spaces left vacant by the first winding . ' As the magnet poles move along the windings come into play alternately . Notice that in a single-phase generator half the surface of the armature core has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , the windings may cover the entire surface , and usually do . Nest , suppose the two-phase windings were each made narrower , leaving space for a third winding just as large as each // of the first two . We should then have three phase windings. and a given field pole would pass them one after the other . Thus would be produced three emfs. differing in phase by equal it mounts . By properly selecting the terminals , the three emfs. would follow one another as represented in Fig. 107 , and it will be seen that now the difference between thenr is one-third of a cycle . In the time of one cycle each of the three comes to a positive peak one after the other . The emf. cur es are shown in Fig. 107 . The emfs. are often spoken of as differing by 120 ? . It might be expected that a three-phase machine would have six terminals . As a matter of fact , the phases are usually so connected in the machine that three terminals are sufficient , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three armature windings . When joined as in the upper sketch , they lure said to be connected in " delta " ; when one end of each coil Is brought to a common junction as at O in the middle figure they are connected in " Y " or " star . " The lower figure is the same as the middle one , in that terminals 2 , 4 , 6 are all joined together and 1 , 3 , 5 are connected to the line wires A , B , C. By changing the position on the paper the connections are made to look simpler . The scheme of connections is ordinarily of no interest to the operator , except in case of trouble , and can not be determined without a close examination . The wires by which the connections are made are carefully wrapped and tucked away at the end of the armature , concealed by an overhanging part of the frame or by the end shield , which has to be taken off before the connections can be traced . ' 1.7 0 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Losses , and Efficiency . 76 . Equations for Frequency and Emf. ? The frequency of the emf. generated by an alternator of the revolving-field or revolving-armature type is given by the equation : The passing of each pair of poles , p in number , gives rise to one cycle . If there are n revolutions per second , the number of cycles per second is therefore 1 . X n . The second form of the equation is given , because the speed is commonly given in revolutions per minute . For example : What frequency will a 12-pole alternator give when running at 5000 r.p.m. ? With 12 poles each revolution gives 6 cycles . In a minute there will be 6X5000-30,000 cycles . In a second there are 30.000=60=500 cycles . The machine gives 500 cycles per second . By the second formula we get the same answer For the inductor type the frequency is the same as the number of inductors which pass a given point per second . Thus 40 teeth at 25 r.p.s. give 1000 cycles per second . The inductors are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that project from the revolving part . The emf. generated in an alternator depends on how much magnetic flux is cut by the conductors per second . Increasing either the magnetic flux from each pole , or the number of poles that pass a given conductor in a second , or the number of conductors connected in series ( so that the effects in them are added together ) increases the end . of the machine in a corresponding way , This may all be stated in one equation . 77 . Dependence of Driving Power on Current. ? The power consumed in an electrical circuit at any instant is proportional to the emf. and also to the current . It is therefore proportional to their product . If the current is made to flow by means of a generator , and if the generator is driven by an engine of some sort , the power that has to be developed by the engine evidently depends upon the power used in the circuit . It is worth while to trace the reason why increased current in a generator calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple loop in Fig. 102 be made to rotate at constant speed by any " prime mover " suitably governed . This prime mover may be anything that will make the loop go around ? a man turning a crank , a gasoline engine , a steam engine , an electric motor , etc . At the instant when the loop is in the plane of the paper , and a is coming toward the reader , an emf . Is being induced in it , in the direction of the arrow . If the circuit is closed , a current flows in the same direction . But it // is known ( see Sec. 43 ) that when a conductor , carrying a current , is in a magnetic field , the conductor tends to move across the field . The force on the conductor is proportional to the strength of the field and to the current . The direction of the force is given by the left-hand rule . Applying the lefthand rule to conductor a , it is seen that the force on it is away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor is being driven , so that the wire is harder to push than it would be if there were no current . The greater the current in the conductor the greater must he the force exerted to drive it around , and therefore the greater must be the power developed by the prime mover in keeping up a given speed . The same reasoning applied to b shows that it acts with a in opposing rot : t:ion. 78 . Losses. ? Of the mechanical energy supplied to a generator by its prime mover , not all appears in electrical form in the circuit . Some is unavoidably transformed into heat , and thus lost for practical purposes . The losses , which may be called power losses or energy losses , may be classified as p . Mechanical losses . 2 . Copper losses . 3 . Core losses . Mechanical losses are those due to friction in the hearings , friction at the brush contacts , and friction between the air and the moving part of the machine , commonly called windage . The latter is not important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very high-speed generators . Generators of the kind we are discussing are driven at nearly constant speed , so the mechanical losses do not depend much on the load , whether large or small . They do depend very greatly on the condition of the bearings and brushes . Some points regarding the care of machines in this respect are given at the end of this chapter , iii Section - MG . Copper losses are due to the flow of current against the resistance of the field and armature windings . They are therefore divided into two parts , field copper loss and armature copper loss . The former is also called " excitation loss . " Since // the field coils have resistance ( usually high ) some heat is produced as the necessary current for magnetization is made to flow through them . Like all heat losses due to current in a conductor , the heating is proportional to the square of the current , being in watts , where If is the current in amperes in the field coils and Pt is the resistance of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armature , when the current in the latter is large , requires more magnetization than when the armature current is small . This in turn requires more field current , hence the field copper loss , or excitation loss , is somewhat greater at large loads than at small loads ; that is , it varies somewhat with the load . Like the field loss , the armature copper loss is of the 121 ? type ; it varies as the square of the armature current , and therefore as the square of the load on the generator . The armature resistance is made as small as is expedient . In a large generator it may be only a small fraction of 1 ohm , but the loss due to the great current generated will nevertheless he considerable . Core losses , or losses in the magnetic circuit , are of two classes , due to " hysteresis " and " eddy currents . " Hysteresis losses are caused by the rapid reversals of the magnetism of Ilia armature core . Each molecule of the core may be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core is changed in direction the molecules have to be pulled around against their mutual magnetic attractions . It takes energy to accomplish this . In an electric machine there is a double reversal during each cycle . This makes many reversals per second and requires considerable power . Eddy currents are little electric currents induced in the iron sheets of which the armature core is made up . The thinner the sheets the smaller are the currents ; in fact , it is because of the eddy currents that the core has to be laminated . ( loth hysteresis and eddy currents produce heat in the core , and in producing heat they use up power which has to be furnished by the prime mover . Therefore they are wasteful , and the designers of electric machinery plan to keep them as small // as possible . Core losses in transformers have been briefly discussed in Section 58 , page 132 . No specific statement can be made regarding the magnitudes of the various losses described in the preceding paragraphs , because they depend on many factors , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design . But in order to give the reader some idea , it may be said , roughly , that at full load , for generators of the usual types , the mechanical or frictional losses may range from 6 per cent for a 1-kw. machine to 1 per cent for the 1,000-kw. size ; the excitation loss , from 6 to 1 per cent ; the armature resistance loss , from 4 to 1 per cent ; and the core loss , from 4 to 2 per cent . It will now be clear why the allowable power output of a generator has a limit . Usually machines are heavy enough to give a large margin of strength , but they can not well be made large enough to allow for the heat produced by severe overloads long continued . The increased current causes heat to be produced more rapidly , and the temperature rises . High temperature is injurious to the insulation . For example , it is found that cotton should not be continuously heated as hot as the boiling point of water . Cotton is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the insulation is spoiled , the current can follow other paths than those it should , and the machine is ruined . 79 . Rating ; Name Plate Data. ? Practically all electrical apparatus , whether for alternating or for direct-current generator , motor , or other device , is designed for certain definite conditions of operation . It is standard commercial practice to attach firmly to every electrical machine before it leaves the factory a brass information tag called a " name plate . " This usually gives the serial number by which the machine can be identified ; tells the maker 's none ; states whether the machine is a generator or a motor ; what is the maximum continuous power output ; whether for direct or alternating current ; if alternating , for what frequency and how many phases ; at what speed it is to be operated ; at what voltage ; the maximum current for continuous operation . Some of these items are at times omitted , but most of them are essential . A person who wishes to become familiar with electrical machinery should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine // to which he has access and note the differences in size , construction , and use . It has been previously said that electrical power is measured in watts ( or kilowatts , " kw , " when large ) . In a direct-current circuit watts are the product of volts times amperes . With alternating current something else has to be taken into account .. and to get the average power we must multiply the volts-tunesamperes by the " power factor . " ' We might expect to find a.emachines rated in watts or kilowatts , but if we look at the name plate of a generator we are likely to find the letters " kva. " ( kilovolt-amperes ) . That is , instead of actual watts the permissible output is expressed as a product of amperes times volts divided by 1000 . The reason is plain , if we remember that the whole question of what an electric machine will stand hinges altogether on the heating . The heating of the field coils and armature core depends upon the voltage generated , because that is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn depends on the current in the field coils . The heating of the armature conductors is determined by the armature current ; whether or not quit . is in phase with the emf. makes no difference . The total Matting , then , depends on the volts and the amperes , regardless . f the power output , which may be large or small , depending the phase relation between the two . Direct-current generators are usually rated in kilowatts ad , as just stated , alternating-current generators in kilooltnperes . Motors , either d.c. or a.c. , are often rated in units of rsepower ( 1 horsepower=746 watts ) . When an a.c. motor is led in horsepower , a particular power factor is , of course , timed . 80 . Efficiency. ? The ratio of the useful output of a device to Input , is called its " efficiency . " In all kinds of machinery it is impossible to avoid some es of power , so the output is less than the input and the // efficiency is less than 100 per cent . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a given machine it varies with the extent to which the machine is loaded . Certain losses go on regardless of the load ; those are the mechanical losses , field excitation , and core losses . Others increase with the load ; the armature copper loss rapidly , some additional core losses and a portion of the excitation loss more slowly . When the output is small , most of the power input is used up in the constant losses , and the efficiency is low . With very large outputs the variable losses become excessive , again lowering the efficiency . For some intermediate load , usually not far from the rated load given on the name plate , the efficiency is a maximum . At full load , and for the usual designs , it may range from 80 per cent for a 1-kw. generator to 95 per cent for a 1000-kw. generator. 81 . Regulation. ? Electric generators are , with few exceptions , intended to be operated at constant or nearly constant speed . Assuming that the speed is constant , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise be constant , regardless of the current output , if it were not for certain disturbing influences . A generator operating under these conditions is often called a " constant potential " or " constant voltage " machine . The current output depends on what is going on in the external circuit . In a city it might depend on the number of lamps turned on . In the case of a generator supplying energy to a spark gap , it would depend largely on the adjustment of the gap . The term " load " is commonly used in this connection . Sometimes it means the devices themselves , which are connected to the line , and sometimes the current taken by them . There is generally no trouble in knowing which is meant . Suppose we have a certain voltage generated when the load is zero . Then , if the machine is made to supply current to a circuit , the voltage at its terminals will in general be lowered and the greater the current , the more will the voltage be reduced . The term by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect is called the " regulation . " It is found by subtracting the voltage at full load from the voltage at no load , dividing by the full load voltage and multiplying by 100 to get the result in per cent . // A small percentage regulation means that the voltage remains very nearly constant when the load is changed . 82 . Armature Impedance and Armature Reaction. ? There are two reasons why the voltage of a generator is lower when it is supplying current than when it is not supplying current , even If the speed is entirely steady and the direct current flowing around the field magnets is the same . ( a ) The armature windings are bound to have some resistance and some reactance . It requires an end . Lo send current through the armature , therefore . This eta. , called the armature impedance drop , has to be subtracted from the emf. generated to get the emf. left to send current through the external circuit . The greater the current , the greater the armature impedance drop and the less the emt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding and core constitute an electromagnet . When current flows in the windings , the magnetic field caused by it is combined with the magnetic field due to field strength , with consequent decrease in armature voltage , since the resultant magnetic field is what determines the generated emf . The change in the field flux by reason of the current flowing in the armature is called " armature reaction . " Armature renet ion occurs in direct current as well as in alternating current machines , and in motors as well as generators. ' 83 . Effect of Power Factor on Regulation. ? The reduction of terminal voltage due to the current flowing in the armature depends not only on the magnitude of the current but also on Its phase relation to the emf. , which is indicated by the power factor . A lagging current causes a greater reduction in terminal voltage than the same number of amperes in phase , the effect increasing with the lag . Thus , at 80 per cent power factor // it may be twice as great as at 100 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by condensers , improves the regulation , so that the terminal voltage may actually be higher when current is flowing than when there is none . 84 . Effect of Speed on Regulation. ? Since the emf. is proportional to the rate of cutting of flux , it follows that fluctuations of speed are attended with proportional fluctuations of voltage , provided the field excitation is not changed at the same time . // 85 . Voltage Control. ? The simplest way to control the voltage of a generator is by adjusting the strength of the magnetic field by means of the field current . For this purpose an adjustable resistance is inserted in the circuit of the latter , called a field rheostat . One kind consists of a quantity of wire of an alloy having a comparatively high resistance , mounted on insulating supports in a perforated iron box with a slate face , or embedded in an insulating enamel . A handle is provided for making contact with any one of a number of brass studs attached to the resistance wire at various points , so that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided for connecting the rheostat to the field circuit . Fig. 109 shows the principle . The place of the field rheostat in the scheme of connections is seen in Fig. 1.10 , which represents the stationary armature and revolving field of an alternator , with arrangements for supplying current to the alternator field from the exciter E , current being controlled by the field rheostat R. Small alternators for field use in radio telegraphy are often used without a field rheostat . The voltage is kept steady enough for practical purposes by driving the machine at the right speed . C. Direct-Current Generators. 86 . Commutation. ? F , ig. 102 , page 163 , illustrates the principle used when alternating currents are generated by revolving an armature in a stationary magnetic field But if each end of the loop is connected to a half cylinder of metal ( C , Fig. 111 ) , on Which rests a stationary brush B --  or B ? , then as the loop is revolved the connection to the external circuit is reversed every half revolution , and the pulsations of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called a " commutator . " The brushes must be so set that the reversal of connections occurs at the instant when the current in the loop is zero Anal about to reverse . Thus in the figure , a is near the N pole , and if it is coming toward the reader the emf. will be toward the right . At that instant the current will flow out through the segment in conet with the upper brush to the external circuit ; that is the upper brush is + . After a quarter revolution the conductors will be moving along the flux and not cutting across it , so // there will be no emf . Each brush will be just in the act of passing from one segment to the other . After a half revolution from the position shown b will have exchanged places with a . Now the emf. in b will be toward the right , and current will flow out to the external circuit through B+ . Thus the same brush is always positive . In the external circuit the current always flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current is alternating . If an emf. curve similar to Fig. 95 , p. 154 , were plotted for this circuit , with time measured along the horizontal axis , and volts at any instant along the vertical axis , the result would be somewhat like Fig. 112 . Instead of a positive and a negative half wave there would be two positive halves , the negative being rectified by means of the commutator . Again , as with alternators , the need of higher emfs. than can be developed by a single loop and of more effective utilization Of the material make necessary the use of coil-wound // armatures and multipolar field magnets . With a commutator consisting of only a few segments , say as many segments as there are magnet poles , the current would still be pulsating . To get a steady , practically constant emf. , commutators are used having many segments ? several hundred in the case of large generators and motors , and usually not fewer than 20 or 30 even on very small machines for 110-volt circuits . Such a commutator consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin insulating sheets of mica , the whole assembled in the form of a cylinder held together by strong end clamps . The segments are insulated from the clamps by suitably shaped rings , usually of molded mica insulation . Connections leading to the armature conductors are soldered into slots in the segments , which commonly have lugs or " risers " for the purpose , extending upward at the end toward the armature. 87 . Ring and Drum Windings. ? Armature windings fall into two broad classes , called " ring " and " drum " windings , according to the way the conductors are mounted on the core . In the first of these the wire is laid on the outside and passed through the hollow space inside of the core , being threaded through and through much as a napkin ring or a bridle ring might be covered with string . Ring windings are scarcely ever used nowadays . Modern mahines have windings of the type shown in Fig. 113 , called " drum " windings . The conductors are all on the outer face of the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent poles of opposite polarity . These two features are characteristic of all kinds of drum winding . In the kind illustrated in the diagram , starting with commutator segment 1 , we pass up to conductor b , which at the . instant shown is under a S pole . It Is connected at the back of the armature to i , which lies under a N pole and is soldered into segment 2 . Starting at 2 , we have d under the edge of the S pole back-connected to k under the edge of the N pole ; k is attached to segment 3 . Continuing in the same way all around the armature we finally have 16 loops connected to the 16 commutator segments . It will be understood that an actual machine has a great many more turns In the armature winding and a larger number of commutator segments . // At the four segments marked + or ? contact is made with brushes leading to the external circuit . By the " right-hand rule " 10 the emf , in conductors under the N pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armature at segment 3 . The brush on that segment is therefore negative . The brush at segment 7 is positive , because there the current flows out of the armature . Similar reasoning applied to the conductors under the S poles leads to the same result as to polarity of the brushes , which are thus seen to be . alternately , one positive and the next negative , as we go around the commutator . If a machine having more than two sets of brushes is examined , it will be found that all the positive brushes are joined by a heavy conductor and all the negative brushes by another . Then one connection is made from the group of positive brushes to the external circuit , and one from all the negative brushes . In speaking of alternators , the actual construction of armatures was described ; that is , the use of machine-wound coils in slots in the face of a laminated core . D.c. armatures are made . // the same way except that the ends of the coils are soldered to the commutator segments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 115 , and 116 . The first shows the copper segments , with their sheets of mica between them , assembled in the form of a ring and held together by a firm temporary clamp . The next picture shows the commutator fastened on the front end of the armature core . The " risers " are to be seen coming up from the ends of the segments for connection to the armature coils . On the core , built up of thin laminations , note the teeth , slots , and three rows of air ducts for ventilation . The last picture shows the coils in the slots of the core . Their ends have been soldered to the commutator . SS . Excitation : Separate , Series , Shunt , Compound. ? While alternators require d.c. from a separate source for their field excitation , direct-current dynamos usually excite their own fields . Depending on the scheme of connections between the armature and the field coils , this gives rise to several arrangements , all of which are of practical importance . In this discussion we leave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its magnetic field on a group of permanent magnets . Fig. 117 shows the several ways of exciting the field magnets , and incidentally illustrates the conventional symbols generally used for an armature and for field windings . In this sort of diagram no attempt is made to draw a picture of the machine . A whole set of field coils , for example , is represented by a single coil , the armature and brushes by a single circle 's and two strokes . Separate. ? The first sketch indicates that current for the field coils comes from a source , like a battery , entirely independent of the armature . Such a machine is said to be " separately excited . " Shunt. ? The next indicates that the current from the armature divides ; some goes to the load circuit , some to the field coils ; the two unite again and flow back into the armature at // the brush of opposite polarity . When the current from the armature divides , a portion flowing through the field winding , the machine is spoken of as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total current which a machine is able to generate continuously is required for shunt field excitation ; it may be 5 or 6 per cent for a 1-kw. generator , and as little as perhaps 2 per cent for a 100-kw. generator . Shunt field windings consist of many turns of fine wire ( insulated , of course ) . There may readily be 2000 or 3000 turns . For instance , the little exciter for the 500-cycle audio-frequency generator described on page 195 is a direct-current shunt generator . Each of its two field coils has 2800 turns of wire about 0.25 mm. ( 0.01 in. ) in diameter . Using this great quantity of fine wire has two consequences ; because of its high resistance II lets only a small current flow ; because of the large number of turns this small current suffices to produce the desired magnetomotive force ( which depends on the " ampere turns " ) . // Series. ? When the whole current from the armature flows through the field coils , the generator is " series excited . " Two ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavy wire is used for series coils . They have to carry the full current output of the machine ; if fine wires were used , the excessive heat produced would destroy the insulation . The necessary ampere turns are secured by virtue of having a large number of amperes and comparatively few turns of wire . Compound. ? When a generator is provided with two sets of field coils , one of fine wires connected in shunt and the other of a few turns of heavy conductor connected in series with the armature , it is called a " compound wound " generator , or more commonly just a " compound " generator . Two ways of representing it are shown in Fig. 117. 89 . Characteristics of Terminal Voltage. ? Why are so many different kinds of connection used for field excitation ? Ordinarily the load on a generator will vary . By this we mean that there are changes in the number of devices switched on ; lamps may he turned on or off , or motors started and stopped . Such changes of load automatically affect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently , according to the kind of field excitation used . To see why the effects differ , hi each case consider the dynamo driven at a steady speed without load . Then imagine the load ( current through the armature ) to be successively increased . If separate excitation is used a certain emf. is generated at no load . When current flows in the armature some of this end . is used up in sending the current through the resistance of the armature itself . There is also another effect , due to " armature reaction , " " which weakens the magnetic field . Both increase as the armature current increases . Hence the terminal volts are less when the armature current is large , than when it is small . Curve a , Fig. 118 , shows this graphically . The load current in amperes is plotted along the horizontal axis , the terminal volts along the vertical axis . The greater the cur- // rent , the lower the voltage . The difference between no load and full voltage shown in the diagram corresponds to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather large machines , say of 100 kw or more . For a smaller one the difference would be greater . When shunt excitation is used the reduced terminal voltage sends a reduced current through the field coils , so the magnetic flux is weaker , the greater the armature current . Hence the terminal voltage falls off more than it does with separate excitation . Thus curve b , Fig. 118 , droops more than curve a . The dashed part shows how the voltage falls off when the machine is greatly overloaded . With series excitation , the condition is very different . When no current flows , only the weak residual magnetism of the iron is available , and the emf. generated is consequently very small . a Load , P roenr of rated Amperes Fig . Ile Relation between Current Outb t and Terminal Volts - For aeparat y encitad $enerat r b- For ahunT b ( ( ner . t r c- For series , enerator d- For Compound &; eretor 4 Defined in Sec. 81. // Curve c shows it by starting only a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the machine . this current , flowing in the field coils , strengthens the magnetic field and so causes a greater emf. to be generated . The greater the current taken by the external circuit , the greater will be the voltage . Hence curve c rises . In the compound generator the two effects are combined . Depending on the relative proportions of the two windings , the voltage at full load may be made equal to that at no load , or greater , or less ; the latter is rare . Curve d , Fig. 118 , is for a generator somewhat " over-compounded . " If the full load voltage were the same as the no load voltage , the generator would be " flat-compounded . " In examining a generator , it is usually impossible to determine whether the field coils are of fine or thick wire without tearing them open , because they are protected with wrappings of tape , hard cord , or other covering . To distinguish between shunt and series coils is , however , quite easy by looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different poles are small because they have to carry only a small current , those between the series coils are heavy , consisting of thick , wide straps of copper on the larger generators. 90 . Emf . Equation. ? It has been stated that the emf. developed in a conductor depends on the rate of cutting the magnetic flux 's and is equal in volts to the number of magnetic lines of force cut per second , divided by 10 8 . On an armature a number of such conductors are connected in series and their emfs. are therefore added . Thus in Fig. 113 , the conductors which would hen e to he traversed in going from one brush on the commutator to the next through the armature constitute one such group . There are three other similar paths , and these four paths are all in parallel , so the resulting emf. is the same as that of one path alone , but the current that goes to the external circuit is the suns of the currents in the four paths . Let N=the number of conductors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ) of the armature. p=number of magnetic poles . 0=magnetic flux per pole . 15 Chapter 1 , Section 45. // Then the flux cut per second by any conductor is n X p X ? lines . Dividing by 10 ' gives the average volts . If there are N conductors in series , the total emf. is This formula shows that the voltage of a generator can be changed by changing the speed n , the flux-o , the number of poles p , or the number of conductors N. The last two , of course , are fixed once for all when the machine is built ; the first two can be changed quickly by the operator , and afford practical means of controlling the voltage . This formula means exactly the same thing as the one given for induced emf. in Chapter 1 , namely that E=N ? It is merely necessary to note that if nXp poles are passed per second , then the time required to cut the flux 4 ) is only nX ? th of a second ; this takes the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing as dividing by nXp , we multiply by nXp . The reason for the factor 108 in the denominator has been explained . 91 . Voltage Control. ? The practical way of controlling the voltage of separately excited , shunt , and compound generators is by having an adjustable resistance , called a " field rheostat " ( Fig. 109 ) , in circuit with the fine wire ( shunt field ) coils . The points 7t in Fig. 117 , show where such a rheostat might be put in the circuit of each machine . 92 . Effect of Varying Speed. ? A rise or fall of speed causes the emf. of a separately excited generator to rise or fall in aboutthe same proportion . In shunt and compound generators the effect is greater . That is why engines for driving such generators have to have good governors , if a steady voltage is wanted . Because of these characteristics , each type of generator has its special uses . For instance , the exciter for the a.c. generator of a radio field set is a simple shunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shunt generator is good also for // charging storage batteries . Incandescent lamps need a very steady voltage that is not changed when some of them are turned on or off . A compound generator meets this requirement . Voltage Regulators. ? Various devices have been developed for maintaining the voltage of a generator constant with varying generator speed and varying conditions of load . A simple type used with a shunt generator is shown in Fig. 118 ? a . The shunt field winding of the generator is shown at S. The voltage regulator proper consists of an electromagnet with two windings V and W , a vibrating armature A normally held back by a spring G , and a noninductive resistance R. The two windings of the magnet are wound so as to oppose each other ; the winding V is called the " voltage " winding , and may have more turns than the " reverse " winding W. The voltage winding T7 is connected across the voltage to be regulated , which is the voltage across the terminals of the generator . The tension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normal the armature A is just held against the contact C , and the shunt field is then connected directly across the line . If now the line voltage increases , the armature is pulled away from the contact C , and the current to the shunt field must pass // through the noninductive resistance R or the winding IV . The current through the shunt field is therefore decreased , and hence t he line voltage is decreased . If it were not for the winding TV , the armature would be held over with the contact C open until the line voltage had dropped sufficiently so that the spring would pull the armature back . The reverse winding W , however , accelerates this action . Winding W is connected across the resistance R , and part of the shunt field current passes through IV . The magnetic field due to the current through W opposes the magnetic field due to the current through the voltage winding V , and the armature is therefore pulled back and contact C closed more quickly . A little time is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W , and the magnetic effect of the current through W lags a little behind the effect of introducing the non-inductive resistance R into the circuit . In operation this type of voltage regulator is continuously chattering , and gives good regulation . A voltage regulator of this type is now supplied with some generators used in Signal Corps sets . There are also various other kinds of voltage regulators in general use . D. Special Alternators for Radio Use . 93 . Audio Frequency and Radio Frequency. ? Alternating currents are generated at various frequencies , covering a remarkably wide range . Depending on their application , the frequencies in practical use fall into three well-defined classes : ( a ) Commercial frequencies , which nowadays generally mean 25 or 60 cycles per second . ( b ) Audio frequencies , which are usually around 500 to 1000 cycles per second but may extend as high as 10,000 cycles per second . ( c ) Radio frequencies , usually between 20,000 and 2,000,000 , but extending in extreme cases down to perhaps 10,000 and up to three hundred million cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . The great machines in the central stations which supply our cities with current operate at these frequencies . Audio frequencies are those conveniently heard in the telephone . When alternating currents are sent through a telephone , 53904 ? 22-13 // the diaphragm of the latter vibrates . The vibrations are heard as sound . The more rapid the vibrations , the shriller the tone . Vibrations at the rate of 4,000 or 5,000 per second give a shrill whistle , while the lowest notes of a bass voice have somewhat under 100 . If a 500-cycle generator supplies current to a spark gap and the spark jumps once on the positive and once on the negative half-wave , then at the receiving station the signal is heard in the telephone as a musical tone of 1000 vibrations per second . Radio frequencies occur in the circuits of radio apparatus , for instance , in an antenna . They are too rapid to cause a sound in a telephone which can be heard by the human ear . They may be generated by dynamo-electric machines of highly specialized construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Audio-Frequency Generators. ? To show how the methods described in the preceding sections are applied in actual generators , a few typical machines used in radio sets will be briefly described . Whether or not these are of the latest design is not important . Changes of detail are constantly being made , but they do not affect the principles used and can be readily understood after the workings of similar machines have been grasped . The examples of machines here given will also illustrate how the form of generator and the auxiliaries used with it are influenced by the source of power available for driving it . The generator is only one part of a unit for converting energy into the electrical form . The other part depends on the source of energy available ; it may be heat derived from coal or gasoline ; it may be falling water , moving air , human muscles , or a charged storage battery . Crank Dr ? cm ? The field radio pack set furnishes an example of a self-contained generating unit driven by hand . These sets have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described only in a general way . The generator is cylindrical in shape and is entirely incased , including the ends . in a metal shell . At one end of it is a flywheel for equalizing the speed . At the other is the train of gears , running in oil and inclosed in a housing , through which power is transmitted from the crank shaft to the generator shaft . The crank shaft is turned by means of a pair of cranks. // The alternator 16 is a 250-watt , 500-cycle machine of the revolving armature type . The exciter " is built in with the alternator , so that the two have but one frame and one set of bearings , and the same shaft carries both armatures . Near one end , on opposite sides of the shell , is a pair of holes giving access to the d.c. brushes which bear on the commutator of the exciter " and near the other end are similar holes for the a.c. brushes t hat bear on the collector rings . The crank is turned at the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the date of the model ) , and the generators make 3,300 to 5,000 r.p.m. , the cranks being geared to them at ratio of 1 to 100 . The diagram and data of Fig. 103 apply to the alternator of such a set , the armature having 18 teeth , the same as the number of field poles . To get 500 cycles it must make 3,333 r.p.m which corresponds to a crank speed of about 33 r.p.m . The connections are shown in Fig. 119 . The field coils of the exciter are connected directly to the brushes . The circuit to the alternator field coils passes through a receptacle I ' , on the side of the machine . A two-wire cable can be plugged in at this point for the sending key . While the key is closed , field current flows and a.c. is generated in the armature . Another receptacle   provides for connecting the alternator armature to the transformer from which current is supplied for the spark . In view of the high speed at which these generators run ( some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly and the bearing surfaces , particularly the d.c. commutator , have to be in good condition . For ease of turning , they should not be pressed in harder than necessary ; on the other hand , unless the contact is good the set fails to operate satisfactorily . The most common ? troubles , electrically , are due to a dirty commutator , poor brush contacts , or to turning the brushes in replacing them , so that the curve of the brush does not match the curve of the cons mutator . Gasoline-Engine Driven. ? Hand power is not practical , except for very small generators , since a man can develop only about // one-tenth of a horsepower if he has to keep it up for more than a short time . One of the most convenient sources of larger power is the gasoline engine . It is particularly suitable for isolated stations , or for the more powerful portable sets , like the field radio tractor sets . Detailed information about any particular set is supposed to be furnished with the set , but certain features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rotation of the alternator is almost always much higher than that of an engine ; it is therefore stepped up by pulleys and belts , or sprockets and chain , or gears , the smaller pulley or sprocket or gear being on the generator shaft . The generator may be of any of the three possible types previously described ; for example , one of the permanent Signal Corps stations uses an inductor alternator ( Sec. 741 ; one kind // of tractor set also has the inductor type ; another has the revolving armature . If it becomes necessary to open the machine it is easy to discover which type it is . If the rotor , or revolving part , has no windings at all , then we are dealing with an inductor alternator ; if the circuit leading to the transmitting apparatus ( not necessarily the key , because that may be in the field circuit ) comes from the slip-rings , then the revolving part must be the armature . In one of the sets of this latter type the alternator and its exciter are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolve together . , A frequency indicator in front of the chauffeur guides him in controlling the speed of the engine so as to maintain the right frequency ? 500 cycles per second . The combination is chain driven from the main transmission . The same engine that drives the truck is used to furnish power for the generator , the one or the other being thrown in as desired . The following name-plate data of this particular set will illustrate some of the statements made in earlier sections : Generator frequency , 500 cycles ; poles , 30 ; kva. , 2.5 ; open circuit volts , 245 ; terminal voltage at full load , with key closed , 110 ; 2 kw at 0.80 p. f. ; 2000 r. p. m . Exciter , shunt type : poles , 2 ; load volts , 110 ; load amperes , 2.7 ; 0.3 kw . From the speed , 2000 r. p. m. , and the stated number of poles , 30 , each revolution gives 15 cycles and the cycles per second will be 15 6X 20000500 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage , 110 , and the rating , 2.5 kilovoltamperes or 2500 volt-amperes , the full load current is 1102500 or 22.7 amperes . The product of volts , amperes , and power factor gives power in watts , thus 110X22.7.X0.80=2000 watts , 2 kw . The great difference between the volts on open circuit , 245 , and volts when loaded , 110 , shows that the armature has a high impedance . It must not be assumed that this loss of voltage is all due to resistance , and so represents a waste of power . Much of it is due rather to the demagnetizing action mentioned in Section 82 , which causes a reduction in the effective magnetism. and therefore in the emir . generated . // The scheme of connections in Fig. 120 shows that the exciter voltage can be controlled by means of the exciter field rheostat . This , in itself , would govern the 500-cycle voltage fairly well , but a second control is provided in the generator field rheostat . High-resistance connections between each machine and the ground provide a leakage path for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Audio-frequency generators have an important application in furnishing current for communicating from airplanes . Fan motors have been used as a source of power , though it has been objected that they increase the head resistance of the plane . There is no theoretical reason why any type of self-contained generator might not be used , but because of the high rotative speeds obtainable with fans and the need of lightness , special machines have been developed with the fan mounted directly on an extension of the shaft . One recent form is described on page 203 . Motor Driven , by A.C. Motor. ? When electric current is tp be had , but not at the desired frequency , use may be made of a combination of a motor , adapted to the circuit that is available , and a 500-cycle generator . Such a combination is called a " motor-generator set . " For use with 110-volt , 60-cycle alternating current , sets are built using the same sort of generator ( with built-in exciter ) described in connection with hand-driven apparatus . Mounted on a common bedplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected by a flexible coupling . Except for the mechanical connection between the shafts , the two machines are entirely independent . Electrically there is no connection . The motor is designed to run automatically , at the proper speed for the generator , or perhaps it would be better to say that there are certain definite speeds at which 60-cycle a.c. motors have to run , and the generator has such a number of poles that it gives the desired frequency when driven by a motor operating at one of these speeds . Voltage control of the generator is secured by means similar to those shown in Fig. 120 . Motor driven , by D. C. Motor. ? When direct current at 110 volts is available the arrangement is somewhat different . The exciter is unnecessary , because current for the field coil of the alternator may be taken directly from the line . It is then // possible to combine the generator and a 110-volt , direct current . shunt motor ( see Sec. 97 ) into a very compact unit . The two armatures are on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rig . 121 represents such a unit , which is shown partly disassembled in Fig. 122 . The generator happens to be of the satire design as that shown in diagram in Fig. 103 , but being built for nearly 50 per cent more power it is somewhat larger , has more poles , and runs at a correspondingly lower speed to give the same frequency . The two armatures are seen on their common shaft ; the collector rings are near one end and the commutator near the other . // One scheme of connections for such a unit is seen in Fig. 123. which shows the d. c. motor connected to its line by way of a switch and starting bog . " The rheostat shown in circuit with the motor field , MF , may be omitted . Its purpose is to give control of the motor speed , 20 if such control is desired , in order to get some definite frequency quite accurately in the a. c. circuit . From the d. c. line , connection is made also to the generator field winding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines the magnetization and , therefore , the generator voltage . Thus the generator frequency may be governed by means of the motor field rheostat and the voltage by the generator field rheostat . Motor-Driren Inductor alternators. ? Thus far in this part of the chapter attention has been centered on revolving armature generators . It is equally feasible to generate 500-cycle current by means of inductor alternators . Fig. 124 represents a motor-driven inductor alternator for conversion from direct to alternating current at 500 cycles . The table following gives the data as taken from the name plate . Here again the two distinct machines . motor and generator , are combined in a single compact unit . The armatures are on one shaft and the two frames are made into one structure , though openings are left for ventilation . These , as well as other openings at the ends of the machine , are screened to keep out foreign material , while permitting a free flow of air for cooling . The generator frame is cast in the form of a cylindrical shell . At each end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward , on which the armature winding is placed . Between the two armature cores is the field winding , a single large coil which fits inside the cylindrical shell , where it is rigidly held in place . This coil produces a // magnetic flux parallel with the shaft . The armature winding is in two groups , one on each core . Each group consists of 12 coils , and the coils are all connected in series . The portion of the set so far described is stationary . The rotor is a solid cylindrical core , at each end of which is a ring of 12 teeth projecting radially outward . The core is magnetized by the stationary field winding previously mentioned . To trace the magnetic circuit , begin at the core . One end of it is N , the other S. The flux passes out through all the rotor teeth at the N end , across the air gaps , into the adjacent stator teeth , through the corresponding gap into the rotor teeth at the S end , and thence into the central core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teeth are alternately in line with the armature coils , then opposite the spaces between coils . The flux through the coils consequently pulsates , and alternating emfs. are induced . So far as the diagram of connections is concerned , Fig. 123 applies to this case quite as well as to the preceding one , for the shunt motor and generator field are supplied with direct current in either event , and alternating current flows from the alternator armature , whether that be revolving or stationary . Self-Excited Inductor Alternator. ? A very novel construction has lately been worked out for fan drive on airplanes . A simplified diagram of it is given in Fig. 125 , from which the electrical and magnetic circuits may be traced , and the principle of its operation may be followed . For the moment , ignore the windings on the rotor . The machine is then seen to be an inductor alternator . The a.c. winding is on the 16 stator teeth , each tooth and its adjacent slot spanning of the circumference . These teeth , in groups of 4. form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have opposite polarities around the stator , so that there are two N and two S poles , by means of direct current sent through the field coils F , each of which consists of a large number of turns . The field coils are all connected in series to the source of direct current , to be mentioned hereafter , but the connections are omitted from the sketch to avoid having so many lines . // l When the rotor is made to revolve , the flux through the stator teeth pulsates , and alternating emfs , are induced in the coils encircling them . By symmetry , whatever happens in any one , , oil is also going on at the same lime in eleven others . The // Besides having on it the inductors for the alternator , the rotor also functions as a d.c. armature . That accounts for the windings shown on the rotor . How such an armature generates direct currents is explained in Section 87 . For present purposes it suffices to say that the armature consists of a large number of turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn spans three teeth . In the diagram the connections have been simplified for purposes of illustration , and the number of commutator segments shown is much smaller than on the actual machine . Connections , not shown in the figure , are made between the field coils and the four brushes , two positive and two negative . The brushes are shown in the diagram on the inside of the commutator , for clearness ; actually they are on the outside . The direct current from this armature is what energizes the field coils . It will thus be seen that the rotor serves two entirely distinct purposes : 1 . It carries the inductors for the a.c. generator , which has stationary field and armature coils . 2 . It carries the d.c. armature , which corresponds to the exciter in other machines . 95 . Radio-Frequency Generators . Alexanderson High-Frequency Alternator. ? It is possible to construct an alternator of the inductor type which will directly generate a frequency as high as 200,000 cycles per second . In order to secure this frequency , it is necessary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This result can be attained only by having a great many teeth on the rotor and driving it at a very high speed . In a 2-kw. , 100,000-cycle generator the rotor has 300 inductors and makes 20,000 r.p.m . With a rotor having a diameter of about 1 foot , this design allows about one-eighth inch for each slot and tooth together , and even with this design the peripheral velocity of the rim is approximately 12 miles per minute . The rotor consists of a steel disk with a thin rim and a much thicker hub shaped for maximum strength . Instead of having teeth on the edge , slots are cut on each side of the rotor very near the edge and may not extend entirely through the rotor disk . The spokes of steel which remain form the inductors , and a solid rim of steel is left . To cut down the friction of the // nit ' at the high speed at which the disk is operated , the slots are tilled with a non-magnetic material such as phosphor bronze , finished off smoothly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid zigzag in small straight open slots in the flat face of the stator core , this face being perpendicular to the shaft . Fig. 126a shows a cross section of a part of a small Alexanderson alternator . C is the rotor disk . and A the field windings . The armatures are shown at B , and D the armature conductors , which are carried in laminations , at P. The field flux passes through the iron frame D , the laminated armature , and the disk . The slot filled with nonmagnetic material is shown at F. The usual air gap is 0.015 inch , so that a very slight defect in construction will cause a serious accident . In the radio station at New Brunswick , N. J. , there is an Alexanderson alternator having a rated output of 200 kw generated at a frequency of about 22,100 cycles per second when the alternator is running about 2,170 r.p.m . Similar alterna206 DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINERY . tors are in use at Tuckerton , N. J. , and Marion , Mass . In this alternator the rotor disk runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation . The rotor disk of the type of alternator used at New Brunswick is shown in Fig. 126c ; this rotor weighs about 5,500 pounds . Fig. 126b shows one-half of the armature of an alternator of this type complete and shows the leads from the terminals of circuits embedded in insulation . In this half of the armature there are 32 armature winding , and each circuit generates about 130 volts on open circuit and carries a current of 35 amperes under normal load . In the complete armature there are 64 windings , and the current generated by these 64 windings is collected in an air-core transformer which has 64 independent primary windings , and the single secondary winding delivers the entire output of the alternator . The voltage at the terminals of the secondary winding when the alternator is operated at normal speed is about 2,000 . The construction of the high-frequency alternator requires many refinements in alternator design and very fine workmanship . Since a slight defect may have serious consequences , very careful operation of these alternators is essential . The use of .01WIMMIFIO.OURR.1W. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication is described in Section 173 . For further information regarding the Alexanderson alternator the reader is referred to : E. F. W.

French Designs of High-Frequency Alternators. ? Bethenod and other French engineers have designed high-frequency alternators in which the practical difficulties of making the very small slots are lessened by utilizing several alternators mounted on one shaft to do the work of one , and in each alternator there are placed only a fraction of the needed poles . Thus , if three alternators are used , in passing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one alternator to the next , and two of every three poles are omitted in each alternator . The pole of each alternator is displaced with reference to the corresponding poles of the other two alternators a distance of one-third of the pole pitch . The space left by the missing poles permits placing the coils more easily . Modifications permit simplifications in construction , so that the assembled unit does not really consist of three separate units . A description of this type of alternator is given in a paper by M. Latour , Proceedings Institute Radio Engineers , volume 8 , page 220 , June , 1920 . Two 500 kw alternators of this type are being installed in a new high-power station under construction at Sainte-Assise , near Paris . Goldschmidt Alternator. ? A principle not previously mentioned in connection with electrical machinery is utilized in the generators of certain German high-power stations . Advan tage is taken of the building up of large currents by electrical resonance ( see Sec. 109 ) in the rotor and stator circuits of the machine itself , as well as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stator and rotor windings on each other . These alternators differ from the Alexanderson alternator in that the high frequencies are not directly gen- // crated , but are built up in circuits associated with the alternator , which are often called " reflector circuits . " A very brief description of this type of alternator will be given here . For detailed information the reader is referred to A. N. Goldsmith , Radio Telephony , and to papers which have recently been published in German periodicals devoted to radio communication . ( See also Bureau of Standards Circular 74 , p. 224 . ) Without undertaking to give the proof here , it may be stated that when a rotor is revolved , and at the same time alternating currents are made to flow in the rotor at a frequency corresponding to the speed of rotation and to the number of poles , then , due to these currents , pulsations take place in the strength of the magnetic flux of the machine at double the frequency of the alternating currents . The circuits ( in simplified form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the stator winding , energized by some source of direct current , such as a battery B. In the magnetic field due to the stator there is revolved a rotor , represented by the coil R. // Suppose it is revolved at such a speed teat the alternating emf. induced in R has a frequency of 10,000 cycles per second . By m ay of the slip-rings this emf. is impressed on the circuit which is tuned ( Section 110 ) , so that , when the inductance of 1 ? is taken into account the natural frequency is the same as that of the emf . Then heavy currents will flow in the rotor . According to the statement made above , pulsations will take place in the magnetic flux at the rate of 20,000 per second . These will induce a 20,000-cycle emf. in S. If the inductances and capacities SCILX2 are chosen for resonance at that frequency , large currents will flow in the stator at the same time with the steady current from the battery . These high-frequency currents are prevented from flowing through the battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20,000-cycle pulsation of the magnetic flux in which the rotor revolves , and when the rotor revolves in this pulsating field it gives rise to a triplefrequency emf. ; that is , 30,000 per second in the illustration chosen . The condenser C , has such a capacity that the circuit RC , C5 resonates to that frequency , and the 30,000-cycle currents in the rotor , in view of the rate of rotation of the latter , cause a 40.000-cycle pulsation of magnetic flux with respect to the stator windings . That in turn induces a 40,000-cycle emf. in S. Remembering that the antenna A and the ground G constitute a condenser ( see Sec. 137 ) , which has the same relation to the stator circuit that fir , has to the rotor circuit , it is seen that by proper tuning the circuit SCRAG can be made to resonate at the final frequency . Thus by providing suitable circuits , it is possible to get a frequency four times as great as that corresponding to the actual speed and number of poles of the machine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , that would necessitate extraordinary speeds . Instead , the large generators used in transatlantic service have 360 poles and are driven at 4000 r. p. m. by 250-h. p. motors . The fundamental frequency is therefore 12,000 , which is quadrupled as has just been explained , giving 48,000 at the antenna . To secure satisfactory operation the finest sort of workmanship is necessary in building them . // The Goldschmidt alternator which has just been described has inside of the machine a means for stepping up the frequency . The Goldschmidt machine , in units suitable for highpower stations , usually operates at a speed of about 4,000 r. p. m . An alternator of the Goldschmidt type was formerly in use at Tuckerton , N. J. The use of the Goldschmidt type of machine is at present decreasing . Telefunken Alternator. ? The " Telefunken " type of high-frequency alternator is at present extensively used in Germany , and an alternator of this type was installed at Sayville , Long Island . In the Telefunken type , the device for stepping up the frequency to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the machine , and is somewhat similar to a transformer in construction . Telefunken alternators of a size suitable for use at high-power stations usually operate at a speed of about 1,500 r. p. m. , and this slower speed as compared with the speed of the Goldschmidt machine is an important advantage . For further information regarding the Telefunken alternator and the device for stepping up the frequency which is used with it , see A. N. Goldsmith , " Radio Telephony , " and L. B. Turner , " Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony . " E. Motors . 96 . Uses of D. C. and A. C. Motors. ? It has already been noted that an electric motor is almost identical with a generator in structure , but its function is reversed ; it converts electrical power into mechanical power . It is important to have the motor suited to the kind of circuit on which it is to be used ; a. c. , or d. c. , the right voltage , etc . Common voltages are 110 to 120 ; 220 to 240 ; 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lower voltages are used on battery circuits . A. c. motors , like generators , may be single phase , two phase , three phase , etc. ; and d. c. motors may have series , shunt , or compound excitation . 97 . D. C. Shunt Motor. ? If a shunt generator is used for charging a storage battery and the engine is shut off , the generator will continue running , provided the battery is large enough , but an ammeter in the circuit shows that the current has reversed . The battery is discharging and the generator is running as a motor . The action is explained by the fact that 211 when a current is sent through a conductor in a magnetic field there is a force that tenus to push the conductor across the field ( see Sec. 43 ) . The left-hand rule gives the directions . Consider the simple loop in Fig. 128 , between the poles NS of ' an electromagnet . If the wires + and ? are connected to a source of direct current , the iron will be magnetized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrows in the loop causes a force toward the front in the conductor near the N pole and a force toward the back in the conductor near the S pole . The loop turns . The effect of the commutator is to make the rotation continuous by making the proper connection to the conductors as they come into place . By a line of reasoning very much like that for the d. c. generator , we can pass from this simple case to that of a four-pole drum-wound motor , illustrated in Fig. 129 . The directions of current and rotation are shown by arrows . Limiting Speed. ? It might be expected that a shunt motor would speed up indefinitely , but actually it soon comes to a definite speed , and then continues to turn so fast , but no faster . As soon as the armature begins to rotate , it generates an emf according to the right-hand rule . " This action is exactly the same as in a generator. +  - -  See Section 63 , page 153. // The emf. generated is opposite to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that reason called a " counter electromotive force . " The faster the armature turns the greater the counter emf. becomes . It can not turn so fast that the counter emf. is as great as the line voltage , because then the two would balance ; there would be nothing to make the current flow through the armature , and consequently no pull to keep it turning . For example , suppose the armature resistance of a certain motor is 0.25 ohm , and suppose that a current of 4 amperes in the armature furnishes just enough pull to keep it rotating . If th // coif. 109 volts when the line voltage is 110 , the current is 4 am1 ucres . " Next , suppose the motor is driving machinery that calls for live times as great . a pull . The speed falls off a little . When it has fallen enough to make the counter emf. 105 volts , the current is 20 amperes 23 If that is enough to drive the load , the speed will be steady at the new rate . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes more or less current , but always just enough to drive its load . The magnets are always of the same strength , regardless of load , because the current around them depends only on the line volts and the resistance of the field coils . It is entirely independent of the current in the armature . Comparison of Generator and Motor Actions. ? In both generator and motor we have an emf. developed in the armature by rotation in a magnetic field . Also in both we have currents which cause a pull on the armature conductors . If the machine is to act as a generator , its armature must be driven at such a speed that its emf. is higher than the voltage at its terminals , due to emfs. in other parts of the circuit . Then current flows with the emf . This current causes a back-drag on the armature and makes it harder to turn . If the machine acts as a motor , its emf. is lower than that of the circuit to which it is connected . The currel : flows against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and causes a forward pull on the armature which keeps it turning . Starting Box. ? The resistance of a motor armature is small . The counter emf. developed by rotation is what keeps the current from becoming excessive . When the motor is first connected to the line it is not rotating and there is no counter emf . Some other way must be found to keep the current moderate . The simplest way is to put resistance in series with the armature 24 and then gradually reduce it ( " cut it out " ) as the armature gains speed . The resistance is usually in // the form of wires or grids , mounted in a ventilated iron box , the whole known as a " starting rheostat. " or " starting box . " Various forms are used ; Fig. 130 shows the connections in one type . The parts drawn in solid lines are supported on an insulating face plate , commonly slate . The internal connections are drawn in dashed lines . Fig. 131 shows how the starting box is connected between the fused main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cut out the iron strip K conies against the electromagnet M , and the handle is held in place . If the switch ( Fig. 131 ) is opened , or the line becomes " dead " for any other reason . the magnet ceases to hold K , and a spring S ( Fig. 130 ) pulls the handle back against the butler B , dins protecting the motor against injury in case the current is turned on again . Some starting boxes have tour terminals . The internal connections of one box of that kind are shown in Fig. 132 , and the // connections to the motor in Fig. 133 . The extra terminal is marked L ? . It is needed because the electromagnet for the " no voltage release " is connected directly across the line . the high resistance Z being contained in the box to keep the current for it small . Connections to a starting box must be made according to the way the terminals are marked on the box . They are almost always stamped with letters or with the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but will not always be found at the places shown in Figs. 1.30 and 132 . At the motor the circuits are often brought out on a terminal board after the fashion of Fig. 134 . Care must be taken not to get them confused , for example , by connecting the field in place of the armature , or by making the sort of mistake shown in the right-hand diagram ( marked " wrong " ) of Fig. 134 , where the " A " terminal of the starting box is wrongly connected to the junction of armature and field , and the " ? Line " is wrongly connected to the armature alone . Wrong connections are bound to cause trouble . Starting and Stopping. ? The proper operations for starting are : 1 . See that handle of starting box is in the " off " position . 2 . Close switch ( see Figs. 131 , 133 ) . 3 . Move starting handle to first contact . Armature should begin to turn . If it fails , open the switch at once , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact , blown fuse , excessive overload , wrong brush position , etc. 4 . As armature gains speed , move handle over contacts , one step at a time . Move slowly if load is great , taking if necessary as much as 30 seconds . When the load is slight and the motor small , a few seconds may suffice . The operation for stopping is : Open main switch . In a few seconds the handle should snap back sharply . If it fails , move it back by hand and look for dirty contacts . Sometimes wiping the contact studs and Putting on just a trace of vaseline will cure the trouble . Very small motors , rated at a fraction of a horsepower , are often connected directly to the line without a starting rheostat by simply closing a switch . // Reversing Direction. ? In the diagram ( Fig. 134 ) the mains are marked + and ? . As a matter of fact , it makes no practical difference if the one marked + is really ? , and vice versa . The motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by taking off the two connections at F ( left-hand diagram , Fig. 134 ) and interchanging them . Care must be taken that the brushes rest on the commutator at the right place and point the right way for smooth running , as described in Section 106 . Speed Regulation and Control. ? For reasons given under the heading " Limiting speed " a shunt motor generally runs a little more slowly when loaded ( driving machinery ) than when running free . The change of speed is called the " speed regulation . " For most motors the regulation is good , the change in speed between no load and full load being only 5 per cent or less . Shunt motors are therefore often called " constant speed " motors . This supposes that the voltage applied to the motor is constant . If it is too low , the speed falls off , as well as the power which the motor can develop . If it is too high , the motor will over ' eed somewhat and is likely to overheat and to spark injuriously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , by several methods . Only two will be described . A resistance in series with the armature circuit only ( not the joint line to armature and field ) will reduce the speed . The conductor must be large enough to carry the armature current without overheating . The ordinary starting rheostat will not serve , as it is not made large enough for continuous duty . It would quickly overheat . Sometimes special rheostats are pro218 DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACIHINERY. vided for starting , which are large enough to be left in circuit continuously . They are then usually marked " Regulating rheostat , for continuous duty . " The objection to this scheme is that it wastes power and that , if the load changes , the speed changes , too . It has the advantage of being simple . A resistance in series with the shunt field winding increases the speed . This seems contradictory . The explanation is that when the field current is reduced the magnetism is weakened . The conductors have to move faster to generate about the same counter emf. as before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applied voltage the speed has to increase . The objection to this method is that the motor may overspeed and burst the armature by centrifugal force if too much resistance is used in the field circuit . There is also danger of damaging the commutator by sparking . It is not wise to raise the speed more than 10 or 15 per cent above that marked on the name plate unless the operator is very sure no harm will follow . 9S . D. C. Series Motor . The field coils of a motor may be made of thick wire and connected in series with the armature , so that the same current flows through both . It is then called a " series " motor . The difference in connections , compared with a shunt motor , is the same as for the corresponding kinds of generator . ( See Fig. 117 . ) Series motors differ in their behavior from shunt motors in two important ways . They do not operate at constant speed , but run very much more slowly when heavily loaded ; and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are therefore used on street cars , for cranking gasoline engines on automobiles , and similar duty where high turning effort is wanted for starting a load . Suppose there is some current , say , 5 amperes , flowing in armature and field coils . Now imagine the load to increase until the current is 10 amperes . Two things happen . If the magnetism remained the same , the doubled armature current would cause double the pull . But the magnetism does not remain constant . When the current doubles , the field magnetism increases , because the 10 amperes flow in the field coils as well as in the armature . Thus the doubling of the armature current and the increased magnetization combined make the pull much more than double . Also the stronger field would make the counter emf. // automatically increase if the speed remained unchanged . But this is impossible because the counter emf. must always be a little less than the line voltage , else no current will flow to keep the motor going , so the speed must fall off . The turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation just given , the torque of a series motor at starting is seen to be great , because at starting the speed is low and the armature current large . The less the load , the higher the speed . If the driving belt slips off , a series motor , unless it Is quite small , can overspeed enough to wreck itself . Series motors are therefore direct connected or geared to the driven machinery . Shunt motors , on the contrary , will not overspeed and belts may safely be used . Speed Control. ? The only way of controlling the speed of a series motor that need be mentioned here is by using a rheostat . Except for small motors , one is needed anyway for starting . If large enough it can be left in circuit to keep down the speed . Of course , this is wasteful , because the heat produced in the rheostat uses electrical power . 991 Other D. C. Motors. ? Connected like compound generators ( Fig. 117 ) , compound motors are used for special purposes , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and for that reason they are not treated here z " 100 . Combination A. C. and D. C. Motors . Reversing the current in the line to which a series motor is connected has no effect on the direction in which the armature turns . If the current is reversed in the field coils alone the magnetism is reversed and the armature turns the opposite way . Reversing the current in the armature , too , makes a second reversal of force ; that is , the armature turns as it did at the beginning . This is still true when the reversals are so rapid that the current is truly alternating , so the same motor canbe used for a.c. and d.c . But in that case some special construction is necessary ; for example . the magnets are built up of laminations instead of being in a solid piece . 101 . Alternating Current Motors . Induction Motors. ? When the terminals of any coil are connected to a circuit , the cur- // rent sets up a magnetic field in and around the coil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stationary two-phase or three-phase armature26 and connected to a corresponding two-phase or three-phase power circuit , there comes the remarkable result that the alternating currents flowing in the coils produce inside of the armature a magnetic field which rapidly and continuously revolves . The iron core and the copper coils are both stationary ; only the magnetism changes . If the changes of current are made slowly a compass needle placed in the open space within the armature will spin just as if it were directed by an imaginary magnet with its poles sliding along the face of the armature . Next , let an iron core with suitable coils on it be placed inside this armature , on a shaft , so that it can turn . The revolving magnetic field cuts across the conductors of this movable " rotor " ; that sets up etufs. ; currents flow , and now we have conductors with currents in them in a magnetic field . Consequently the rotor begins to turn . It speeds up until it turns nearly as fast as the moving magnetic field . How fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the frequency ( cycles per second ) of the alternating current supplied . The machine just described is an " induction " motor . " Its parts are called the stator ( stationary part ) and rotor ( part that revolves ) just as in an alternator . Nothing has been said about any connection between the rotor and an external electric circuit . In the simplest form of induction motor there is no such connection . The rotor is dragged around magnetically at a practically constant speed . A pulley on the rotor shaft can be used with a belt to deliver power to some other machine . An induction motor can be considered to be a particular kind of a. c. transformer in which the secondary winding and the secondary core are allowed to revolve with respect to the primary , and the secondary winding is short circuited . In the transformer the position of the secondary is fixed , and the emf. induced in the secondary winding causes a current to flow // which delivers electric power in the secondary circuit . In the induction motor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow in the short-circuited secondary winding , and I his secondary current causes the secondary to revolve and deliver mechanical power . In some forms of induction motor there are connections between the rotor , which in that case has slip-rings , and an external circuit . But the external circuit is not a power circuit ; it merely consists of resistances for controlling the motor speed . The terms " squirrel cage " and " wound " are often used to describe rotors ; the first means the simple kind with conductors of plain bars of metal and no slip-rings or other moving contacts ; the second means the kind having coils like an armature , and , commonly , slip-rings . If one of the connections to a three-phase induction motor is opened , leaving only two attached , the rotor continues to turn . Two wires can supply only a simple a. c. ( single phase ) , so it is evident that an induction motor can be used on a single phase circuit . But it will not start on a single phase without a special starter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be operated at about the voltage for which they were built . In addition , they have to be connected to a line of the right frequency . Then they run at certain definite speeds , which are nearly as high at full load as when running free . On 60-cycle circuits the common speeds for small motors are a little under 1800 , 1200 , and 900 r. p. in . Starting. ? Small induction motors are started by simply connecting them to the right kind of power circuit by a switch , double-pole ( two blades , for two wires ) for single phase , threepole for three-phase , and four-pole for two-phase motors . With polyphase ( two or three phase ) motors , this produces the revolving magnetic field as previously explained . , With single phase the action is different . It was said , earlier in this section , that an induction motor will not start on one phase , but continue if started somehow . One way might be to give it a start by hand . Generally , that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " phase splitter . " That merely weans that the current goes through the stator by two paths in parallel , one having more inductance or capacity than the other . Inductance in any branch of a circuit causes a phase-lag in that // branch . The armature must have two sets of coils , and if the currents in them differ as to phase , the motor starts as a sort of two-phase machine . After it gets up to speed . one winding ( the " starting " winding ) is disconnected . That may be done by hand , a special two-way switch being provided with a starting and a running position or there may be an automatic centrifugal cut-out in the motor . " A third way is by " repulsion motor " action . Then the rotor has a commutator and brushes , like those for d. c . The stator is connected to the supply line , the rotor is not . The brushes are connected together by a short-circuiting conductor . When currents flow in the stator , other currents are induced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper speed , a centrifugal device short-circuits the commutator and so converts the machine into a simple induction motor . At the same time , the brushes are lifted automatically , to reduce friction . Larger three-phase motors are started by applying a fraction of full voltage , obtained by a combined transformer and doublethrow switch known as a " compensator . " ' " Synchronous rotor ? In Sections 73 and 74 there have been described briefly several forms of alternators , and their use as generators of alternating current . If two alternators of identical construction are driven at the same speed , they may be connected in parallel to supply the same distributing line . If now the supply of mechanical power to one alternator is cut off , as by slipping off the belt , that alternator will usually continue to operate as a motor , taking power from the other alternator . An alternator operating as a motor in this way is called a " synchronous motor , " and may be either single phase or polyphase . It is not at all necessary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generator supplying it ; a number of // smell synchronous motors can be driven by one large generator . Synchronous motors are much less used in practice than induct ion motors . Synchronous motors of large sine have particular applications . The single-phase synchronous motor will not start itself , except by the use of special starting devices , some of which are similar to those ' described for starting the singlephase induction motor . The synchronous motor must operate it exactly the frequency of its supply , and if it falls out of step for any reason it will usually stop . The synchronous motor must operate at the same speed at any load , while the speed of I lie induction motor varies with the load . By adding a commutator to the synchronous motor it becomes a " synchronous converter " or " rotary converter . " ( See Sec. 103 . ) The construeion of one kind of synchronous motor is shown in Fig. 97 , page 157 . For further information see A. S. McAllister , Alternating Current Motors . F. Motor Generators and Dynamotors. 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , but not in the form needed , the change is made by transformers , 31 rectifiers , motor generators or dynamotors , according to circumstances . The first named change a. c. at one voltage to a. c. at : mother voltage at the same frequency . The second change a. c. to pulsating d. c . The last two are used for changing a. c. at one frequency to a. c. at another frequency or to steady d. e. , or the reverse ; also for changing d. c. from one voltage to another . The most easily understood way to make the change is by the use of a suitable combination of motor and generator , built for the same speed and mounted on a common base , the shafts being coupled together . Such a combination is a " motor generator . " Motors and generators have been described . The combination brings no new ideas . Each part can be thought of by itself , without regard to the other . Examples of such machines have been given 3z In radio practice they are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc circuits . Battery Charging. ? Motor generators for battery charging are used where the supply is a.c. , or d.c. at 6e wrong voltage . In the latter case if the d.c. voltage is too hiigh , a rheostat may be // used , but it wastes power . When several low-voltage batteries have to be charged , they may be connected in series and the power wasted in resistance thereby reduced . The generator of a battery charging unit is usually shuntwound . The voltage of a storage battery rises as it gets charged . Also , at the beginning it is allowable to use a larger current than toward the end of the charge . The voltage of a shunt generator is lower when it is delivering a large current than when the current is small . " Therefore such a generator , connected to a discharged battery and given the proper setting , produces a large current which gradually decreases as the battery voltage rises . It is also possible to use a compound generator , so designed that the voltage is substantially constant , whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the initial rate of charging the battery is higher than when a shunt generator is used , but falls off in the same way . A high rate of charging at the beginning cuts down the time required for the whole process , and is therefore desirable , provided it does not injure the battery . Modern portable batteries will stand charging in this way and compound generators may consequently be used . The proper treatment for a given battery must be learned from instructions pertaining to that particular form . Motor generators are used also for connection to ordinary lighting circuits ( about 110 volts ) to get 500 or 600 voits d.c. for are transmitters , " or for connection to such circuits or to low voltage storage batteries to get a.e . at 500 to 900 cycles for use with transformers in audio-frequency spark transmitters.3 ' Motor generators may also be used for supplying 300 or more volts to the plates of electron tubes used for generating undamped alternating currents of radio frequency . ( See pages 491 , 49S . ) Such alternators and motor generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If connections are made to a pair of collector rings from opposite sides of a two-pole d.c. armature , it will generate alternating current . At the same time , direct current can be taken from the commutator . In that case the ma- // chine is a " double current generator . " If not driven by an engine , but connected to a d.c. circuit , it operates as a shunt motor and can be used to generate a.c . Operated on a.c. as a motor , it delivers d.c . When used for such conversion it is called a rotary converter . When an a.c. generator is used as a synchronous motor ( not an induction motor ) it requires d.c. for field excitation and operates at the exact speed ( called " synchronous " speed ) , corresponding to the frequency of the supply . The d.c. for the rotary converter field comes from the commutator . On the other hand , when such a converter is used to generate a.c. , the frequency depends on the speed of rotation of the armature , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a rotary converter is used in this way for converting direct current into alternating current , it is said to be operated as an " inverted rotary . " The rotary converter has the advantage of accomplishing in a single machine what the motor-generator does in two . Its disadvantage is that the voltage at the generator end depends entirely on the voltage supplied to it as a motor , the effective value of the a.c. voltage in the case of a single-phase converter being about 71 per cent of the d.c. voltage , slightly more or less , depending on the direction of the conversion . Thus , if operated on a 10-volt storage battery , it would give about 7 volts a.c . In radio communication it is desirable to have a machine which will deliver a.c. of a frequency of 500 cycles when supplied with d.c. from a storage battery . Small rotary converters can not be designed to supply a.c. of a frequency anywhere near as high as 500 cycles . Either the speed or the number of commutator segments would have to be increased beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built for two-phase or three-phase currents , the former by four connections equally spaced on the armature and four rings , the latter by three connections and three collector rings . The statements made for bipolar machines are equally true for multipolar rotary converters , if it is understood that each ring has as many connections to the armature as there are pairs of poles . The rotary converter , or " synchronous converter , " is really a synchronous motor to which a commutator has been added , but the design of rotary converters requires a number of modifications from synchronous motor design . In external appear226 DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINERY . once a polyphase rotary converter resembles a direct-current generator with a conspicuously large commutator and an auxiliary set of collector rings . 104 . Dynamotors. ? Rotary converters can not be used for changing direct current at one voltage to d.c. at another voltage . The most compact machine for that purpose is the " dynamotor . " An application which will occur to the radio student is the securing from batteries giving only 10 or 12 volts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential of electron tubes used as generators of radio-frequency alternating current . ( See Fig. 135 . ) In the dynamotor two separate armature windings are placed on a common core . One acts as a motor , the other as a generator . There is but one frame and // one set of field magnets . The two windings are connected to commutators at opposite ends of the shaft . The ratio of voltages is fixed when the machine is built , so the output voltage depends on the voltage applied . The field coils receive current from the same source as the motor armature. 105 . Double-Current Generators. ? A dynamotor can be driven by mechanical power as a generator , and can then deliver d. c. at two different voltages . Such machines have been designed for fan drive on airplanes , the low and high voltages being used for the filament and plate currents , respectively , of electron tube transmitters . To get constant voltages , in spite of the varying speed at which the armature is driven , the field flux must be weakened as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent around the field coils , supplying the main magnetization . A weaker current from the other commutator is sent around the opposite way , giving a differential effect . ( Fig. 136.1 If the speed rises , and consequently the voltage , the current in the second winding is made to increase considerably by a sensitive automatic regulator . The flux is therefore reduced , counteracting the effect of the rise in speed . 106 . Common Troubles. ? Electrical machinery is subject to the same troubles as other machinery , such as rough , gritty , dry or tight bearings , bad alignment , sprung shaft , etc .. which show themselves by , heating , taking excessive power , and vibration . The bearings must be clean and smooth . Care must be taken never to spring or jam the shaft . There must always be enough oil of good quality in the oil wells to keep the bearings thoroughly lubricated . Most generators and motors are oiled by means of brass rings that ride on the shaft and dip into the oil and carry it up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine apart ; then they do not turn properly ; the bearing runs dry and heats . Some machines have ball bearings . They should run very easily , but are subject to the same troubles as a bicycle bearing , such as broken balls , grit , adjustment too tight . In general if a bearing gets too hot to be borne with the hand , it needs attention ; the trouble is likely to grow worse , until finally the shaft binds firmly and can not be turned . The job // of getting it free again may then be a very tedious and troublesome one . Another point of friction is at the brushes . If they are pressed in too firmly . they rub harder than necessary . They should be fitted smoothly so as to give the full area of electrical contact , then excessive pressure will not be needed . They should be only tight enough to make good contact and prevent sparking or flashing . When carbon brushes are working properly , the metal surface on which they rub becomes finely polished , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of copper commutators on direct current machines . Besides those of a mechanical nature there may be electrical troubles , some requiring expert attention , others easily found and cured . The most common electrical troubles are caused by loose , wrong , or missing connections , and dirt . Connections ( usually accidental ) that allow current to pass by a piece of apparatus , instead of flowing through it , are called " short circuits . " They are a common source of trouble . A systematic way of hunting troubles is as follows : 1 . Make or find a circuit diagram , unless you are thoroughly familiar with the connections and are positive they are right . In drawing diagrams follow each branch of the circuit from the source ( +terminal of battery or generator armature ) completely around ( through the ? terminal ) to the place of beginning . Remember that no current will flow in a circuit or in any part of a circuit unless there is a difference of potential in it . 2 . Trace the wiring according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) Fuses are good , if any are in circuit . ( b ) Connections are clean and good . ( c ) Contact is not prevented by insulating caps of binding posts or insulation of wire . ( d ) Wires do not touch , making short circuits . ( e ) There are no extra wires or connections . ( t ) There are no breaks in wire inside of the insulation . This occasionally happens with old lamp cord . The broken place is very limber , and can be pulled iii two more readily than a sound place . 4 . Look for defects in the apparatus itself . // In a generator , besides loose connections , electrical troubles easily remedied are , for d.c. : 5 . Failure to generate emf. , caused by ( a ) Brushes not in the right place . On nearly all d.c. generators of reasonably modern construction , the proper position for the brushes on the commutator is nearly opposite the middle of the field poles , or slightly forward ( in the direction of rotation ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that which gives sparkless commutation . Brushes are set right at the factory , and should be left as they are , unless there is good reason to believe that they have since been shifted . ( b ) Brushes not making good contact because of bad fit or too little pressure . Test by lifting them slightly , one by one , to detect loose springs ; also try pressing brushes to commutator with dry stick . Remedy by working fine sandpaper back and forth , sharp side out , between commutator and brush ( holding it in such a way that the toe of the brush is not ground off ) or by tightening brush springs , as needed . Brushes are designed , either to press against the commutator squarely , pointing toward the center of the shaft , or , more commonly , to trail somewhat as an ordinary paint brush might trail if held against the commutator . However , there is also in very satisfactory use a form of holder by which the brushes are held pointing against the direction of rotation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pressed against a smooth face of brass by springs . ( c ) Field connections reversed . 6 . Sparking , when caused by ( a ) Roughened commutator ; cured by holding fine sandpaper ( not emery ) against it while running . ( b ) Brushes shifted ; for remedy see 5 , above . It is very important that all brushes be at the proper points . This means , for example , that if the brushes are supposed to touch at four points , spaced a quarter way around the commutator , they shall actually be exactly a quarter of a circumference apart , as tested by fine marks on a strip of paper held against the commutator . 7 . Heating of commutator due to brush friction . Reduce tension of springs . // In a. c. generators look for S. Loose connections and bad contacts at brushes . Position of brushes on rings is immaterial , as there is no commutation . In d. c. shunt motors , motor-generators , or dynamotors , the simple troubles are : 9 . Failure to start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrong connections . ( See Sec. 97. ) 10 . Sparking , caused by excessive load or wrong brush position . ( See 5 and 6 above . ) The proper position for motor brushes is slightly backward ( against the direction of rotation ) of the center of the field poles . CHAPTER 3 . RADIO CIRCUITS . A. Simple Radio Circuits . 107 . The Simplicity of Radio Theory. ? The principles of alternating currents developed in Chapter 1 are applicable to radio circuits . Radio currents are merely very high frequency alternating currents . The fundamental ideas of sine waves ( Sec. 50 ) apply to what are known as continuous or " undamped waves . " " Damped waves " also behave in many ways like sine waves ; for some purposes slight modifications of the sine wave theory are needed . These are treated in Part B below . The frequencies of alternation of radio currents are very high . Ordinary alternating current power circuits use frequencies from 25 to 60 cycles per second . The lowest radio frequencies , however , lie above some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put at perhaps 300,000,000 cycles per second . Such an enormous difference in frequency should naturally give rise to some differences in the behavior of radio circuits as distinguished from low-frequency alternating current circuits . In low-frequency a.c. circuits the principal opposition to the flow of currents through the wires connecting the various machines and other parts of the circuit is the resistance of the wires . It is only in unusual cases that the inductance and capacity of the connecting wires requires consideration in low-frequency a. c. circuits , although the inductance of the windings of generators , motors , and transformers is important . The inductance and capacity of every part of a radio circuit are usually of much more importance than the resistance . The reactance of such small inductances as are provided by a few turns of wire is of importance , and condensers whose small capacity would very effectually prevent the flow of ordinary alternating currents readily allow the passage of radio currents . The mutual inductance effect of one circuit on another is much greater , when radio frequencies are used , than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The enormous frequencies used in radio work give rise also to much larger skin effect ( see Sec. 117 , p. 263 ) , eddy currents , and dielectie losses than would be the case if the same circuit were worked at low frequency . Furthermore , measuring instruments commonly used for alternating current work are , for the most part , unsuitable for use in radio circuits , or require modified methods of connection . Instruments whose indications depend upon the heating effect ( Section 59 ) are , in general , suitable for radio work . Direct current instruments may also be used . but in connection with rectifying devices . The telephone receiver , so useful in low frequency work . requires a rectifier also . At low frequencies the diaphragm of the receiver vibrates with the current , giving an audible singing note of the same frequency as the alternating current . Radio currents execute their changes , however , altogether too quickly to he followed by the telephone directly , and even were it possible for the diaphragm to vibrate so rapidly , the sound produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ear . It is found to be necessary , therefore , to break up the radio currents into groups of rectified waves . Each group gives a single impulse to the diaphragm , and if the impulses follow regularly with sufficient rapidity a musical note is produced . 105 . The Simple Series Circuit. ? The simplest form of radio circuit is one having resistance , inductance , and capacity ii series , as in Fig. 137 . An alternating emf. is supposed to be applied at E. // In Chapter 1 , Section 57 , page 127 , it has been shown that the Nailue of the current produced in a circuit , to which an altertinting emf. is applied . may be calculated by the equation . emf . Current= impedance . If the effective value of the emf. is used here , the equation gives the effective value of the current . ( Sec. : 1i , p. 118 . ) The impedance Z depends not only on the resistance R. hut on the reactance X of the circuit as well . ( Secs . 55 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' / ? 2=P ' +X2 ( 69 ) That is , the square of the impedance is found by adding the squares of the resistance and the reactance . The impedance can therefore never be less than the resistance , and may be very - ouch greater . If the resistance in the circuit is very small in comparison with the reactance , the impedance is practically equal to the reactance . The impedance is measured in ohms . As has been pointed out ( Sec. 49 ) , the reactance is the opposition offered to the current by an inductance or a capacity . The reactance. in ohms , of an inductance coil is equal to 27r times the frequency , times the inductance in henries . For a capacity , the reactance , in ohms , is equal to 2 1 ( Sec. 56 ) , iii which f is the frequency and C is the capacity in farads . In their reactive effects an inductance and a capacity tend to offset one another , so that the total reactance of an inductive coil and a condenser in series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is general practice to use the symbol w to represent 27r times the frequency ( 27rf ) , since the quantity 27rf very frequently occurs in problems involving radio circuits . ( See Circular 74 , p. 22 . ) Using this abbreviation , the reactance of an inductance may be written wL , and the reactance of a capacity may be written // Example .  --  Let us calculate the reactance of the combination of a coil of 500 microhenries inductance in series with a condenser of 0.005 microfarad capacity at several different frequencies . The table shows at a glance that the reactance of the coil is small at low frequencies , increases as the frequency rises ; and becomes very considerable at the higher frequencies , such as occur in radio work . The behavior of the condenser is just the reverse . At the lowest frequency it offers a very large reactance , but at radio frequencies the impedance is vastly smaller . For very high frequencies the reactance would be negligible . In most radio circuits the resistance of the circuit can be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that only in the case of the 100,000 cycles , in the table , would it be necessary to take account of the resistance in calculating the impedance . For example , if R=5 ohms , the impedance for the frequencies in the table above will have the values 530,000 , 31,837 , 6.5 , 5 and 3110 , respectively . In : ill except the third and fourth cases , the difference between the reactance and the impedance is less than one part in a million of the total . It is thus apparent that ill many cases the impedance of a circuit depends almost entirely on the reactance of the circuit . Only in those cases where the reactance is small is it necessary to take the resistance into account . 109 . Series Resonance. ? It would seem at first sight , then , that radio circuits would offer for the most part a high impedance and that therefore very little current could flow , except with very large milt . This is in general true of any radio circuit if the frequency be taken at random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency , the reactance of the cirSERIES // cult may be made zero . This is at once evident , when we remember that the inductive reactance increases with the frequency , while the capacitive reactance diminishes . At some definite frequency , then , the inductive reactance of the coil must have the same value as the capacitive reactance of the condenser , and since they act against each other , the total reactance will be zero . This may be shown graphically . In Fig. 138 are plotted the curves A and B of the reactances of the coil and condenser , respectively , of the previous example . Frequencies are measured along the horizontal axis and reactances along the vertical axis . The reactances of curve B are taken as negative to distinguish between the opposing effects of the inductive and capacitive reactances . Curve C is obtained by taking the algebraic sum of the reactances of curves A and B. It is the curve of resultant reactance in the circuit . For the particular values of C and L chosen in this example , the circuit acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of slightly above 100,000 cycles , while below that point it has the character of a capacitive reactance . Furthermore for only a narrow range of frequencies , 99,000 to 103,000. perhaps , the reactance of the circuit is less than 10 ohms . For most frequencies the reactance is much greater than this . The frequency which makes the capacitive and inductive reactances equal is called the " resonance frequency " of the circuit , and the circuit is said to be in " resonance , " or to be " tuned " to the frequency in question . It is important to be able to calculate the frequency for resonance . To do so , the condition must be fulfilled , that Applying this relation to the example under discussion , and substituting therein L=0.0005 henry , C=109 farad , the resonance frequency is found to be about 100,700 cycles per second . The reactances of both the coil and the condenser at this fregERIES // quency it re the same and have the value 316.2 ohms . This value may of course , be calculated by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expressions 2irfL or 2 f ( . It is of Interest Io note that each of these expressions for reactance red urea simply to when the frequency has the resonance value . There exists , then , for any series circuit containing inductance and capacity a definite value of the frequency , for which the total reactance in the circuit is zero , and the impedance. is simply equal to the resistance of the circuit . This frequency is called the resonance frequency , and the circuit is said to he in a condition of resonance . The impedance has its smallest value , and the current which flows in the circuit when the applied emf. has any value whatever has the largest value possible with that value of frequency . These facts may be readily verified experimentally by inserting in a simple radio circuit a suitable ammeter for measuring the eau ? rent . If now the frequency of the applied emf. is gradual ) y raised , the current will at first be small and will increase very slowly as the frequency is increased . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to increase rapidly for small changes of frequency , and after passing through a maximum will rapidly decrease again as the frequency is raised to still higher values . The results of such an experiment may be shown by a curve in which frequencies are measured in the horizontal direction , while the values of the current corresponding are plotted vertically . Since most instruments suitable for measuring radio currents give deflections proportional to the square of the current , it is customary to plot the squares of the current , or the deflections of the instrument , rather than the current itself . Such " resonance curves " are plotted in Fig. 139 , and they show plainly the " resonance peak " of another circuit having different constants . ( See p. 241 . ) On account of its great importance in radio work the phenomenon of resonance requires further study . To fix our ideas , let us suppose that a circuit whose inductance and capacity have the values already chosen in the previous example ( 500 // microhenries , 0.005 microfarad ) has a resistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied in the circuit . The maximum possible value of the current is found by dividing the applied voltage by the resistance , which gives 2 amperes . This current will flow when the frequency has the critical value of 100,700 cycles per second . To study the distribution of emf. over the different parts of the circuit we have to remember ( Sec. 55 ) that the emf. between any two points of the circuit has to have a value equal to the product of the current by the impedance between the two points . Accordingly the emf. between the ends of the resistance is 2X5=10 volts , that on the coil is 2X316.23=632.46 volts , and the same emf. is found between the terminals of the condenser also . The existence of such a large voltage on both the coil and the condenser explains how it is possible to obtain such a relatively large current through the large reactances of the coil and condenser . The small applied voltage is employed only in keeping the current flowing against the resistance of the circuit , not for driving the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the large voltages on coil and condenser , it must be remembered , as was shown in Section 57 , that when a current is flowing through an inductance and capacity in series the emf. on the inductance opposes that on the capacity at every moment . The sum of the voltages on the two is therefore found by subtracting their individual values . Since at the resonance frequency the emf. on the inductance has the same value as the emf. on the capacity , the emf. between the terminals of the two in series is therefore zero . Energy is supplied to the circuit by the source at a rate which may be determined ( when the resonance condition has been established ) by simply multiplying the emf. by the current . ( Sec. 55 , p. 123 . ) That is , in the present instance the power is 10X2=20 watts . The power dissipated in heat in the resistance may be calculated by taking the product of the resistance by the square of the current . ( See . 51 . ) In this case it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the circuit at just the right rate to make good the energy dissipated in heat in the resistance . After the current has reached the final effective value ( 2 amperes in this case ) no further energy is supplied to the coil or condenser by the source . but their // energy is simply transferred back and forth from one to the other without loss or gain in the total amount , nor is any outaide agency necessary to maintain this condition . In the above discussion of a simple series circuit , consisting of a resistance , an inductance , and a capacity in series , it has been assumed that the inductance coil was a pure inductance and that the capacity was a pure capacity ? that is , that neither had any resistance and that the entire resistance of the circuit was concentrated in the resistance unit . In actual practice these ideal conditions can not be absolutely realized , although they may be very closely approximated . The inductance coil necessarily has a certain amount of resistance in which energy Is dissipated as heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inductance coil . The insulating material between the plates of the condenser constituting the capacity is not an absolutely perfect nonconductor , but allows a certain very small leakage current to flow , resulting in a small loss of energy as heat . There are also other sources of energy loss in condensers.a The effect of these energy losses in the condenser Is equivalent to introducing additional resistance into the circuit . With suitable design , the energy losses in both inductance coils and in condensers may be made very small . Mechanical Example of Resonance. ? Many mechanical example of resonance might be cited . It is a well-known fact that the order to " break step " is often given to a company of soldiers about to pass over a bridge . Neglect of this precaution has sometimes resulted in such violent vibrations of the bridge as to endanger it . This is especially the case with certain short suspension bridges . When a shock is given to a bridge it vibrates , and the frequency of the vibrations ? that is , the number of vibrations per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever the source of the shock . The frequency of vibration is analogous to the resonance frequency of the circuit . For if an impulse he applied to the bridge at regular intervals , tuned so that the number of impulses per second is exactly equal to the number of // vibrations natural to the bridge in the same time , violent vibrations may be set up , although the individual impulses may be small . In fact , when the bridge is thus vibrating the impulses need to have only just force enough to overcome the frictional forces and thus keep the vibrations from dying away . The much greater forces involved in the vibrations themselves correspond to the large voltages acting on the coil and condenser . The voltage on the condenser is of the same nature as the large forces which exist in the beams of the bridge when they are stretched , while the voltage on the coil corresponds to the very considerable nromentum of the moving bridge . The small force of the impulses given the bridge corresponds to the small applied emf. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become so violent as to rupture it , it means that the beams have been stretched beyond their breaking point . Similarly the dielectric of the condenser may be broken by the emf. existing between its terminals in cases where the resonance current is too large . 110 . Tuning the Circuit to Resonance. ? The practical importance of resonance lies in the fact that it enables the impedance of a circuit to be made equal to the resistance alone . It must be remembered that the reactance of the small inductances in the circuit , which are unavoidable , becomes important at radio frequencies and may often be much greater than the resistance . This fact . taken in connection with the smallness of the emf. of incoming signals , would make it impossible to obtain any but minute currents in the receiving apparatus with inductance alone in the circuit . From this standpoint , the sole function of the tuning of the circuit to resonance is to offset the inductive reactance by an equal capacitive reactance , so that the impedance may be made as small as the resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways ( a ) By adjusting the frequency of the applied emf. ( b ) By varying the capacity in the circuit . ( e ) By varying the inductance in the circuit . Of these , the first case has already been treated , the other two find application in receiving circuits where the frequency of the incoming waves is beyond the control of the operator , in the use of coupled circuits and in the adjustment of the frequency of the waves emitted in certain methods of sending . // The possibility of tuning a circuit is of course not confined to radio- circuits . but is present also with ordinary alternating current circuits , and is becoming common in telephone work . however , at low frequencies the values of the inductance and capacity involved are relatively great , so as to make it inconvenient to vary their values in steps sufficiently small . F'urthermore , in low-frequency work the reactances of the coils likely to occur in the circuit are small , and the large quantities of power involved render the use of condensers relatively uncommon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , are relatively small , and the construction of coils of continuously variable inductance ( " variometers " or variable inductors ) and of apparatus of variable capacity ( vari , able condensers ) offers no particular difficulties . Prom formula ( 71 ) it appears that it is the product of the Inductance and capacity , rather than their actual values , which determine the resonance frequency . To tune a circuit to a given frequency , the inductance may be large or small , provided only that the capacity may be so adjusted that the product of inductance and capacity shall have the value correspondbig to the frequency assumed . ( A table showing these variations with the product of inductance and capacity is given in Appendix 5 , p. 557. ) 111 . Resonance Curves. ? A resonance curve is a curve which shows the changes of current in a circuit , when changes are made which cause the resonance condition to be somewhat departed from . For example , the current ( or square of the current ) may he plotted for different values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or , the curve may show the change in current , when the capacity ( or Inductance ) is somewhat raised and lowered with respect to the Value which holds for the condition of resonance . Such curves are often determined experimentally , in whole or in part , on account of their value in calculating the damping of the circuit . ( Tamping is treated in Sec. 116 below . ) Such , for example , are the curves of Fig. 139 , in which are plotted the values of the current squared , to an arbitrary scale , for different values of the capacity of the variable condenser . The inductance of the circuit was fixed at the value 377 microhenries . Three different curves were determined with the re242 1tADI0 CIRCUITS . sistance in the circuit fixed at the values 4.4 , 9.4 , and 14.4 ohms , respectively . Sharpness of Resonance. ? It was , of course , to be expected that the value of the current at resonance ( height of the peak ) , should be greater , the smaller the resistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sharpness of the curve with the smallest resistance and to the flatness of the curve with greatest resistance . This is the characteristic of resonance curves in general , and is a necessary consequence of the equations for the impedance . It may be shown still more clearly , if the scales to which the three curves are plotted are so altered that the peaks of the three curves have the same height . This has been done in Fig. 140 , page 23G . The same results may be seen by calculating the square of the impedance with different settings of the condenser and with different resistances in the circuit . The resonance frequency in this case was 169,100 cycles per second , which shows that with the inductance of 377 microhenries the setting of the condenser at resonance is almost exactly 2,350 mieromicrofarads . The reactance of condenser and coil at this frequency is 400.56 ohms in each case . The following table shows the impedances for three different settings of the condenser when the resistance of the circuit has the three values corresponding to those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , less in proportion as the squares of the impedances are greater . For the smallest resistance , the square of the current is about 4.7 times as great at resonance as when the capacity Is changed by 50 micromicrofarads in either direction . For 9.4 ohms circuit the ratio is about 1.8 , and for the largest resistance only about 1.35 . These calculated ratios agree very well with the experimental values . The close connection of the shape of // the resonance curve with its resistance points to the possibility of ralrulating the total resistance in the circuit from measurements of the resonance curve . For this method of measuring radio resistance see Circular 74 of the Bureau of Standards , Sections 49 and 50 . The calculations here given , as well as an inspection of the curves of Fig. 139 , show that the resonance curve is not symmetrical . That is , the current has not the same value when the capacity is a certain amount less than the resonance value that It has when the value of the capacity is greater by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is treated in the next section . Hyinmetry of Resonance Curves. ? The curves of Fig. 138 show the changes of coil reactance , curve A , and condenser reactance , curve B , together with the total reactance , curve C ( their show the changes of coil reactance , curve A , and condenser reactance , curve B , together with the total reactance , curve C ( their Its zero value ( point Z , Fig. 138 ) . The resonance peak ( Fig. 139 ) is , therefore , unsymmetrical also . That is , the current is not the same for two frequencies , one slightly higher than the resonance frequency , and the other the same number of cycles lower than the resonance frequency . The explanation is found In the shape of the curve of condenser reactance . The same lack of symmetry exists when the inductance and the frequency are held constant and the capacity is varied to obtain resonance , because the shape of the curve of condenser reactance in this case is the same as in the preceding . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resonance condition is reached by varying the inductance , a symmetrical resonance peak is obtained ; equal changes of the inductance above and below the setting for resonance will cause the current to fall to the same value . The difference of this case from the two preceding lies in the fact that curves of condenser and coil reactance and hence of total reactance are here straight lines . To summarize , then , the resonance curve is symmetrical when the tuning is accomplished by varying the inductance ( C and f constant ) , but is not symmetrical in the two other methods of tuning , viz , by varying the capacity ( L and f constant ) or by varying the frequency ( C and L constant ) . // 112 . The Wavemeter. ? The phenomenon of resonance enables one to obtain relatively large currents in a circuit to which only a small emf. is applied , provided only that the circuit is properly tuned . To determine when the condition for resonance is realized with a given frequency in a given circuit , or to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in resonance , use is made of the " Wavemeter . " This is the most important instrument used in radio measurements . It consists essentially of a series circuit , which includes an inductance and a capacity , both of which are of known values . Either the inductance or the capacity may be of fixed value , while the other will be variable . A hot-wire ammeter , thermo-junction , or other suitable device for measuring radio currents is inserted , either directly into the circuit ( Fig. 141 ) , or , better , is coupled electromagnetically to it , the coupling being made as loose ( Sec. 119 ) as will permit of a suitable maximum deflection of the ammeter ( Fig. 142 ) . If the frequency of the current in a given circuit is to be measured . the coil of the Wavemeter circuit is placed near the circuit in question and the capacity of the wavemeter is varied until the indicating device shows that the current in the wavemeter circuit is a maximum . In making the final adjustment the Wavemeter coil should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question as is possible and yet provide a convenient maximuiu detlection of the current-indicating device . I ' ruin the known value L of inductance of the wavemeter coil unil the capacity Cr , corresponding to the setting of the condenser at resonance , the desired frequency may be calculated rrom equation ( 72 ) , which gives f=27T'LC ( 72 ) v r What is generally desired , however , is not so much the frequency as the wave length ( Sec. 125 ) of the electromagnetic waves radiated by the circuit . The wave length A is connected with the frequency f by the fundamental relation =f ( 73 ) in which e is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in space and has the value of 300,000,000 meters per second . Expressing Cr in microfaradas and L in microhenries , as is commonly convenient , the fundamental wavemeter equation giving the wave length in meters is a=1884 AC , ( 74 ) For example , if L=1000 microhenries and Cr=0.001 microfarad , the wave length emitted by the circuit is 1884 meters . A wavemeter is usually provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which oscillations may be set up in the wavemeter circuit . These will have a wave length which may be calculated by equation ( 74 ) from the inductance and capacity of the wavemeter circuit . By coupling any desired circuit with the wavemeter circuit an emf. is introduced into the former , when the buzzer is working , the frequency of which is the same as that existing in the wavemeter circuit . This frequency may be calculated by ( 74 ) from the known inductance of the wavemeter coil and the capacity corresponding to the setting of the condenser . If , further , it is desired to tune the circuit in question to the frequency emitted by the wavemeter circuit , it is only necessary to connect a detector and telephones in the circuit to be tuned , to cause the wavemeter to emit waves , and to vary the capacity or inductance of // the circuit to be adjusted , until the sound of the buzzer in the telephones is a maximum . 113 . Parallel Resonance. ? In the preceding sections it has been shown how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given applied emf . The principle of resonance , utilized for this purpose , finds application also in the solution of the reverse problem of keeping currents of a certain frequency out of any chosen part of a circuit without , however , preventing the passage of currents of other frequencies . To such an arrangement is given the appropriate name of a " filter . " A filter consists essentially of an inductance coil , joined in paralled with a condenser . This combination is interposed between the emf. in question and that portion of the circuit from which the undesirable currents are to be excluded . Any such combination of inductance and capacity , taken at random , will oppose currents of a single frequency only , whose value depends principally on the values of the inductance and capacity . To render such an arrangement effective against currents of a certain chosen frequency it is necessary to adjust the capacity and inductance to have a definite relation . The solution of this problem requires a knowledge of the principles of " parallel resonance . " Fig. 143 shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel with a condenser of capacity C. The current I flows from the alternating source of emf . E through the main circuit , and at the branch point divides , a part It flowing through the coil and the remainder I. through the condenser . At every moment the current I has a value which is the algebraic sum of the values of It and le existing that same moment . Let us suppose , first , that the emf . E has a definite frequency , and that the inductance of the coil is invariable . Current-measuring instruments may be arranged to measure the three currents . If the capacity is varied continuously and the indications of the ammeters recorded , the following experimental facts will be observed . In general , the currents in the coil and condenser will be unequal , and the current I may be less than either . As the . capacity is varied , the currents in the coil and condenser may be made to approach equality , and at the same time the main current will decrease . At length , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current will reach a very small minimum a I ue , while the current in the coil and the condenser current tire nearly equal . Further , each is many times larger than the main current . As the capacity is now varied still further , the nut in current begins to increase , and the coil and condenser currents are no longer so nearly equal . As an example , assume the inductance of a coil to be 1000 microhenries and its resistance 2 ohms . An effective emf. of 10 %ells and a frequency of 71,340 cycles per second is applied. ( this value of frequency was chosen , since it gives a minimum current I , with a condenser of almost exactly 0.005 microfarad The changes of the current in the main circuit , as the capacity Is varied from 0.002 to 0.008 microfarad are shown in Fig. 144 , In which values of the capacity are measured horizontally and values of the square of the current vertically . The latter values In the figure are multiplied by a million . The minimum current Is not zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value whose square is too small to be easily distinguished in the figure . ' The corresponding currents in the coil and condenser are each about 0.02236 ampere . Their difference is only about rasa part of this value , the condenser current being the larger by this minute amount . In practice , then , if we imagine some troublesome emf. to be introduced into the circuit at E ( Fig. 143 ) , by induction or otherwise , the employment of a parallel combination of inductance and capacity can be made to very completely prevent this emf. from causing currents to flow in the circuit , provided only that the values of inductance and capacity are properly chosen . And such a filter does not prevent the passage of currents of other frequencies . If , for example , we suppose that the emf . E has a frequency of 100,000 cycles , in the above case the combination of 1000 microhenries and 0.005 microfarad would allow 0.01549 ampere to flow in the main circuit . That is , this filter has 155 times as much stopping effect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100.000 cycles , and for frequencies further : sway the effect would be greater . Filters of this kind are used in airplane radio telephone sets to remove noises produced by the electric generator used in the set ; for example , in the type // SCR ? 68 sets . A similar filter is used in connection with the Signal Corps buzzerphone , type 1= ? 1.1 Filters are also used in telephony on wires using modulated radio-frequency currents . ( See Sec. 212 . ) Filters designed for this purpose may consist of an elaborate arrangement of a considerable number of inductances and capacities . The results of theory show that to filter out currents of a frequency f , the necessary relation between inductance and capacity is given in the following equation : ) The current in the main circuit is , under this condition , 2 In all practical radio circuits , however , the resistance of a circuit is so small in comparison with the inductive reactance , that it may be neglected . The equation ( 75 ) , under these circumstances , goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is 2 Otherwise expressed , then , it may be stated that when the condition of parallel resonance is realized , the loop circuit which contains the coil and condenser in series is very closely in a condition of series resonance . Recalling the fact that , in the series resonance condition , the emf. on the condenser is equal and opposite to that on the coil , it is easy to see that there is here a flow of current back and forth between the coil and the condenser . Viewed from the main circuit ( Fig. 143 ) , the current in the coil is , at every moment , opposite to the condenser current , so that the main current , which is their algebraic sum , is at every moment merely the difference between the condenser and coil currents . These latter being nearly equal in value , we have the explanation of the existence of the relatively large currents in the coil and condenser , when the main circuit is almost free from current . // The ideal filter would be one in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the two branch circuits were actually zero . In such a case , the condition for parallel resonance would be rigorously the same as for series resonance , equation ( 70 ) , the condenser current would be exactly equal to the current in the coil , and absolutely no current would flow in the main circuit . The filter effect would be perfect . No energy would therefore flow from the source E. but this would merely give the condenser an initial charge , and thereafter current would flow between the two branch circuits , even if the main circuit were removed . See Section 115 , on free oscillations . In any actual case there must , however , be some resistance in the circuit , and the energy for the heating in the resistance must come from outside . The emf . E must cause just enough current to flow in the main circuit to make good this loss of energy . It is easy to show that these conclusions follow also from the equations previously cited . When the resonance condition is established , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the power is equal to the product of the emf . E // E2R and the main current ? that is , to R2+ ( 2 , rf.L ) 2 . The power lost in heating is equal to the square of the current in the coil multiplied by the resistance of the coil . The current in the coil is , however ( Sec. 55 ) so that the power in heating has the value R2+V 2 f.L ) 2 , as before . The fact that the main current should be zero , when the resistance is zero , is in line with equation ( 76 ) for I. and with the fact also that the heating must be zero in that case . Besides tuning the filter by varying the capacity , it is of course possible to obtain parallel resonance by varying the inductance instead . For a given coil and condenser , it is also possible to obtain parallel resonance by adjusting the frequency of the applied emf . It must be noted , however , that when either the inductance or the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main circuit are slightly different and are not the same as when the capacity is varied . These three conditions differ appreciably only when the resistance is large . For radio circuits , the resistance is usually so small that no difference can experimentally be detected between all these conditions for minimum current . For zero resistance , all three coincide and are expressed by equation ( 75 ) . 114 . Capacity of Inductance Coils. ? A coil used in radio circuits can seldom be regarded as a pure inductance . While the capacities between turns of a coil are small , they approach the same magnitude as other capacities used in radio circuits . A coil is to be considered as a combination of inductance and capacity in parallel . It is found that the capacity Co of a coil does not change appreciably with frequency . Neither does the inductance itself , but the apparent or equivalent inductance L. of this combination of inductance and capacity does vary with frequency as indicated by the equation L.=1 wac. , L ( 77. ) in which the quantity w is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The variation with wave length is shown in Fig. 145 . When the coil is the main coil of a circuit , it is usually desirable to // Introduce the emf. into the circuit by induction in the coil itself there than in series with the coil . The capacity of the coil is Shen merely added to the capacity of the condenser . When the emf ' , is in series with the coil , one effect of the coil capacity Ii to Increase the resistance introduced into the circuit by the coil and thus reduce the current . The capacity of coils frequently gives rise to peculiar and Undesirable effects in. radio circuits . Among these are effects caused by the capacities of those parts of a coil which are not connected in the circuit . The turns which are supposedly " dead " may actually produce considerable effect , both upon the resistance and frequency of resonance of the circuit . Thus , the capacity of the unused part 2 of the coil in Fig. 146 causes n second circuit to be closely coupled to circuit 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies and exhibit the other phenomena of coupled circuits described in Section 120 below . ( See also Circular 74 of the Bureau of Standards , as . 19 ; Bureau of Standards Scientific Paper No. 427 , by ( Breit , " Some Effects of the Distributed Capacity Between Inductance Coils and the Ground " ; and also a paper by G. Breit , " The Distributed Capacity of Inductance Coils , " Physical Review , vol. 17 , pp. 649-677 , June , 1921 . ) B. Damping . 115 . Free Oscillations. ? Thus far it has been assumed that a constant alternating voltage has been applied to radio circuits , in which case the alternating currents produced are of constant amplitude . Such currents may be regarded as analogous to the forced oscillations which are produced in a mechanical system like a swing or a pendulum , when it is acted upon by a force which varies periodically . The system is forced to vibrate with the same frequency as that of the force . It is , however , possible to produce oscillations of current iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating emf . A common method is merely to charge a condenser and then to allow it to discharge through a simple radio circuit . This may be accomplished , for example , by the simple means shown in h'ig. 147 . By throwing the switch S to the left , the cnodenser C is charged by the battery but when the switch is thrown to the right , it is discharged into the circuit contain252 RADIO CIRCUITS . ing the resistance R and the inductance L. If the resistance R is not too great , electric oscillations are set up which , however , steadily die away as their energy is dissipated in heat in the resistance . As in hig. 148 , the current becomes less and less as the oscillations go on . To explain this action , we must follow more closely what takes place in the circuit from the moment when the condenser , charged up to a certain potential difference , is inserted in the discharge circuit . When the condenser starts to discharge itself , a current flows out of it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment when the plates have reached the same potential , current is still flowing out of the condenser . The current has energy and can not be stopped instantly . In fact , to bring the current to zero value it is necessary to oppose it by an emf. , and the amount of emf. necessary is greater the more quickly one wishes to stop the current . It is similar to the case of a moving body . On account of its motion the body possesses energy , and can not be brought to rest instantly . The greater the force which is opposed to it , the more quickly it may be brought to rest , but unless its motion is opposed by some force , it continues to move indefinitely without change of velocity . The flow of current from the condenser , then , does not cease when the condenser has discharged itself , and , as a result , that ' plate which was originally at the lower potential takes on a higher potential than the other . The condenser is beginning to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plates now acts in such a direction as to oppose the flow l // of the current , which decreases continually as the potential difference of the plates rises . If the resistance of the circuit were zero , the current would be zero ( reversing ) at that moment when the potential difference of the plates had become Just equal to the original value . That is , the condenser would N. as fully charged as at the beginning , only with the potential difference of the plates in the direction opposite to that at the Nlnrt . Now begins a discharge of electricity from the condenser hi the opposite direction to the first discharge , and this discharging current flows until the condenser has become fully recharged in the original direction . The cycle of operations then repeats itself , and so on , over and over again , // The action in the circuit may thus be described as a flow of electricity around the circuit , first in one direction and then in the other . The rate of flow ( current ) is greatest when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes zero and then begins to build up in the opposite direction at the moment when the potential difference of the plates reaches its maxamum value . This alternate flow of electricity around the circuit first in one direction and then in the other is known as an " electrical oscillation . " Since no outside source of emf. , such as an a.c. generator , is acting in the circuit , the oscillations are said to be " free " oscillations . Mechanical free oscillations are well known . Such , for example , are the swinging of a pendulum and the vibration of a spring which has been bent to one side and then let go . In the case of the pendulum the velocity with which it moves corresponds to the value of the current in the electrical case , while the height of the pendulum bob corresponds to the potential difference of the condenser plates . When the bob is at its highest point its velocity is zero , corresponding to the condenser when the plates are at their maximum potential difference and no current is flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is moving most rapidly . Similarly , when the plates of the condenser have zero potential difference , the current flowing has its maximum value . The pendulum does not stop moving when it passes through its lowest point ; neither does the current cease at the moment when the condenser plates are at the same potential . The pendulum rises with a gradually decreasing velocity toward a point at the other end of the swing as high as the starting point . The current gradually decreases as the condenser charges up to an opposite potential difference equal to the original value . The return swing of the pendulum corresponds to the flow of current in the direction opposite to the original discharge . A pendulum swinging in a vacuum and free from all friction would continue to swing indefinitely , each swing carrying it to the same height as the starting point . Similarly , electric oscillations would persist indefinitely in a circuit ? that is , they would be " undamped " if there were no resistance to the current . Actually , electric oscillations die down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual pendulum will make shorter // and shorter swings and finally come to rest . Since the occurrence of free oscillations in a circuit presupposes no interference wrath the circuit from outside , the circuit receives no energy beyond that imparted to it at the moment when the oscillations begin . Thereafter the circuit is self-contained , and any loss of Its energy in heat and electromagnetic waves reduces by just so much the energy available for maintaining the oscillations . This loss of energy goes on continuously and the oscillations die away to nothing . They are said to be " damped " oscillations . At the start there is a definite amount of energy present in the circuit , namely , the energy of the charge given the condenser . The amount of this energy depends upon the capacity of the condenser and the square of the potential difference between its plates ( emf. to which it is charged ) . This energy exists in Ike dielectric of the condenser , which is in a strained condition due to the charge . As soon as the current begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this begins to be associated with the current and is to be found in the magnetic ( leld around the current ; that is , principally in the region around the inductance coil . As the current rises in value under the action of the emf. of the condenser , energy is continually leaving the condenser and being stored in the magnetic field of the inductance coil . When the plates of the condenser have no Potential difference , the whole energy of the circuits resides in the magnetic field of the coil and none in the condenser . Energy is then drawn from the coil as the current decreases and energy is stored up in the condenser as it is recharged . I I ' the resistance of the circuit were zero and no energy were radiated in waves or dissipated in other ways , the total energy of the circuit would be constant . The energy dissipated in heat and electric waves is , however , lost to the circuit , so that the total amount of energy , found by adding that present in the Condenser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original store of energy given the circuit has been disipated and the oscillations cease . The energy lost when a steady current is flowing in a circuit depends not only on the value of the current , but on the resistance of the circuit , and in a radio circuit this resistance is replaced by a somewhat larger quantity of the same kind , the " effective resistance . " ( See Sec. 117 . ) The greater the effec- 2 5.6 RADIO CIRCUITS . tive resistance the greater the amount of energy dissipated per second when a given current flows . Ohm 's law shows that to keep a current I flowing through it resistance I ? an emf . RI is necessary and this has to be furnished by the battery , generator , or other source . In an oscillating circuit the same is true , and that portion of the emf. in the circuit which is employed in forcing the current against the resistance is , of course , not available for charging the condenser or building up the discharge current . The changes of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current does not rise to as great a value as it would in the absence of resistance . The maximum of emf. between the plates of the condenser is less each time the condenser is discharged , and thus the oscillations of the current die away . alogy to damped electrical oscillations in a circuit is found in the vibrations of a flat spring , clamped at one end in a vise , and then bent to one side and released , Fig. 149 . The spring vibrates from side to side with decreasing amplitude , until finally it comes to rest in its unbent position O. When the spring is bent energy is stored up in it ? the energy of bending . On being released the spring moves and gains energy of motion , while the energy of bending decreases . If there were no friction the loss of one kind of energy would be just offset by the gain of the other kind and the sum total would remain constant . The spring would move past the natural undisturbed position 0 , under the influence of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a position just as far to the other side of 0 as was the starting point . Friction has , however , the effect of opposing the motion and causing a dissipation of energy in heat , and each excursion away from the resting point is smaller than the one preceding . // Free oscillations , then , can take place in a circuit containing aductance and capacity . These would be undamped in the ideal case where the resistance can be regarded as zero . In all practical cases of free oscillations , however , the oscillations are hilted . To produce undamped waves it is necessary to prode some source of power to make good the energy dissipated the oscillating circuit . Strictly speaking , undamped free Illations are impossible in actual circuits . It is of importance to study the effect of the resistance in determining the Iddily with which the oscillations die away . 116 . Frequency . Damping , and Decrement of Free Oscillations. ? If the resistance of the oscillating circuit is constant it is possible to calculate the period of the free oscillations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oscillations die away . If / ? and R are . respectively , the inductance , capacity , and re ! stance of the circuit , then free oscillations in the circuit will , me the frequency his is known as the " natural frequency " of the circuit . Simir considerations apply to the pendulum and vibrating spring Isrussed above . Each vibrates in a period natural to it . which petals upon the dimensions , material of the vibrating system , WI the friction against which it moves . If it should happen , iu : us case , that the quantity equal to or greater than then free oscillations in the reuit are impossible ; the current in the circuit does not verse its direction at all , but simply dies away . The circuit said to be in the " aperiodic " condition ; that is , without error . Seldom do such cases occur in radio circuits . Usually e quantity R2 22 instead of being larger thanC is very small comparison with the latter . We may , therefore , as a rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the same expression as for the frequency of the applied // emf. necessary in order that the circuit shall be in the resonance condition . The rapidity with which the oscillations die away depends , not only on the resistance of the circuit , but on the inductance also . The greater the resistance and the smaller the inductance , the more rapid is the damping and the rate at which the oscillations decrease . If the resistance , capacity , and inductance of the circuit have fixed values , it may be shown that each successive maximum of current is the same fraction of the preceding maximum as the latter is of the maximum immediately preceding it . If , for example , the second maximum is 0.9 of the first , the third will be 0.9 of the second , etc . However , instead of adopting as a numerical measure of the rate of decrease this ratio itself , it is found more convenient in the mathematical theory of damping to adopt the natural logarithm of the ratio of any maximum to the next following maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the logarithm of the ratio of two maxima one cycle apart . This number is known as the " logarithmic decrement , " or " decrement , " for short . This is the decrement per complete oscillation . In cases where the resistance of the circuit is not exceedingly large , the decrement is equal to times the quotient of the resistance by the inductive reactance of the circuit , calculated for the natural frequency of the circuit . That is. the decrement is equal to 7r ( 2 fL ' , so that either increasing the resistance or decreasing the inductance will increase the decrement . The natural frequency being practically independent of the resistance , that is , equation ( 79 ) being sufficiently accurate , the capacitive reactance is equal to the inductive reactance . Thus the decrement is , r times the quotient of the resistance by the capacitive reactance at the natural frequency of the circuit . In a spark circuit the idea of logarithmic decrement is not exactly applicable . On account of the variable resistance of the spark , the oscillations fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( See Circular 74 , p. 230 . ) Examples of Decrements. ? Fig. 148 gives a graphic idea of the dissipation of the oscillations in three cases where the decrements are 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1 . These correspond to circuits of very // null damming , moderate damping , and excessive damping , respectively . Each curve starts from the same value of current t the first maximum , and for each the natural period of the reult is the same . The latter is represented by the horizontal distance , AB , BC , etc. , in each . The difference between the curve is striking . In the case of a decrement of 0.01 , the oscillations decrease only very gradually ; this case approximates that of undamped waves . In the extreme case of a decrement Of 1 , the oscillations become negligible after only four or five periods . To construct such curves the following simple method May be used : Assume a certain number of divisions in the horizontal diSteelton to represent the period of the oscillations , for example , ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and one-half divisions . Choose a convenient number of diVisions to represent the first maximum of the current , for example , ten . The curves DE ( Fig. 148 ) are next drawn to scale , farting with the chosen value for the first maximum . The curves DE have the property that the height of the curve falls Off by equal fractions of its value for equal horizontal intervals . For instance , if the decrement is 0.1 , we find , since 0.1 is the natural logarithm of 1.105 , that the first maximum OD in the positive direction is 1.105 times as great as the next . PG , and ao on for any two successive maxima in the same direction . If , therefore , we take ( 11 ) =10 divisions , PG will equal 1.1010.5 =9.05 9.05 divisions , RH will be = 1 . 105 8.19 , etc . For all except large values the logarithmic decrement is practically equal to the fractional difference between successive maxima . Thus , for example . when the logarithmic decrement Is 0.1 each maximum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Although , strictly speaking , the oscillations never would become absolutely zero , they actually become negligible after a certain time . A knowledge of the logarithmic decrement enables us to calculate how many complete oscillations will be executed before their amplitude has // fallen below a certain fraction of the first oscillation . This number is greater the smaller the decrement . If , for example , we arbitrarily choose to find the number of oscillations which will be completed before the maximum of current will fall below 1 per cent of the value at the start , we hove simply to tale the quotient of the natural logarithm of 100 by the decrement . The natural logarithm of 100 is , near enough , 4.6 . The number of oscillations is thus 4.6 divided by the decrement . Thus in the three cases given in Fig. 148 the numbers of complete oscillations will be 460 , 46 and 4.6 , corresponding to the decrements 0.01. 0.1 , and 1 , respectively . The maximum possible value of decrement would be infinite , but the United States radio laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on account of the interference of highly damped stations with other stations . The number of complete oscillations calculated by the above rule is 23 for a decrement of 0.2 . The ratio of two successive current maxima for a decrement of 0.2 is about 1.22 . Effect of Decrement on Tuning. ? The decrement of a transmitting set gives an approximate idea of its effectiveness in generating oscillations of a definite wave length , and in delivering its energy at the wave length which it is desired to use . The smaller the decrement the sharper the tuning possible and the less the chance of interference with stations tuned to a different wave length . The reason for this is that with highly damped waves there are fewer radio-frequency oscillations per wave train than with slightly damped waves , with the result that in the former case the tuning of a receiving circuit to the wave length of the emitted radio-frequency oscillations has less effect in determining how much current will be built up in that receiving circuit . Let us compare two wave trains having the same energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly damped . In the former there will be a smaller number or waves between the same relative values of amplitude in a wave train than in the latter . and the energy and the electric impulse in the earlier waves of the highly // dumped wave train will be greater than in the slightly damped w u y e train . Also the electric impulse in the successive waves of the highly damped train will differ considerably , while the electric impulse in the successive waves of the slightly damped Ira in will be almost the same . The first wave of the highly damped train will have a large electric impulse and will also have a considerably larger electric impulse than the one following it . This first large electric impulse can be thought of as producing a large response ? that is , forcing a current in a system which is not exactly in tune with it . Even if the second Impulse should act on the receiving system at an instant such that its effect would tend to diminish the effect of the first , nevertheless since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current in the receiving system would not cease on account of the counteracting effect of the second impulse . fence if a highly damped wave train acts on any receiving circuit , that circuit will respond to the first incoming waves of the train and will maintain oscillations at the frequency to which the receiving circuit happens to be tuned . ( See Impulse Excitation , Sec. 123 . ) In the case of the weakly damped wave train , each impulse is comparatively small and has nearly the same impulsive force ; the first impulse will produce a small response which could be annulled by the second impulse if it should act on the receiving system at an instant such as to oppose the effect of the first impulse . Since each impulse is small and has nearly the same value , the cumulative effect of a number of impulses must be utilized , which means that the transmitting and receiving systems must be closely in tune . In Fig. 148 the emitted wave train having a decrement of 0.1 will cause an appreciable response only in such receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emitted wave . The wave train having a decrement of 1.0 will cause an appreciable response in nearly all receiving circuits which it has the power to affect at all by simply applying to them a series of impulses of the train frequency . A wave train having a decrement of 10 would have only one-half of an oscillation of appreciable magnitude and would have no tuning properties whatever in a receiving circuit . Thus , even if the total power of the oscillations be the same in both cases , a transmitter which sends out a certain number // of waves trains per second , each wave train having 20 oscillations of large amplitude at 600 meters , will be much more apt to interfere with a receiver tuned to 800 meters than if the transmitter sent out the same number of wave trains per second each of which had 100 oscillations of less amplitude at 600 meters . This can be roughly illustrated by the familiar example of resonance in sound . Tuning forks usually persist a considerable time in their vibration . This means that their vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound wave which they emit will have comparatively small energy content . If a tuning fork having a frequency of 512 vibrations per second is to cause another tuning fork to respond by the action of sound waves , it is necessary that the two forks have nearly the same vibration frequency . However , the single blow with the hammer which started the 512 fork vibrating will also start a 900 , 1200 , or 3000 fork . The single blow with the hammer which would start all of these forks can be thought of as corresponding to the strong impulse of the first wave of a very highly damped wave train . Another illustration of this application of the principle of resonance is found in a suspended swing . A small child by feeble but well-timed impulses can gradually swing his playmate high into the air , providing friction is very small , that is , providing the hinges of the swing are well oiled . The swing will reach the greatest height if the frequency of the impulses is the same as the natural frequency which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial impulse . If the hinges are rusty , it will be very difficult if not impossible to work the swing up to its full height by feeble impulses no matter how well timed ; this condition corresponds to the case of highly damped oscillations . If the hinges are very rusty , it may be necessary to give an initial impulse sufficient to send the swing to its full height on the first swing ; this corresponds to the case of impulse excitation , which gives waves which will cause response in every receiving circuit which they reach at all without regard to the wave length to which the receiving set may be tuned . Modulated Continuous Waves. ? If a continuous or undamped radio-frequency wave , such as that produced by an electron // tulle generator , is modulated at a low frequency , as in radio telephony , it may cause interference over a wide range of tuning adjustments , behaving in this respect much the same am a damped wave of appreciable decrement . This effect is discussed in Section 206 , page 514 . C. Resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady emf. is applied between the ends of a conductor , the current quickly ' rises to the final Ohm 's law value , and distributes itself uniformly over the cross section of the wire . During the interval between the moment when the emf. is applied , and the moment of attainment of the final steady state , the current distribution over the cross section is not uniform . This effect is due to selfInduced emfs. in the cross section of the conductor . Suppose that a section be taken through the axis of a cylindrical conductor and that the applied emf. tends to produce a current in the direction of the arrow ( Fig. 150 ) . The magnetic lines in the cross section will be circles , in planes at right angles to the axis , and with their centers in the axis . In the figure , the lines will be directed out of the paper in the region above the axis and into the paper in the region below the axis . As the total current rises in value , the number of lines of force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCD and F , FGII , will be increasing , and by Lenz 's law ( Sec. 45 ) this change of field will glee rise to induced emfs. which tend to oppose the changes of the field . The directions of these induced emfs. will accordingly be those indicated by the small arrows , and it is easy to see that the increase of the current is aided in those portions of the cross section which lie near the surface of the conductor , and hindered at the portions nearer the axis . That is , the current reaches its final value later at the axis of the cross section than at points on the surface of the wire . On the other hand , if the circuit is broken after the distribution of current bas reached the uniform state , the outer portions of the conductor will first be free from current . These effects may be accurately described by the statement that the current grows from the outer layers of the wire inward , and that the current inside the conductor attains the // same value as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When a rapidly alternating emf. is impressed upon the conductor , ( a ) the phase of the current inside the conductor lags behind that of the current at the surface by an amount which is greater the nearer the point is to the axis ; and ( b ) the amplitude of the current is largest at the surface and decreases as the axis is approached because sufficient time has not been allowed for the final steady value to be reached before the emf. was changed . This non-uniformity of current distribution in the cross section is known as the " skin effect , " and it is equivalent to a reduction of the cross section of the conductor with consequent increase in its resistance . From these considerations , it will be seen that in addition to its dependence on the frequency , the skin effect will be more serious , the thicker the conductor and the greater the permeability and conductivity of the material . of which it is composed ; for the thicker the conductor , the longer the interval which must elapse before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conductor and thus the greater the difference in the current density at different points of the cross section . With given dimensions , the greater the permeability of the wire , the greater the end ' . induced in its mass . The better the conductivity , the less the ratio of the effective current to the value at the surface . A numerical calculation of the magnitude of the skin effect can be made only in a few special cases for which Circular 74 , pages 299-308 , should be consulted . Table 18 of Circular 74 will enable one to see at a glance how great diameter of wire is allowable , in order that the increase of resistance due to skin effect shall not exceed 1 per cent of the direct current value . Such data are of use in estimating the size of wire suitable for a hot-wire ammeter , in order that its resistance may not vary in the range of frequency for which it is intended . For larger diameters of wire the effect increases rapidly , and cases where the high-frequency resistance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare . These facts must be kept in mind when estimating the current carrying capacity of a conductor . The " resistance ratio " is defined as the ratio of resistance at the frequency in question to the resistance to direct current . Then , for the same heating , the allowable current at the high freErr ' // fluency will be less in the ratio of the square root of the resistance ratio . In Appendix 4. page 550 , is given a table of values of the resistance of various sizes of solid copper wire at a frequency of 1,500,000 cycles per second . Since the skin effect tends to render useless for the carrying of the current the inner portions of the cross section of a wire , thin tubing , or a thin layer of good conducting material plated or welded on the surface of a poor conducting cylinder is a form of conductor suitable for carrying currents of radio frequency . In fact , tubing which is very thin in comparison with Its radius has for the same cross section a smaller highfrequency resistance than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conductor is often built up of a lumber of very fine conducting strands . The resistance ratio of such a combination is , however , on account of the mutual inductance of the strands , appreciably greater than the resistance ratio of one of the strands . To be effective , the strands should be placed as far apart as practicable , and the diameter of the Individual strands should not exceed about 0.1 mm . The individual strands are usually enameled and the conductor is usually so constructed that each strand comes to the surface or very near the surface at regular intervals . If the individual strands are not enameled , a stranded conductor may at high frequencies have a resistance considerably greater than the resistance of the corresponding solid conductor . In a stranded conductor carrying radio-frequency current , in a given cross section different strands have different potentials , and if the strands are not enameled current will flow across contacts of appreciable resistance between individual adjacent strands , and energy will be lost as heat and the effective resistance of the conductor will be increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to nuke , is one where the strands are so twisted as to form a woven tube . For further particulars see pages 306-303 , of Circular 74 . Effective Resistance. ? The resistance of a circuit at high frequency is never the same as the resistance measured by direct current . To define what is meant by the resistance at high frequencies , we have to divide the power lost in heating or otherwise dissipated , by the square of the effective current . This // quotient is known as the " effective resistance " at the frequency in question . The effective resistance of a circuit carrying currents of radio frequency may be very appreciably affected by the presence of neighboring conducting bodies . The energy of any eddy currents which may be induced in the latter is drawn from the circuit in question , whose effective resistance is thereby increased . On account of the high frequency , this effect can be astonishingly large in good conductors and may be appreciable in the presence of such a poor conducting path as a painted surface . Different portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity . The mutual effects of the currents which flow in opposite directions in two parallel cylindrical wires is , for example , such as to cause the maximum current densities in the two cross sections to be shifted to points nearer the other conductor , with an increase in the effective resistance of each conductor above the value it would possess in the absence of the other . In other cases ( p. 302 . Circular 74 ) the effective resistance may be reduced by the presence of the other lead . An important example of the effect of the mutual inductance of neighboring conductors on their effective resistances is furnished by a system of parallel wires connected in parallel . In this case more current , at radio frequencies , flows in the outer wires than in the inner , and the differences may become very important . This is a point which can not be overlooked in the design of hot-wire ammeters to carry large currents . 118 . Brush , Spark , Dielectric , and Radiation Resistance . ? As has already been explained ( Secs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some heating takes place in it , and we may artificially represent a condenser as equivalent to a pure capacity in series with a resistance . The introduction of a condenser into a radio circuit has therefore the effect of increasing the effective resistance of the circuit , and , except in especially designed air condensers , this effect can not be neglected . Care needs therefore to be taken that poor dielectric materials be kept away from regions of intense electric field . When operating condensers at high voltages , large energy losses may occur in the so-called brush discharge , and this // effect will generally give rise to a very considerable increase In the effective resistance of the condenser . If a spark gap is included in a circuit , the resistance of the spark will have to be included in the total effective resistance of the circuit . This spark resistance depends upon a number of circumstances . and the laws of its variation are very complex . In general , a short spark gap , has a larger conductivity per unit length than a long one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a single one of a length equal to the sung of the lengths of the shorter gaps . The pressure and nature of the gas between the terminals also affect the resistance which is materially decreased with reduction of pressure . Further , the nature of the terminals and the constants of the remainder of the circuit all affect the spark resistance . Some of the power supplied to a circuit , which is carrying a radio current . is radiated from the circuit in the form of electromagnetic waves ( see Chap . 4 ) . This may be regarded as the useful work obtained from the circuit , and for transmission purposes the power radiated should be made as large as possible , in comparison to the power dissipated in the circuit itself and in its immediate surroundings . The power radiated at any frequency is found - To be proportional to the squire of the current flowing , so that the radiative effect may be regarded . artificially , as causing a definite increase in the effective resistance of the circuit . This fictitious resistance increase is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be directly proportional to the square of the frequency , or inversely proportional to the square of the wave length . D. Coupled Circuits . 119 . Kinds of Coupling. ? When two circuits have some part In common or are linked together through a magnetic or an electrostatic field they are said to be " coupled . " If two circuits have an inductance coil in common ( Fig. 151a ) , their relation is said to be " direct inductive coupling . " If they have a condenser in common , their relation is said to be " direct capacitive coupling " ( Fig. 151e ) . If they have a resistance fn common , their relation is said to be " resistance coupling . " // If two circuits are mutually inductive ( Fig. 151b ) and have no part in common other than the mutual inductance , their relation is said to be " indirect inductive coupling , " usually called simply " inductive coupling . " ( For mutual inductance see also Sec. 47 . ) Sometimes the coupling shown in Fig. 151c is modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensers in series and one condenser in the first circuit is coupled to one condenser in the second circuit through a coupling condenser ; this is described as " indirect capacitive coupling . " Mutual inductive coupling is used very extensively in constructing radio apparatus . It often happens that the two coils constituting a mutual inductance are so mounted that they also constitute the two plates of a condenser whose capacitive reactance is appreciable at radio frequencies , and in this case the effect of the coupled coils is a combination of inductive coupling and capacitive coupling . It is customary to denote as the ' primary " that circuit in which the applied emf. is found , the other being regarded as the " secondary " circuit . When two circuits are coupled they react on one another so that the current in each circuit is not the same as would be the case were the other circuit absent . The extent of the reaction is , however , very different in different cases . Circuits are said to be " closely coupled " when any change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . When either circuit is little affected by the other the coupling is regarded as " loose . " The coupling between two inductively coupled circuits is changed by changing the distance between the two coupling coils . In general , increas- COL PLED ) CIRCUITS . 2Gb lug the distance between the two coils will make the coupling looser , providing each coil is moved parallel to its original position . If the distance between the two coils is not changed . but they are moved so that the angle between their projected axes is changed , the coupling will also be made looser , since fewer lines of force are then linked with both coils . A more exact measure of the closeness of the coupling is given by what is called the " coefficient of coupling " ( denoted by b- ) . Its value in the case of direct coupling ( Fig. 151a ) is given by If the total inductances of the circuits in Fig. 1511 ) are denoted by 1 ? and L , , we have for inductive coupling - a d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose , k approaches zero as its limit ; for the closest possible coupling k would be unity . In equations ( 80 ) and ( 81 ) the values of M , La , Lb , Li , L , , mist be expressed in the same units . In equation ( 82 ) the values of Ca , Cb , Cm must be expressed in the same units . The coupling of two direct coupled circuits may be increased by increasing the amount of inductance which is common to the two circuits , maintaining constant the total inductances ( / , , +M ) and ( L , +M ) of the two circuits . To make the coupling of the inductively coupled circuits closer , their mutual inductance is increased by moving the coils nearer or by increasing the inductance of either coil . For example , the coefficient of coupling of an antenna may be increased by adding turns to the coil of the oscillation transformer , enough inductance being subtracted from the loading coil to keep the total inductance of the circuit constant . Capacitive coupling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with the capacities C ? and Cb. // In some types of receiving apparatus the coupling condenser is connected in a different manner from that shown in Fig. 151 ? c ( see Sec. 177 ) , and in that case the coupling is loosened by a decrease of capacity in the coupling condenser . The reaction of either circuit on the other affects , not only the value of the currents in the coils , as would be expected , but has an important influence on the frequency to which the circuits respond most vigorously . This is explained in the fol-lowing : 120 . Double Hump Resonance Curve. ? It may be shown ( Secs . 1 ( 1 to 18 of Circular 74 of the Bureau of Standards ) that the reactance of either of the circuits , primary or secondary , is zero ; that is , the impedance is a minimum for two separate frequencies f ' and f " , which are different from the natural frequences f , and f2 , for which the primary and secondary circuits are in resonance when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " differ little from f , and f2 . With closer coupling ; however , the differences becomes very appreciable . If f ' be used to denote the lower of these two frequencies , then it may be shown that f ' is always still lower than the lower of the two natural frequencies f= and f , , while the higher frequency f " is always higher than the higher of the two natural frequencies . Increasing the closeness of the coupling has always the effect of spreading f ' and f " further apart . Furthermore , the difference between f " and the higher of the two natural frequencies is always greater than the corresponding difference between f ' and the lower of the natural frequencies . These conclusions may be tested by means of a wavemeter . As has been already pointed out ( Sec. 112 ) , the current induced in a wavemeter circuit is a maximum when the wavemeter is tuned to the frequency of the exciting current . Suppose the wavemeter to be very loosely coupled to either the primary circuit or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary be varied by small steps and adjust the setting of the wavemeter for each frequency until the indicator shows a maximum current in the wavemeter circuit . If the settings of the wavemeter condenser and the corresponding deflections of the indicating instrument are plotted , a resonance curve is obtained which will show two humps or peaks corresponding to the frequencies f ' and f " . The positions of // two humps will be found to be different for a second resoflee curve , taken with a different coupling between the priry and the secondary . The coupling between the wavemeter lit and the circuit which is exciting it must be made as as practicable in order that the wavemeter circuit may react appreciably on the other circuits and thus change r currents . more direct method of showing the two frequencies is fur- by simply inserting a hot-wire ammeter or thermocouple the circuit . to be examined and noting the changes in its slings as the frequency is continuously varied . u the case of the usual coupled radio circuits the two cit. - , primary and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , f , is made equal to fa . the coupling is made loose both f ' and f " approach the e %aloe , f " from above and f ' from below , and at very loose ( ding f ' =f " =f=f ? 1 might be supposed that in the special case where f , =fz the nits in the circuits would be a maximum for a single freicy only , namely , at the value of f to which they are both Nevertheless , both experiment and theory show that circuit , even in this case , offers a minimum impedance two different frequencies , just as is found for the more al case . The two frequencies f ' and f " lie on either side e value f , though not at equal intervals from the latter , difference f " ? f being always greater than f ? f ' . en f1= fz the effect of the coupling on the values of f ' r is shown by the simple relations coupling is made more and more loose , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two humps of the resocurves finally merge and become indistinguishable from le hump . ( See also Sec. 165. ) the absence of a secondary current there is no reaction on %loon y , which is no longer a coupled circuit , and will successfully be in resonance at a single frequency only ( f by heals ) . The same remarks apply to the secondary when primary circuit is broken . // The further treatment of coupled circuits naturally follows two different lines , according to whether the primary is excited by a sine wave of a definite frequency ( producing oscillations ) , or whether the primary circuit is given a single impulse and then allowed to oscillate freely . ( See Sec. 115 , p. 251. ) 121 . Forced Oscillations. ? Forced oscillations of frequency fo will be caused when a sine-wave emf. of frequency fo is applied to the primary of two coupled circuits . When the emf. is initially applied to the primary , the currents in the primary and in the secondary are at first very complicated , and consist of free oscillations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ' and f " of the preceding section ) , superposed upon forced oscillations of the impressed frequency fo . The free oscillations quickly die away , and there remain sinewave currents of frequency fo in both the primary and secondary . High-Frequency Transformer. ? It can be shown that to obtain the maximum current in the secondary circuit a certain value of the coupling of the coils is necessary . If the coupling be made either closer or looser than this value the secondary current falls off in value . In general , the proper coupling for maximum secondary current will depend upon the resistances of the primary and secondary and their reactances , and can be determined better by actual experiment than by calculation . For one important case , however , the values of the coupling and the maximum secondary current can be expressed very simply . If the primary and secondary circuits are separately tuned to the frequency of the applied alternating emf . E , the maximum E possible secondary current has the value F.-= 2 R R2 where RI i 2 and R2 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual inductance ( coupling ) which gives the maximum secondary current may be calculated from the relation 2orfl-I= R , R2 . The primary current under these circumstances as- sumes the value which is one-half the resonance value i of the primary current when the secondary is absent . These relations and the dependence of the secondary current on the coupling are illustrated in Fig. 152 , which shows the changes of the secondary current as the mutual inductance between the coils is varied . The resistances R , =2.0 and R2=12. // ane assumed , and the secondary current is plotted in terms maximum value , which is taken as 1 . The abscissas taken not the mutual inductance itself but 2701 , so that the IM applicable to different frequencies , assuming , of course . In every case the two circuits are tuned to the frequent ? question . Maximum secondary current is , in this example . Ind for 27rfI=A/2.0 X12.5=5 . Supposing , for instance , that frequency is 100,000 , the coils must be so placed that their hail inductance is airX100,000 or 7.96 nucrohenries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary to malty ) in the high-frequency transformer. when adjusted to give maximum current . has been shown to be 1/i , so that , R2 general , it may be increased by decreasing the secondary resistance or by increasing the primary resistance . The voltage ratio is in general more complicated . If the two currents are tuned to one another and to the impressed ireFIG. 152 // quency , the voltage ratio ( secondary to primary ) approaches the value / -J as the resistances in the circuits are made smaller . If the circuits are not tuned to the same frequency , but are closely coupled , the voltage ratio approaches the ratio of the number of turns on the two coils ( when the resistance may be neglected ) , which is the case of the usual alternating-current transformer . Inductive coupling of transmitting sets is discussed in Section 161 , page 370 , and types of transformers for high frequencies : are described . Transformers used for radio frequencies generally have air cores , that is , no iron is used . In tha case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Section 196 , page 481 ) an iron core is sometimes used , very thin laminations being employed . Devices of transformer type , such as the Alexanderson magnetic amplifier ( see Section 173 , page 399 ) are used for controlling or modifying radio-frequency currents . 122 . Free Oscillations of Coupled Circuits with Small Damping. ? Suppose the condenser in the primary circuit is given a charge , and the primary circuit is closed directly or through a spark gap . If the secondary circuit is open , the primary will oscillate freely . the frequency of the current being given by the equation fl21r%/L1C1 ' the damping of the oscillations being determined by the ratio 2 fL as treated in Section 1 As soon as the secondary is closed , the matter is complicated by the reaction of each circuit upon the other . An emf. is induced in the secondary by the changes of the primary current , and thereby a forced oscillation is started in the secondary . The secondary condenser is charged by this current and starts a free oscillation , whose period will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter wave will induce a forced oscillation in the primary , and similarly the oscillation which was forced in the secondary by the primary , will react on the primary , modifying the original oscillation in the primary which produced it . The oscillations in the primary will then further react on the secondary , and so on . // Naturally , the result will be very complicated , but it is evident that each circuit is the seat of two waves , one free and the other forced by the other circuit . Each of the waves which we have designated as free is , however , not entirely so , since it forces an oscillation of its own frequency in the other circuit . and has to supply the energy for this induced wave . This has the effect of modifying the frequencies of these waves from the natural values f , and f , already treated . Of the two waves In the primary , the free wave has ( with loose coupling ) the greater amplitude , skid the same is true of the secondary except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With close coupling , the forced wave in the primary becomes stronger , owing to the increased amplitude of the secondnry free wave . Finally , with very close coupling , those waves predominate the frequency of which is f ' . The frequency f " of the other waves lies so far above the natural frequency of either circuit that only feeble oscillations of this frequency are present . In general , therefore , the oscillations in both the primary and secondary circuits are compounded of two damped oscillations Of different frequencies . It is of interest to study a little more Closely the nature of the complex oscillations resulting from he superposition in a single circuit of the two oscillations of different frequencies . Vamping Curves of Coupled Circuits. ? Fig. 153 shows two Pine waves A and , B of equal amplitudes but of different frequencies . Curve C is obtained by taking the algebraic sum of the ordinates of A and B. It is seen to be a curve the oscillations of which alternately increase and die away . The frequency of these fluctuations is equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and B. The curve C passes through its zero values at nearly regular intervals of time , the length of the intervals usually being intermediate to the intervals between successive zero values for curve A and the intervals between successive zero values for curve B. In addition , however , curve C passes through zero at one extra point in each cycle of curve C , the intervals between this extra point and adjacent zero values being about one-half of the regular interval . This extra zero value occurs at the mid-point of the cycle of curve C , where curve A and curve B pass through zero // at the same point , which is in the vicinity in which the amplitude of the oscillations of curve C is smallest . In Fig. 153 curve C has ten zero values in a cycle , including the extra zero value at the mid-point of the cycle . It is also noticeable that the loops of the curve C are only approximately of sine shape . An exactly analogous case is furnished by the resultant sound wave coming from two tuning forks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is heard alternately increases and decreases in loudness , giving the phenomenon of " beats . " The number of beats per second is equal to the difference in frequencies of the two forks . Thus , if two furls have frequencies of 259 and 255 vibrations per second , they combine to give a sound which beats four times per second . Beat phenomena in the reception of undamped waves : Ire discussed in Set Lion 205 . I. 501 . G i5 ! Pna.aio of Deeta Free oscillations in coupled circuits are damped , so that in addition to the alternate waxing and waning of the resultant oscillation , the energy of the oscillation as a whole dies away according to the laws already treated in Section 116 . Fig. 154 shows the nature of the damped oscillations in the primary and secondary circuits . The primary decrement is assumed to be 0.1 and that of the secondary 0.05 . The two coexistent frequencies are supposed to have the ratio of 4 to 5 . The curve of oscillations is in each case drawn as a full line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the dashed curves give an indication of the clamping effect . It is noticeable that the primary current is passing through its maximum values at the moments when the secondary current is zero , and vice versa . Further , when the primary is passing through a period of intense oscillation , the secondary oscillations are small , etc. // Another important conclusion which can be drawn from Fig . Is that the energy of the coupled system is transmitted alternatively from the primary to the secondary , and back again from secondary to the primary . Thus , at certain moments the Bray is entirely in the primary , at others entirely in the secondary , and at other instants partly in the primary and partly in the secondary . This transfer of energy , first in one direction and then the other , show 's that the primary and ' mainly play alternately the role of driving circuit . // From the standpoint of radiation of energy , it is desirable to hinder the return of energy to the primary , after it has once been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a nature as to radiate very little energy ( see See . 136 ) , no useful purpose is served by the transfer of energy back to the primary , and some of the energy thus handed back is necessarily lost in heating in the primary . Further , the radiation of the energy of the secondary in waves of two different frequencies is undesirable . The receiving circuit can be tuned to give a maximum of current for either one of the incoming wave frequencies , but not for both at the same time . The partition of the radiated energy of the secondary in waves of two frequencies is therefore wasteful , since only that wave to which the receiving circuit is tuned is effective , while practically none of the energy of the other wave is usefully employed , and it may cause interference with other stations . For a further discussion of oscillations in coupled circuits , the reader may refer to Bureau of Standards Circular 74 , and to a book by G. W. Pierce , " Electric Oscillations and Electric Waves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some means or other the energy of the primary circuit can he transferred to the secondary and then all connection between the circuits can be removed before any energy can be handed back to the primary , we may avoid the disadvantages just mentioned . In this case , the secondary will oscillate simply in its own natural frequency , and the toss of energy in the primary can be restricted to the short interval during which the primary is acting . By properly choosing the resistance of the secondary , the damping of the radiated wave may be kept mull , and since only a single frequency is radiated , the advantages of close tuning of the receiving circuit can be realized . Such a method of excitation is known as " impulse excitation , " and is analogous to the mechanical case where a body is struck a single sloop blow , and thereafter executes vibrations , the period of which depends entirely on the inertia and elasticity constants of the holy itself , and not at all on the nature of the body from which the impulse has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft the secondary is to insert so much resistance in the primary that its Muttfalls away aperiodically ( see Sec. 116 , p. 257 ) . This has % ? ever , the disadvantage that considerable energy is lost in the primary due to the heating of the rather large resistance t the primary by the initially rather large primary current . More satisfactory arrangement is the " quenched gap . " By dividing the spark gap in the primary into a number of short in series , the cooling effect of the relatively large amount metal is available for carrying away the heat of the spark . ? Charge . This is found to be sufficient , in the ease of a properly designed quenched gap , to prevent the reestablishment n spark discharge after the first passage of the primary oscillations through their condition of maximum amplitude to zero , of point D , Fig. 154 . The secondary , at this moment , is the at of the whole of the energy of the system and thereafter fascillitates at the single frequency natural to it . The damping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the // energy lost in the primary is restricted to the heating during the short interval before the quenching of the primary oscillations . Fig. 155 shows the form of the oscillations in the two circuits for this case . The curves are the same as in Fig. 154 up to point I ) , after which the secondary curve is a simple feebly clamped oscillation . The construction and operation of the quenched gap are treated further in Chapter 5 . Section 156.
