SOME one of the British journals , in speaking of the prolific press of the English Society named above , says , rather freely , We wonder where Brougham can find the men to write all these tracts . ' Now we must as freely say , though without designing the least disrespect , certainly , to that distinguished individual or his praiseworthy coadjutors , that it seems to us they might find them anywhere . The truth is ,  --  and the truth in this case is a matter of so much disappointment and regret to us , that we can not suppress the expression of it ,  --  there is a most lamentable want of tact , not to say talent , in these publications . No doubt the first series is sufficiently learned , that is , the scientific part of it , though we can not wonder , ' certainly , that men should be found to do this work for a fair consideration . But the want of talent appears in this , that there is no adaptation , in these tracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are wholly unfit for the diffusion of knowledge among the mass of the people , or among the mass of general readers . And when this deficien .. cy was confessed , though not remedied in the current series , as it ought to have been , the moment it was discovered ; when a new series is brought forward , as if starting anew would better help the matter ; when , we say , a new series // ( the Library of Entertaining Knowledge ) is got up , on purpose to correct the preceding error , what have we but a collection of children 's stories about Menageries and Forests , descriptions that look like a traveller 's memoranda of trees and plants ; rambling anecdotes about dogs , cats , and jackalls and all this , with scarcely any pretension to philosophical classification or instructive inference . We have had , but this moment , as we were writing , an exact illustration of the character of this series . We were expressing our disapprobation about this work in conversation ; and the answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing for children ? It is indeed a good thing for children , ' was our reply , but it was designed for men . ' The title Entertaining ' we were in truth afraid of , from the first ; and it seems to have impressed its character upon the tracts , almost to the exclusion of all other objects . They may do good , no doubt ; we are not sorry to have them for our youth to read as entertaining books ; but we can not admit , that these or any publications of the British Society are examples of what can be done to further its great project . Our brethren across the water must pardon us if we express ourselves somewhat strongly ; for we have looked to them for the best thing that could be done ; we have rejoiced at their great and noble undertaking ; we have actually had visions of the good they were to do , and , confess it we must , we are grievously disappointed . The truth is , the first failure seems to have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and intention to unite . Of scientific books we had enough before ; entertaining and intelligible treatises , too , such as Goldsmith 's and St Pierre 's ; but the object of the Society was to give these matters a form sufficiently scientific for the best purposes of instruction , and yet to render them intelligible and interesting . Now its first series of tracts had enough of scientific classification , but was not intelligible to the mass of readers . To remedy this , the Society has issued a second series ; but , by this arrangement , being unwilling to trench upon the ground of the first , they have cut themselves off from a large portion of the field of interesting and useful instruction ; and that , too , the best portion . For instance , in the first series the subject of Vegetable Physiology was treated of ; a subject which yields the most interesting results for mental and moral contemplation . But // in the second , as this ground was preoccupied , we have only an account of the general aspects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such as might have answered a very good purpose , if it could have been introduced to clothe the dry and barren limbs of the first . So again , we have Animal Mechanics in the first series , and the forms and habitudes of animals in the second . Now it does seem to us. that a work may be produced , with enough of scientific classification and detail on the one hand , and yet , on the other , intelligible , interesting , exciting and satisfying inquiry , gratifying the natural curiosity of the human mind , directing it to the practical applications of science , and exalting it to that devotion which is its great end . It might indeed be a work , and one of the noblest works , of united learning , genius , taste , and piety . We have lately spoken of the new . tlmericau lilmanac , a work highly valuable in its general objects and character . There is one portion of it , however , against which we must enter , with qualifications , the same complaint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Second Part , on the Calendar , Celestial Changes , and Astronomical Phenomena , ' is that to which we refer . There is an interesting series of brief chapters on these subjects ; but here and there , when the matter becomes more deep and difficult , the writer certainly forgets that apparently hardest of all things to keep in mind , how many degrees he stands above those whom he undertakes to instruct . We refer , for instances of this observation , to portions of the chapters on the Calendar , ' on the Year , ' on the Solar and Lunar Cycle , ' and on the Tides . ' We will consent that any intelligent , but general reader , shall be umpire between us and the learned author of the Second Part , on the point which we have respectfully suggested for his attention . The publications before us , with many others of the same character , inVite our attention to a great and interesting project , which is nevertheless so novel and unprecedented , that it is probably regarded by some as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indifferent . A defence of this project , in these points of view , claims attention , for reasons that extend far beyond any limited sphere of our own , and in fact beyond our own country . It is indeed one of the peculiar and great undertakings of the age , to communicate scientific knowledge to the whole intelligent portion of the // mass of society . The energies of the social world , aroused , as they never were before , to the work of general improvement , are now , especially in England and in this country , directed particularly to this object . Three distinct series of publications , having , as one of their leading objects , the advancement of this enterprise , and bearing upon their title-pages some of the greatest names of England , are now issuing from the British press ; and the Lyceums , which are rapidly springing up among us , are likely , if the first efforts are successful , to spread over the whole country . The records of Greek and Roman literature give no example or hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fables of Arabic learning and genius , though royal halls gave audience to them ; the mystic lore and cumbrous philosophy of the East , furnish nothing that can enter into the comparison . The Lyceum , that was first built on the pleasant banks and among the shady groves of the Ilissus , where Aristotle taught philosophy , was designed only for a few studious youths . Those sequestered retreats were never invaded by the footsteps of the Athenian artisan or tradesman , nor by fruiterers or husbandmen from the fields of Attica . The noble project of bringing down high philosophy and holy science to the mass of the people , has been reserved for this age . It is a novel enterprise among mankind . It is an unwritten page in the history of the world . It is a project , we do not think it too much to say , which never before entered into the conceptions of men ; for it is an attempt to pluck from the sun , in the highest heaven of philosophy , ' the Promethean fire , to burn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The error of past ages has been , to accumulate power , wealth , learning , and evea religious responsibilities and trusts , in a few har*ds . Monopolies have not been confined to property ; they have extended to knowledge too . Science , as well as religion , has said to the mass of mankind , Stand by thyself , for I am holier than thou . ' The paths of the scholar have led far away from the beaten track of common life . He has conceived himself to have little to do with the world at large ; he has had few sympathies with it ; he has felt little interest in it . He has compared science indeed to the light of heaven ; he has talked eloquently about its properties ; but he has talked in figures ; he has not actually felt that it is one of the lights which men may daily walk by . Indeed , // these primary interests and blessings of the world , to which we have referred , have not failed of diffusion because they have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their possessors in a sort of selfish estimation ; because they have been considered as too good for the mass of mankind , or because it has been imagined that they would he soiled by a common use . But it is the strong tendency of all liberal thought and feeling , at this day , to bring every human acquisition to a practical account ; to make men in politics their own rulers , in religion their own guides ; to spread wealth , by abolishing the laws of entail and primogeniture , into general competence and comfort ; and , as the best pledge and safeguard for all the rest , to call down knowledge , from its proud and inaccessible heights , to be the companion and cheerer of the lowliest toil and of the humblest fireside . Diffusion is the watchword of the age ; and unless the spread of intelligence keeps pace with that of power , of wealth , and of religious liberty , it will become the motto of universal disappointrnent and defeat . It is certainly an interesting question therefore , whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the professed undertaking to further it , in the department of the sciences particularly , promises to be either successful or usefu1. * Is not the project to diffuse a knowledge of the sciences , visionary , impracticable ? Or , if it is not , if it can succeed , is there a prospect of much good to be effected by it ? These are the questions before us . And there is the more occasion to discuss them , because this practical character of the age , of which we have spoken , is sometimes falsely considered in such a light as to furnish specious , but unsound objections to our views ; and because there is , in many minds , a peculiar skepticism about the practicability and expediency of diffusing generally a knowledge of the sciences . The first feeling , in many persons , to whom this sort of knowledge is proposed for their acquisition , is a vague feeling of utter incompetency to the undertaking , or of the absolute impossibility or impropriety of the thing ,  --  a feeling , as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven ; or , at any rate , to put themselves altogether out of their place and sphere . We can not know anything about these matters . They are for scholars to understand . They are to he learnt in colleges . If you attempt to teach us things of this // sort , ' say many with an incredulous air , you must take patience with you at any rate . ' It takes some patience to listen to the objection , we confess . For why can not men , and all men , know ? And why should they not ? The objects of this kind of study are God 's works , works which were expressly designed to be studied and admired by all his rational creatures ; and , as religious reasoners , so far from admitting these things to be out of the province of the mass of mankind , we should say , that the world is not , and never will be , right , till they are generally understood . It is not in a fair and right state for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to urge the general propriety of these pursuits . If the object of God 's works on earth had been mere temporary accommodation and comfort , less than all the infinite wisdom displayed in them would have sufficed . Plants , for instance , could have been caused to grow without their present curious structure and beautiful appearance . It is as evident that the world was made to display to its inhabitants the wisdom , as the goodness of its Creator . it is reasonable , therefore , that they should study it . No inquiry could be more proper for men , and for all men . And why , we repeat , can they not know ? The objects to be examined are all around them ; the subjects of study are the very elements with which they are every moment conversant ; the instruments are their senses ; to see , to hear , is to know . The times for study are all times that are not necessarily engrossed with other pursuits ; when they take a walk , when they look around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at leisure . Why can not a man , who sits down before his evening fire , spend an hour in reading a few paragraphs that will teach him the curious and beautiful theory of combustion ? Why can not any man read enough upon the nature and changes of the atmosphere , the clouds , and the seasons , to be in the habit of reflecting philosophically on what is passing around him , instead of receiving , as passively , iii this respect , as the post before his door , the visitation of the elements ? And as to time , the time that makes a wise man is the time that makes a fool ; and the counters , with which the untaught lose the game , are the same with which the skilful win it , ' - says , or should say , some proverb of the East or of the West . It is strictly true in this matter , that time and chance happen to all men ; but all men do // not know how to use them . The thing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is nigh us . ' It is said that Linna*us , when abroad one day in the fields with his pupils , laid his band upon the green turf , saying , he had that under his hand , whose consideration n ) ight justly occupy all of them for a considerable portion of their lives . He verified this assertion , by showing that within that space there were thirty-four different species , either of grass or moss , or insects , or anirnalcules , or varieties of mineral . ' Yes , but all this is nothing , ' say our objectors . Science is what we are talking about . ' Nay , but this is the very thing . The foundation of the sciences is observation . The business of philosophy is not to construct theories , but to state facts ; not to deal with mysteries in mysterious language , but to deal with plain matters in intelligible language . Science , instead of being a high and abstruse mystery , is a clearer up of the mysteries that lie in our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of many practical and plain men , if they had been properly and pbilosophically noted down in their own minds , would have laid the foundation for much useful philosophy . The judgment , for instance , which seafaring persons form of the weather , which seems at once as sure and as mysterious as instinct , is no doubt founded on actual and careful observation . If the observer had been , in this respect , a philosopher ; if be had been able fully to state the grounds of his almost unerring predictions , he might have furnished far more valuable aid to the science of meteorology , than is now given in dry tables of temperature , wind , rain , and sunshine . And if the same observations were made on the land , it would not be difficult to form a Farmer 's Manual , or a Traveller 's Directory , which , in many cases , would he of great convenience and utility . When science is mentioned , the minds of many persons are at once carried away from what is around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These things have their place and use , it is true . Diagrams are essential in the mathematics ; and apparatus is a needful auxiliary to scientific observation . But observation need not wait for them . The inquirer may begin his researches without stirring from the spot where be stands . He has only to revive the curiosity of childhood , a curiosity unhappily dulled by repeated disappointment ; he has only to ask , What is this , // and why is that ? and he has begun the work of scientific philosophy . If he has any zeal in these inquiries , he will procure or invent some simple apparatus to aid him ; not to say that our Lyceums are now likely to make the necessary provision for his wants . It was thus , and without these resources of modern enterprise , that our Franklin and Rittenhouse advanced through the first steps that led to their distinction as philosophers . We do not expect that many among us will rise to the same eminence ; but we do say , that , with only a moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree and kind of knowledge , that will give a new character to their minds and a new complexion to their lives , that will open treasures in nature , more truly valuable than the most fertile soil or the wealthiest mine . And to this end , we repeat , they are not to wait for lectures or apparatus , but to begin those inquiries which will as certainly lead them to reading and to experiments , as cause will ever lead to effect . It has been proposed as a good method of instructing children , to confine their attention to the apartment they are in , and to question them with regard to the nature and origin of everything in that given space . Such a course , we believe , never fails to interest them . And thus , if a man would question himself with regard to all the objects within the circle of his vision , he would find enough to elicit his curiosity , to task his reason , and give direction and employment to his hours of reading . True , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of thinking ; and our business is to labor . ' But why not join them ? Need a man stop turning over the furrow of his field , because he observes the chemical properties of the soil ? Must the builder pause in his work , because he proceeds upon a full understanding of the principles of mensuration and architecture ? Does any artist labor less assiduously or effectually , because he understands not only the practice , but the philosophy of his art ? Does the merchant lay his plans less wisely , because he brings into his contemplation a sagacious and comprehensive view of the principles of trade ? The truth is , that in all these cases knowledge does not hinder , but helps a man . Precisely as the philosophical , we had almost said , the imaginative system of the double entry helps the accountant , or as the science of geometry aids the surveyor , or of navigation , the mariner . And in a simple // 301 journey upon the land , may not the traveller , without any interruption , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notice its soil , its productions , its *apabilities , its mineralogical character ? Even in judging of its scenery ,  --  and no man would be thought so negligent as not to know whether he had passed through a fine or a dull tract of country ,  --  even here , there is use enough , if he understood it , for the philosophy of taste . And with a mind thus employed , he would not only not be retarded , hut he would find many sources of pleasurable interest ; he would be saved from some portion of the tedium of a journey ; and he would not need such frequent resort to the coarser stimulants which the tavern furnishes . But we do not know how to class these things , ' still say our men of doubt and difficulty ; we have no books , and we do not know how to begin ; or if we do begin , we do not know how to proceed without instruction . ' There is some ground for these objections . Nature , at first , presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is desirable that he sbould have some elementary works to aid him at the outset , to answer immediately those first inquiries , which we have represented as the beginning of philosophy . And we must confess , that there is here a deficiency , which we trust is yet and ere long to be supplied . Most of the Manuals of Natural Philosophy , of Chemistry , of Mineralogy , Zoology , &amp;c. are designed for scholars . We want something of a simpler character . But what then ? shall we do nothing for ourselves , because everything is not done to our hands ? The Lyceums which are rising around us , we trust , are to furnish an answer to the question . Some among us have undertaken to instruct and to aid one another . And let it be observed in this connexion , that those who shall , in these institutions , give the results of their inquiries in the form of dissertations or lectures , who shall , with a generous zeal , study for that purpose , can not , in their communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , also , it is important that they should not put one thing for another . Prolixity is not plainness ; nor are many words to be mis* taken for much simplicity . Perfect clearness of ideas , no matter in bow few words , provided they be intelligible , is the first qualification of a lecturer . But again , let it be asked , shall we not read books , be // cause they are not precisely what we want ? Few books would be read or studied , by this rule . Besides , there are portions of most of the Manuals that may be read , with derstanding and to advantage , by almost every one . And what if these things , in the outset , cost some study ? What if some pages must be read over twice and thrice before they will be understood ? If any one thinks these matters not worth the attention ; if he is willing that the vision of nature should pass before him as an idle show ; if he cares not to ijuderstand the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject is to be addressed . If he has any intelligent concern or reasonable zeal on this subject , he will not think it too much to spend some of his leisure hours in the reading and study of those authors that will lay open to him the secrets of that world of science , which as yet , to most men , is truly an invisible and unknown world . " Ay , ' says some skeptical observer of this undertaking , you may address whom you will ; you may say and do what you can ; but you will never accomplish much . It is all a Utopian scheme ; one of the forms of modern extravagance ; an attempt to carry people out of their condition , to make philosophers out of ploughmen , and lecturers out of laborers . Let us rear up a community of plain , industrious men , who understand their business ; and let those who please , dream of a nation of dreamers like themselves . ' There are some predictions which have no other chance of accomplishment , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls in with language of this sort ; if it is the tendency of the times to doubt or to contemn all projects for intellectual improvement ; if skepticism is stronger than conviction , and ridicule i5 more weighty than men 's interests , then we admit that this great and noble undertaking of the age may fail . Eut even then we shall not admit , that it is at all necessary it should fail . We maintain , that , if society would seriously and earnestly set about the work of self-improvement , there are intellect and ability of every sort enough , and a hundred times more than enough , to accomplish all that we desire . If we could promise that every leaf of scientific knowledge should turn to a bank note , though of the humblest denomination , the work would be secure of the desired fulfilment , If men would seek knowledge , not as they seek silver , but with a hundredth part of the same zeal , we should not fear // for the result . If , for opening the sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what it now pays for excess , vice , disease , ruin , and death , it would be enough ; enough to build Lyceums everywhere ; enough to procure apparatus and libraries ; enough to pay lecturers ; enough to meet all the expenses of the most lib-. eral , or of the most extrava0ant projects , in this cause . The substance of the objections we are now considering is , that the undertaking to disseminate scientific knowledge among the mass of the people , is visionary , that it is unsuitable to the state and objects of society . But let us consider what it is in this matter that is visionary . Not the knowledge proposed to be gained ; not the treasured wisdom of nature ; not the pleasure of contemplating it ; not the aptitude of the human mind for such an employment ; not the capacity of common minds to receive the elementary truths of science , for they are very simple . What then is visionary in this project ? That , undoubtedly , which has caused every improvement that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the novelty of the undertaking . It is this that marks it as chimerical . Unless , indeed , it may be said that one part of mankind were made to be ignorant and to work ; and another part made to he wise and to rule them . On this summary classification and appointment , it is true , we easily comprehend what is meant by rearing up a community of plain and industrious men , who understand their business . ' But , we trust , it is not visionary for men also to understand their own nature , to reverence their Creator , and to look , with earnest inquiry , into those proofs of power , wisdom , and benevolence , which he has spread before them . There can not be a steam-boat , a power-loom , a fire-engine , the model of a carriage for a rail-way , or a newly invented nachine of aay valuable description , presented for inspection , hut it is thought a mark of reasonable curiosity and enlightened judgment to examine and understand it . And shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , and beauty , and scarcely bestow upon it a casual thought ? But the point we are now considering opens to a wider discussion . The general question of utility here naturally offers itself . We have thus far been endeavoring to meet the question , whether anything can be done . Let us now // go to the inquiry , whether any good is likely to be done , provided the undertaking can succeed . lAThat is useful can not be pronounced to be visionary . And yet what it is that constitutes the utility of any measure , or of any acquisition , may be a question , on which there will be all that difference of opinion , which shall make the project we advocate appear to some to be a visionary undertaking , and to others to be the soundest wisdom and the best policy . With some , nothing is useful but what immediately tends to increase the property , comfort , and outward well-being of the people . And be it admitted , with all the readiness and latitude that can be desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not the only things that come into account , as affecting the welfare of society . But admit the importance of these interests . We believe that no one estimates them , singly considered , at a higher rate than we do . We are tempted to say , that one of the greatest evils in society is , that people are not well enough off . Not that there is a want of means , for Providence everywhere is bountiful ; but these means are so distributed , and the maxims and habits of society are such , that the struggle of human interests and necessities is too hard ; that , through human misdirection , the temptation to dishonesty , ambition , and mutual strife , presses harder , if we may venture to say so , than it was meant to press . We have reasons then , beyond all worldly prudence , for wishing that competence and comfort may be increased in the world . But here we say , and might argue much at large , did our space permit , that the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the mechanical powers and of the capabilities of nature , would tend , and directly tend , to bring about this result . Science , it has been often said , is man 's empire over nature . It is this that makes a large part of the difference between the barbarian , who is subject to the elements , and of the civilized man , who commands them . It is this that , in civilized countries , is , every day more and more , rendering nature subservient to man 's use , for food , medicine , clothing , habitation , fuel , convenience , comfort . These , it may be said , are the labors of the learned . But Arkwright and Fulton were not learned . Besides , why should that which , in the hands of the studious , is so powerful an instrument , be so useless in the hands of the active // and laborious ? We know that it is not . And it is demon . ' strable , as a matter of the plainest inference , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as art intelligent handicraftsman , who understands the powers he wields , and the elements and materials he works upon , will have a great advantage in his knowledge . The artisan , with this qualification , will be constantly improving his tools and the productions of his skill , and shortening the processes of his labor . The farm will be certain , other things being equal , to he better cultivated , and to be made more productive , by a scientific agriculturist . He will turn the stock , as well as the soil , of his farm to greater account , with the knowledge that books of science will give him . How many horses have been ruined by ignorance in the farrier of the part he operates upon . The foot of the horse is connected with the leg by muscles and ligaments , which answer the purpose of a fine elastic sprinb , that saves the animal from the shock , which every step would otherwise give him . This effect is aided by the expansion of the hoof , and by the descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , muscular substance , technically called the frog . Now , if the shoe be placed too far back , or be formed so as to contract the foot , it will interfere with this admirable provision of nature ; and lameness will ensue . In the building of houses , again , scientific principles are indispensable , and undoubtedly a thorough understanding of them would enable the carpenter to improve his plans , and to facilitate the execution of his task . But there is one evil that especially calls for a scientific remedy , and that is , the evil of smoky houses . ' There are principles , if we are rightly informed , on which every chimney may be constructed , so as certainly to draw smoke ; and any one may convince himself of this by the fact , that a Franklin stove is an invariable remedy for a smoking chimney . And yet , in many places , if not generally , more than half of the chimneys are so built , as to inflict . this lasting evil , this century 's calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expended , either to make a stronger draught by increasing the fire , or to heat rooms with half-open doors ; the colds , rheumatisms , and various diseases induced in this way ; the irritation , the actual ill temper occasioned by such circumstances , constitute , all together , no small item in the troubles and afflictions of domestic life ! And all this , because one class of our artisans do not understand , in this particular , the philosophy of
