IT has often been remarked , that the most valuable gifts of nature are precisely those which are bestowed with the greatest profusion . It requires some effort of reflection to recognize and acknowledge the number and magnitude of those blessings which are showered upon all mankind alike , and are essential to their very existence ; though , from their continuous character or their incessant recurrence , we are apt , in summing up the good and ill of our earthly lot , to pass them by in utter heedlessness , or to forget them amid a whirl of cares and perplexities resulting from the casual absence of some minor , and in comparison quite insignificant , object of desire . The air , the water , freedom of speech and motion , health of mind and body , the unimpaired possession of the senses , abundance of daily food , friends , a fine sky , a beautiful prospect , - these are the most common things in the world , but they are those of which we take the least account . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one is too proud , and the other too miserable , even in the midst of them , to think of being grateful for their presence . Common language , which is the exponent of common feeling , has no phrase to express the value of those things which can not be bought and sold , because , being universally diffused , no one can convert them into his exclusive property . Most men are like the political economist , who recognizes no value but that which is marketable . The case is quite similar in the social state , with respect to the advantages which redound to mankind from the mere existence of society , irrespective of the greater or less skill manifested in its constitution or of the comparative intelligence and virtue of its members . Companionship , general security of life and limb , the institution of property , the division of labor , the tacit laws which regulate our intercourse with each other , the facilities for extending that intercourse to an indefinite extent , - all are benefits which are experienced alike by the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark out the situation of those subjects as // immeasurably superior to the merely animal existence of the solitary and the brute . We speak of gross tyranny , or an essentially evil government , as a thing which ought to be resisted even at the expense of life , - not because it deprives us of a thousandth part of the things which render life desirable , - but because it is the denial of a right - a perfect right - which the first impulses of our nature require us to maintain , though the object which it covers may be too insignificant to deserve a moment 's consideration . Despotism makes but a small inroad on a man 's daily comforts , on the sum of his means of enjoyment . It levies an unjust impost of three pence a pound on tea ; it requires one man to contribute six pence to the support of government , while his neighbour , having equal means , is taxed but four pence ; it enjoins upon all persons to forego the open expression of their opinions on two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reference even to these , and may say what they like on the innumerable other themes of speculation and discourse . " How small of'alI that human hearts endure , That part which laws or kings can cause or cure . There is no great hardship in the case apparently , when viewed in this light ; but men go to war about it , and make revolutions , and equip armies and fleets , and shed blood , and acquire undying reputation for patriotism by these efforts , not because they avoided the payment of an insignificant tax thereby , but because they successfully defended a principle . They wholly disregard the countless other blessings , of infinitely greater importance than the original subjects of dispute , and which they might quietly have enjoyed under the old government to the end of time , without let or hinderance . If we go one step farther , and look at society and government in their best estate , we are still struck by the same fact , - that far the most important and beneficial results are produced by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operation , and consequently attracts the least notice and remark . The motive and the regulating power , that which keeps every part of the vast machine in motion , which turns the drums and the cranks , lifts the ponderous hammers , and guides the wheels in their swiftest whirls , is placed precisely in that portion of the building where there is the least // clanking and din . Slowly and silently the great water-wheel revolves in the basement story , while the stir and the Babel are in the apartments above . Equally powerful and noiseless in their operation are the great springs of government , while the loudest clatter attends the working of the least efficient department of the state . The legislature is essentially a noisy body , a blatant beast ; and its real activity and efficiency are generally in inverse ratio to the bustle and clamor which it makes . It enacts laws and repeals them , though its debates are often conducted with the greatest heat and vehemence , when there is the least prospect of doing either , - when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only subject of dispute . The fundamental laws of the state , the principles of the constitution , are those which it dares least frequently to touch , though they form the constant topic of vociferous declamation and angry debate . The position of the executive in modern days is equally conspicuous and arrogant , while its influence on the general well-being of the country is even less constant and less perceptible . In a monarchy , it is a pageant or a symbol ; in a republic , it is an object of noisy ambition , and a dispenser of gifts to clamorous applicants . In the former case , the fortunes of an individual subject are but little affected , though the throne may be occupied by a sot , a driveller , or a knave ; in the latter , only the persons who fill the inferior offices have a deep interest in the character of the incumbent of the executive chair . The prosperity of the community at large , in every material respect , except on rare emergencies , is beyond his action and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election to a presidency , stirs the minds , or rather the passions , of men , as if the result were to modify essentially and continually the outward weal and the fireside comforts of every citizen . What a turmoil , and a running to and fro , and a gathering of multitudes , and a waste of speech and print , occur every four years in this country ; and yet , when the contest is over , how trivial is the effect on every actor in the busy scene , apart from the gratification of his pride or his vanity in the success of the cause to which he is attached ! The poor are still condemned to the same dreary routine of toil , and the rich are arrayed in fine linen and fare sumptuously , and neither Van Buren nor Clay can help the one , nor prevent the other . // But there is one department of the government which goes silently on its way , unceasing and indefatigable in its labors , neither attracting nor heeding the remarks of the multitude , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life , of every citizen are subject to its control and protected by its power . We refer , of course , to the Judiciary . Who can estimate the sum of the influences of this portion of the social machine , or the variety of the directions in which they are exerted ? Through the whole country , not a bargain is made , nor an institution founded , nor a marriage contracted , nor a death occurs , but that this powerful and almost unseen agent controls the expectations of the actors or the spectators , and decides what shall be the consequences of the act . It is this power in the state which determines , almost exclusively , the measure of that protection which government affords to all its subjects , and for which it is instituted and they are taxed . Whoever suffers a wrong , or claims a right , whatever be its nature or extent , looks to the judiciary for redress or support . In the confidence that this defence or compensation will he afforded by it , he accepts the engagements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his property to other hands , walks the streets in perfect security by night as by day , and sleeps , if he chooses , with his doors unbarred , and not a weapon in his house . And how little notice is taken of the operations of this salutary agency , and how quietly it does its work ! The sleepless activity of the law , the constancy with which its influence is felt , and the implicit reliance which we place in its integrity and watchfulness , seem effectually to blind us to any proper sense of its dignity and importance . We receive its benefits as we do the influences of the sun and rain , as we inhale the air , or slake our thirst from the running stream , without taking any note of the magnitude of the gift which we enjoy . Only some fearful convulsion , by loosening all the hands of social order , and violently interrupting the workings of this great machine of state , could convince men ofits value by making them sensible of its loss . Ordinary political disturbances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the darkest period of our Revolution , the doors of the courts remained open , the complainant was heard , and justice was rendered . That is but a superficial view of the subject , which regards // the judiciary only as the creature of the legislature , bound merely to watch over the quiet and equal operation of the laws made for it by a superior power . Legislative action is too feeble , desultory , and short-lived , to modify to any great extent the vast body of principles and usages for the guidance of the courts , which have been silently accumulating during the lapse of ages . Slowly and painfully it introduces a few new elements into the aggregate , but the character of the whole evinces essential change only after the interval of centuries . In this country , we are even now reaping the fruits of the legislative wisdom of Edward the First , and of the acumen and wisdom of judges who occupied the bench during the reign of the Tudors . Our ancestors brought with them to these shores the great collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the most precious portion of their English birthright ; and , adopted either by express enactment or quiet assumption , it has remained with us to this day , not only coloring the whole stream of our legislation , but still constituting in itself the main body of our jurisprudence . " It was not introduced , " says Mr. Justice Story , " as of original and universal obligation in its utmost latitude ; but the limitations contained in the bosom of the common law itself , and indeed constituting a part of the law of nations , were affirmatively settled and recognized in the respective charters of settlement . Thus limited and defined , it has become the guardian of our political and civil rights ; it has protected our infant liberties ; it has watched over our maturer growth ; it has expanded with our wants ; it has nurtured that spirit of independence which checked the first approaches of arbitrary power ; it has enabled us to triumph in the midst of difficulties and dangers threatening our political existence ; and by the goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manly principles , the blessings of a free , independent , and united government . " Commentaries on the Constitution . Abridged edition . 80 . The reason why the law is built upon so broad a founda* tion , and towers to so vast a height , is to be found in the variety , complexity , and magnitude of the interests which it covers . The operations of the judiciary are necessarily coextensive with the affairs and pursuits of men ,  --  with the diversity of employments , the entanglements of business , the wiles of fraud , the species of crime , the modes and difficul // ties of proof , and the causes of dispute , which mark the variety of character , and give full scope to the activity , of the human race . No cause is too mean to claim its attention no interest is so great as to rise above its control . The doors of the courts are open to every human being , on whatever errand he may come . And in order that equal justice may he rendered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by the caprice or uncertain judgment of any man or set of men , it must be tried by invariable and equitable principles , previously known and established , instead of wondering , therefore , that the science of law should be so extensive and complex , we ought rather to admire that human assiduity and patience should ever be capable of mastering its provisions . Attempts are made from time to time to simplify , abridge , and methodize some portions of the vast code ; but so long as the infinite diversity of cases exists , which come up for trial , and so long as it is deemed necessary for the ends of justice and the satisfaction of the parties , that each one should be determined by a fixed principle , and not by a sentence wholly arbitrary and capricious , so long evidently these attempts can must be interpreted , and every new enactment supplies fresh difficulties of this nature to be overcome . Let the statute be framed in the most comprehensive and lucid language , with the greatest skill and circumspection that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly unexpected and unprecedented character , and the question is immediately mooted , whether they fall within the scope of this particular enactment . We can not refer to the intention of the legislators for the solution of this doubt , since the case was not foreseen , and therefore not provided for , by the founders of the law . Here then is fresh matter for the decision of the court ; a new rule of interpretation , a new governing precedent for future cases , is to be established in consequence of the very statute which was framed because the number of such rules and precedents was already too great . In the collateral circumstances with which every legal question is surrounded , and which must , in some measure , control the decision , though they form no proper part of the case itself , we find additional reasons for the great accumulavor* . LVII. - NO. 121 , 52 // tion and constant increase of the principles of jurisprudence . Among these accessories are the rules of evidence , the interpretation of papers , the conflict of testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the circumstances through which the facts are ascertained and the trial conducted , apart from the mere determination of the law which governs the chief point in dispute . Over this great range of multifarious subjects , and guided by such an imposing array of maxims and usages that have been accumulating for ages , the power of the judiciary extends . There is not a member of the community whom its decisions do not more or less irnmediately affect ; there is hardly one who does not , more or less frequently , claim its direct interference . And the results of the decisions come home most closely to a man 's bosom ; they affect his dearest interests , and stir his strongest passions . A litigant is , proverbially , an excited and unreasonable man . He has suffered a wrong , in imagination , at least , if not in reality ; and the promptings of pride and resentment , as well as the hope of pecuniary gain or compensation , blind his judgment , and hurry him into inconsiderate action . Perhaps the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievance , or of a politician , urged to seek protection and redress by the injuries of a party , mingle with and excite his peculiar and personal motives to action . In any and every case , he appears in court agitated by the most powerful impulses that can swell the human heart . The decision sends him away either elated and triumphant , or a humiliated and disappointed man , - vanquished in a contest on which he had set his heart , and perhaps a bankrupt in fortune and reputation . Yet how quietly the system works ! After all the excitement and intensity of feeling with which the cause was first propounded , and the case conducted , the decision is received in submission and silence . Some indignation may be expressed against the inequality or insufficiency of the laws , but not a murmur against the character of the tribunals where they are interpreted and applied . Even the daily press , that faithfully records the most trifling transactions of the day , seldom deems it necessary to chronicle the proceedings of the courts . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of persons or events that have recently excited public attention ; and then the progress of the cause is eagerly watched . But even in this case , when the verdict // is rendered , or the judgment passed , curiosity and excitement appear at once to subside , and few are found audacious enough to question the legality or fairness of the proceedings . And the number of such cases is very small , and their importance trifling , when compared with the variety and the momentous consequences of the others which continually tax the silent and unnoticed industry of the courts . Why is it , then , that disappointment , and malice , and anger do not in these cases , as in all others wherein hopes are deceived , or fraud detected , or guilt exposed , lead to vehement abuse and outrageous assaults ? How is the judiciary protected from the secret calumny or open abuse , which continually follows every other department of the public service ? Why are men so patient under the operation of decrees , which strip a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their reputations , or wound them in their tenderest feelings by doing these injuries to their nearest connexions and friends ? A judgment of the court effectually thwarts the execution of a scheme , in which a number of persons bad embarked their property and their hopes ; and though they had hotly resented the slightest criticism or opposition during its progress , they quietly resign themselves at last to the total defeat of their expectations , as if the final blow had been dealt by a superior power , against which it were idle to struggle , and sinful to complain . But we gain a very imperfect idea of the confidence inspired by the judiciary , and of the reverent submission with which its acts are received , when we limit our view to the private cases , in which only individual citizens are concerned . In England , and in this country , - though with some limitations in the former case , as will appear hereafter , - the courts are the tribunals of final appeal , before which constitutional questions , and doubts respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are , in the highest sense , " the guardians of the constitution , " appointed to see that the fundamental laws of the state shall receive no detriment . The controversies which they are thus called upon to decide have been agitated in the community with an earnestness and warmth commensurate with their intrinsic importance . In such discussions , popular excitement and the zeal and clamor of contending parties in the legislature have nearly silenced the voice of reason , and passionate declamation has usurped the province of grave debate . But // when these vexed questions come before the tribunals of law , they are discussed with as much patience and deliberation , with a logic as severe , and a power of analysis as searching , as if a mathematical problem were the only matter in dispute . The decision is at length made , and the controversy is put for ever at rest . The people acquiesce as implicitly as if their passions had never been excited ; and a dispute , which seemed at one time to threaten the dismemberment of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of history . We need not search far , either in English or American annals , for instances of what we have here described . Less than a century ago , Great Britain was convulsed by the dispute respecting the legality of general warrants ; and the party of " Wilkes and Liberty " seemed for a period to menace the safety of the throne . The question was the most important one respecting the liberty of the subject that had arisen since the revolution of 1688 ; and every step taken by the ministry and the legislature seemed only to fan the popular tumult . Fortunately , it was one that admitted of legal arbitrament ; and when the case came up for trial at the King 's Bench , the judges formally decided , that general warrants were illegal and void . Public agitation at once subsided ; Wilkes sunk into the obscurity which the profligacy of his character merited ; Parliament retraced its steps , and , in the teeth of its former action on the subject , solemnly reaffirmed the decision of the court . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in stilling the wild uproar of political strife , seemed like the action of the sea-god in calming the troubled waters . " - et dicto citii*is tumida *quora placat , Collectasque fugat nubes , solemque reducit . " Only three years ago , a similar controversy arising between the House of Commons and the legal authorities , involving the gravest questions of constitutional law , such was the confidence reposed by the people in the integrity and steadfastness of the courts , that the affair excited no alarm , and the tocsin of popular tumult was never sounded . We refer to the case of Stockdale and Hansard , in which the House of Commons went so far as even to imprison the sheriffs , who executed the orders of the judges . But the people , notwithstanding // their natural attachment to the popular branch of the legislature , which has always been the noisiest , but not the most effectual , guardian of their rights , seemed to take sides with the judiciary ; and though the Commons acted with singular unanimity on the subject , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The equanimity and dispassionate conduct of both parties on such a trying subject must be attributed , almost entirely , to the high sense , which all persons entertained , of the justice and majesty of the law , as administered by the proper tribunals . In this country , the effect of judicial proceedings on great constitutional questions was recently shown in a striking manner , in the case of Prigg vs . The &amp;ate of Pennsylvania . Since the formation of the present government , no subjects have ever been debated with so much heat in Congress , or have excited such vehement controversy in the community at large , as those which involved the existence of slavery in the Southern States . Disputes on this head were among the chief impediments to the formation and adoption of the Constitution , and at various subsequent periods they have interrupted the harmony of legislation , and seemed to threaten the duration of the Union . So sensitive have men 's minds become on this exciting topic , that a passing remark is resented like a studied attack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of it shall be tolerated . The speck no larger than a man 's hand is viewed with as much alarm as the thick gathering of clouds already black with the instant tempest . To the scenes which the agitation of this topic have occasioned on the floor of Congress , we need not allude farther than to say , that every friend to good order , *o the reputation of the country , to the existence of the republic itself , must deeply deplore their occurrence . At this period of agitation and alarm , one of the gravest points belonging to the subject is carried up for decision to the Supreme Court of the United States . When this exciting cause came up for trial , the words of the poet mighL well have been directed to the court " Periculosm plenum opus alea* Tractas , et incedis per ignes Suppositos cineri doloso. " // much dignity and calmness , as if it had never set the country in a flame ; and the judgment was received by the public with the quiet submission which they usually manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from both parties about the insufficiency or hardship of certain provisions in the constitution , but hardly a whisper against the fidelity and even-handed justice with which that instrument had been expounded by the court ; and some of the States have already begun to modify a portion of their statutes , so that they may conform to the principle of this decision , now recognized as the established law of the land . Suppose the same matter had come before Congress , and this large and irritable body had been called upon to legislate on the mode of reclaiming fugitive slaves . We have no heart to imagine and describe the scenes which would probably have ensued , and we gladly leave the sketch to the conception of our readers . It would be idle to pursue these illustrations of a fact so notorious as the beneficial action of the judiciary in quieting public contests , and maintaining unruffled the majesty of the law . Its continued and salutary influence is alike conspicuous , whether employed in the arbitration of private disputes , in regulating the descent and transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detecting fraud and punishing crime , or in allaying popular fever and tumult on the great questions of political right and constitutional law . And its regular and peaceful action , though far from being fully appreciated by the community at large , owing to the very circumstance of its quietude , is still revered and protected from an indistinct consciousness of the blessings which follow in its train . Amid all the uproar of party contests , while calumny and invective dog the steps of the executive and the legislature , while a ribald press is for ever throwing its poison and filth on nearly every public character , neither age , nor office , nor previous reputation affording any immu* nity from its obscene attacks ,  --  the judges sit apart , like the statues of the ancient gods in a temple , imposing from the stillness of the scene , the awful majesty of their attitude and expression , and the unsullied whiteness of their marble robes . What are the causes of this great contrast ? Why is it , that the mighty array of public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high authorities of the state , // - which does battle , when occasion calls , with Congress and Parliament , with kings and presidents , - on passing the august tribunals of the law , lowers its colors and silences its drums ? In attempting to answer this question , some facts may be brought to notice respecting the position of the judiciary , which are too apt to escape the memories of men whose attention is so infrequently drawn to the subject , though they must be kept in mind , if we value and would preserve the most important advantages that result from the institution of society and the existence of law . The first reason , then , why the courts are respected and upheld in their functions , is undoubtedly to be found in the nature of the subject on which they are engaged . Their office is the dispensation of justice , - the elucidation and enforcement of the idea of Right . They are revered from the reflected splendor and majesty of that virtue , which it is their high prerogative to unfold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jus ipsum amant , nec est yin toni errare et diligere quod per se non sit diligendum . Per se igitur jus est expetendum et colendum . Quod Si JUS , etiarn justitia ; sic reliquce quoque virtutes per se colendai sunt . Ergo justitia nihil expetit prcemii , nihil pretii . Per se igitur expetitur . Eademque omnium virtutum causa atque senterttia est. " * However the idea of abstract justice may seem to be covered up under the complexity of laws and precedents , and the technicalities of the courts , it is still the sole object of legal proceedings . Even enactments which are merely positive , and were not founded primarily on any dictate of natural law , acquire a moral force from their longstanding ; they become binding on the conscience , because , having governed the previous expectations and contracts , they are properly applied to determine the respective rights , of the parties to a suit . The legislature is guided by considerations of expediency , its aim being to advance the welfare of the state by watching over its temporal interests and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it favors honesty and religion by providing for the punishment of blasphemy and fraud , it is only because these virtues are subsidiary to lower ends , - because , in the long run , even in this world , honesty is the best policy , and religion the // highest gain . This task it shares with the executive , the province of which is coordinate with its own , both having the same ends in view , though different means are allotted to them for the attainment of those ends . Both are bound to the service of the state , and their rule of action is salus reipublicce suprema lex . But the judiciary has a higher aim , and is governed by a nobler rule . It is bound to do justice though the heavens should fall . Thus it sometimes interferes with the action of the two other departments of government , and thwarts their best laid schemes for the public advantage , by defending the cause of Right . It bridles the legislature in the name of the constitution , and it stands between executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural reverence of men for justice and the instinctive moral promptings of the heart are enlisted in favor of the courts , and hold up before the judges a shield against violence or contempt . But the sacred character of the functions of the courts would not alone suffice to procure for them all the consideration and deference which they actually enjoy . The second , and probably the most efficient , cause of their high reputation and commanding influence is the independence of the judiciary . The tenure by which the judges hold their office shields them even from the suspicion of truckling to the chief power in the state , or of sacrificing in any way the ends of justice for their own advantage . The basis for this inde** pendence of our national judiciary is established in the constitution of the United States , which declares , that " the judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behaviour , and shall , at stated times , receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual States have followed the example thus set by the natioD at large , and have placed their respective legal tribunals on an equally stable foundation ; and most of those which have in any way limited their judges ' term of office , have established periods of seven , twelve , or fifteen years , - a length of time which gives a considerable , though certainly an insufficient , guaranty of the independence of the courts . In one State only , Vermont , the judges are appointed to office but for one year ; but even here , the good sense of the people , aiming to remedy the defects of their fundamental // laws , has induced them each year to reappoint the old incumbents with so much regularity as to establish the semblance of an independent bench . In England , as is well known , the judges were made independent soon after the revolution of 1688 , * and the change has produced the most important and beneficial results in respect both to the character of the bench and the liberties of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace to the character of a people that had any pretensions to freedom . The courts before which Hampden , and Russell , and Sidney were tried , went through a solemn farce to which it were mockery to give the name of justice . But since the alteration , the moderation of the officers of the crown , and the fairness and inflexible integrity of the bench , have cast an imperishable lustre on the judicial history of England . We need not specify instances , for since that period not one state prosecution has been conducted in a way to raise even the suspicion , that undue influence was allowed to the counsel for the crown , or that the court had prejudged the case . The independence of the judiciary rests upon two points , - that the judges hold office for life , except they subject themselves to impeachment , and that they receive an honorable support , which shall not be lessened during their period of service . When these points are secured , not only are all temptations to swerve from the strict path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even suspicion can be turned against them .

The character which they bear is a thing of quite as much importance for the common weal as the intrinsic equity of their proceedings . It is little for me that a man at a distance , of whom I never heard before , is defrauded of his due in the courts .

We say , that all temptations are removed as far as practicable ; for it can not be denied that , even in this independent and honorable station , an avaricious judge may , if he chooses , " contaminate his fingers with base bribes , " and sell the judgment and his own integrity . But those who lay stress upon this danger show that they have little knowledge of human nature . The gross temptation of a bribe may not allure a man to a flagrant violation of his oath , though the secret promptings of self-interest , the desire of pleasing a powerful friend , the hope of obtaining a reappointment to a lucrative office , may bias his reason by insensible degrees , and finally lead to a judgment as iniquitous , as if it had been openly purchased in court . Virtue is usually sapped and mined , not taken by storm .

When passion , or avarice , or ambition is tugging at the heartstrings , a man becomes a sophist to himself , and will try all the wiles of casuistry in order to varnish over the crime , and give it the poor semblance of virtue . Any one can resist Apollyon , when he comes in his proper shape , with horns and hoof , or as a grovelling snake ; but the cunning devil appears as a beautiful woman or a judicious friend , and the // poor dupe clasps him to his bosom and is entangled in the snare .

Perplexed and difficult cases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are separated by the difference of a hair . So evenly does the matter lie between them , so doubtful is the rule of law to be applied to such an obscure and intricate question , that all the acumen of a sharp and vigorous intellect can hardly determine on which side equity and legal authority incline . Let self-interest , in the mind of the judge , put a feather into the balance , and it will turn the scale . He must be a poor sophist , in so nice a case , who can not blind himself so far as to believe , that justice actually requires that decision which is most accordant with his own feelings and ulterior views . The constitution , therefore , wisely frees the mind of the judge from any anxiety respecting his own situation and support . He is made to feel , so far as is possible , that his post is a permanent one , not dependent on the will of a monarch , or the caprice of a party ; - that he is set to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to waste his thoughts upon his private concerns . Being thus relieved from the carking cares , which too often vex and annoy men out of their integrity , and being chosen from that class , whose talents , learning , and character are a sufficient safeguard against gross and palpable violations of right , it is not strange that the reputation of the courts has so long remained unsullied . In England , we believe , not a judge of the higher courts has been removed by address of the two houses of parliament since the independence of her judiciary was established . In this country , not one member of the national judiciary has been arraigned at the bar of the Senate on any charge affecting his honor or integrity . It may seem superfluous to argue in defence of that constitution of the courts of law , which has been so long approved by the experience both of England and America , and by the suffrage of nearly every political or juridical writer of any note .

A theory , under a specious name , may be allowed to supplant one of those time-honored establishments , which have ever afforded the best protection to the rights of the individual , and to the highest interests of the commonwealth . There are ominous signs in this country at the present day , which lead to some apprehensions of such a fatal result . The judiciary is attacked in some of the States , not only by diminishing the salaries of the judges , where it was possible , but by doubts openly expressed whether any institution ought to exist here , which is beyond the popular control . The opinion is plainly avowed , that the will of the people , for the time being , ought to be the only law , and that all restraints upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as such opinions and doubts were confined to the electioneering harangues of a few demagogues , or *o the columns of a few worthless newspapers , they could not effect much injury , and did not deserve serious notice . But when they are found embodied in official documents , when the governor of one of the " old thirteen states** gives them place in his annual message to the legislature , it behooves the friends of free government and of the reputation of the country to be on the alert , and to arrest the evil , if it be possible , ere it is too late . We know not that this question has ever been agitated between the great political parties which divide the country . Probably it has not been , and we fervently hope that it never may be . The independence of the judiciary is no subject for the common strife of faction and interest , - no topic to be debated in the heat of contest , - no material to be hammered out into " political capital . " We know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs , and though this point might be determined in a moment , we have studiously abstained from asking the question . It is possible , that he has only published in an official way a doctrine which other persons , of equal respectability , have freely avowed and defended on other occasions . Be this as it may , we consider the doctrine as a dangerous heresy , and shall comment upon it with the utmost freedom , though without the slightest intention of trenching upon that class of political discussions , from which this Journal has always carefully ab // stained . We quote the whole passage relating to this subject from the Annual Message of Governor Thomas , the title of which is placed at the head of this article . " We have in commission twenty-one common law judges and a chancellor , at an expense for their salaries of $36,500 per annum . There can be no question , but that many of these officers are supernumeraries . We are now surrounded by States , in no one of which is to be found such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which , the laws are still faithfully executed without complaint from the public as to their delay , and an absence of all protest by the judges in commission , against the imposition of duties too onerous to be easily performed . Indeed , there is not a State in the whole Union , notwithstanding the population of several of them is quadruple that of ours , where the number of the law judges , and the amount of their salaries , are not less than those of Maryland . New York , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Ohio haviug , three of them , a population four times greater , and one of them a population more than three times greater than ours , pay respectively a less sum in the annual salaries of their judges than that with which our treasury is charged . The same States have each a superflcies over which their laws are extended , more than four times as great as that of Maryland , and nevertheless have in commission a less number of judges . In the payment of unnecessary salaries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred thousand dollars have been wasted . With these illustrations before us , of the effects to be expected from a reorganization of the system , so as to diminish sensibly its cost , we ought not to pause in the discharge of a high public duty , from any npprehensions as to the effect of such a proceeding on the interests and well-being of society . " Besides these objections to the system , another will be found in the fact , that no effectual means are provided in the Constitution , to get rid of judges once commissioned , as promptly as the public interests may sometimes demand . The tenure during good behaviour is found in practice to be tantamount to a term for life . A judiciary independent of all the evil passions that may influence , at intervals , the mass of the community , is certainly desirable . But it does not appear , that a tenure for life will , in itself , exempt the occupant of a seat on the bench from the possibility of feeling , in a greater or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro our popular assemblies . Observation compels us all to contest such a conclusion . A tenure for life is , and ought to be , a popular doc // trifle in Great Britain . Such a tenure there , may afford a safeguard to the people against the influence of the Crown . The commissions of the judges being granted by the king , a periodical reappointment would give to the sovereign a most dangerous power in the opportunity to dismiss all who were not willing to prostitute their offices to subserve his purposes , however tyrannical and unwarrantable . Here , we have no permanent or hereditary executive to dread . All our public functionaries , but the judges , return at stated periods , to their separate stations in private life , to give place to successors qualified to rule , by having been taught to obey . It is believed , that there can be found neither in our experience , where the life tenure of judges prevails , nor in the experience of several of the States of the Union , where all such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason for adherence to a doctrine becoming daily more and more obsolete . There was a time when improvements in government were hard to make . Those who were interested in existing abuses could arrest innovations and changes by magnifying and misrepresenting the effects of a proposed reform . But it is time that such artifices should lose all influence on our deliberations . In the hope that full justice will be done to all the deep interests involved , the whole subject , without further remark , is submitted to the Senate and House , who are empowered to make such alterations in the fundamental law of the State , as may be required . " - pp. 17 , 18 . Passing over , for the present , the question about the comparative cost of the system in Maryland and some of the neighbouring States , we observe , first , that the distinction which is here attempted to be set up between England and America , in respect to the independence of the judiciary , does not now exist . In state trials , in the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the ministry , and that majority in parliament and among the electors at large , by which the ministry is supported . The monarchy is become a pngeant and a name , the direct will of the sovereign hardly influencing any thing but the appointments in his own household . The party that holds the reins of government for the time being , whether Whig or Tory , institutes legal proceedings against political offenders in the name of the sovereign , but really in its own behalf . That party holds in its hands the power and the patronage of the state , and , in its eagerness to defend and strengthen its position , // would wield these means effectively for the destruction of its most active opponents , if it were not checked by the independence and integrity of the courts . The most turbulent among the Chartists are tried and sent to Botany Bay , not by the will of the Queen , nor even by that of Lord Melbourne or Sir Robert Peel , but by the two great parties among the voters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case is precisely sirnilar in this country . The rights of a citizen are endangered , if at all , not by an ambitious and reckless president , or a corrupt cabinet , but by the passions and the strength of a dominant party in the Republic , which , while engaged in the hot pursuit of its favorite measures , recks not of the sacrifice of an individual among the crowd . Here , then , as well as in England , an independent judiciary is needed to protect the weak against the strong , - to guard the property , the interests , and even the life of a citizen , not against the arbitrary will of a single despot , but against the violence and recklessness of a more formidable enemy , an excited political party . We speak here of " the rights of a citizen , " purposely avoiding the use of that convenient but vague abstraction , " the liberties of the people . " An aggregate must be composed of units ; the population of a country is made np of individuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and interests of each inhabitant , and not in allowing any casual aggregation of those individuals , which may form a majority for the time , to act its own pleasure at the expense of the weaker party . No one freeman is any farther interested in preserving the liberty of " the people , " than as he is himself one of the people , and expects that his own privileges and rights will be best secured by caring for the welfare and security of the whole body to which he belongs . Of course , we speak only of his direct interest in the state , for by affection or sympathy , by the ties of blood or patriotism , he is bound in unselfish attachment to all who breathe the same air , and tread on the same soil with himself . But his only immediate stake in the freedom and welfare of the people at large is his own property and life , and he hopes to sectire these by doing his share in guarding the property and lives of his fellows . The liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the freedom // of the individual is the end . If a man is cheated by one of his associates , or defrauded of his dues by a corporate body , or has his house burnt over his head by a mob , it is no consolation for him to be told , that the people , of whom he is one , are still free , - that they can still elect their own magistrates , and make and repeal their own laws . On the occurrence of one of these calamities or wrongs , he does not even appeal to the people ; he does not summon a townmeeting , and lay before the assembled citizens the story of the injury he has suffered ; but he goes to the tribunals of the law , cheering himself on the way by the reflection , not that the country is free , but that the judges are independent , and the integrity of the courts is sure . Within their walls , he knows that no undue or improper influence can exist , - that the party by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society , a political combination , or a mob , will there be powerless , and be compelled to make the compensation , or suffer the punishment , which justice requires . With this view of the proper functions of a free government , believing that its only office is to afford a safeguard to the rights of every individual , we must maintain , in opposition to Governor Thomas , that an independent judiciary is even more necessary here than in England . There , the danger to any citizen , of suffering from the arbitrary will of the sovereign , is lessened by the existence of the many distinct orders and establishments in the state , the interests of one or more of which are probably linked with those of the person threatened , and their power is thus enlisted in his defence . King , Lords , Commons , the Judiciary , the Church , - it will be strange , indeed , if all these separate powers are combined for his destruction . In one or another , from community of interest , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands between the individual citizen and his sovereign - the majority of the people , - but the majesty of the law and the independence of the courts . Here too , as has been wisely remarked , " persecution , especially of a political nature , becomes the cause of the community against one . It is the more violent and unrelenting , because it is deemed indispensable to attain power , or to enjoy the fruits of victory . " The innocent may well tremble , if the power of the dominant faction is to extend by // influence even into the courts , - if the same party is to be not only the prosecutor but the judge . Another function of the judiciary is to interpret and uphold the constitution and the laws ; and in this respect , also , the independence of the judges is more needed in this country than in Great Britain . The theory of her government is , that parliament , embodying the three estates of the realm , is omnipotent , and can pass any law that it sees fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , though the judges may sometimes be called upon , as in the two cases already mentioned , to oppose some illegal proceedings of the legislature , it can never be required to declare , that any law properly ratified by the two houses is unconstitutional and void . In the case of Wilkes , for instance , the court of King 's Bench decided , in opposition to the opinion of both Lords and Commons , that " general warrants * were not authorized by the principles of the common law , nor by any statute already enacted . But if parliament had thought proper to pass a new law , expressly authorizing them in future , the court could only have submitted , and have lent its aid to carry the new statute into effect . But in this country , we have a written constitution , expressly restricting the power of the legislature to certain subjects , and , even on those , confining it within certain bounds . If these restrictions are really to amount to any thing , if the constitution is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrossed , then there must be some tribunal in the state which shall have the power of enforcing them , and of putting a final stop to legislative usurpation . This duty belongs to the courts , and they are consequently required at times to interpose a peremptory negative to the proceedings of the legislature . How could the judges be expected to execute this responsible and delicate task , if the legislature , as the first token of its displeasure , could deprive them of the larger portion of their salaries ? What would be the value of the constitution , if the department which has it in charge , and whose duty is to enforce its several provisions , were at the mercy of the two other departments in the state , whose rights and powers are defined and limited in these very provisions ? But leaving the comparison , so frequently made , though generally deceptive , of English institutions with our own , it may be asked , on what grounds does the governor of Ma // ryland invite the legislature to limit the judges ' term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument to show the necessity , or even the expediency , of the proposed alteration . He urges , indeed , - with what success we have already seen , - that the example of England ought to have no weight in America . But he does not show , that the practice both of England and America is faulty in any degree , or that it is productive of evils which might he avoided under a different tenure of office . After admitting , that " a judiciary independent of all the evil passions that may influence at intervals the mass of the community is certainly desirable , " he affirms there is no evidence " that a tenure for life will , in itself , exempt the occupant of a seat on the bench from the possibility of feeling , in a greater or less degree , a sympathy in the passions that sometimes sway to and fro our popular assemblies . " True ; but will a periodical reappointment to office lessen this evil ? Is it probable , that the judges will be more conscientious and inflexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront an angry legislature or an excited populace , if their salaries and their offices are held only at the pleasure of those bodies whom they are expected to oppose ? Governor Thomas seems to argue , that because the judiciary under the present constitution is not entirely exempt from evil influences , it ought to be placed in a situation where it will surely be exposed to these influences in a tenfold degree . Whence arises , then , we ask again , this anxiety " to get rid of judges once commissioned , " unless it be from the wish to increase the number , already too great , of those offices which the executive may fill and vacate at its pleasure , and thus satisfy the demands of its hungry partisans , and extend a corrupting influence through the whole body of the people ? Is it politic , is it desirable , that the judges of our national and state courts should hold office on the same terms as the postmasters and the collectors of customs , and be displaced as frequently as these have been during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change , for we know of nothing that would sooner shake the confidence of the people in the capacity of our peculiar institutions to protect the rights and promote the well-being of the persons for whom they are established . Let it once be fully understood , that an unpopular decision of the courts // will be followed by a prompt dismissal of the judges , and the legislature may as well abrogate the whole system of laws and judicial tribunals , and individuals bring their disputes with each other into a town meeting for arbitrament , and alleged criminals be arraigned at the bar of a popular assembly for trial . If the ultimate decision of all lawsuits and criminal trials , and doubts respecting the interpretation of the constitution , is to depend on a popular vote , let that vote be given directly and immediately on the subject in hand , and the whole cumbrous machinery of the courts , which now stands between it and its object , he done away . There is a more specious argument for destroying the independence of the judiciary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , though it is frequently urged in newspaper paragraphs and electioneering harangues , because it is better calculated than any other to make an impression on the unthinking multitude . It is founded on the doctrine that , in this country , the will of the people is , and ought to be , supreme in every respect , and no institution should he allowed to exist , which is independent of their authority . It is urged , that all our laws emanate from the people , and therefore should be referred for interpretation to the power which enacted them ; that the people are as competent to decide questions of law , as to select persons who shall make the decision for them ; and that a denial of this right and competency is a virtual impeachment of the constitution and the government under which we live . It is said , that the will of the people is usually made known only at stated times , and under certain forms , - as at elections , and by ballot or hand-vote upon questions regularly proposed ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same power which required the observance of them may also dispense with it ; so that the popular will , however promulgated , shall form , for the time being , the supreme law , and the supreme exposition of the law . This is all sophistry , and sophistry so gross , that one is almost ashamed to argue against it . The doctrine contained in it involves a denial of the superior advantages of society over the primitive and solitary condition of man , and a rejection of the forms and institutions hy which alone the social state can be maintained . For its entire refutation , it would be necessary to go back to the theory which lies at // the foundation of all government , and to show that laws properly so called , of supreme authority and permanent obligation , are necessary to the very existence of the social union . We propose to enter into no such discursive argument , hut only to adduce a few brief considerations to show the utter inapplicability of such a theory to the form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , we suppose , that the popular will can not change the nature of right and wrong , any more than it can alter the fixed relations of quantities to each other , or change the figures in the multiplication table . It can not make injustice , cruelty , and oppression right in the eyes of God , nor remove the stamp of his approbation from holiness and virtue . The functions of " a court of justice " are indicated by its title . Its province is to decide between man and man as to the requisitions of that law , which is not the mere creature of human enactment , but which is written in the heart , and is binding upon the conscience , of every intelligent being . Its office is to do justice , and so far from listening to the expressions of public sentiment , it is bound to disregard , if need be , in the cause of duty and integrity , the opinions , the wishes , and the interests alike of individuals and of the state . Noxv , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been their intentions with respect to the amount of power to be lodged directly in the hands of the people , certainly did not contemplate the establishment of a republic or a democracy , which should exist without any legal enactments whatever . On the contrary , they created a legislature , prescribed the manner in which laws should be passed , defined the subjects to which they might relate , and established the tribunal by which they were to be interpreted and enforced . A law is , from its very nature , an inflexible and universal rule , that governs the conduct , and defines the rights and duties , of all persons subject to the law-making power , during the whole period of its existence . It is not an unchangeable rule for the future , because the same power which enacted may abrogate it , and put another in its place . But it is unchangeable in its application to all cases which have grown up during its continuance . Adopt , then , the most comprehensive and unlimited theory respecting the sovereignty of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on all manner of subjects , or may even // annul all existing statutes , and live without law for all time to come . Still their power relates only to the present and the future . The past is fixed and irrevocable . The sovereign may enact or abrogate what rules it pleases to govern coming events and the future conduct of men ; hut it can not annul the rights , the contracts , and the expectations which have grown up under the laws that did exist . In respect to these , the government covenanted with every individual , and every individual with the government , that the statute should he respected and oheyed , on condition that it should he fixed and universal in its obligation . The price has been paid , and the fulfilment of the contract is demanded . Men have made bargains , and contracted obligations , and regulated their conduct , in strict conformity with the law . And they now require , that those bargains should be fulfilled , those obligations respected , and their conduct declared to be innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judiciary is to determine the rights and duties of individuals in conformity with previously existing laws . It does not , and it can not , interfere with or limit the sovereignty of the people , because it neither claims nor exercises any portion of the law-making power . It deals only with the past ; it makes no laws , but only interprets and enforces those already made for it by another department of the government . Its decisions are binding for future cases , it is true ; but only because uniformity of interpretation is essential to that inflexibleness and universality which , as we have seen , grow out of the very nature of a legal enactment . And this stringent power of its expositions and decrees for the future continues only so long as the legislature or the people sees fit . A new rule of interpretation for new cases may be enjoined on the courts by the proper authority , with the same facility with which any new law may be passed for their guidance . But all previous cases must be determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that was derived from the fixed principles of reason and justice , and the natural mode of interpretation , while the new rule is a matter merely of positive enactment . In short , the exposition of the law by the proper tribunals is to be deemed a part of the law itself , and equally imperative and unchangeable with it in reference to the past conduct of men . And it is clothed with these high attributes for the same // reason that the law itself is invested with them ; - that men may know what to expect , and how to govern their daily actions . The statute and the mode of interpreting it may he altered at pleasure by the law-making power in reference to future cases . We now see the reason why the legal tribunals rightly claim to be considered as the fountains of equity , justice , and natural law , however arbitrary , impolitic , and even unjust , may be the usages and the special enactments which they are required to interpret and enforce . They are not responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the business of the legislature . They only unfold and apply the great principle of natural right , or law abstractly considered ; which is , that the actions of men must be judged , and their consequences determined , by a fixed law , promulgated at the time when those acts were committed , imperative and permanent in its obligation in reference to them , and definite and unchangeable in its application . To ascertain what this law is , and to apply it to the case in hand , is the high function of the courts . Public opinion can not aid them in this task , for it is not within the province even of Omnipotence to recall the past , or to alter one jot of the eternal law of justice . The clamors of the multitude must be unheeded , for the judges are listening to a voice as awful as that which proclainied the law in thunder from the top of Mount Sinai . It is of law thus abstractly considered , that the sublime language of Hooker hardly seems to contain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the bosom of God , and its voice is the harmony of the world . " Enough has been said to show the entire absurdity of the doctrine , that because the*people have the power to make the law , they have also the ability and the right to expound and apply it as they please . An uncertain and shifting exposition of legal requisitions and commands is as bad as the absence of all law ; it destroys confidence between man and man ; it annihilates all trust in the future ; it exposes the innocent to continued and cruel apprehensions of danger , and it comforts the guilty with the hope of escape from merited punishrnent ; it has been the characteristic feature of the most oppressive and tyrannical governments of which there is any record in history . But waiving the farther consideration of // the doctrine in its full extent , as leading evidently to such pernicious results as to require no other refutation , it may be worth while to look more particularly at the minor inconveniences , which would follow the adoption of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people ought not merely to abstain from taking the law into their own hands , and giving a perfectly arbitrary exposition of it , but to guard the courts , so far as may be , from all extraneous influences ; in other words , to make the independence of the judiciary as complete as possible . This duty results from the peculiar nicety and complication of the inquiries which the judges are obliged to make , the number and importance of the interests which they have in charge , and the general difficulties of their task . Their functions are not to he exercised by any person of common information and a clear understanding , nor by any mere sciolist in the law . They require deep study , and long and careful preparation . We have seen what a broad ground is necessarily covered by the labors of the jurisprudent , and what a vast accumulation of rules , usages , and special enactments he is obliged to ponder over and comprehend . For every doubt or cause of dispute that may grow out of the infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract from this mountain of authorities a determining principle , directly applicable to the case in hand , by which it may he adjudged in strict conformity with the requisitions of justice and the previous expectations of the parties . Who will venture to come in haste , with his loins ungirded , to such a task ? Who will undertake to perform it , when distracted between the clamorous expression of public opinion , the necessities of his own situation as dependent on a salary and an office that may both he taken away at the will of the multitude , and the still but powerful voice of conscience , and the known purport of the law , both requiring him to disregard the other disturbing causes , and to keep fast his own integrity ? They tell him , that he is bound to pay as little heed to the will of the citizens as to the menaces of a single tyrant ; that " Non civium ardor prava jubentium , Non vultus instantis tyranni must shake his rooted purpose . The selection of competent persons to fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and // difficult tasks to be performed in a republican country . In most of the States , as well as under the national government , the judges are appointed by the executive , subject to the approval of a council , or of one branch of the legislature ; and this is undoubtedly the best mode , as the responsibility of making a proper selection is thrown , in the main , upon one person , and there is the least chance of foreign and improper influences being allowed to direct the choice . As the responsibility is divided , and personal or other wrong motives are allowed to bear sway , there is greater probability that unwise appointments will be made as in some of the States , where the judges are chosen by the legislatures , and even , in a few instances , by the people . Here is no question about the comparative wisdom and integrity of the executive , the legislature , and the people . The same man who , as one member of a large body , would give his vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , a relative , or a member of the same political party , though known to be poorly qualified for the station , would , if the responsibility were thrown entirely upon himself , most scrupulously avoid these very ensnaring influences , and scrutinize the pretensions of a candidate with the more care and jealousy , because he suspected himself of entertaining some personal bias . He would know that the eyes of men were upon him , watchful to detect any sinister motive , and that the consequences of any improper choice would redound entirely to his own discredit . Nor does the metbod which we here recommend constitute any departure from the true republican principle , that elections ought to be made by the body of the people . This principle applies only when the choice is to be made from the body of the people ; that is , when the office is such , that a man of any class or profession , without previous study or professional training , is competent to fill it . We choose a lawyer , a physician , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferently , to be a governor or a legislator , knowing that the question of his competency depends very little on his previous avocations , and of his general character all the world can judge . But the law , as we have seen , is an abstruse and difficult science , requiring many years of study and practice for its mastery . In general , only members of the bar are candidates for situations on the bench , and of their respective qualifications , // one person , in whom the people have so much trust that they have already confided to him an important office , is a more competent judge than the people themselves , - especially when he is held to a strict responsibility . It would be even more unwise to confide the appointment of the judiciary to a numerous assembly than to choose the physician of a hospital , or the captain of a ship , by a popular vote . It is true , the mass of the people know nothing about physic or seamanship ; but if they did make a poor selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by the passengers and crew ; whereas , the hurtful consequences of the blunders or the crimes of an incompetent or a dishonest judge in office are thrown broadcast upon the community , falling most severely upon the electors themselves . But one other question remains to be treated in connexion with this part of our subject , and that concerns the amount of salary to be allowed to the judges , and the possibility of diminishing it while they continue in office . In regard to this last point , we may say , that it is vital to the independence of the judiciary ; for if the salaries may be reduced at pleasure by the legislature , tbe judges are quite as much at its mercy , as if they were subject to the chances of a periodical reappointment to office . It is mere mockery to retain a provision in the constitution , which requires that they shall hold office during good behaviour , when another department of the government may at any time deprive them of all means of support by reducing their compensation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench impossible . It being self-evident , that the provision would be made wholly nugatory by the assumption of such a power on the part of the legislature , to argue the matter any farther would be only to repeat all that we have said in favor of the entire independence of the tribunals of justice . In reference to the amount , it needs only be said , that the salaries should be honorable , and sufficient to insure the highest degree of legal knowledge , ability , and character , which the bar of the place can afford . It can not be expected , that eminent lawyers will sacrifice large professional gains for the sake of a seat on the bench , if the change does not bring with it compensation enough to support them in their usual style of living , and to maintain the dignity of the office . The standard , of course , v*tries in different placcs . The // income from his profession , of a distinguished practitioner at the bar , in one of our large cities , often exceeds ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer may not be one thousand . Vermont and New Hampshire , therefore , can support a judiciary at less expense than New York and Massachusetts ; for the salaries of the judges will naturally be proportioned to tbe profits of the lawyers , and as there are no large cities in the former States , both the bench and the bar are contented with comparatively small incomes . It may be added , too , that in these cases , from the limited amount of legal business created by a small population , mostly agricultural in their pursuits , the labors of the judiciary are lighter . At any rate , by offering a moderate salary , the government can command the highest legal ability to be found in the State . At Boston and New York , in order to attain the same end , it must bid higher . The necessities of the State are greater , the business of the courts larger and more important , and proportionally high inducements must be offered , before eminent practitioners will quit lucrative employments for the sake of a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , Governor Thomas complains , that " there is not a State in the whole Union , notwithstanding the population of several of them is quadruple that of ours , where the number of the law-judges , and the amount of their salaries , are not less than those of Maryland . " We doubt the truth of this assertion ; * but if it were well founded , it would be not at all to the purpose . Baltimore is a city of great population and commerce , where the professional earnings of eminent lawyers are probably very great , and the State is obliged to offer them high sala * From the latest authority , " The *meri can qimanac for 1844 , " it ap . pears that New York , not reckoning her courts of Common Pleas , has twenty judges , and pays them ahout $ 44,000 per annum ; Virginia , in her Court of Appeals and Circuit Courts , has twenty-seven judges , and the aggregate of their salaries is $46,550 ; and Pennsylvania , in her Supreme Court , District Courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nineteen districts , has thirty- five judges , whose salaries amount to more than $ 75,000 According to Governor Thomas 's own statement , Maryland has but " twenty-one common law judges and a chancellor , at an expense for their salaries of $36,500 per annum " ; and yet he affirms , that " JWew York , Pennsylrania , Virginia , and Ohio pay respectively a less sum in the annual salaries of their judges than that with which our . treasury is charged " We might adduce several other States , in which the expense of the judiciary is greater than in Maryland ; but the above specimen of the Governor 's accuracy is quite sufficient . // ries before they will abandon their lucrative practice . And it can well afford to do this , considering the magnitude and importance of the business which comes before its judiciary . Ohio has no city the population of which is one half so great as that of Baltimore ; and considering the scattered situation and agricultural pursuits of the great majority of her inhabitants , it is quite probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of Maryland . It is doubtless true , that , in any State , men may be found who will accept a situation on the bench with no higher wages than those of a common ploughman ; but the duties of the office would certainly be performed by them in a ploughman 's fashion . Are the people willing to trust the decision of cases in which their property , their reputations , and even their lives may be concerned , to courts constituted in this fashion ? Is it desirable , that , in all the States , as is notoriously the case in one or two already , such appointments should be made as to render the bench an object of contempt and derision to the bar ? If not , then the small portion of the annual income of the government which is devoted to the support of the judiciary must not be grudgingly given , and the salaries of the judges must rather be increased than diminished . We need not apologize for the length of our remarks on this subject , as there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The financial embarrassments , under which the country has suffered for some time , have induced several of the States , during the past year , to curtail to a considerable amount the sum annually paid to their judges , and a serious injury has thus been inflicted on their judiciary systems , the evil effects of which will be felt for a long period . Pennsylvania , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , and Kentucky have recently effected a paltry saving in this way ; and the legislature even of the rich State of Massachusetts , with a population of three quarters of a million , and property which was assessed two years ago at three hundred millions , while the aggregate annual expenses of the government are considprably less than half a million , deemed it necessary , at its last session , to save the miserable sum of four thousand dollars a year , by cutting off about one seventh from the salaries of all the judges . Divided among the population , this saving amounts to half a cent a head ; and for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the very // foundation of the independence of the judiciary . And it has done this in the face of a provision in the State constitution , which requires , that the judges " shall hold their offices during good behaviour , " and shall receive " honorable salaries ascertained and established by standing laws . " As at one session it has taken off one seventh , at the next it may remove five sevenths , of the salaries , and thus the whole body of the judges may be driven from their posts . If this measure is sanctioned by the people , we hope , for the sake of consistency , that the language of the constitution may be altered , so that this clause shall affirm what is now true , that " the judges hold office during the pleasure of the legislature . " These and similar measures are adopted from the supposed necessity of conforming to the theory of our political institutions by establishing the supremacy of the people on every point , and diminishing the amount of taxation in every possible way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy ! It is not true , that the people desire to have arbitrary power put into their hands , to be used against the requisitions of justice , or that their own burdens should be lessened in an insignificant degree by taking away the freedom and dignity of the legal tribunals . The financial prosperity of a state depends as much on the reputation of her courts of law , as on the funds in her treasury . " Public credit , " says a vigorous writer , " is wealth ; public honor is security . The feather that adorns the royal bird , supports his flight ; strip him of his plumage , and you pin him to the earth . " Not to uphold the common credit by a watchful regard for the common integrity , is to sacrifice the highest interests of the state , and to throw a reproach on the republican name . It is to build up unjust and arbitrary power under the deceitful semblance of a democratic institution . If the judiciary is to be spoiled of its honor and its independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a citizen , are to be made the sport of popular caprice , if the country is to be subjected to all the evils of an uncertain and changeable exposition of the law , it had been better for the people if the Declaration of Independence had never been signed.
