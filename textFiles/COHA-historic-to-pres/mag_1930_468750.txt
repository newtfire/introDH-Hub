A MAN 'S life bifurcates when lie be ? gins to have children : first there is his own childhood , then , like a two or more pronged fork , there follow his adulthood and the childhood of his children . The nature of the one prong is just as much an extension of his earlier years as is the nature of the other . In 1904 I was seven years old , and in 1925 my older son was seven ; it seemed to me that , just as in 1904 a new stage in my personal existence began , so in 1925 another new stage , existing side by side with an adult stage of my very own , and as much my own as that , was beginning . Of course I could not tell where this collateral experience would lead save that the general direction lay farther and farther away from me ? the " me " of more orthodox nomenclature ? until it would finally lead out of sight ; but I did know that there were certain experiences which I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven in 1904 and that these experiences must not be al ? lowed to happen to the " me " who was seven in 192.5 . I must not give the impression , how ? ever , that I regard my children as mere extensions of my own personality ; far from this , I like to feel how little I really know about them in many direc ? tions . Parents who tell you that they know all that goes on in their children 's minds because they are such good friends with them are fools , liars , or hypocrites ; and probably all three . It is a delight to watch the being whom one has seen in a period when stupid though necessary physical functions seemed the sum total of its personality becoming daily moreinscrutable and more independent . But then the " me " who was seven in 1904 seems almost as independent when I think of him ; he is not a dead self , but a friend with whom I have had many con ? versations , hoping to gain from them a clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first let me explain why I use , as if it were a critical moment , the age of seven . Why was it an astonishing adventure of the imagination when I realized that 1 actually had a child who had ceased to be from nought to seven years old and had begun to be from seven to fourteen ? In the first place , when I was very young somebody told me that every cell in the human body is destroyed and renovated in the course of seven years , so that not a vestige of one 's body seven years ago remains to-day . This vague biological generalization became not merely an article of faith to me but an important motif in the emotional pattern of my life . It came to my rescue from time to time and actually was the only thing which made life seem worth living at certain moments of stress . Thus when I was thirteen years old there was a little girl six months my senior whom I kissed one evening behind the front door ; and for some time after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her to make an honest woman of her ; six months later , I discovered that another boy had also , by force I was glad to know , kissed this girl , and that night I lay on my bed saying to myself , " In seven years there will be not one cell of Theresa left ; she 'll all be new ; I must wait until she is twenty-one , and then I shall be able to feel happy again . " On another occasion as a result of mass bullying I had been hurt and soiled ; the little savages ? the " regular boys " of an orthodox English preparatory school ? had spat on me and worse ; and once again I wanted seven years of time to dissolve the cells of my unhappy body and bring new and clean ones in their place . My whole body had become for the time being an offense to me and I could not see how to cleanse it short of this septennial annihilation . But there is a less mystical reason than this : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twain . At that age I left South Africa , where I had been born , and was brought home to England to be educated . I have never revisited my native land , so that those first seven years remain to me an island of memories separated by a broad ocean from the continent of subsequent events . I can know with certainty- that such and such emotions and experiences happened before I was seven if I see them against an African background : it is as if my emotional ontogeny , recapitulating the phylogeny of the human race , at seven left the sea and became a land experi ? ence , so complete is the break between the two existences . And so when I sud ? denly awoke to the fact that I had a son past his seven years ' birthday it was almost as remarkable an event as having him born at all . He had entered into his second period , the period which for me had not been as happy as I could have wished . And I began to bother about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then that I first suspected a fact of which I am now quite certain ? that the quest which most of us modern parents are busily making for the ideal school is a quest without a real end ; and that , in a sense , it has more to do with our own needs than with those of ourchildren . Once upon a time the inade ? quacy of human life this side of the horizon led men beyond the horizon in search of an Earthly Paradise , where rivers of life and wine flowed between trees laden with apples of gold . We have learned now that such Gardens of the Hesperides are dreams , compensating the dreamers for the sorrows and inade ? quacies which are so large a part of reality . Just such another dream is the Perfect School ; a dream place wherein we live again ? in our children 's childhood ? our own childhood free from all those things which were irksome , sad , or cruel in it . And if we are not very careful , our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of education allows his children to go to a more or less experimental school ought to go into seclusion for five minutes every day and ask himself these questions : " Is my child being made to suffer for my childhood ? Shall I he upbraided twenty years hence for exposing him to pre ? cisely the opposite vices to those which injured my young days ? Are my new ideas about education really ideas or only blind revolts or recoils from what hurt me ? " In many cases it seems only too possible that modern parents are seeking vicarious compensation for their own sufferings , real or imagined , rather than thinking first of their children ; and that some modern schools frequented by pasty-faced and messy children are the product not of reason but of rationaliza ? tion . In short , for good and for evil alike , the nature of the children 's child ? hood , it seems , must depend upon the childhood of the parent , so that all par ? ents should be on their guard against the dangers which arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jesuits are agreed that the first seven years of childhood make or mar a man and , therefore , we should all of us concentrate upon a good start for our children during those years at least . But the trouble is nobody knows the first thing about the nature of a good start . Of course no intelligent parent can be taken in for a moment by all the talk about nursery schools and kinder ? gartens ; these may be good or they may be bad , but there is no scientific manner of judging either way . The complicated process of modern life requires that par ? ents should have places to park their offspring as early and as often as possi ? ble , and this is at least a partial justifica ? tion of these institutions . Furthermore , most parents are fools about their chil ? dren for the same reason as they are fools about other people , because they have not sufficient imagination to realize the existence in this world of individuals with needs different from their own ; and this inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous than contact with the parents . But this is as far as we can with decency go ; to pretend that we have discovered a better way of educating is mere superstition . We have invented ways of safeguarding our children from our own inadequacies , but we have no shred of evidence that they will grow up any less inadequate than we . For example , the first step in proving that Mr. Bertrand Russell 's remarkable school is an advance in edu ? cation will be if his son proves to be a more brilliant and a better man than his father , or better still if all the children turn out better than their parents ; and even then the proof will not be rigorous . For all we know , exceptional brilliance is like a beautifully colored gall on an oak leaf , a reaction to a poison ; it may be that a repressed and distorted childhood produces the best sublimations ; and then the proof of a good education will be ab ? sence of abnormal talent in the product . Nor does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts out afresh with a dogma or two , and practically no attempt to find out what has really been done elsewhere , and that nobody tells us of his mistakes or of his gradual compromise and withdrawal from an untenable position . In short , unless parents are going to drug themselves with reliance on insecureeducational doctrines , they must face my main thesis that the childhood of their children is the product of their own childhood modified only by the use of an occasional burst of common sense . For my own part , I am prepared to con ? fess as much and to see in it the reason why I wanted the first seven years of my children 's lives to resemble mine , and the next seven to be as different as possible ; for I was happy from nought to seven and miserable from seven to fourteen . I am not suggesting that it is a reasonable position for any parent to take up , but I do suggest that it is a more honest one than some . What then was this seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's childhood ? In the last years of the dying century my fa ? ther and mother , immediately after their marriage , left England and went to South Africa . They settled in the half-tamed bush country of Zululand , where my father , a clergyman six foot three in height , kept a frontier school for children of at least five races , disagreed with his fellows of the cloth , learned to despise missionaries of every sort , read Huxley and Tolstoi , and cultivated his garden in the spirit of Voltaire . What possible future there was for such a man we can never know , for three years later he was to die . He had overworked in a London slum , read all night instead of sleeping , induced chills by swimming in rough seas for miles round the Isle of Wight , and gener ? ally undermined his colossal frame ; and when he first reached Zululand was al ? ready nursing tuberculosis bacilli . The doctor gave him one hope ? to trek up ? country in a covered wagon across the veldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the four of us , my dying father , my mother , myself aged two , and an infant younger still . The baby died on the veldt , and my father carried him nine miles in his arms to the nearest graveyard , and then we moved on . Only last year , by the way , I read in the papers how some Zulus , infuriated by white mishandling , had desecrated that particular graveyard and torn up all the graves . Then came the Boer War ; we could go no farther . My father , a Tolstoian pacifist , lay dying in a military hospital listening to the guns of Ladysmith ; and then my mother and I were left alone . I was three years old ; my father had taught me how to place a chess board , and the last I remember of him was a disagreement over a game of cards ; and then he became a myth in my life , a myth more powerful than almost any living human being I have ever met since . It is not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare , but that now , thirty years after , thinking of him produces precisely the same detached inebriation as listen ? ing to a string quartet . I have already lived too long for any son of mine to have a like feeling for me ! For four years everybody was too busy to worry much about me , or at least to interfere with me . Such things as heat , trees , thunder storms , and the sight of miles of brown , burnt grassland are my most vivid memories ; and the nearest ap ? proach to a nursery school that I suffered was a quarter of an hour a day at a little green desk where I learned to read and write when my mother was not too busy to find me . And usually she was too busy : for she had flouted her English class conventions and , instead of going home to take her place and mine in the Forsyte Saga of suburban London , she started a toy shop and did dressmaking in a small town in Natal . She had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be independent of her people 's charity so as to save me from the sort of education they would want to impose . So there we have it again my childhood was fixed by her childhood and my father 's and , because of the pain and fu ? tility of theirs , I was saved for freedom and independence under a hot African sun . It is not likely that the American reader can comprehend what this decla ? ration of independence on my mother 's part involved or the extent to which it was bound to deflect the normal course of my development ; because no American has drunk in the English class conven ? tions with his mother 's milk ; nor born within his unconscious the ancestral spec ? ters lurking in ours . As I write I can see the venerable form of my maternal grandfather , a worthy churchman who , at a pinch , would have sat in the same pew as a man who had to do with a shop , but would never dream of ac ? knowledging him in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as others speak of Bolsheviks or Jacobins . By the age of thirty he had reached the position of chief clerk in a city firm , and out of that position he had to be forcibly retired more than fifty years later when he was eighty-three . He was a genial old gentleman , as I re ? member him , and I have nothing against him ; indeed , his long white beard into which egg and coffee invariably de ? scended at breakfast time was the only help I ever had in my attempts to visu ? alize the first person of the Trinity . Probably he regarded it as a personal grievance that my father had not been content to take a refined lady out to Africa but had died there into the bar ? gain and left her stranded . As for his wife , my grandmother , in 1896 she de ? cided that the best way to make other people suffer for her rheumatism would be to refuse to get out of bed and , being iron-willed , she persisted in being bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five flights of stairs and used to ring her electric bell from time to time so as to be sure that the servants would come from the basement " if she really needed them . " When my parents mar ? ried she was much annoyed at the way in which conventional ceremony in the matter of clothes , gifts , and useless para ? phernalia was eliminated , and finally when told of a new accession to the general scheme of economy she said bitterly , " Well , all I can say is , that each day this seems to me to be getting less and less of a wedding and more and more of a marriage ! " To some the meaning of these words will he obscure , to others they will epitomize the Victorian Age . But we must not linger over grand ? parents ; we shall not look upon their like again , and I owe most of what I have to my mother 's struggle against their in ? credibly powerful spirit , a spirit which grimly led my generation on to August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remoteness of a not over-civilized corner of the world ? It gave me silence and solitude , absence of supervision , freedom without cruelty and , above all , the ab ? sence of a conventional herd with stand ? ardized reactions to come between me and my thoughts and feelings . It was a rough life too , and my body was always bleeding from stones and thorns , and bruised from the gentle kicks of adults who wanted me to leave them alone ; but never once was I aware that people existed whose pleasure came from hurt ? ing other human beings . I was to learn that only when I came back to England to be educated . One day , or indeed one bewildering , amazing minute taught me this neces ? sary truth ; it " converted " me as com ? pletely as whatever it was that turned Saul into St. Paul . I can remember the excitement of my going to school for the first time . It was a frosty morning in late September when all the grass was white and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . I arrived one hour too early and waited in a room alone for the other boys , wondering what they would be like , longing for the new thrill of lessons to begin . In later months and years I was to creep up to the school gates as the last bell tolled , taking cover behind trees and hedges , so as to avoid being ambushed by a crowd of boys , whose object it was to knock me down and fill my mouth with mud , partly because I did not like it , and partly to extract from me the answers to lessons which they had not done . The change moreover came quickly . The first Saturday of term my grand ? father came down from London to visit us ; we walked down the long High Street in the dusk , my mother and I , to see him to his train ; he gave me a shilling to spend in exactly the way which would give me most pleasure . No shilling spent on a serious book ever taught anyone as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home from the railway station we stopped at a toy shop and I bought an iron hoop and a hoop-stick with a hooked end , and 1 remember regretting that it was too late in the day to learn how to bowl the hoop before bedtime came ; so I had to fall asleep thinking of how to-morrow was very far away and somewhere in the house a hoop , which ought to be racing along the road , was standing still . On Sunday afternoon we went as al ? ways for a walk together , and only then did the chance come to master this new art : at first I was always picking it out of the hedgerow or watching it sink lop ? sidedly to rest yards ahead in the very middle of the road . We learn to skate in summer and to swim in winter , and that night in sleep I learned to bowl my hoop . Proudly on Monday morning did I go to school and , turning into the play ? ground where the other boys were kick ? ing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastery and certainly a little hope that I should acquire merit by reason of my talent . What was my astonishment when upon their first sight of me , every one of the seventy boys , more or less , stopped kick ? ing the football and gathered round me with howls of derision . As I flushed scarlet , pushes sent me this way and that , and in a flash I realized that I was a little boy who was doing an unheard of thing , bringing a hoop to school , a hoop which only a guttersnipe who went to a free school ought to play with . Very rap ? idly my mind began to work ; first , they must not take my hoop from me , then , I must not cry , then the realization that they were enjoying themselves because I was unhappy , and then a feeling of the irony of it all , a white-bearded old man who with all kindness had given me a shilling and had caused this . He must never know , nor must my mother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , the differ ? ence between solitude in Africa and loneliness in England . The jeering continued until the school bell rang ; but , once only , another voice broke in with , " Oh shut up , you fellows , after all he 's only a kid . " The speaker was probably thirteen years old , nearly twice as old as I and , therefore , an adult ; and the idea that an adult should find an excuse for me helped me to feel that I was not altogether damned . I have for ? gotten the name of everybody on that day except one name , and the only rea ? son why I have never written to remind its owner of the episode is a fear lest if I made the necessary inquiries I should find that he had been killed in the War . If this were an autobiography , instead of a revery over two childhoods and the way in which one boy of seven influences another , even though the first happens to be the father and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a number of things in my life were irrevocably pre ? destined because of a shilling hoop . Because of it I was to run round another street , whenever I could , if I saw a group of small boys coming ? a terror which lasted into adult life and has only begun to be broken by my discovering that my own children , though they are ten years and nine years old , seem to like me and to have no wish to jeer if I meet them in the road . From that day I found my ? self forced to wear a scarlet letter , and all my ideas and feelings were treated by my schoolfellows as if they were bastards . But this is not as relevant to our subject as that , owing to what I learned in thatmoment , my children have never gone to an English preparatory school . Had I been one of the jeerers or the sturdy individual who stood out against the jeering , matters might very well have been different . Of course the episode was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a necessary shatter ? ing of a fool 's paradise . I am quite pre ? pared to admit that , ten years of being bullied , of being plagued by the mass mind of regular boys taught me some lessons ; but the very admission goes to prove that the time has gone by when parents will plunge their children into hell simply cause it may be said with plausibility that they themselves were refined by the hell of their childhood . That indeed is the significant thing ? we parents of to-day are determined to spare the rod even though this may spoil the child . Sparing the rod is the important thing with us and , starting from a determination to spare it , we look with an almost pathetic faith to the verbalisms of " scientific pedagogy , " hoping that they will show us a way of sparing the rod without spoiling the child . So far there is no proof at all that our faith is justified . And yet we can not overestimate the importance of this change ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that children should be " licked into shape . " Pliny centuries ago informed the learned world that bear cubs came into the world as shapeless masses of jelly , and that the mother bear settled down to the task of licking these masses until her tongue had shaped the limbs into their due proportions . Human beings , always true to form , never looked at a new-born bear cub but con ? tinued to read Pliny , so that even in Shakespeare 's day people believed in the jelly which was licked into shape . Finally some Bolshevik had the inde ? cency to upset authority and describe bear cubs as his eyes had seen them . Meanwhile a phrase had become em ? bedded into the language to describe an orthodox educational idea : children needed to be " licked into shape , " and schools were the place to do it . It must have been very unpleasant for the parents . My mother , for ex ? ample , who slaved day and night to clothe and feed me , must have known when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My dying father had said that his education had been ruined by his being shifted about from school to school and had begged her not to make the same mistake with me . Once more childhood of father fixed the childhood of son , and I had to be kept in the school in which I had started . I think it was certainly a good thing in the long run , but it must have hurt my mother at the time . In these days we are not willing to pay the price because we no longer believe that anything is worth the price of un ? happiness ; " licking into shape " has ceased to be part of our educational philosophy . But are our children any happier ? There must be times when the modern parent , after taking a good deal of trouble to ward off the more obvious forms of childhood sorrows , wonders whether children are not after all congenital martyrs . Thus one day at the dinner table one of my boys , aged five at the time , said suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The statement coming unexpectedly produced a smile , more of surprise than anything else ; at once he turned white , burst into tears , and said , " It is n't true ; nothing I say is true " ; and it was hard to console him . The welt ? schmerz of the modern child sometimes defies all adult efforts to control . Child ? hood and sadness can not always exist apart . Indeed , I doubt if we can reduce the sorrows of childhood very much , but at least we have been a little bit more suc ? cessful in increasing the joys . I can re ? member countless pleasures during my African days , most of them experienced alone : I can still feel the joy of long , hot afternoons spent in cutting up leaves intolittle pieces and drying them as I had seen done in the tea plantations ; in playing soldiers with my army of dis ? carded cotton reels collected from my mother 's workroom ? they were so much more amenable to discipline than the ridiculous tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one position ; cotton reels were in any position you cared to imagine ; in watching wild ani ? mals , ants , vultures , spiders , bats , and so on ; in making clay cows with the help of the Zulu girls . I had no pleasures such as these when I went to school ; for even though cricket and football were good fun , they did not smack distinc ? tively of the pleasures of the imagination . Gradually all my emotions went into one thing : I schemed to hurry home as fast as I was able in order to sit down on a particular chair , shut my eyes , put my hand out to the left where the book ? shelves were , and grab and read what ? ever came to my hand . The only saying preserved from my childhood is that when just before he began to die my father asked me to fetch him a book , I replied , " Which one , Degeneration or the Origin of Species ? " From seven to fourteen I read my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sold and brought home to England . It was his copy of Max Nordau 's nonsense and Darwin 's sense that 1 read in snatches after hurrying home from school . But even so , South African pleasures were no more . I am deter ? mined that they shall linger on far longer in my children 's childhood than they did in mine . I confess I am a little puzzled where it is all leading us at present . Certainly the children have their " South African pleasures still , they spend days devising how to shoot the neck of a bottle at ten yards with blank cartridges and how to invent a target which will collect spent shot so that they may be used again . I am particularly pleased at these activities , for when my Tolstoian father died leaving me an orphan at three , and became a " myth " over ? shadowing my whole emotional life , there were probably laid the seeds of my own pacifism ? though when attacked on the subject I base it naturally enough solely on the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be more armed to the teeth than mine , a fact which I take rightly or wrongly as evi ? dence that I am letting them lead their own lives ! It is not so much the pleasures that cause me doubts ; it is the endless criti ? cism which falls from their lips and seems so reasonable . Certainly , for ex ? ample , they are not submitted to the lack of individuality which was a feature of my education ; indeed , there are twenty-five children and seventeen adults to teach them . Are they pleased that the staff is adequate ? Not a bit of it . " What we need if we are ever going to learn anything , " says one of them , " is fewer grownups and more children . " And I believe he is right . Certainly , again , everything is done to stimulate their interests ; indeed , I sometimes think that modern education consists in boy ? cotting all work and putting the hobbies into the curriculum instead . So appar ? ently thinks my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are so many other things to do that you do n't even get time to want to learn . " And again I believe he is right . Curiously enough , just as I ran home as fast as I could from an orthodox school so as to read books , my older son runs home from a " new " school as fast as he can so as to read books . In my case they tried to dull my intellectual pleasures by mak ? ing me learn by heart all the capes and bays on the west and south of Ireland and calling it geography ; in his case there is a tendency to " high hat " the intellect altogether and substitute a number of rather silly handicrafts for any reason ? able form of head work ; but in neither case does it make much difference , at the age of ten we both lay or lie on ourstomachs in our homes to read the EncyclopcEdia Britannica . Meanwhile , in contrast to myself or his older brother , the younger child at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dren to " do for the village what Mr. Hoover is doing for America " ; and in case you do not know what that may be , the club is specifically " to put down bullying and encourage football . " There you have the man of action who goes through life without too many prob ? lems for happiness . In other words , it seems as if whatever the school some children are happy and others less so . I do not think that the older son is happier or less happy than I was ; but 1 am perfectly certain that the younger one is happier than either . And from this I gather among other things that my grandchildren , by my younger son , will go to much the same sort of school as that in which he finds himself , whereas my grandchildren by my older son will go to a school full of discipline , rewards and punishments , fixed subjects , orthodox curriculums , and everything else that is different from his father 's experience . And I only hope , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty years hence , a complaint against his upbringing . What , then , is the conclusion of the whole matter ? Surely that we modern parents will do well to regard the educa ? tion of our children as a matter of emo ? tional experience rather than as a thing to be logically determined . That does not mean that we must not think ; thought is needed for nothing so much as for affairs of the heart and feelings ; it means , however , that if we are to make a success of education , it will be as artists in the art of life , and not as scientists practicing applied sociology . A great deal of modern education is a confession of emotional inadequacy : we make our ? selves believe in " experts " because we are afraid of a difficult human problem . And yet you might as well hand over a love affair to an expert as this other equally personal relationship .                   @ @
