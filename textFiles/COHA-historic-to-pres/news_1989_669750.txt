Soldiers have scrubbed the blood of Beijing citizens from Tiananmen Square , the symbol of the ' ' people ' s republic , ' ' and hoisted bright red flags around the capital for celebrations of the 1949 revolution on Oct. 1. // But since the crushing of popular protests for democracy , China ' s fate has been linked more precariously than ever to the longevity of one man : paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. // Many Chinese say they will never again hail Mr. Deng as their nation ' s savior , a pioneer of bold economic reforms , a deliverer from decades of isolation and catastrophic political campaigns under Mao Zedong. // // ' ' People used to admire Deng , ' ' says a second-year Beijing University student . ' ' Now they hate him , they think he is terrible and worse than Mao. ' ' // Deng lost more than prestige when he denied basic freedoms and sanctioned the Beijing bloodbath . He sacrificed power to conservative party elders and the military , scuttled his succession plans , and endangered his market-oriented economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chinese people will pay the price for Deng ' s failings . Despite his blackened image , Deng remains the man holding this embittered country together . He is still the mediator between the party ' s die-hard revolutionaries and a generation of younger reformers . He is still the bridge , however weakened , between Maoist China and a modern nation. // As rumors of the 85-year-old leader ' s ill health persist , foreign diplomats and scholars offer bleak assessments of the new power balance in China , possible succession scenarios , and the future of Deng ' s modernization strategy. // ' ' Deng is not as powerful as in the past , ' ' says an Asian diplomat . ' ' There are indications that he is losing control of the situation. ' ' // One of the clearest signs of Deng ' s diminished power has been the reemergence of party conservatives such as Chen Yun and Peng Zhen , octogenarians who Deng had persuaded to withdraw into semiretirement in 1987 . Deng enlisted the party veterans to suppress the democracy movement last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , say Beijing-based diplomats on condition of anonymity. // ' ' The old revolutionary leaders are very pleased to find themselves useful , ' ' says the Asian diplomat . ' ' It has been too peaceful for them. ' ' // Recent decisions to intensify Marxist indoctrination , send city youths to farms for ' ' tempering , ' ' tighten state control over the economy , and bolster party committees in factories , schools , and government bodies all bear the stamp of party elders opposed to Deng ' s radical reforms. // Schooled in guerrilla warfare and the crude , heavily ideological politics of the Mao era , the veterans are out of touch with China of the 1980s , diplomats agree. // Party veterans ' ' still think they are dealing with the China of the 1950s , when the public was ignorant and isolated , ' ' the diplomat says. // While summoning back the old guard , Deng has also undermined his earlier efforts to remove China ' s generals from the political arena . By ordering an Army crackdown in June on unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominance that has signaled the disintegration of Chinese dynasties for centuries. // ' ' Deng had attempted to put the military back in the barracks , but that process has been reversed , ' ' said Roderick MacFarquhar , director of the Fairbanks Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University . ' ' The Communist Party was unable to solve the problems it faced by political means , so it effectively abdicated and opted for a military solution. ' ' // Finally , Deng has undercut his goal of achieving a smooth succession by ousting his protege , party general secretary Zhao Ziyang . Mr. Zhao , the victim of increasingly vehement attacks by party conservatives , could face ' ' counterrevolutionary ' ' charges at a party plenum reportedly scheduled for October . Zhao ' s incrimination , while unlikely , would mark a major defeat for Deng , diplomats say. // Having sacrificed his protege and failed to establish a formal procedure for designating a successor , Deng , like Mao , can do little before he dies to prevent a fierce struggle from erupting among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Deng died tomorrow , most observers say President Yang Shangkun would be best positioned to assume the role of paramount leader . However , strong rivalries are believed to divide China ' s regional military commanders , making it difficult for any Chinese leader to command great loyalty , diplomats say. // Mr. Yang is the senior member of a power clique including Premier Li Peng , Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong , and Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing , which has been dubbed the new ' ' Gang of Four ' ' by diplomats in reference to a radical faction led by Mao ' s wife Jiang Qing that rose to power during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. // The new ' ' gang ' ' could be short-lived , however . Yang and the younger men appear to be united by a narrow coincidence of interests : All enjoy greater power under martial law . Yet this tie to martial law has made them extremely unpopular. // Some diplomats say Deng will attempt to groom the new party general secretary , Jiang Zemin , to replace him . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of becoming more than an interim compromise leader such as Mao ' s successor Hua Guofeng , they say. // None of the potential successors commands the broad influence that has enabled Deng to skillfully manipulate competing party factions and push forward bold economic reforms. // China is already moving toward greater central economic planning and ' ' neo-Stalinist ' ' rule that is likely to emerge in the immediate post-Deng era , diplomats and scholars say . The conservative tone is evident in a new , four-point propaganda campaign . Chinese sources say this campaign calls for opposing privatization in economics , pluralism in politics , liberalism in ideology , and individualism in ethics. // Like Qing Dynasty rulers of the early 1900s , who tried in vain to uproot Western influences , Chinese Communist leaders are warning of ' ' hostile imperialist forces abroad ' ' and ' ' bourgeois liberalization ' ' in a bid to stem the flowering of democratic ideals from the West. // Yet both within the party and among city dwellers , there are signs of ongoing resistance to the new conservative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the impact of Western ideas seems to be impossible to contain , an attempt will be made to prevent things from going too far , ' ' said Professor MacFarquhar. // ' ' Just as when the empress dowager tried to hold back the tide , there is a danger that the dam will burst and all will be swept away.
