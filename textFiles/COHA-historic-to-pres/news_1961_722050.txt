PARIS , Sept. ** month Khrushchev confided to a foreign diplomat : " If the West Germans lost faith in the West they will turn to us . They have no place else to go . " When this confidence was passed on to allied Ambassadors in Moscow , one remarked : " We must be very careful . Morale in Berlin is dissolving fast . " Since this conversational incident , two enormous and unexpected ergs have occurred to further change the situation . Hammarskjold 's tragic ' death incalculably reduced U. N. 's capacity to play a significantly helpful role in easing the Berlin crisis . And the Federal German elections have so weakened Chancellor Adenauer 's position that one can no longer predict with flat certainty how Bonn 's long-range foreign policy will evolve . The foundation of Adenauer 's personal attitude was that total alignment with the West would in the end secure East Germany 's liberation and return . But , after all these years , that solution , never realistic , seems even more distant than before . There are increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East German state . Meanwhile , Khrushchev tries both to frighten the neutrals and wear away allied resolve . His most recent warnings have been addressed to Norway , Denmark and Greece . Allied resolve still appears satisfactory , but there is telling simplicity to the slogan " Why die for Berlin ? " And it is hard to explain the intricate ramifications of the problem when Khrushchev blandly promises a protected " free " status for West Berlin . Whether or not Adenauer can long remain at the helm , the weight of his policy suggestions is henceforth bound to lighten . Erhard , whose political fortunes are rising , is less stubbornly proFrench than Adenauer and more pro-British . His foreign policy thoughts may prove more supple than those of the adamant de Gaulle , more attuned to what Khrushchev himself . calls " British wisdom , " more intent on seeking compromise .

" And no matter how the political cards are shuffled , it is evident that Defense Minister Strauss will assume more and more importance . Apart from the dynamics of his own personality , his Bavarian fraction of the dominant party did much better than Adenauer 's . Strauss , too , is not so entirely proFrench as Adenauer . He feels that , strategically speaking , Paris has been trying to make of Germany a kind of defensive Maginot Line behind which French guerrilla units could form . Nor does he think the United States has given West Germany adequately modern weapons in sufficient numbers . Strauss is tough toward the Russians and one may assume he will do everything now to have parliament enact a law increasing military service from twelve to eighteen months . He is against anything that smacks of a " deal " between Bonn and Moscow . But he fears that opposition to such a deal will decrease if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " militaristic , conscienceless " nation . Strauss is a close student of history and logic , above all Thucydides and St. Augustine . He envisions his country 's future as a strong component in a strong Western Europe . But if this can not be achieved , he sees Germany some day attempting to maneuver between West and East  --  and succumbing to the East . This is therefore the new atmosphere surrounding the increasingly grim crisis . U. N. 's potential has been enfeebled . West Germany 's ultimate policy may  --  or may not become confused . The only constant is Khrushchev 's ambition . There has - been speculation that the Soviet Premier , needing some flashy success before his party Congress next month , might postpone that meeting and speed up his schedule . In that event he could call for an East German peace conference before the Congress . Now , however , the death of his enemy Hammarskjoid and its crippling effects on U. N. plus what is tantamount to a defeat for his enemy Adenauer may give him a feeling that luck is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
