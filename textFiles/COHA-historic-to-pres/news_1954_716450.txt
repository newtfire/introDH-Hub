Former President Hoover returned , Aug. 10 , to the white clapboard cottage in West Branch where he was born , to receive a round of official honors celebrating his 80th birthday . He came prepared to deliver a major speech on foreign and domestic policies . West Branch  --  population 789 ? expected some 50,000 persons to converge on the green and manicured lawns that now surround Mr. Hoover 's birthplace . The little town bedecked itself with flags and banners , loaded up with fried chicken and potato salad , nailed unfamiliar ' one-way-street " signs to the trees and light poles , and happily prepared for the engulfing army . His sons , Herbert , Jr. , and Allan and their families were with him . The delegation of Iowans meeting him included Gov . William S. Beardley , Dr. James H. Hilton , president of Iowa State College ; Virgil M. Rancher , president of the University of Iowa , and other officials . Vice-President Richard M. Nixon , originally scheduled to represent President Eisenhower , teregrapnea ne would not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hoover birthplace : " I regret that because of close votes on farm legislation scheduled for tomorrow , I will be unable to join with you in honoring Herbert Hoover on the occasion of his 80th birthday . " Mr. Anderson said Wilbur M. Bruckner , representing the Department of Defense , would speak in Mr. Nixon 's place . Mr. Hoover himself is the main speaker . His prepared address was largely devoted to the 20-year period between the end of his own administration in 1932 and the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower . Much of it discussed the foreign policies pursued during those years by the United States  --  especially with respect to the Soviet Union . Other major sections , however , set forth Mr. Hoover 's views on what he called " socialism " and on his contention that the original pattern of American government  --  the separation of powers among the three main branches  --  have suffered dangerous changes . Prior to his speech he first visited the three-room cottage where he was born . It stands on the corner of Penn and Downey Streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitewash and shaded by ancient trees . It has two rooms , one of which is mainly filled by a large double bed with rope springs . The other contains the yellowing photographs of Mr. Hoover 's family , going back to his grandparents , his books , and his baby high chair . A shed , built onto the house , officially constitutes a third room . Mr. Hoover lived here until he was nearly six years old . His father was the village blacksmith , his mother a Quaker schoolteacher . Both passed on before he ' was 10 , and he then went to live on a nearby farm with one of his uncles . More than 17,000 persons have visited the house this year , the caretaker , John Thompson , said . On the now-capacious grounds , tents were erected for an old-fashioned picnic at noon . Mr. Hoover was to receive an honor- I ary degree of doctor of laws prior to delivering his speech . In front of the cottage is a I plaque which records that this was the birthplace of " Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President born west of the Mississippi . "
