" Costa Rica is like Tangiers or Casablanca . There are spies everywhere . " <P>  --  John Hull , rancher <P> The locals call him el Patron . A tough-talking , leathery native of Indiana , he came to Costa Rica in the early 1960s and carved out his own Central American Xanadu , 40 miles south of the Nicaraguan border . The 1,500-acre ranch where he raises cattle and grows oranges is the centerpiece of six properties he owns or manages . Once a week the modern-day feudal baron and his Costa Rican wife Margarita ride out on horseback to check on the 100 workers in their employ . El Patron also enjoys climbing into his blue-and-white Cessna and taking off from one of his half-a-dozen or more airstrips to survey his fiefdom from a God's-eye view . <P> But lately there has been trouble in John Hull 's paradise . The threat of assassination has prompted the 66-year-old rancher to ship his two children to the U.S. Barricades have been installed along the perimeter of his main estate . The ranch-house roof has been reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows to repel grenades . Until recently as many as five bodyguards , paid a total of $800 a month , watched over Hull and his wife . This protection , says Hull , was provided by his stateside patron : the CIA . <P> Hull , a dual citizen of the U.S. and Costa Rica , says the U.S. intelligence community once counted him among its most valuable assets along Nicaragua 's southern border . When Congress was constraining the Reagan Administration from supporting the contras ' war against Nicaragua 's Sandinista regime , Hull was a leader of the network that helped sustain the rebels ' " southern front . " His airstrips were used by planes that supplied U.S. weapons , food and clothes to the contras , his ranch house was the site of delicate negotiations among contra factions , and he was a conduit for money used to support rebel activities . Directly across the San Carlos River from Hull 's ranch sits a powerful radio transmitter for the Voice of America , which broadcasts daily into Nicaragua . Though Hull claims he was never on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency liaison , " providing information to my government . " <P> The CIA support evaporated when the Iran-contra scandal broke last year , says Hull , and now el Patron is the target of major investigations and a controversial lawsuit in the U.S. " In the news media and absolutely nowhere else , I have been accused of being a CIA agent , a drug smuggler and an assassin , " declared Hull in a statement he says he made last summer to the office of Iran-contra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh . " I can assure you that if the assassination charge were true , there are people walking the streets today that would have long since been six feet under . " <P> The latest inquiry into Hull 's activities began two weeks ago , when the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Terrorism , Narcotics and International Affairs opened hearings in Washington to probe U.S. Government loans to Hull and examine charges that contra suppliers operating from Hull 's ranches had been flying shipments of cocaine and marijuana into the U.S. Said Subcommittee Special Counsel Jack Blum : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( contras ' ) ) war was used as a cover for narcotics operations .
