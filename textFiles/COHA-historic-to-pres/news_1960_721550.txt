The International Court of Justice 11 ; 10 today that Nicaragua was obligated to give effect to a 1906 arbitration award settling boundary with Honduras . The award , which was made by King Alfonso XIII of established a boundary line that would cause the transfer Sto Honduras of frontier regiotis claimed by Nicaragua . Nicaragua informed Honduras in 1912 that , she challenged the award . Repeated attempt , ' toward settling the issue failed until 1957 , when the Organized . tion of American States brought about an agreement between the two countries to submit the case to the World Court . - The court supported the 190$ // award by a vote of 14 to 1 . The vote against judgment was cast by Urrutia Holguin , a Colombian Ambassador who had been designated by Nicaragua to " sit as a member of the court for this case . The disputed area is called the Mosquito Coast , or Mosquitia . It is a vast , underdeveloped , sparsely settled region extending 150 miles along the Caribbean coast . It extends inland like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , and Nicaragua , to the south . King Alfonso fixed the ' boundary mainly along the Segovia ( Coco ) River , but Nicaragua claimed the entire , 3ilosquito Coast as her own . Honduras Lauds ' Ruling After today 's decision , Dr. Esteban Mendoza , speaking for Honduras , praised the court 's ruling . " The fact that the judgment of the court was issued by the unanimous vote of the permanent judges , " he said , " is a clear demonstration of the final character of international awards and that justice was on the side of Honduras . " He added : " If , as previously agreed , Nicaragua voluntarily gives prompt execution to the arbitral award , the relations between both countries from now on will rest on sound bases of fraternity and trustworthiness . " Nicaraguans Are Critical The representatives of Nicaragua in the case , Ambassadors Jos6 Sanson-Teran and Diego , M. Chamorro , commented : " We did not expect the decision so soon for the relevant importance of the case for two small states of Central America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself without studying it very carefully and without instructions of our Government . " One wonders nevertheless about the far-reaching repercussions of this decision in the whole institution of international arbitration and many other matters of modern international law . " The brilliant pleadings of our jurists will undoubtedly be . great help to evaluate this decision , notwithstanding the fact that it is going to be very difficult for the jurists of our Western Hemisphere to understand why some fundamental principles of inter-American law were completely overlooked . " Challenge Held Proper The pleadings by lawyers for Nicaragua mentioned in the Nicaraguans ' statement argued that the Latin-American states had customarily considered ar- , bitration awards as open to challenge on factual grounds . That view was one of the points stressed by Acting Judge Holguin in his dissenting opinion . ) He said that Nicaraguan authorities decided soon after the 1906 award that the award needed to be revised . It was a recognized principle in interAmerican affairs then that arbitration awards might be revised because of errors made by the arbitrator in reaching a judgment , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant that all the other judges sitting in the case  --  including jurists from both sides of the Iron Curtain  --  rejected that view . They ruled in effect that once a valid arbitration award was made in an international dispute it became effective and remained so thereafter despite any lapse of time in carrying it out . It was said that the broad support for arbitration displayed in today 's judgment laid the groundwork for the future settlement of many international problems . The World Court declared that the King of Spain was a proper arbitrator under the terms of an 1894 treaty between Honduras and Nicaragua that provided for eventual arbitration of unsettled boundary questions . Nicaragua accepted the King 's decision at that time , the court said . Before King Alfonso 's arbitration award , a commission worked out a boundary from the Pacific Ocean to Totecacinte , but it disagreed about the line from there to the Atlantic Ocean . Representatives of Honduras and Nicaragua then induced the Spanish King to act as arbitrator.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
