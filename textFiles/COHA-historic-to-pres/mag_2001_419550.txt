A teammate 's view of the effect Michael Jordan 's comeback is haveing on the Wizards BY SEAN DEVENEY PHOTOS BY BOB LEVERONE Photograph Whitney ( right ) has seen a new attitude emerge among his teammates because Jordan provides the possibility of winning . // Chris Whitney is standing in front of his locker at the MCI Center in Washington , buttoning his dress shirt after a win over Philadelphia . He looks down at his chest . He 's in good shape , but not so good that he wants to appear shirtless on TV . So the television cameras-there are four-wait as he buttons . " I am going to get with Tim Grover next summer , " he says . " I got to get built up so I can look good for these interviews . " It 's understandable that Whitney , the Wizards ' starting point guard , is not used to such attention . Interviews have been rare for Whitney in his NBA career , but now that his locker is next to that of his new teammate , Michael Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's get this straight . " My locker is not next to his , " Whitney says . " His locker is next to mine . Make sure you write that . " Fair enough . It 's an important distinction because no player has suffered more with the Wizards than Whitney . He signed with Washington in March 1996-he was a Bullet back then  --  and has managed to avoid the organizational purges the do n't expect Whitney to be intimidated by some newcomer . " This is my team , " Whitney says with a smirk and a pause . " But do n't write that one . " Sorry , Chris . This has been the feeling that has emerged out of Wizardville in the infancy of this NBA season , Michael Jordan 's first after a three-year hiatus . The Wizards can be relaxed . They can joke , even at Jordan 's expense ( as long as he is out of earshot , at least ) . Because although the team might be imbued with a sense of lightheartedness it has not known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winning that Jordan 's return suddenly has given the Wizards . When it comes to winning , Jordan is very serious . " It is a completely changed attitude , " Whitney says . " It was always good for me to come to work because I just like playing basketball . But the atmosphere was not always great here . Now , we have media following us , we are on TNT and NBC , and all that . That makes it fun . I did n't know it was going to be this much fun . And what 's best is we think we can win . " As an executive , Jordan was subpar and kept his distance . Before last season , he said the Wizards would finish at least .500 and would make the playoffs , but that delusion unraveled quickly . Instead , they finished 19-63 , the second-worst mark in team history . He was not around the team much but said he was watching them daily , getting so frustrated with their play he " threw ( stuff ) at the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Jordan was so seldom seen . That , obviously , has changed . Unable to have an impact on the team from a management seat , Jordan is , as Wizards forward Popeye Jones says , " in the foxhole with us now , which makes a big difference . " It makes a big difference because the Wizards have shown very little will power in recent years . Will is one thing Jordan is not lacking . " They have never seen passion like this , " he says . " It 's us against the world . We 've got to lay it on the line every minute . We 're all in this together . " It is midway through the second quarter of the win over Philadelphia in the Wizards ' home opener , but victory already seems an unlikely outcome . Jordan has been sitting at the end of the bench for a couple of minutes . The Wizards have fallen behind , 29-22 , and have gone on a two-minute scoring drought . After a turnover and two bad shots , Jordan has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his warmup jersey . Coach Doug Collins looks surprised to see him , but Jordan wants back in the game , and Collins is not going to stop him , as he did two nights before in Atlanta . That night , Jordan wanted to forgo his scheduled rest at the end of the third quarter , but Collins talked him out of it by telling him , " Trust your teammates . If I do n't rest you , we ca n't finish this game : That time , Jordan sat . But now , it 's the second quarter , and Jordan is checking himself back in . " He knows what this team needs , " Collins says . " His will is what drives this team . " " He does what needs to be done , " Whitney says . " I 'm not going to argue with him . He is Michael Jordan . We are still getting used to playing with him , playing with someone who dominates the ball like that . I have never played with someone who dominates the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very determined . " Two nights earlier , in a win over Atlanta , Jordan had shown a more vocal kind of determination . The Wizards trailed the Hawks , 53-49 , at the half , and when the players got to the locker room , they got a sharp tongue lashing from Jordan . He wanted better execution . He wanted better effort . He yelled . He used foul language . But he was careful not to turn the halftime meeting into a self-serving speech . He never brings up his past with his current team . " He keeps the focus on us , " Jones says . " He never talks about things like , he did not come back to lose like this , or we are hurting his history or anything . I know you all do n't believe it , but he came back to help this team , not to prove anything . " Jordan also said such halftime outbursts will be rare . When the Wizards were down again against the 76ers , he left the talking to Collins , who delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in the second half . The Wizards outscored the Sixers , 55-33 . This represents a major change for Washington . Last season , the Wizards were an awful third-quarter team , unable to hold leads and even more unable to overcome deficits . They lost 47 of the 57 games in which they were tied or behind at halftime . This season , so far , halftime deficits are not a problem . " Last year , every game it seemed like we would get off to a slow start , and we 'd come in at halftime and get together and say , We got to change this , " Whitney says . " We would try , too . But you also knew what was going to happen . Regardless of how we tried , majority of time , it did not work , and you wind up looking at the scoreboard and hanging your head a little . " It 's different this year . There is a confidence now , we know we can win . " Whitney , as much as anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney earned the team president 's respect during the misery of last season , as the Wizards suffered through injuries , a roster overhaul , three arrests and two on-court blowouts at former coach Leonard Hamilton ( one of which involved Hamilton summoning arena security to have Tyrone Nesby removed from the sideline ) . Whitney emerged as a team leader . He stood and cheered teammates no matter the score or circumstances . He played as long as he could despite two sprained ankles that got worse with every game . He was the guy players sought out for advice on plays and positioning . Now , it is Jordan who directs traffic on the court . He makes the loud pronouncements , and players are supposed to follow what he says . But Whitney still has his role-players still come to him , especially when they do n't want Jordan to know they are uncertain about something . " Mike is out there , always talking , " Whitney says . " He 'll let you know when you are doing something wrong . Guys still come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable coming to me one-on-one . All Mike has to do is say something , and everybody listens . That alone is different than last year , or in the past . " It helps that Whitney has played well so far . Over the summer , he was told he would have to win his starting job from freeagent signee Tyronn Lue , but Whitney has been making shots . Jordan seems to trust him , as he did with some of the shooters on his old Bulls teams . When Jordan faces double- or triple-teams , Whitney is one of the guys he looks for to take an open shot . Lue has had difficulty getting off the bench because of it . Photograph Jordan 's will to win is crucial to the Wizards ' potential success , Collins says . // " Chris is like my Steve Kerr or John Paxson , " Jordan says . " If he 's hitting his shots , it allows me to operate under the radar screen . Teammates say Jordan 's biggest contribution to the team also is under the radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post , or drawing fans and national attention to a moribund franchise , Jordan has been a glue for the team . He gives the Wizards , who have been so fractured in recent years , what Collins calls " a connectedness . " He is the game 's most fierce competitor , but his ability to relax , have a beer and play cards when the game is over is just as important . " We 'll get on the team plane , and it 'll be fun , " Whitney says . " We might talk about the game a little , but it 's not like that is all there is to it . He 'll talk to everyone , we 'll joke around , some guys will be playing games . That 's not something we have always had here . " It goes beyond relaxing , though . Staying together off the court affects what happens on the court . " Doug and Mike came in and preached cohesiveness , " Jones says . " We had no idea what that meant . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I 'll score myself ; I do n't need you guys to help me : If they got an easy basket , it was , Well , it was not my man who scored . " ' The change from last season already has begun to take hold , and no Wizard appreciates it more than Whitney . " The difference is night and day , " he says . " I 'll let you guess which one is night and which one is day . " Photograph A fierce competitor , Jordan also is a team guy .
