Accused . David Belasco 's second production is a sound and courtly contribution to the season 's more serious drama - as far a cry from the tawdry Ladies of the Evening , which he did last year to fatten his purse , as can be easily imagined . <P> Possibly the fattening derived from the unlovely Ladies may indirectly have made Accused a reality . The new play is an expensive matter , employing as it does E. H. Sothern among its luxurious adjuncts , and decidedly a wild financial risk. * <P> The production is a risk because it is old fashioned . It is a leisurely piece with a purpose . Brieux , French author of the original , is inclined to propaganda ( Damaged Goods and The Red Robe ) . Modern plays have hurried things up be hind the footlights . If they have a sermon to preach they take care to cast it in intensive words and action . Accused is largely argument , brilliant and searching argument to be sure , but developed in long paragraphs . <P> A murder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never defended a case in which he is not convinced of the innocence of his client , takes the case . The wretched , half crazy husband of a lovely woman has been killed . She is charged . Deep in the play the lawyer discovers that she is guilty , despite her insistence to the contrary . To complicate matters he is in love with her . His problem , then , is whether to go through with the case or by dropping it virtually insure her conviction by his very act . He carries on and wins her freedom . <P> E. H. Sothern , some 65 years old , his snow-white hair dyed black , gives a distinguished and a dominating performance . It is withal an elderly performance , reminiscent of an earlier generation in the Theatre , cut and gestured to measure ; yet it has a quality of thoroughness and intelligence that makes it tower above the peculiarities of much of the present day acting . The play is a vocal treat , for Sothern 's is probably the finest speaking-voice we know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this play mightily last season , and the earliest spectators were hopeful . They were sharply set down . It turned out to be an unskilful echo of The Show-Off , well played but cheap and dreary . <P> The young man who has most to do is a talker . He talks so much and so smoothly that he does not bother to work . The system suffices until he talks another man out of his fiancee and marries her himself . Then , in a heroic bit of utter implausibility in the last act , he talks himself into his rich uncle 's favor . Apparently he is going to go through " life on the same principle . Not a bad idea , but is it practicable ? <P> Allen Dinehart and Jessie Crom-mette make the evening possible with excellent performances-the former as the hero , and the latter as the bewildered mother of the girl who marries him . <P> A Holy Terror . John Golden is chiefly famous for clean plays-a fame in no small measure achieved by his own insistent advertising of the fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist of his first play this autumn caused comment . The profanity was not , it is true , intense . But remember the crooks in Turn to the Right and the apaches in Seoenfh Heaven . They never said damn or hell .
