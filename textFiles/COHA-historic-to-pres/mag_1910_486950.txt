The Finer Grain . By Henry James . ' New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . He thought he had already , poor John Berridge , tasted in their fulness the sweets of success ; but nothing yet had been more charming to him than when the young Lord , as he irresistibly and , for greater certitude , quite correctly figured him , fairly sought out , in Paris , the new literary star that had begun to bang , with a fresh red light , over the vast , even though rather confused , Anglo-Saxon horizon ; positively approaching that celebrity with a shy and artless appeal . Thus characteristically opens the initial story in this latest group of Mr. James 's studies . To read the sentence aloud is to realize how far the speech of print may come to vary from its natural model . The second semi-colon , flung out as a life-belt at the last desperate moment , is all that fetches one through . Nobody could have invented a more taking parody of the Jacobite style . And to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his latter phases to the helpless imitation of his own mannerit may well be feared that Mr. James is destined to arrive are long . Never has ' his substance seemed so attenuated , his manner so uselessly finicking , as in these five studies , as we must again say . For they are not tales , or stories at all , so much as disquisitions apropos of certain shadowy incidents . There is no lack of the material of fiction , but the writer scorns to deal with it except with pince-nez and pincers . The affair of John Berridge thus reduces itself to bald terms : Berridge the author is made up to by the lord , and besought to give an opinion of a book written by a friend of his lordship 's . The book shows itself beneath contempt at a glance ; and Berridge 's confusion is great when the friend turns out to be a lovely princess to whose eyes he has already succumbed . It is worse confounded when , in all her " Olympian " loveliness , she flatly demands Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an Olympian she succeeds in carrying him off in her motor-car for a loitering drive through nocturnal Paris . But the enchanting intimacy of the experience is blasted by her vulgar purpose . Heart-brokenly he confesses his inability to do what she asks. - " Then you do n't like me ? ? " - she murmurs , driven to the last feminine bulwarks " Princess , " was in response the sound of the worshipper , " Princess , I adore you . But I 'm ashamed for you " ' Ashamed ? ? " " You sic Romance  --  as everything , and by what I can make out , every one about you is ; so what more do you Want ? Your ' Preface  --  the only one worth spe-aking of  --  was written long ages ' ago by the most beautiful imagination of man . " She can not comprehend ; and the kiss he presses upon her wondering lips at a parting which he assures her is final , merely seals his tribute to Romance . The substance of the following episodes is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be , rather than of the finer grain . disjointed structure of the book appears to be an effect of design to emphasize the juxtaposition and grotesque incompatibility of the animal and the intellectual natures , the insuitability of the mind to its tenement . The divorce of-M . Bergeret seems to have a certain symbolical significance ; in the life of reason , it seems to suggest , there can be no truce with the body . Now , there is something unwholesome in the intellectual detachment of M. Bergeret . In spite of his monastic withdrawal from the : dealt , he is troubled at times by the visions of St. Anthony . " Were I , for instance , " he says on one occasion , " to express all the fancies that crowd my mind at this moment , all the notions which pass through my head , like a swarm of witches riding on broomsticks down a chimney , if I were ' to describe the manner in which I see Madame Gromance , . . . the vision of her which comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indecent than that famous figure introduced in the scene of the Last Judgment on the north portal of Saint-Exupere by a masterly craftsman who had caught a glimpse of Lust himself as he leant over a vent-hole of hell ; if I were accurately to reveal the ' strangeness of my dream , it would be concluded that I am prey to some repulsive mania . " This passage suggests the snake that lurks in the garden of Epicurus ; a taint of sensuality , sometimes violent , sometimes nearly imperceptible , is almost everywhere discoverable in the works of Anatole France . His serenity , one is compelled to feel , is not so much achieved as thrust upon him - by the spontaneous recoil of a powerful sensual imagination . It is the serenity of disgust  --  a disgust which is rather the cause than the result of his philosophy . A Successful Wife . By G. Dorset . New York : Harper &; Bros . This book may be read as a wholesome antidote to David Graham Phillips 's coincident effusion , " The Husband 's Story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . It presents the case of the " American woman " from a very different point of view , or , rather , it presents a very different variety of that genus from that which is now most commonly put upon exhibition . Here is no picture of the worthy but fatuous American male in the act of being bled and trod upon by the rapacious and dissolute creature whom he patiently calls wife . The shoe is quite upon the other foot . The woman who is supposed to tell , . he story belongs to an old-fashioned order : a sort of Griselda , with the instinct of service , of endless courage and patience , and yet with a high spirit of her own which asserts itself at the crucial moments of her experience . She has that mingling of intellectual artlessness and practical acuteness which is so common among American girls of her class . For she has a class : that of the small shopkeeper , the drummer , and the saleswoman . She herself is a stenographer , and at fifteen has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does not lose the earmarks of class , and her story is told with remarkable consistency of style . " I do n't think there is a creature living who would not love to be ' successful , ' and who is n't ready to spend twenty-five cents , or even twenty-five dollars , on a book which would tell them how to succeed . You hear such a lot of talk nowadays about success ! , " In this utterly commonplace vein her tale is for the most part told . She has no apprehension of words as anything more than vague counters . She pronounces Swinburne " very pretty , " and Mr. Kirkland 's remonstrance means nothing to her , though she re -- ports , it faithfully : " Now , for instance , " he suggests , " you would n't call this scarlet wall of quivering foliage , this liquid-hearted corner of the woods , nice , would you ? " I said yes , that I thought it was very nice indeed . - Mr. Kirkland thereupon abandons the vocabulary , but he marries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain . He is an " artist , " a genius , and , of course , a good deal of a scapegrace . The experience of this wedded pair is not smooth , but it is not conventionally rough , either . The woman has the fidelity and the sturdy endurance of her kind . Even in her hardest youthful struggles with poverty , she had never consented to be pitiful : " Nobody knew when I was tired , frightened , or disheartened ; I did n't have feelings that were hurt , and I did n't cry . " Nevertheless , there is a treasured self behind an inner citadel of this apparently commonplace nature . Eventually , the husband discovers it , and in the same moment beholds his own comparative littleness : and in that moment begins their real union . Deep in Piney Woods . By J. W. Church . New York : Thomas Y. Crowell &; Co . In this story of the turpentine belt of Georgia , where thrive the mysteries and horrors of the Voodoo religion , that dread cult of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household which has preserved from the ruin of the civil war much of its former prosperity and ease . Major Claiborne , comfortable and picturesque , if archaic in his manner of life ; Brett Heed , the hero , born in the South , but trained in the North , and successful in every conflict ; Savannah , the Major 's daughter , and the various negroes , though all are drawn ' conventionally , will doubtless appeal to those to whom a romance laid in the South is ever dear . That the negro problem should enter into the plot was of course inevitable , considering the Northern education of the hero .
