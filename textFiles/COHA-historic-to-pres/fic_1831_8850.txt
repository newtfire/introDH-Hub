Jones , he returns his sincere thanks , for his admirable and manly personation of the character of Demetri ; as well as for his friendly assistance in the suggestion of the alterations , that tended so advantageously to increase the dramatic effect of the piece ; and the skill and care he exhibited in the arrangement of the combats , &c.; To Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to her beautiful and effective performance of the character of Zella , he feels that the success of this drama may with more justice be attributed , than to any intrinsic merit it possesses .

Once , once could Demetri mingle in the happy throng of his companions ; dance with the maideus of his native valley , and join in the glad song and merry aborus .

Katusthius Ziani Thanks , thanks , Demetri ; a change has come over my fortunes , and I have come to claim the performance of your vow . Dem . Demetri Hush  --  not here , not here . Ziani ; come to my dwelling . I can serve you , for I have power to make the boldest quail and tremble beneath my glance . Come to my dwelling , Ziani ; I 'll gaze on thee in friendship , but wo to those , on whom I look in anger . Come  --  come . Exeunt Demetri and Ziani , R. Zadric and Alexis come forward . Zadric .

The Klephtai and Females come slowly down on either side . Hush ! I 'll tell it thee anon , Zadric ; our coinrades are about leaving us , and it is a tale as well told when we are by ourselves  --  What ! are ye going , my merry men ? well , well , men that have to rise betimes , do well to retire early to rest .

Alexis , do n't frighten a body so . You know , there is not a braver man in the band than I am , particularly after having emptied a flagon or two ; but I have a mortal aversion to all sorts of supernatural terrors . But has his eye really the power the old women say it has ? Alex . Alexis Ruin has been said to follow , where its glance has rested in anger ; he seems himself invulnerable , and I have heard it said he has leagued himself with one , we will not name ; for he has dared the wild beast in his lair , and escaped unhurt ; he has assailed the Mainote in his port of refuge , and been the conqueror .

I verily believe , hereafter , I shall be afraid to look Demetri in the face ; for , if I should once see his eye fixed upon mine , I should think it all over with me indeed  --  but you can finish the story at my cottage ; come , comrade , come . Exeunt , L. SCENE II .  --  Interior of the Cottage of Demetri , decorated with warlike instruments and skins  --  two rude stools . Enter Demetri and Katusthius Ziani , R. Dem . Demetri Now , Ziani , welcome to my mountain home . Speak freely  --  how can I serve you ? Katus . Katusthius Ziani Demetri , you have the power to give me happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wretched . Dem . Demetri How say you ? to give thee happiness  --  Pray ! by what means ? speak freely to me , thy friend . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Demetri , you may remember in the battle field of Boularias , when thy noble charger fell , I threw my body between thee and the uplifted sword of thy enemy , and on my shield received the blow that would have sent thee to thy ancestors . You may remember , too , that then you swore by your faith , and the honour of Albania , to aid me in any cause , in which you could serve me  --  you pledged your faith , your gratitude  --  do you disclaim the debt ? Dem . Demetri My life 's preserver need not remind me of what I owe  --  command my life . In what can the mountain Klepht aid the son of the wealthy Ziani ? Katus . Katusthius Ziani The son of Ziani is a beggar , and most perish , if you , his friend , deny your assistance . Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it has been adventurous and guilty ; I neglected the counsel of my early advisers , and when I returned to my native land , I found that the fortunes of my father were lost to me : he had acknowledged another as his heir . I found this younger brother , with his wife and child , possessed of my inheritance . He offered to divide the property ; but , no , Demetri , I must and will have all . I know him only as a base impostor , who has deprived me of my honest rights , and I have sworn revenge ; and thou , my friend , must aid me to obtain it . Dem . Demetri Where does this impostor dwell ? Katus . Katusthius Ziani Near Corinth . He has an only child , a boy , whom you must first remove  --  therefore , assist me with your sword , or blast the offspring of this usurper , with the reputed power of your eye . Dem . Demetri Ha ! you have heard the superstitious tale  --  yes , Ziani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorned Demetri , tremble beneath its glance ; with but a look , I have quelled the spirit of rebellion . I have seen mothers mantle their children from my sight , lest my evil eye should wither the offspring of their affection ; and I have laughed with a joy unutterable , to see the weak and timid sons of men , shrink from my gaze , like terror stricken infants  --  therefore , Ziani , command my sword , and the power of the evil eye , as thou wilt , for both are thine . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Thanks , my more than friend , for you have raised me from despair and saved me from a brother 's murder  --  but tell me , Demetri , the cause of your hatred to mankind ? why , with a deadly feeling of revenge , do you pursue the Mainotes ? Dem . Demetri Ziani , thy deep rooted friendship prevents me from looking in anger upon thee ; for from thee only , would I excuse such question . But thou art my life 's preserver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , Ziani , in the valley of Korvo , and passed my days of childhood amid the wild mountains of Albania . Having a desire for knowledge , I travelled the continent of Europe , for that purpose . I returned to my native country , and became an inhabitant of the island of Scio . Often did I revisit and defend my native hills ; and , under the banner of the renowned Ali , beat back the bold invading Turk ; and then , in peace , returned to my island home . Ah ! beloved Scio ! the days of thy prosperity have passed away ; those of thy chivalry will no more return , but like early vapour , struck by the morning sunbeam , swept from earth , as though they had never been . Weeps . Katus . Katusthius Ziani What ! a tear , Demetri ? Dem . Demetri Yes , Ziani , nor think I am ashamed to shed a tear , when I think what Greece once was , what now she is . But my sorrow springs from a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the destruction of my domestic peace . In the island of my adoption , I became enamoured of a lovely Sciote girl ; beautiful as the first rose the balmy breath of summer warms to life ; as virtuous as she of old , who , by her death , gave liberty to Rome . With my beloved Helena , all was happiness , prosperity and peace . Our love was blessed with a beauteous daughter , and our wedded life promised to be one of continued sunshine . The position of Albania again called for my assistance ; I flew to her rescue , and again drove the invader back to the confines of his native land . I returned in triumph to the island of Scio ; my heart leapt with joy , as I approached the dwelling of my wife and child . But , Ziani , words can not describe the horror that was presented to my sight . My peaceful villa destroyed  --  my wife savagely murdered  --  my child stolen from the embrances of that mother , who had fallen beneath the assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helena , on which was traced , " The wife of Demetri , slain by the Mainotes . " Now tell me , Ziani , ( rising , ) have I not cause to hate this horde of pirates . For years I have been the mountain robber , to be revenged on this detested race . I pursued them to their port of refuge , to seek revenge ; I have braved them to the field , have dared them to the ocean , to seek revenge , I live but to be revenged on the murderers of my wife and child  --  Ha ! I am bewildered  --  recollection will drive me mad . Look , Ziani ; the spirit of my murdered Helena rises from the grave  --  it ascends to heaven , crying revenge ! revenge ! The cry of murdered innocence is echoed from heaven to earth ; even hell itself reverberates the sound  --  revenge ! revenge ! Crosses to R. therefore , Ziani , command me as thou wilt  --  we 'll set forth instantly ; be assured thou shalt have thy rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exeunt , R. SCENE III .  --  The villa and grounds of Cyril Ziani.  --  Music . Enter Menkatiz , L. U. E. , driving on Slaves , with garlands and vases , as if preparing for a fete . Menk . Menkatiz Come , bustle , bustle , ye inactive specimens of mortal mechanism ; in a few moments the guests will be here , and nothing ready , Bless me ! what a weight of care am I burthened with ; to have the direction of this annual festivity , see that every thing is in order ; and , besides that , to be in love  --  Heigho  --  poor Menkatiz , you are in a sad way  --  But bustle , bustle , rascals , Nymsis , you little blue-eyed hussey , do nt look so roguishly at me ; I ca n't stand the glance of more than one pair of eyes at once and Leoua 's are quite enough for me , upon my word . There , now every thing is ready , and , I doubt not . I shall be overwhelmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mind you keep time in the chorus . Ah ! what stranger is this ? as I live , it is our master 's elder brother . Enter Katusthius Ziani , R. 3d E. Katus . Katusthius Ziani Aside . Some festivities are going forward ; pity it is , they soon must turn to mourning . Come hither , Menkatiz . Menk . Menkatiz That 's me ; I knew my name , at a remarkably early age , and although I have forgotten many things I learned in youth , it is wonderful how well I remember it still . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Where is your master ? Menk . Menkatiz Feasting his guests within , while I am preparing to entertain them without . We have a rare festival here , whenever the anniversary of the birth of their son comes round . Katus . Katusthius Ziani And to-day , then , is the anniversary of their child 's birth ? Menk . Menkatiz Yes  --  but if I stand chattering here , I shall forget all that I have to attend to  --  Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ye . Music . Enter Cyril Ziani , and Zella , with Con . Stans , followed by Guests and Children . CHORUS . CHORUS Health to the parents ! And bliss to the boy ! The pride of their love , And their sunlight of joy . On his face , like the rose-blush , Health smiling appears ; Whose eyes heam with gladness , They 're strangers to tears . Health to the parents ! And bliss to the boy ! The pride of their love . And their sunlight of joy . Cyril . Cyril Ziani Thanks  --  thanks ; go , Constans , thank Menkatiz for his attention , and give glad welcome to your friends . Con . Constans Crossing to Menkatiz . I thank you . Menkatiz ; you promised me this pleasure . Returning to his father . I do not know how to give welcome , father ; but I am sure , I am right glad , to see these friends . Cyril . Cyril Ziani You have done well , my boy . Ah ! Katusthius , my brother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Constans Crossing to Katusthius . Is this my uncle ? you 'll stay among us . Returning to Zella . No  --  I hope he will not  --  I do not like him , mother ; he looks not kindly on me , like my father . Zella . Zella You are too free of speech , sir . To Katusthius . I pray you , pardon my untutored boy , Ziani , and take his parent 's welcome , and remain . Katus . Katusthius Ziani I gladly would remain , and be a participator in your mirth : but I am on my way to Stamboul , and but came to know if I can serve my brother in any transactions at the capitol . Cyril . Cyril Ziani Stay but till to-morrow ; this is a festive day ; I can not give attention now to business . Katus . Katusthius Ziani On one condition , then , will I remain . Cyril . Cyril Ziani Name it . Katus . Katusthius Ziani That you and my sister will accompany me some hours on my way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all my heart  --  now , then , proceed with the festivities . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Aside . He has fallen in the snare . I will draw them hence , and , while away . Demetri will secure this idolized boy . Music  --  Ballet  --  Constans , in delight , leaves his Parents and joins in the dance  --  Demetri suddenly enters , R. U. E. , and comes down , c.  --  Music ceases .  --  He fires his gaze earnestly on the boy  --  the dance ceases , and the attention of all is fixed on Demetri . Dem . Demetri Lovely art thou , bright infant ! thy blue eyes are beaming , thy tresses flowing ; thou art fair to behold , but thou art a vision fleeting as beautiful . Taking the boy in his arms . Look at me ! Music  --  The child looks in the face of Demetri , and shrieks .  --  Demetri puts him down , and rushes out , R. 2d E.  --  Constans , in terror , runs to his mother , and falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zella All-gracious power ! my boy ! my boy !  --  look up  --  alas ! an evil eye has been upon him ! Dem . Demetri Suddenly appearing on an elevation in the back ground . Yes  --  the Evil Eye ! Disappears , L. Zella , kneeling , envelopes the boy in her mantle . Cyril anxiously consoling her . The guests come in groups around the mother  --  others looking off , as though to discover Demetri . The scene closes on the picture . SCENE IV .  --  The exterior of the beautiful and romantic villa of Cyril Ziani.  --  Music . Enter Leona , with Constans and Menkatiz , L. Menk . Menkatiz It is positively ridiculous , Leena  --  an evil eye , forsooth ! why , the boy was only frightened at a stranger . No , you jade , the only evil eyes I believe in , are those sparklers of yours , and they have piereed me through and through , they have  --  oh ! dear . Leona . Leona You may affect not to believe it ; but surely you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has not ? he 's an old candidate for a certain elevated situation , a man never enjoys twice . They say his eye can blast wherever it looks . What say you , master Constans , do n't you feel quite as well and happy as you did yesterday ? Con . Constans Yes  --  no  --  not so happy . I feel as though I could cry , and yet I can not . When will my dear mother come , Leona ? Leona , Leona Soon , very soon , dear boy . Menkatiz , do you go , and see if our master and his lady are on the road  --  I never yet was so unhappy in their absence . Menk . Menkatiz Lord , now ! Leona , how can you suffer such a foolish superstition to run away with your spirits ? nothing frightens me  --  except when I see that young Constantine throwing sheep 's eyes at you . But I will do your bidding  --  keep a stout heart , master Constans . Exit , R. Con . Constans I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not then have left me . Leona . Leona Come , come , you must be a braver boy , or you can never be a soldier , sir . We will go in ; your little gun , and all the presents your friends brought yesterday , will give you pleasure  --  but , stop , what weary man is this ? Music .  --  Demetri , covered with dust , and apparently exhausted with fatigue , enters , L. 1st E. , and falls . Leona . Leona Poor man , how very ill he seems ; good stranger , can we serve you ? Dem . Demetri By the life of yon child , give a cup of water to one who faints with thirst . Con . Constans Oh ! that will I do ; mother ever told me , to be kind to those who were poor and in distress . Exit , R. D. F. Leona . Leona Have you travelled far ? Dem .

Music .  --  Constans returns from cottage with a cup of water , and kneels while he presents it to Demetri ; who takes the cup , dashes it down , and , taking the boy in his arms , starts up , and draws his poniard . Dem . Demetri Mine  --  he is mine ! make no alarm ; attempt not to pursue , and he is safe  --  but dare to do so , and this poniard will be buried in his heart . Beware ! the Evil Eye . Rushes out with the boy . Leona . Leona What shall I do ? if I call for help , the boy is lost ; yet I will risk it  --  help  --  help  --  Constantine , Menkatiz  --  where are all the slaves ? Enter Menkatiz and Slaves , R. Fly , Menkatiz ; a villain has stolen little Constans from my side . As he left me , I recognised in his fearful glance , the stranger of the evil eye . Menk .

Katusthius Ziani What ! are you becoming compassionate ? Where is your weapon ? Come , this place is suited to the purpose  --  you understand me . Dem .

Gratitude , for life preserved , bound me to thee , and I did steal this boy , because , as ' t were , he stood between thee and thy fortunes ; but , ere I would harm a hair of that fair infant 's head , I would plunge this weapon hilt deep to thy heart , great as the debt may be I owe to thee . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Ungrateful villain , you forget your vow ; remember , you had a child stolen , murdered ? Dem . Demetri Ha ! you make me a monster again  --  down , boy , down .

Dem . Demetri No , I will take him to my mountain home ; teach him to climb the precipice , to ford the stream , to draw the bow , and hate the Mainote . My heart was vacant , till I saw this child . I could not cast an unkind glance upon him . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Then , by hell ! Demetri , I am your foe , and will myself destroy you hated offspring . Dem . Demetri First you must win him .

Zella I  --  I add a pang to my poor Cyril 's anguish ? Going to him , and with great feeling . Ah ! thou wilt pardon me  --  a father 's heart knows well a mother 's pains  --  a mother 's madness ; but I am very wretched , my brain 's on fire ; and you linger so ! ha ! there again .

Zella He is not here ; and yet , upon this rock , methought I saw my child . Yonder , like a speck upon the waves , I see a vessel ; perhaps it bears my boy from me for ever  --  or else  --  oh God ! oh God ! it was a horrid thought  --  perchance they dashed my darling from the rock , and the rude waves now roll above his form . No  --  no  --  no ; a mother 's fears but conjure up these frightful images  --  there does not breathe a wretch so cruel , to do a deed like that . Cyril rushes in , L. Cyril .

Zella My father ! ah ! thou art come , to soothe thy daughter in her sorrows ; to restore her child to her embrace . Cam . Camaraz By my heard ! I 'll aid thee to regain thy boy , though a thousand dangers encompassed him . In the offing lies my little barque , which like a sea-bird skims the deep . With my gallant Mainotes , and thee , good Cyril , we will attack this robber , even in his fastnesses , surrounded by his lawless band .

Zella I 'll brave it all , though it were tenfold , in this anxious search . Cam . Camaraz Then he it so ; yes , Zella , you shall go with us . Your face is pale , my child ; alas ! when thou wast but an infant , like thy boy , ' t was a rude blast that severed thee , sweet flower , from thy parent stem . But , away  --  away  --  I may not think of that .

What say ye , friends ; are you ready to follow me to the destruction of the Klepht village ? 1st Moun . First Mountaineer Destroy fair Korvo ? it is the village where my father was born  --  where I first drew the breath of a life , which Demetri himself once saved , at the peril of his own .  --  Never . Katus . Katusthius Ziani Then canst thou remain ; what say the others ? gold shall reward your service amply . Mountaineers . Mountaineers We will follow you . 1st Moun .

Remember its smiling vales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katus . Katusthius Ziani Peace , whining fool ! think you that these brave hearts are to be diverted from their purposes by idle recollections ? Korvo is now the home of robbers . What ! hang ye back ? behold , the gold is here ; your choice between us  --  wealth and Ziani , or poverty , with yon weak and timid fool ? Mountaineers .

Camaraz Eighteen years ago , I hovered , with my vessel , in search of prey , on the coast of Scio  --  a cottage stood on the borders of a chestnut wood , inhabited by the widow of a wealthy islander , and her daughter , married to an Albanian , then absent . Dem . Demetri Much agitated . An Albanian , say you ? go on  --  go on  --  go on . Cam . Camaraz She was reputed to have treasure concealed  --  the girl herself would be rich spoil ; it was an adventure worth the risk ; and when the moon went down , we landed , and stole , under cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Dem . Demetri Half unsheathing his dagger . Not yet , not yet  --  proceed . Cam . Camaraz The girl had a child ; she feared for its life , and struggled with the men , like a tigress defending her young . I was in another room , and heard her piercing shricks  --  the cry went to my soul . I rushed to save her , but was too late : she lay upon the ground , the life blood gushing from her heart . But , I thank the gods ! I saved her child , and reared it , as my own . That child is Zella ; the mother of that boy . Brings in Zella , R. Dem . Demetri Live ! lives ! Katusthius retires to his followers on the bridge . By heaven ! I thought his blood was Albanian .

Zella , ah , Zella ! know your father ! Pensive music . Zella . Zella It is too horrible  --  the outcast of society  --  the despised and shunn 'd of man  --  Gazing on Demetri , who observes her emotion , with agitation . Oh ! holy nature  --  he is  --  he is indeed my father Advancing to Demetri , at first timidly , then with more confidence , and sinks in his arms , pronouncing , Father ! Dem . Demetri Thou hadst just learned to lisp that name , when I left Scio . Placing Constans in her embrace . There is thy boy , my Zella , well , quite well , to bless his parents with his love .
