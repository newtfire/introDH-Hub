PROLOGUE . DELIVERED BY MRS . PRESTON . This night a native bard unfolds a scene That , yet , abides within the mem'ry green ; His first attempt the Thespian art to reach , Heroic deeds through mimic life to teach . Long had the Nation , ere to arms she rushed , Suffered  --  till pity wept and virtue blushed ; Spies round the land like gaunt hyenas prowled , While faction , like an unchained maniac , howled . Our gallant mariners  --  forbear the theme  --  Their blood , from scourgings , dyed the ocean stream : The savage axe was whetted for our doom , The vandal torch was lighted to consume . Columbia dropped the olive from her hand , She grasped her arrows and drew forth her brand ; In awe profound , the nations from afar , Gazed to behold her ride on Vict'ry 's car . High beat the generous heart  --  her praises rung From every voice that had a freeman 's tongue . The foe , at length , humanity was taught , And back the dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration claims , In brilliance stands " The Battle of the Thames ! " At Raisin 's stream , and at Miami 's flood , Had the stern Indian glutted him with blood . Lo ! Perry 's voice in startling thunder spoke , And Johnson ! soon , the savage sceptre broke : The mighty Chief , before him , prostrate fell , With whom expired the last appalling yell . The West , in mourning weeds , looked on and smiled , And hailed the Champion as her first-born child . The poet , now , will this event explore , He craves your candour , but  --  he asks no more .

There 's something strange in all this . What can it all mean ? Nothing could be heard here yesterday but narrations , orations , and proclamations about a mighty triumph  --  a great naval victory , that was to be huzzaed all over the town to-day . The big guns were all crammed to their muzzles . But nothing is said about it this morning . What a change ! Malden is as hush  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of a Yankee cheese . Chambers was at my master 's lodgings about midnight . He told him something  --  what it was I shall not pretend to philosophy  --  but it was something that had very little opium in it , for my master never slept a wink afterward . He walked his room all night long  --  and day has hardly peeped at us yet , when here am I , sent post-haste to prepare the horses , for perhaps a  --  back out ! Well , well , ( feels in his pockets , ) I have a shilling or two left  --  and  --  ( pulls out a bottle ! ) O , the creature is safe ! My darling , I must give you a buss , ( drinks . ) I feel it running down the middle of me like warm milk from the udder of a cow in a frosty morning . Jerry Grimes has lived long enough in the world to know how to cherish his own flesh and blood . ( drinks . ) Col. Chambers ,  --  oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stinging wit ? Never mind , I 'll try to make it go down ( drinks . ) Oh , yes : Chambers is the man for me , and I 'm the man for Chambers . He 's my shadow , I 'm for his substance  --  ( striking the pieces of money together ) . Whenever I says , " open Sessame ! " his hand opens  --  and when it does open , it always has the cash in it . True , very true , he has a stripling of a waiter  --  but not an atom of use to him , as I can see . He keeps him in better trim than any cadet in the whole army  --  ( singing ) . I brush his coat , black his shoes , powder his hair . Fetch , carry  --  do other things decent and rare . That is , for the cash I does it  --  and cash advances much greater men than I am , to carry on a less honourable business than blacking boots . Enter Proctor and Aide-de-Camp , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jer . Jerry O , sir  --  ready ? saddled you mean . Proc . General Proctor You 'll have the black and the sorrel led to my quarters immediately  --  move !

( Jerry winks his eye ) hanging up snug in the saddle-house ! ha ! ha ! ha ! But I must have them backed upon the horses  --  or Jerry 's back  --  oh , I must be off .  --  Exit , L. SCENE II .  --  Exhibits a tent pitched in the woods , supposed to be in the rear of Malden . Enter Lucinda in boy 's attire from tent , U.E.R. Lucin . Lucinda Alas ! no tidings of him yet . At times my spirits droop , while hope almost expires . This disguise is irksome . His dear , dear name , is written on my heart ,  --  yea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah ! cruel day !  --  When the fell savage , thick their hands imbued in human gore at Raisin 's fatal stream ! My blood congeals . I must the theme forbear . But what will love not tempt us to achieve ? They seized  --  they dragged my Edward forth a captive ! Wretched captive ! I 've ventured all to find  --  to rescue him ,  --  if need there be , my life to offer up for his release . For what would be this world to me without him ?  --  Waste , a barren waste  --  a heath , producing nought but thistles , night-shade , and the deadly upas . My heart would be in widowhood with nature . To Chambers , most magnanimous of chiefs  --  of British chiefs  --  a page have I become ,  --  that some unseen , auspicious chance may throw me in his arms ,  --  or , this denied  --  I may the satisfaction have to kneel , embrace his bosom cold in death , compose his limbs , strew flowers , and then  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  wild  --  it burns  --  my brain !

Already does the joyous sun smile on the lake , and pour from diamond urns , a golden shower , which beautifying , gilds this gorgeous drapery of Autumn .  --  But see  --  he approaches  --  I must dissemble Chambers advances from the tent . You seem to be in heavy mood this morning ,  --  your visage sad , cast down .  --  There 's fever on thy brow . Wild dreams  --  perhaps  --  perplexing dreams . Cham . Col. Chambers Vex , vex me not with tedious questions  --  dreams ! I wish it were no other than a dream . Reality !  --  How beautiful the fleet from out the harbour glided !

Forbear  --  enough ! Impressment ! cursed impressment hath done this  --  dimmed  --  yea  --  it hath wrapped proud Albion 's glory in the pall of mourning . Lucinda betrays some feelings of joy . You smile  --  while I am overcast with grief ; this transport ill becomes thee . Lucin . Lucinda ( aside . ) I must disguise .  --  Sir ?  --  transport ?

Me , they told , that I should find him at your wigwam here . He betray Tecumseh  --  harkened not to me . To him I uttered many words to bend him from his purpose ,  --  No ! My people gashed their flesh to meet Kentucky at the shore , and trouble Erie 's lake with drowning ghosts ! His ear was deaf  --  Fear closed its hearing up .

The wild cat strip the bones ! Aye , tremble shall the mountains at my voice ,  --  for they shall fear it as the thunder ! Enter Lieutenant Anderson , R. H. U. E. And . Lieut .

He said  --  " Tecumseh , sit thou here beside me . " He was my foe . Me scorned his offer ,  --  on my mother 's breast  --  the earth  --  I rested me my limbs . Cham . Col. Chambers To Anderson . And Johnson , said you not ? And . Lieut .

Anderson Their prows lash up the foam ,  --  the blighting stars shone dimly  --  far they seemed to cast a baleful light upon the waters , like sanguine meteors streaming through the sky ! Tecum . Tecumseh Then will Tecumseh smother up in blood ! Cham . Col. Chambers ( To Anderson . ) You , Anderson , my first lieutenant , I charge to linger on our rear , and cautious mark the motions of the enemy . To me , as opportunity occurs , will you report their movements  --  their position  --  all incidents . And . Lieut . Anderson Trifling circumstances ? Cham . Col.

Ye gentlemen and ladies fair , Who grace this famous city , Just listen , if you 've time to spare , While I rehearse a ditty ; And for an opportunity , Conceive yourselves quite lucky , For ' t is not often here you see A hunter from Kentucky . Oh ! Kentucky ! the hunters of Kentucky , The hunters of Kentucky ! We are a hardy , free-born race , Each man , to fear , a stranger , Whate'er the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if a daring foe annoys , Whate'er his strength and forces , We 'll show him that Kentucky boys Are alligator horses ! Oh ! Kentucky , etc . I'spose you 've read it in the prints , How Packenham attempted To make old Hickory Jackson wince , But soon his schemes repented ; For we with rifles ready cock 'd , Thought such occasion lucky , And soon around the General flocked The hunters of Kentucky . Oh ! Kentucky , etc . You 've heard , I'spose , how New Orleans Is fam 'd for wealth and beauty , There 's girls of every hue it seems , From snowy white to sooty . So Packenham , while he made his brags , If he in the fight was lucky , He 'd have their girls and cotton bags In spite of old Kentucky . Oh ! Kentucky , etc . But Jackson he was wide awake , And was'nt scared at trifles , For well he knew what aim we take With our Kentucky rifles ! So he led us down to Cypress swamp , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in martial pomp , And here was old Kentucky . Oh ! Kentucky , etc . A bank was raised to hide our breast , Not that we thought of dying , But that we always like to rest , Unless the game is flying . Behind it stood our little force , None wished it to be greater . For every man was half a horse , And half an alligator . Oh ! Kentucky , etc They did not let our patience tire , Before they showed their faces , We did not choose to waste our fire , So suugly kept our places . But when so near to see them wink , We thought it time to stop ' em , And ' t would have done you good , I think , To see Kentuckians drop e 'm . Oh ! Kentucky , etc . They found at last ' t was in vain to fight , Where lead was all their booty , And so they wisely took to flight , And left us all our beauty . And now if danger e'er annoys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky boys , And we 'll protect you ladies ! Oh ! Kentucky , etc . All . All Ha , ha , ha ! Arth .
