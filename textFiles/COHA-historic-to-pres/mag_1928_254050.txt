Thomas D. Campbell of Hardin , Mont. , was a welcome White House caller . He , farmer on the largest scale in the U. S. , assured President Coolidge that the farm " crusade " ( see p. 13 ) was an unjust political ruse and fiction . . . . Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow was an interesting White House caller . The President passed a whole day hearing about Mexico . He called in Secretary of State Kellogg to hear too . . . . Vice President Dawes was an entertaining White House caller . He accompanied 15 other Republican notables to a Coolidge breakfast and made great sport of small-eyed Senator Watson of Indiana for wearing a straw hat with his Prince Albert . When President Coolidge heard what the Vice President was tittering about he smiled and said : " Well , it 's just about as proper to wear a straw hat with a Prince Albert as it is to smoke a pipe when you are wearing a Prince Albert . " The Vice President laughed harder than before .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
