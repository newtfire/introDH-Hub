Considering the size of the $ 5.4 billion acquisition of Newark 's First Fidelity Bancorporation , First Union clearly would have to pause , settle back and digest its huge Northern addition , right ? <p> " Absolutely not , " said John R. Georgius , president of First Union Corp . and commander of the acquisition troops . <p> Even as we spoke , the company remained on the prowl , looking to add its 62nd acquisition . <p> Georgius , a Decatur native who went to Georgia State , said buying smaller banks has become virtually a line of business at First Union , much like real estate loans or money management . <p> " Just as airlines and trucking companies needed to combine in order to compete after they were deregulated in the early 1980s , banks of our size have also needed the efficiency of large size , " said Georgius . <p> Bank mergers have been necessary to add territory and reach more customers . <p> Just a name to many people some five years ago , First Union ignited the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal in six months . <p> The massive purchases are just a continuation of First Union 's way of life . <p> This most recent prize in First Union 's ceaseless shopping spree has produced a megabank ranking sixth in the nation with $ 123.7 billion in combined assets , some 10.5 million customers , and nearly 2,000 branches from New England to Key West , Fla. , and west to Memphis . <p> No. 2 in Charlotte <p> Big as it is , First Union is No. 2 in Charlotte , trailing NationsBank , its neighbor down the street . <p> But at one point Georgius said , with a note of triumph , " We are much more than a Southeast bank . " <p> Georgius talks with obvious delight about the smoothly fashioned in- house system for expansion that has driven First Union since interstate bank mergers were legalized in 1985 . <p> Unlike the platoons of lawyers and accountants who cobbled together the hostile corporate takeovers of the 1970s and 1980s , First Union 's scouting team includes financial managers and operations experts with an eye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoother and quicker with each major transaction , First Union now moves machinelike , and therefore not even First Fidelity should force it to miss steps . <p> " We are able to move into a target bank , assess what it can do for us , what it can sell , " Georgius said . " Then we can generate a five-year plan for that bank and demonstrate performance over time . " <p> In the process , First Union not only establishes whether the target bank is a natural fit but also the sensible price to pay for it . <p> The plan drawn up to assess the potential buy also gives First Union a running start in operating it . <p> Scarcely two years since the takeover of Georgia Federal and Decatur Federal , acquisitions worth more than $ 7 billion , the Georgia operations are firmly on the upswing , said David Carroll , president and chief executive of First Union National Bank of Georgia . <p> " Even though thrifts like Georgia Federal and Decatur Federal often do not operate with the profit levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings over the last 12 months , compared to the previous corresponding 12 months , " said Carroll . <p> The company is moving strongly into capital market business such as commercial financing and private placements that the old institutions seldom touched . <p> " The upshot is that operating efficiency has improved 5 percent in the last year alone , " he said . That is an indicator that a smaller and decreasing percentage of the revenue dollar is now being sunk in the cost of operations . " We feel as if we are well-positioned in this best of financial markets to go after consumers and business with midsize companies with revenue in the $ 25 million to $ 200 million range . " <p> Acquiring and then hitting the road fast was not always so smooth for First Union . <p> One of First Union 's biggest headaches occurred in 1986 and 1987 when the company bought and tried to fit First Railroad &; Banking Co. of Augusta into the big company . <p> " It consisted of 17 banks under one holding company with each bank having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Georgius . " We first had to get the 17 banks coordinated into one working system , then fit that system into First Union . It was a nightmare . " <p> The Decatur Federal merger was no cakewalk either . The huge Decatur thrift had cultivated an image as an oversized community bank , with actor- spokesman Hal Holbrook conveying a just-family feel . At first , customers and even some employees balked at the outsiders , new ways and new relationships . <p> With First Fidelity , First Union combines with an institution that has already been coordinated and put in good running order over the last five years under Chairman Tony Terracciano , officials said . <p> In addition , because First Fidelity has been buying and absorbing smaller banks in its own territory , it has the kind of skills to fit in - and continue to scout and acquire other potential partners in the Northeast . <p> Some skepticism <p> Some analysts are skeptical of the short-term ability of First Union to get a bang for its purchasing dollar in last week 's blockbuster deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two institutions , First Union can not pick up a quick boost from firing lots of managers and staff , and closing branches that wind up across the street from one another . <p> Secondly , unlike First Union 's Southeast territory , where there is plenty of population and business growth , the Northeast lags in growth . First Union Chairman Edward E. Crutchfield takes a different perspective . <p> His company , far from being done , will use First Fidelity as a beachhead and buy up more , smaller banks in the Northeast . <p> " The consolidation game is largely over in the South , " he said , observing that there are no more sizable banks willing to be purchased . <p> First Fidelity is large , with many customers and branches but without the range of products , such as credit cards and investment accounts that First Union already has on the shelf . <p> Simply by distributing these products through the First Fidelity network that reaches throughout New Jersey , and into well-heeled New York suburbs , there will be an instant revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman . <p> Most important of all , said Georgius , " First Union is obviously headed toward a national franchise , and by getting a toehold all along the Atlantic seaboard , we have taken an important step in that direction .
