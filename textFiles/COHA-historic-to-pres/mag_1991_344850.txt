BILL SEIDMAN has just topped his own private joke . Shortly before he was confirmed in 1985 as chairman of the FDIC , Seidman got an Irish wolfhound , which he named Proxmire after the Senator who opposed his confirmation . " Heel , Proxmire , " Seidman would bark . But not long ago , as Seidman prepared to step down from his post , William Proxmire wrote a flattering valedictory to the chairman . So Seidman renamed his dog Annunzio in dubious honor of Frank Annunzio , chairman of a House Banking subcommittee , who has sparred with Seidman over the S &L; bailout . Seidman tells colleagues that when he calls " Annunzio ! Annunzio ! " the dog rolls over and plays dead .
