Shielded by two bulletproof glass partitions , Defendant Mohammed Ali Hammadi rose to his feet last week to read a statement that startled spectators in the Frankfurt courtroom . The Lebanese terrorist confessed to participating in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut but denied that he murdered one of the plane 's passengers , U.S. Navy Diver Robert Stethem . " I pleaded against the killing , " claimed Hammadi , who said his partner had shot Stethem . <P> Speculation arose that Hammadi 's confession was part of a maneuver by Iran that could free West German Rudolf Cordes , one of 16 foreign hostages believed to be held in Beirut by groups like the pro-Iranian Hizballah . Most experts doubted , however , that West Germany would agree to a Hammadi-Cordes swap . At the same time , a West German intelligence source contends that Iran ordered Hammadi 's confession to gain Bonn 's support during upcoming peace negotiations with Iraq . For more intrigue , tune in when the trial resumes next month .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
