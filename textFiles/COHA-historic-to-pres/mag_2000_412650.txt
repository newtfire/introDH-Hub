Each of Mrs. Bush 's four versions of the necklace sports a different clasp ( gold loop , rhinestone , crystal , and ruby and crystal ) .

As a joke , I said that I wanted a strand of pearls that reached from the bed to the door . And I got it ! Two long strands.You could put them together and take them apart . They were marvelous . I wore them coiled like a rope or down to my knees . Later on , when my mother died , I threw her diamond necklace into it .

Her wedding present from the Queen Mother was a large oval sapphire surrounded by two rows of diamonds , similar to the queen 's Prince Albert brooch ; Diana later mounted the sapphire as the centerpiece of her signature seven-row pearl necklace . She felt no compunction about wearing fakes , either . When she wore a two-row choker with a small sapphire and diamond clasp , a blatant fake from Kenneth Jay Lane , the Duchess of Kent liked it so much that she bought the identical necklace .

I did n't wear them in school , but I did wear them in the afternoon . Of course , I have daytime pearls and evening pearls . I have three strings that I wear every day , in the morning and the afternoon and sometimes in the evening . My evening pearls are bigger and have diamonds around them , helping them to be strong . Sometimes the pearls are hanging from the diamonds  --  or the diamonds are hanging from the pearls , " she muses about her bib necklace from Verdura , whose gems almost seem to float against her skin .
