New Zealand is a land of diverse and gentle beauties , from the semitropic grasslands and steel-blue lakes of the north to the magnificent fiords , mountains and waterfalls of the cooler south . Life , too , tends to be placid for New Zealand 's 2,590,000 inhabitants . Cradled in the arms of a welfare state , they have practically no unemployment , easily buy houses on government loans and are cared for with " womb-to-tomb " government benefits . The Maori word apopo , the equivalent of Latin America 's maana , symbolizes the New Zealander 's belief that much , and perhaps all , can best be left till tomorrow . <P> Perilous Balance . As might be expected in such a country , New Zealand has problems , and solutions can not be put off until tomorrow . One big problem is a dog-chasing-tail economy : with little industry of its own , the country depends heavily on exports of its butter , beef , mutton and wool to balance the steady flow of imports that its people need . The balance has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major changes in its economy . Last week the government approved the creation of a native steel industry that will refine ore from New Zealand 's black sand beaches . The steel mills , to cost $156 million , will save $56 million a year in imported steel costs and become the largest industrial project in the nation 's 125-year history . <P> The steel complex will use low-cost power from another new project now abuilding : a grid of power plants that will generate electricity from such unusual sources as boiling springs and a water raceway that runs underground for nearly six miles through the rocky soil of South Island . Parliament will soon extend the country 's territorial limits from three miles to twelve to protect New Zealand 's infant fishing industry , which is being trained by the Japanese to catch tuna and by the Australians to harvest oysters . Hoping to form a kind of Tasmanian Common Market , New Zealand is renegotiating its trade agreements with neighboring Australia , which supplies 20% of all New Zealand 's imports but takes only 3.5% of her exports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Zealand hopes to attract more foreign tourists . Only 113,000 visited New Zealand last year ( 15,000 of them Americans ) , and most of them have to fly prop planes from Australia or Fiji to get there . So far , there has been little reason to come : most New Zealand hotels are dilapidated , service is poor , almost all bars close at 6 p.m. daily , there is practically no night life and a New Zealand Sunday is one wide yawn . The government is determined to improve matters , hopes that it can raise tourist income from $27 million to $40 million within a few years . Next month , for the first time , jets will arrive from Sydney to land at Christchurch airport ; by year 's end the all-new Mangere airport will open outside Auckland and Air New Zealand will begin flights to North America .
