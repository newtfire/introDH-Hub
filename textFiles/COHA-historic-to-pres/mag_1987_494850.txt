AGAINST AUSTERITY PETER G. PETERSON and friends have hurled them-PETE once more into the breech , warning this time in two-page newspaper ads that America must restrain public spending and balance the federal budget before it is too late . The signers of this latest incarnation of Peterson 's " Bipartisan " budget plan include mostly Republican corporate chief executives and investment bankers , but with just enough well-heeled Democrats , nominal and real ( Lloyd Cutler , George Ball , Felix Rohatyn , Bob Strauss , Cyrus Vance , Robert McNamara , et al. ) , to give the bipartisan label plausibility . Unlike the first Peterson Budget Appeal , calling for spending cuts in the pit of the 1982-83 recession , this one comes after five years of accumulated deficits . The earlier warnings now seem prophetic ; the remedy seems inevitable , and overdue . Peterson 's fundamental economic contention , spelled out in greater detail in a recent Atlantic cover article and widely endorsed by America 's financial establishment , is that the nation has been living beyond its collective means , that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the federal deficit , and that private savings must rise sharply to finance more productive investment , lest a worse day of reckoning come later on . A similar case has been made in editorials and columns in this journal and elsewhere . A recent cover piece in Business Week , headed " Wake Up , America ! " ( illustrated by a man tightening his belt ) , warned that " living standards will almost surely decline . " Belt-tightening , seemingly , has the universal support of prudent people everywhere . As the Peterson ad declares , " We have joined together to urge our fellow Americans and this Nation 's leaders to rise above politics as usual , to set aside differences ? of party , region , ideology , and even immediate self-interest ? in order to resolve our worsening economic problems before it is too late . " Specifically , urges the ad , " spending cuts of all kinds should be top priority . " Defense spending should be " restrained " while " cuts must be made in non-defense programs , especially all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not means-tested . " Some of this is reasonable . But most of it represents one possible strategy among many , one that is covertly and intensely partisan , embracing a particular philosophy . Notwithstanding the rhetoric of equal sacrifice , Peterson 's program has heavy costs both for equity and growth . Although his brand of traditional , sound money conservatism presents itself as the opposite of Reagan 's giddy supply-side brand , the subtext turns out to be the same : civilian government , once again , must unfortunately be sacrificed . Public outlays that have been cut for seven years in the name of supply-side gods must now be hacked some more to reassure Wall Street . The Peterson program submerges and obscures distributional issues that simply can not " rise above politics " because the question of whose belt should be tightened ? or enlarged ? is inherently political . Whenever selfless millionaires declare that " we " must tighten our belts for the greater public good , the appropriate response is Tonto 's " What you mean ' we , ' Investment Banker ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cut . The Gramm-Rudman bill holds that the deficit must be cut by $23 billion in 1988 , and to zero by 1993 . Peterson thinks it needs to be cut even faster than that , " s30-40 billion in the first year . . . so that the budget can move towards balance by 1992 . " But that would be absurd policy . State and local budgets run net surpluses of about 1.5 percent of GNP . So a federal deficit of 1.5 percent of GNP equals a net public fiscal stimulus of zero . A very good case can be made for a federal deficit of about two percent of GNP , or about $100 billion by the early 1990s . At normal growth rates , the government can run a two percent of GNP deficit ( which is mildly tonic for expansion ) and the economy grows faster than the debt , allowing the debt to shrink steadily as a fraction of GNP . Some historical perspective is in order here . America came out of World War II with a federal debt of $271 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today of some $2.4 trillion is about 55 percent of GNP . Household savings rates soared during World War II , but those savings were largely consumed by government borrowing , leaving the nation with a very low net savings rate . The household assets existed only as accounting claims against the Treasury . Yet the debt was rolled over after the war , with the cooperation of the Fed , and it financed a consumer boom . The worst possible policy for retiring the World War II debt would have been an austerity program . The government typically ran moderate deficits between 1946 and 1980 ; yet by 1970 , thanks to a growing economy , the debt had dropped to less than 30 percent of GNP , where it stayed until 1982 . The second debatable issue is how to reach an appropriate deficit . Peterson proposes to cut civilian spending first , to " restrain " defense spending , and to raise taxes only as a last resort . But this is a distributively perverse response to the fiscal mess left by Reaganomics . During the Reagan years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial share of total national income , due to shifts in relative tax burdens , the cut in social spending , the reduced wages at the bottom of the labor market , as well as demographic changes . On average , the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution lost one dollar of every six dollars in earnings that it had in 1981 . Statistically , the top fifth increased its share of total income by about eight percent , but that understates the story . The big distributive shift in the 1980s has been a vastly greater concentration of wealth . Between 1981 and 1987 , the stock market almost quadrupled in value . Even after Black Monday , and even adjusting for inflation , the Dow Jones has more than doubled in real value since 1981 . The other big winner during the past decade has been real estate , which also has more than doubled in real value . Financial assets are concentrated among the very wealthy to an astonishing degree . The top ten percent own fully 90 percent of the value of stocks , 88 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusts . In short , the massive run-up in wealth values during the Reagan presidency benefitted a tiny fraction of the population . These are the people who had the party during the 1980s , and these are the ones who should pay the bill . W E COULD BEGIN by holding the top rate on the personal tax at 38.5 percent , rather than letting it drop to 28 percent in 1988 . That would raise $22 billion each year right there . We should cap the mortgage interest deduction at the level of an average-priced home . That would produce another $6 billion to $8 billion a year . We might add a tax on stock transfers , to reward long-term investment and raise revenues at the same time . And we could complete the package of taxes on the well-to-do by taxing the capital gain in inherited stocks . There is also a strong distributive and partisan case that domestic public spending ought to be increased , not reduced further . Not counting Social Security , federal social spending has been cut by about $40 billion during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back control of the Senate , several long-deferred issues have been nonetheless upstaged by the politics of deficit reduction . Instead of making more cuts , public spending ought to be restored . Those public outlays might be financed by defense cuts , or by further tax increases , say , on private consumption . But all of this is a matter of political choice and not technical economic imperative . Please note also that most of these are precisely not programs " limited to the poor , " but programs that serve America as a society . Universal health insurance , or public education , or the rebuilding of highways , by definition , can not be limited to the poor . ( There are , at the same time , some cuts that might be made in entitlement outlays , for example , by including as taxable income all of the Social Security benefits paid to well-off people . ) But holding harmless only means-tested outlays is another politically cute maneuver that undermines whatever constituency remains for the idea of public spending . Some portions of the Peterson view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with markedly different distributive implications . Peterson and Company are right that America consumes too much , saves too little , and borrows too much from abroad . A debt equal to 55 percent of GNP is not by itself a problem . But a net foreign debt that is increasing by $150 billion to $200 billion yearly is a problem indeed . There is obviously a need to make American products more marketable , to demand that our trading partners treat our goods fairly , and to raise domestic savings rates sufficiently to finance both the accumulated debt and the need for new investment . Cutting the public deficit , which is a drain on private savings , is one way to increase net savings . A value-added tax , made progressive by generous tax credits for the consumption of basic necessities , would also help . H ERE IS another idea that would dramatically reduce the need for foreign borrowing to finance America 's accumulated debt . The idea is based on a little book written by John Maynard Keynes in 1940 , titled How to Pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , given a laissez-faire economy , would divert civilian resources , raise consumer prices , and lead to punishing tax rates . So he proposed instead a novel scheme of compulsory savings . A portion of the income of well-off people would be deferred , saved , and ultimately invested in low-interest bonds , to be repaid after the war . This had the virtue of reducing private consumption among the class that could best afford it , while allowing the government to finance the war at lower than market interest rates . During the 1980s America did not fight a war ; but America squandered a lot of money just the same . Here is a plan in the spirit of Keynes that might be titled " How to Pay for Reaganomics . " All incomes over $100,000 would be subject to a special three-year levy equal to a surcharge of 20 percent of the federal income tax owed . If the taxpayer owes $20,000 in federal tax , an additional 20 percent$4,000 ? must be placed into ten-year bonds , carrying a below-market interest rate equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be a cross between a bond and a tax . The bonds would trade in financial markets at a steep discount , so that bondholders could choose either to cash out and take a partial loss or to hold the bond until maturity . The bonds might be called Reagan Bonds , in memory of the president who made them necessary . A rough calculation is that this would increase domestic financing of the debt by about $30 billion in each of the next three years , reducing foreign borrowing by that amount . In sum : America as an economy needs to reduce both its federal deficit and its dependence on foreign borrowing . But it also needs to rebuild its public economy as well as its private one , and it needs to do so on the basis of high growth , and not on the basics of some puritanical conceptof suffering as a necessary purgative . We also needs to keep in mind just who gains and who suffers . The " sound money " solution , throughout the history of modern capitalism , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Keynes taught , the measures that make sense for a firm or a family during hard times ? reducing purchases , deferring expansions , or laying off workers ? are perverse when applied to an entire economy , because they only deepen recessions . The Reagan era , as economist Fred Bergsten put it , may indeed be remembered as the time when we borrowed a trillion dollars from the Japanese and held a party . But a lot of people did n't come to the party . Tens of millions of Americans , and not just the certified poor , suffered substantial declines in their living standards . Multimillionaires generally have no conception of what belt-tightening truly means for ordinary Americans . What , exactly , in his own comfortable life would Pete Peterson sacrifice ? By all means , let us get America 's fiscal house in order . But an election year is no time for " bipartisan " budget appeals , even less so when the fiscal calamity is the legacy of one party , and least of all when the political assumptions are dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
