In the end there was something for everybody . Britain could claim that it was still master of its monetary and labor policies . France could point to a firm timetable for establishing a single currency for the European Community 's other 11 members . Germany , among the most Euro-minded of the Community states , could hail the birth of a " European union . " And the most impoverished brethren in the group  --  Greece , Ireland , Spain and Portugal  --  had won the promise of money transfers from the rich states to the poor . <P> The summit in the medieval Dutch town of Maastricht last week , aimed at forging deeper economic and political integration within the European Community , was a qualified success . After two days of heated wrangling , the 12 heads of state and government produced an agreement that took a giant step toward monetary unity , a half step toward strengthening a separate European defense organization , and a baby step toward framing a common foreign and security policy . They also moved toward pursuing joint action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This meeting , " said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , " has resulted in the fulfillment of a dream . Further integration is now inevitable . The course is irreversible . " <P> The Maastricht decisions will be incorporated into the 1957 Treaty of Rome , the E.C . ' s charter document . With its political dimension expanded , the Community  --  the industrialized world 's largest single market with 340 million people  --  should provide much needed stability in the face of turmoil in Eastern Europe and disintegration in the former Soviet Union . <P> The summit 's crowning achievement was the commitment by 11 of the 12 ( Britain excepted ) to monetary union by the end of the century . After years of debate , the leaders agreed to establish a single European Currency Unit , the ECU , as early as January 1997 . But each country must first meet stringent economic criteria . Among them , total government debt must fall below 60% of gross domestic product , and budget deficits may not surpass 3% of GDP . If fewer than seven countries meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be delayed until 1999 , when qualifying nations will put the ECU into circulation as their legal tender . Countries still unable to adopt the ECU by that date will do so when their economic performance matches the E.C . guidelines . In addition , a European Monetary Institute will be established in 1994 and will later achieve full powers as Europe 's central bank . <P> All of this is designed to make Western Europe the world 's biggest economic power , equipped to meet the American and Japanese challenge . But there are huge caveats . Most important , Britain demanded a separate " opt out " clause , under which its Parliament may vote later in the decade on whether or not to adopt the ECU . Moreover , only three countries currently meet the criteria . At a time when average E.C . unemployment is nearly 10% , belt tightening to achieve the rigid goals will hardly be popular .
