Groping for the middle way and posting multiple opinions <P> The Supreme Court 's October-to-July year that ended last week will be best known for the race-yes , quotas-no , something-for-everybody decision that the Justices reached in Bakke . But the 1977-78 term should also be remembered for what Bakke reflects about the court itself : the notion of a conservative " Nixon court ' ' has by now become largely myth . <P> For a time , the Nixon court sobriquet seemed apt . From 1969 to 1971 , four Nixon appointees joined the court-Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Harry Blackmun , William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell-and many observers expected them to reverse the trend set by the liberal Warren Court in the 1950s and ' 60s . Judicially activist , the Warren Court had frequently extended constitutional guarantees of free speech , equal protection and due process to safeguard individual rights , which usually meant those of the poor , minorities and criminal defendants .

That does not mean that the court 's political pendulum has swung back to the left . Rather , court watchers say , the court has become distinctly nonideological . " They have no overarching doctrine , " says Virginia Law Professor A.E . Dick Howard . " They 're taking cases as they come in pragmatic fashion . " In the early ' 70s some expected Chief Justice Burger to rally the court around him in conservative restraint , just the way his predecessor , Earl Warren , galvanized the court to judicial activism . But this year Blackmun abandoned Burger 30% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens , Potter Stewart and Byron White , they form an uncertain and searching middle core , sometimes balancing , sometimes just unpredictable . <P> Burger and his closest ally , Rehnquist , now stand increasingly isolated on the right , while Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan hang onto the Warren tradition on the left . " Fragmented moderation , " Michigan Law Professor Vincent Blasi calls it . " Even when they get clear majorities , " says Stanford Law Professor Gerald Gunther , " many different opinions come down . The Justices are tending to be loners , more isolated , less inclined to give and take . "
