NEW YORK  --  When Petty Officer Second Class Paul Dahl of the U.S. Coast Guard helps plan the Statue of Liberty ' s centennial , he thinks of vessels like the Useless . Then he worries a lot . The four-day event honoring Miss Liberty ' s 100th birthday will take place over the Fourth of July weekend and already is shaping up as the world ' s greatest maritime gathering . An invasion of some 40 , 000 vessels is expected in New York Harbor . And one of those vessels is a 1937 cabin cruiser called the Useless . A few years ago the Useless lay on the bottom of the Hudson River , but John Krevey , a New York electrical contractor , winched her ashore , pumped her dry and sealed her leaky hull with a cementlike coating . " I have the biggest piece of junk , " says Mr. Krevey , pointing below deck to a mattress chewed by rats . Nevertheless , he plans to sail his friends to the festivities aboard the Useless . No one knows how many craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petty Officer Dahl says the job of policing the harbor during the celebration , dubbed Liberty Weekend , will " take a superhuman effort . " The vessels , three times the number ever gathered here before , will be attracted to New York ' s Upper Bay by parades of large sailing ships , reviews of naval vessels , a great fireworks display and other events commemorating the statue ' s birthday . Coast Guard officials are concerned that confusion , collisions or worse will follow in their wake . Even spared their worst fears of swampings , capsizings , sinkings and drownings , authorities are bracing for an unprecedented maritime traffic snarl . " It will be wall-to-wall boats . We ' ll have gridlock , " says the Coast Guard ' s Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Eldridge , who expects the harbor to be choked for days . Adds N. Nick Cretan , the executive director of the Maritime Association of the Port of New York : " It will be like the invasion of Normandy . " However , while some fear danger and disruption , others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The immigrants came on ships , " says Howard Slotnick , the treasurer of Operation Sail 1986 , the organization that is coordinating the maritime events . Shrugging off doomsayers , he points to New York ' s sprawling harbor and cites Operation Sail 1976 , which was conducted in relative safety despite dire forecasts . Ship captains from Maine to Florida seem eager to accept Mr. Slotnick ' s invitation . Lured by the opportunity to charge day charter rates up to $1 , 000 a person , 10 times the normal fees , ocean liners , yachts , fishing-party boats , ferryboats , tugs and barges are preparing to set sail . Liberty Weekend , says Gail Collins , a New York charterer , could " represent a whole season ' s revenues in two days for which you hardly have to raise a finger . " She is trying to line up customers , at $900 a person , for her boyfriend ' s homemade Chinese junk . Says Alan Tyler , a Chesapeake Bay tour-boat operator , " I hear there will be some money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the 300-mile trip from Smith Island , Md. , to cash in . Some of the spectator craft will be lumbering hulks that never carried passengers before . A.J. McAllister III , a tugboat captain for McAllister Bros . Inc. , plans to mask the blemishes on a coffee barge with palm trees to shade spectators . Not everyone is impressed . " I can ' t get involved in a screwy idea like that , " says his uncle and the company ' s president , Brian McAllister . If the price is right , however , he may bring oil-field service vessels laid up in the Gulf of Mexico to New York for charter . Corporations are footing much of the bill . Merrill Lynch &; Co. is chartering a hospital ship , and Allied Signal Inc. is hoping to complete for the occasion a 104-foot yacht it was already building . For $700 , 000 , Avon Products Inc. plans to put 750 employees on three excursion boats . Prices are " just exorbitant , " says Charles McCabe , a senior vice president of Manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat after being quoted prices up to $2 , 000 a person . Audrey Hubert , a charterer , says she visited one New York pier where the owner wanted $500 to park a boat . " It was just poles in the water , " she says . New York City ' s dock space has crumbled to less than half what it was 10 years ago when more than 10 , 000 craft arrived for Operation Sail 1976 , a third the number expected this year . Port officials worry that with an estimated 500 , 000 people on boats , many won ' t have access to shore . " We ' ll really have a major city on the water , " says Mr. Cretan , who hopes to provide some medical , food and garbage collection services . Amid shifting currents and debris , 300 Coast Guard vessels will mark safety zones around the statue , anchored navy vessels and fireworks barges . Specially designed fluorescent signs will flash interchangeable messages such as " Stand by , you are about to be boarded by the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away drunk or disorderly crews and unseaworthy craft , including kayaks , canoes or motorized surfboards . The Coast Guard also is discouraging any boat manufacturers or boating groups seeking world-wide television exposure during the tall-ships parade . Recently it turned down Ohio ' s offer to send a delegation of Indian war canoes . " It would make Ohio stand out , " says Joseph Sommer , the director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources , adding , " We ' re disappointed , but we won ' t go to court or anything . " Then there ' s an editor at National Geographic magazine who wants an outrigger canoe from the Federated States of Micronesia to be included despite the tribal boat ' s limited speed . " What would you think of an attempt to motorize the outrigger to make it fit for the parade ? " she asks Operation Sail , which doesn ' t think much of the idea . Coast Guard predictions of rampant collisions , bumpings and scrapings don ' t daunt John Krevey , the owner of the Useless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " The guy who polishes his boat and keeps everything spotless should worry . " Since the Useless isn ' t Coast Guard-certified to carry paying passengers , Mr. Krevey says he will carry 30 to 40 friends on Liberty Weekend . Docked near the Useless at a rotting Manhattan pier is his second vessel , a 1926 tugboat named the River Rat . A pipe holds a metal plate over a three-inch hole in her rusting hull , and her engine has been removed and junked . Mr. Krevey says he is trying to raise $30 , 000 to fix the River Rat and have her towed to anchor near the Statue of Liberty for the festivities . Meanwhile , captains with seaworthy craft are preparing their defenses . Martin Weiss , who will sail the schooner Nighthawk to the celebration from Baltimore , plans to install fenders and a large horn . The Nighthawk , offered for charters at $1 , 000 a person a day , also carries a fire hose for use against unruly boaters . " If things get out of hand , spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . Of course , some boaters may figure that the best defense is to set sail in the opposite direction . Robert Terdeman , a past commodore of the Harlem Yacht Club in City Island , N.Y. , says he will watch the festivities from his 30-foot sailboat  --  on a portable television set . Mr. Terdeman says he wants to avoid " collisions with less experienced sailors , boats out of control and too much traffic . " He adds : " I ' d rather be with my friends on a beach than in the middle of a nautical version of the Long Island Expressway .
