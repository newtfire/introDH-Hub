Merry , spanking breezes stiffened the purple Royal Standard above Castle Magdalena , which signified the presence of comely Queen Victoria Eugenie with Royal Infantes+ and Infantas on the seaside at smart Santander . Her Majesty , a granddaughter of Britain 's late Queen Victoria , would be pleased to hear the gossip of her native Court , pleased too that King Alfonso had " seen his tailor " in Savile Row so successfully .

When King and Dictator clasped hands , last week , and retired for a most private conference , baffled Spaniards were left in disgruntled suspense ' concerning ' the National Scandal . <P> Maddening Rumors . As everyone remembers , the rich Seorita Mercedes de Castellanos , 47 , was courted for several months by the Dictator , who announced his engagement in April , and then publicly broke it off ( TIME , June 18 ) with the explanation that his fiancee had been seen on the floor of the Madrid Stock Exchange accompanied by two noblemen and that such conduct was " imprudent and inexplicable . " Since then the Dictator has refused challenges to duel by the noblemen concerned , Conde de Cemira and the Duque de Almodovar , and has been cut by such great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montellano , both intimate friends of jilted Seorita Mercedes de Castellanos.
