In the days before Verdi 's domination of Italian music , when an opera buffa meant two tunes , a plank and an ensemble , Rossini composed The Barber of Seville . Yet despite critics who have scraped fy-fying fingers , directors who have indicated with expressive gestures the works of later composers , great coloraturas continue to elect this work . Last week , Galli-Curci , famed prima donna , made in it her first appearance of the season at the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan . Sweetly she rendered the falling cadenzas , the elegant trills , the brave bravuras . A great house , which came to praise , noticed that her lower register had improved , disregarded the fact that her high notes were sometimes a shade flat , sometimes thin to the point of expiration . Every loop and somersault of her voice through its silver trapezes was violently applauded . The bellowing buffoonery of Titta Ruffo , the Barber , helped to cause the family circle and half the standees to go home with red palms .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
