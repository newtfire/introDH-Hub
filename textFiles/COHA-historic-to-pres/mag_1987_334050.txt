Only once before has the Dow Jones industrial average crossed a milestone of such dizzying stature . Before the magic of 2000 came the mystique of 1000 . The Dow first broke through that barrier more than 14 years ago , closing at 1003.16 on Nov. 14 , 1972 . For nearly a decade before , brokers had dreamed ! about the event , describing it as " romantic " and comparing it to the first breaking of the 4-min. mile . " It 's a hell of a news item , " said one investment-house partner on the day it finally happened . Economist John Kenneth Galbraith , on the other hand , downplayed it , saying , " Mostly it was useful to people who needed an excuse to get drunk . " But many Wall Streeters believed the general intoxication surrounding the event would inspire small- time investors to pour their money into the market and keep the Dow rolling inexorably forward . <P> The 1000 mark was sweet to Wall Street because it capped a long struggle . The Dow had momentarily crossed 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1966 , but had fallen back before the end of the day . The index rallied in 1968 , but then began a rocky slide as the Viet Nam War continued to eat away at the nation 's morale and economic health . For the next few years inflation and recession knocked the Dow down every time it tried to edge up toward 1000 . <P> Finally , toward the end of 1972 , came a time of national optimism and prosperity . The economy had been expanding for 24 months , and experts predicted a growth spurt of as much as 6% for 1973 . National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger made his famous prediction in October that peace was at hand in Viet Nam . The final boost came on Nov. 7 , when President Nixon and Vice President Agnew won re-election in a huge landslide . Exactly one week later the market hit the millennium . <P> The giddiness prompted Wall Street bulls to forecast that the Dow would break 1100 and even 1200 within twelve to 18 months . Said William Donaldson , chairman of the investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the industrials went over and stayed over 1000 has big psychological importance . " Few investors expected the stampede to continue without a pause , but even the grouchiest bears would not have guessed what actually happened : the Dow was unable to break 1100 until more than ten years later  --  during the bull market of the ' 80s . <P> After topping 1000 , the Dow climbed to a ' 70s peak of 1051.70 on Jan. 11 , 1973 , and promptly fell into the worst bear market since World War II . The Watergate scandal was heating up , inflation surged , and the Arab oil embargo hit . The Dow plunged relentlessly for nearly two years , until it lost 45% of its value , hitting a ' 70s nadir of 577.60 on Dec. 6 , 1974 . The market seesawed upward during the rest of the ' 70s , but was kept under 1000 by inflation , recessions and a second oil shock in 1979 . The lesson of those sober years is that reaching the 2000 milestone reveals almost nothing about what is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
