What is culture , after all ? The immigrant shrugs . Latin Americans initially come to the U.S. with only the things they need in mind  --  not abstractions like culture . They need dollars . They need food . Maybe they need to get out of the way of bullets . Most of us who concern ourselves with Hispanic-American culture , as painters , musicians , writers  --  or as sons and daughters  --  are the children of immigrants . We have grown up on this side of the border , in the land of Elvis Presley and Thomas Edison . Our lives are prescribed by the mall , by the 7-Eleven , by the Internal Revenue Service . Our imaginations vacillate between an Edenic Latin America , which nevertheless betrayed our parents , and the repellent plate-glass doors of a real American city , which has been good to us . <P> Hispanic-American culture stands where the past meets the future . The cultural meeting represents not just a Hispanic milestone , not simply a celebration at the crossroads . America transforms into pleasure what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now in evidence ( the teen movie , the rock song ) may exist in an hourglass , may in fact be irrelevant . The U.S. Border Patrol works through the night to arrest the flow of illegal immigrants over the border , even as Americans stand patiently in line for La Bamba . While Americans vote to declare , once and for all , that English shall be the official language of the U.S. , Madonna starts recording in Spanish . <P> Before a national TV audience , Rita Moreno tells Geraldo Rivera that her dream as an actress is to play a character rather like herself : " I speak English perfectly well . . . I 'm not dying from poverty . . . I want to play that kind of Hispanic woman , which is to say , an American citizen . " This is an actress talking ; these are show-biz pieties . But Moreno expresses as well a general Hispanic-American predicament . Hispanics want to belong to America without betraying the past . Yet we fear losing ground in any negotiation with America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our culture . <P> We come from an expansive , an intimate , culture that has long been judged second-rate by the U.S. Out of pride as much as affection , we are reluctant to give up our past . Our notoriety in the U.S. has been our resistance to assimilation . The guarded symbol of Hispanic-American culture has been the tongue of flame : Spanish . But the remarkable legacy Hispanics carry from Latin America is not language  --  an inflatable skin  --  but breath itself , capacity of soul , an inclination to live . The genius of Latin America is the habit of synthesis . We assimilate . <P> What Latin America knows is that people create one another when they meet . In the music of Latin America you will hear the litany of bloodlines : the African drum , the German accordion , the cry from the minaret . The U.S. stands as the opposing New World experiment . In North America the Indian and the European stood separate . Whereas Latin America was formed by a Catholic dream of one world , of meltdown conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has believed its national strength derives from separateness , from diversity . The glamour of the U.S. is the Easter promise : you can be born again in your lifetime . You can separate yourself from your past . You can get a divorce , lose weight , touch up your roots .
