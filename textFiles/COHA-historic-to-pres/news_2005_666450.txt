One after another , men and women took the makeshift podium and shared their anger about unemployment and living in poverty . Many of the thousands of demonstrators crowding the city square cried - it was their first public forum in many years in this tightly controlled former Soviet republic . <p> Suddenly , an armored personnel carrier sped by . Immediately afterward came a truck of soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and helmets , Kalashnikov rifles across their chests . When a second truck with troops drove through , protesters hurled stones - and the troops opened fire into the crowd . <p> The soldiers , loyal to Uzbekistan 's authoritarian leader , a U.S. ally , took decisive action Friday to put down an uprising that began when armed men freed 2,000 inmates from prison , including suspects on trial for alleged Islamic extremism . <p> The death toll from a day of violence in the eastern Uzbek city was not known . The government said nine died before the shootings in the square but gave no overall figure . Witnesses said the troops may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots were heard briefly in central Andijan early Saturday ; still , the streets appeared largely quiet with most of the city 's 350,000 people in their homes . <p> Authorities said security forces had regained control of the city administration building seized earlier in the day by armed protesters . Hostages taken by the demonstrators as human shields at the building were released , a high-ranking Uzbek official said on condition he not be named . <p> The prison raid and the soldiers ' fusillades were in sharp contrast to the largely peaceful uprisings that sparked regime changes in the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan in the past 18 months . President Islam Karimov is regarded as one of the harshest leaders in the region and apparently favors moving quickly against any threats to his regime . <p> Uzbekistan is a key Washington ally in the war on terrorism and hosts a U.S. air base to support military operations in neighboring Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks . But it also is frequently denounced by human rights groups and Western governments for torture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government and the demonstrators . <p> " The people of Uzbekistan want to see a more representative and democratic government . But that should come through peaceful means not through violence , and that 's what our message is , " White House spokesman Scott McClellan said . " We have had concerns about human rights in Uzbekistan , but we are concerned about the outbreak of violence , particularly by some members of a terrorist organization that were freed from prison . " <p> The focus of the jailbreak were 23 men on trial on charges of being members of a group allied with the outlawed radical Islamic party Hizb-ut-Tahrir , which seeks to create a worldwide Islamic state and has been forced underground throughout most of Central Asia and Russia . <p> Supporters of the 23 men maintain they were victims of religious repression by Karimov 's secular government . <p> The 23 are members of Akramia - a group named for their founder , Akram Yuldashev , an Islamic dissident sentenced in 1999 to 17 years in prison for allegedly urging the overthrow of Karimov in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akramis are considered the backbone of Andijan 's small business community , running a medical clinic and pharmacy , as well as working as furniture craftsmen , and providing employment to thousands in the impoverished Fergana Valley , where Islamist sentiment runs high . <p> Their trial has inspired one of the largest public shows of anger at the government . In recent weeks , Uzbeks have shown increasing willingness to challenge the leadership in protests , apparently bolstered by the March uprising in Kyrgyzstan that drove out President Askar Akayev and similar ones in Ukraine and Georgia . <p> Before dawn Friday , armed supporters of the defendants raided the jail in Andijan where the men were being held , freeing all 23 as well as about 2,000 other prisoners . A rights activist , Saidjakhon Zainabiddinov , said late Friday that some of those freed were surrendering to avoid retaliation . <p> During the day , thousands of people swarmed into the streets of Uzbekistan 's fourth-largest city , clashing with police and seizing the administration building . Nine people were killed in those clashes and 34 wounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parpiyev , told The Associated Press the death toll could be as high as 50 . <p> Cars were set ablaze and a nearby theaters were burning . Two bodies laid splayed near the square - one with a stomach wound , another burned . Several military helicopters circled overhead . <p> " We want to be allowed to work and do our business without hindrance , " the 42-year-old Parpiyev told AP . <p> One of the 23 defendants , Abduvosid Egomov , was holed up in the local government compound . <p> " We are not going to overthrow the government . We demand economic freedom , " Egomov told AP . " We are ready to die instead of living as we are living now . The Uzbek people have been reduced to living like dirt . " <p> Parpiyev said Interior Minister Zakir Almatov called him Friday morning and heard the protesters ' demands . He initially agreed to negotiations but said later that the offer of talks was off , the protest organizer said . <p> " He said , ' We do n't care if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force and we will chuck you out of there anyway , " ' Parpiyev quoted Almatov as saying . <p> In the afternoon , about 4,000 protesters massed in the central square and set up a podium under a monument to Babur , an Uzbek prince , where speakers complained of unemployment and living in poverty . <p> For some , it was the first time in their lives they were able to speak out in public . <p> Protest organizers , some with Kalashnikov automatic rifles slung across their chests , took turns addressing the crowd through a microphone . <p> " You have a chance now to say what you 've wanted to speak openly about all these years , " one thin , slight speaker wearing a white Muslim cap urged the crowd . " Come on and talk . " <p> But shortly before dusk , the soldiers moved in and opened fire , sending the terrified demonstrators fleeing . One man wailed , " Oh , my son ! He 's dead ! " <p> A witness told The Associated Press he had seen a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed to the square . The city 's hospital was cordoned off and officials could not be reached for casualty figures . <p> Karimov and other officials flew to Andijan during the day but returned to the capital of Tashkent on Friday night . <p> The government blocked foreign news reports for its domestic audience . <p> Uzbek authorities blame the banned party Hizb-ut-Tahrir for inspiring deadly attacks and bombings last year that killed more than 50 people in Uzbekistan . Hizb-ut-Tahrir says it disavows violence and has denied responsibility . <p> A statement from Hizb-ut-Tahrir 's office in London said " the blame for today 's unrest lies squarely with the desperate Karimov regime whose repression of Uzbekistan 's Muslims knows no bounds or limits . " <p> The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , which is linked to al-Qaida and the Taliban , also fought for establishment of an Islamic state in the Fergana Valley since the 1990s . Andijan is in the Fergana Valley , and there are concerns that the region could be a flashpoint for destabilizing wide swaths of ex-Soviet Central Asia . <p> Uzbekistan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-largest exporter of cotton . The largely arid nation , which depends heavily on irrigation , also has some gold and oil reserves .
