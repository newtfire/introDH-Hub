Although London 's Fulham is one of the smallest election districts in Britain , last week 's by-election there was hailed by many as the most important of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's seven years in power . With unemployment in Fulham running at 13% , and many people outraged by a recent government decision to increase pensions by only 55 cents a week , the Conservatives seemed likely to take a beating . Few were surprised , therefore , when Labor 's Nick Raynsford won the seat handily . It was Labor 's most impressive by- election victory since Thatcher first came to power . <P> Despite the defeat , the Conservatives were relieved that they got to find that Thatcher 's recent problems had not done more damage . They ended up with 35% of the vote , well ahead of the Social Democrat-Liberal alliance , which pulled in just 19%.
