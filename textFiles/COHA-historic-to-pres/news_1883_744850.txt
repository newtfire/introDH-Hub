At the last meeting of the English Congregational Union , the Rev. Mr. IIIIRDALL read a paper urging the abolition of sermons . He held that the sermon as a part of divine service is " unscriptural , " and that it is a powerful agent in keeping people away from church . He pointed out the fact that the Salvation Army leaders do not preach , and are therefore able to attract crowds of people to the Salvation Army meetings , and he insisted that if all religious bodies were to imitate the Salvationists in discarding sermons , both ministers and people would be the better for it . The reverend gentleman is clearly wrong in asserting that sermons are , " unscriptural , " by which , of course , he means that they are contrary to the teaching of Scripture . The only argument which he adduces in favor of this view is that the Scriptures nowhere assert that sermons should form part of divine worship . Now , he must remember that long ago the Chaplain of New gate drank punch , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture , and hence was an innocent one . Vie same reasoning will convince any fairminded Congregational theologian that sermons are not contrary to Scripture . Mr. HIIRDALL has not got hold of the right end of the Newgate method of Scriptural interpretation , and his effort to prove that sermons are " unscriptural " is not worthy of consideration . The Salvation Army can afford to throw aside sermons , since the Salvationist religion , being entirely an emotional one , can flourish on a strong but simple diet of songs and shouts . The Roman Catholic has in the mass a religious service which is quite satisfactory to him , and can therefore easily dispense with sermons ; and many Anglicans consider that their own service is improved just in proportion as the sermon is shortened . But that the minister of a denomination which makes the sermon the chief part of divine service should propose to abolish sermons altogether is most surprising . If the sermon is taken away , what have the Congregationalists left wherewith to attract people to their meeting-houses ? Obviously , nothing , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection plate ; and it is very improbable that these would prove attractive features . Mr. ilIIIMALL is right in saying that many people do not like sermons , and stay away from church in order to escape them ; but , on the other hand , there are many people to whom the sermon is an attraction . There are the honest people who sleep in church . What would these do were there to be no sermon ? There is no opportunity for sleeping afforded by any part of the service except the sermon . The church-goer who is kept awake during the first part of the service , and settles himself for a refreshing nap when the sermon begins , would have no object in going to church were the sermon abolished . What , for instance , could Mr. HunDALL offer to his congregation in exchange for his sermons ? If he ceases to preach , Sunday will no longer be a day of rest to those who have hitherto slept sweetly under his preaching ; and he will find that instead of going to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest by reading the religious newspapers .
