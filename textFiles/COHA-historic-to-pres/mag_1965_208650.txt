The first 30 U.S. astronauts were all top jet pilots . Last week the National Aeronautics and Space Administration named six more-and a couple of them ca n't even fly . Four of the new men are scientists with Ph.D.s ; the other two are physicians . NASA hopes to utilize their scientific skills after manned flights to the moon become an accomplished fact. *The astro-scientists : <P> &gt;Owen K. Garriott , 34 , an associate professor of physics at Stanford University , is a wispy ( 5 ft. 9 in. , 145 Ibs. ) electrical engineer specializing in ionospheric physics . He holds a private pilot 's license for single-engine land planes , first applied for the space program 18 months ago , got nowhere , had to reapply . <P> &gt; Edward G. Gibson , 29 , physicist and senior researcher at Philco 's Applied Research Laboratories , has flown only as a passenger . Like his three colleagues who are not qualified to fly jets , he will undergo a 55-week training course that will eventually certify him as a jet pilot . He volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read aloud a newspaper story about NASA 's new interest in science-trained spacemen . <P> &gt; Duane E. Graveline , 34 , joined NASA last month as a flight surgeon after serving at the Air Force 's Aerospace Medicine School . An expert on weightlessness , he hopes to experience it and other effects of prolonged flight in space . Graveline has a private pilot 's license but is not jet-qualified . <P> &gt;Lieut . Commander Joseph P. Kerwin , 33 , a Navy flight surgeon and jet pilot , has hankered for astronaut 's wings for two years , says it took him exactly 1 seconds to make up his mind when he heard NASA was out shopping . <P> &gt;Frank Curtis Michel , 31 , a physicist and assistant professor of space sciences at Rice University , is an expert on solar winds . Although he had flown Air Force jet fighters for three years , his first application for the space program was rejected in 1963 because of insufficient flying time . <P> &gt; Harrison H. Schmitt , 29 , a member of the U.S. Geological Survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served as project chief for photo and telescopic mapping of the moon and planets . Like Gibson , he is not yet a pilot . Of all the astronauts , Schmitt is the only bachelor . <P> By the time they are through with their training , the astro-scientists will be able to fly space capsules as well as jets . They will probably do some spacecraft piloting , but their main function will be as expert passengers in moon flights four or five years from now . Explains Dr. Robert R. Gilruth , director of NASA 's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston : " After we 've developed a transportation system to the moon and back , we can enjoy the luxury of scientific experiments . " <P> <P> *These will be missions flown in three-man Apollo spacecraft . Meanwhile , crews for the remaining two-man Gemini nights will be drawn from the 28 pilots still active . Scheduled for the next three shots : Major Gordon Cooper and Lieut . Commander Charles Conrad in Gemini 5 next month , Commander Walter Schirra and Major Thomas Stafford in Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut . Commander James Lovell in Gemini 7 early next year .
