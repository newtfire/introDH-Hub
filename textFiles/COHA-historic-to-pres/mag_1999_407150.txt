" KATCH " ING SOME QUALITY TIME // Just wanted to say thank you for your fantastic magazine . My son and I have just completed building the Krit-R-Katcher from your last issue ( Country Lore , April/May ' 99 ) . We really had a good time together . It was raining out , there was no baseball game to go to , so we just set to work . We have not caught any " Krit-R 's " yet , but even if we do n't , my son loves baiting the trap and checking it . In 20 years , we will be able to look back on this time and remember the trap we built , using plans we found in MOTHER EARTH NEWS . Shawn Garrett Mesquite , Texas ( Not ) For the Birds Upon reading my latest TMEN , I see another well-meaning person suggesting fabric scraps and dryer lint be left out for birds to use as nesting material ( Country Lore , April/May ' 99 ) . I have been advised that these or any absorbent materials are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain water when it rains and keep the nest damp too long , causing increased cases of fungal infections and the like in baby birds . Please provide only materials that do not retain water . Human or animal hair are excellent nesting material and nicely personal , too ! Christy Smith Hayward , California Thanks for the Bees Thanks Mom . Just in time . Bees . Neighbor and I were planning on buying beehives . Now we have the plans for the same ( " Beekeeping Basics , " Feb/Mar ' 99 ) . I hope Keith Rawlinson will again write a page on the care of bees and any special tips along the way . I had been reading books , but found that Mr. Rawlinson gave information other books did not . I appreciate Mr. Rawlinson sharing his skills , and thank you for publishing them . Patricia Ball Cave Junction , Oregon Honey and Babies I 'm really sweet on your magazine . I read it cover to cover each month . However , I 'm not sweet on your recent article , " Healing With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the first page of the article , there is a box discussing the risks of babies ingesting honey and botulism , which is certainly appropriate . Yet , on the next page , there is a box describing easy honey uses , with a nursing salve described as one home remedy . Just a simple question here : Who do you think is going to be latched onto the breast of a lactating mother ? Nursing babies and toddlers , right Are n't they then at risk for ingesting honey , which can cause botulism in young children ? If a nursing mother has sore , cracked nipples , it is because her baby is improperly latched onto the breast . She needs to have someone who is skilled in assisting women to breast-feed observe and assist her as her baby nurses . This could be a lactation consultant , La Leche League leader or even an experienced nursing mother . Slapping some honey-soaked gauze on her nipples is going to make the situation worse by not solving the underlying problem , which is poor latch-on . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's nipples are cracked , bleeding or blistered . Usually , the only thing a mother needs is her own milk , which has unique healing and antiinfective properties and will not expose her child to botulism or something that tastes different from mother 's milk . Bottom line : proper latch-on will correct the problem , not honey ! So , what makes me qualified to tell MOTHER the real deal on treating gnawed nipples ? Well , I 'm a nursing mother , a registered nurse , a certified childbirth and breast-feeding educator , La Leche League member and a dedicated MOTHER EARTH NEWS reader . Maurenne Griese , RNC , BSN Manhatten , Kansas Smart Energy for a New Millennium Thank you for your article on the state of alternative energy ( Bits &; Pieces , Feb/Mar ' 99 ) . I have been following the development of better batteries and fuel cells for years . Your readers need to consider that in order for a real revolution in energy to take place , we must be careful that we are not substituting polluting products ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nonrenewable fuel sources ( i.e. , hydrogen fuel cells that use platinum ) for the ones we are already using . We must transition to energy storage that is benign in its long-term effect on the environment . We must not trade reliance on one finite source ( fossil fuels ) for another ( platinum ) . Photograph Matt and Shawn Garrett display their handiwork . Photograph Maurenne Griese sets us straight on honey remedy . // We live in a time full of incredible possibilities for change in the way we create and capture energy . We need to make sure that we have our requirements for 21st-century energy generation and storage clear : nonpolluting , fully recyclable batteries and energy generators that make use of common , readily available elements , not rare ones . And , Of course , best of all are the energy sources that nature provides so bountifully-solar , wind and water . As I travel to work each day , I look around and envision a time in the not-too-distant future when the power lines will all be gone because each home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , and we will look back on oil spills , pipeline leaks and wars over oil rights as a sad and pointless part of our history . Jylle Benson-Gauss Hector , New York Diploma Mills Exposed I thought your May 1999 article on home study ( " A Long-Distance Diploma " ) was great . It 's about time someone checks out these kinds of things . People have been lied to and ripped off for way too long and something should be done about all of these con artists . Thank you for doing something about a small part of big problem . Linda Sheve Pound , Wisconsin Drawing Walls Regarding your review of home-design software ( " Let Your Fingers Do the Building , " April/May ' 99 ) : While I 'll agree that AutoDesk 's AutoCad is a bit much for the one-time home designer , the author 's comments have a glaring error . AutoCad software does not require that one create " every single line " for drawing walls . In all releases after R12 , one simply loads and calls up the Lisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This allows the user to create a double parallel line , spaced a user-defined number of units apart and centering on the left , right or center . The perfect tool for drawing walls . Jim Arnott Union , Oregon Nothing Like a " Good-Attitude " Cat In reading " Pest Control : Tips from a Pro " ( Feb/Mar ' 99 ) , there 's one you neglected to mention : A " good-attitude " cat can literally scare away very large , entrenched Norway rats , as we happily found out . In the late 1980s , we were renting a small , two-story house on a farmstead that was being used as a custom-reservation restaurant . No animals were raised , but plenty of garden vegetables were . The rats had taken over the outbuildings and we were annoyed nightly by rats in the pantry . They could chew up the kitchen floor faster than we could patch ! After three to four months of this nightmare , we adopted a declawed , spayed , abandoned cat from my sister , who had rescued it from a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Dumpsterette " - unable to kill anything except mice small enough to behead by biting-had nevertheless made a firm pact with the nearly two-pound rodents , most of whom were her size ( she was only a seven-pound cat and very short ) . We never again had rats in the pantry and never had mice in the house . And p.s. - fox terriers are also good rat catchers ! Marcia Walls Bedminster , Pennsylvania Save the Goldenseal Being an herbalist , I always enjoy reading about people discovering the efficacy of herbal preparations ( " Homemade Herbal Liniment , " Country Lore , Feb/Mar ' 99 ) . I do , however , want to offer a few words in the defense of the cost of goldenseal . I am glad to see it get prohibitively expensive . This plant is highly endangered due to overharvesting and was never meant to be used routinely . There are plenty of alternative herbs that grow plentifully-Oregon grape root comes to mind . Also , essential oils have anti-inflammatory and anitbacterial properties and would make a lovely addition to your liniment . Lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you use therapeuticgrade oils . If you are ever unsure about which herb to use , get in touch with a local herbalist . He or she will be glad to provide guidance . Nam Stilwagen Florissant , Colorado Add Vodka , Hold the Alcohol Your homemade herbal liniment recipe ( Country Lore , Feb/Mar ' 99 ) sounds like a good one , except for the rubbing alcohol . Isopropyl alcohol is certainly poisonous and possibly a carcinogen . Using it on mouth sores or as a gargle seems risky to me , even without swallowing . Photograph Tiggy and WonTon on rodent patrol . // Substituting a mixture of vodka and pure water would probably be a lot safer , if more expensive ( though still cheaper than a visit to the doctor ) . I still would n't advise swallowing this mixture without diluting it first ... I imagine that the cayenne would burn all the way down !
