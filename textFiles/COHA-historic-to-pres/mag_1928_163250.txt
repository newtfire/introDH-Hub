If seven maids with seven mops should sweep for endless years they could do little with the desert sands of Gobi . No ocean beats upon these sands ; no sheiks beguile the tourist . In the heart of Mongolia in northern China the Gobi desert sprawls , 500,000 square miles of forgotten loneliness . Last week a distinguished German emerged from this loneliness and a U. S. expedition penetrated deeper into its mystery . <P> German . For two and a half years the German dug the brisk point of his intelligence into Gobi 's secretive sand . Through the desert he trekked southward accompanied by obscure missionaries . When the sands of the desert grew cold in the mountain passes of Thibet , his feet chilled and hardened . Feet still half-frozen when he arrived at Leh , in northern India , he announced happily to the world that the scientific purpose of his wanderings ( not stated ) had been accomplished . He is Dr. Wilhelm Filchner . <P> U. S. Meanwhile the Central Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the northern sands . Geologists , paleontologists , topographers , zoologists , archeologists , accompanied by 125 camels , eight motor trucks , many horses and Chinese boys , seek the western wastes of Gobi hoping to uncover secrets of man 's origin . This is the fourth expedition of its kind . The last one , 1923 , returned with the fossilized eggs of the dinosaur , aged some ten million years . The present expedition will collect lower animal fossils when found under foot , but the main interest will centre on recent prehuman ancestors not older than three million years . <P> Man is believed to have originated in Asia because Asia is the oldest continuously dry land in the world ; because climate and topography were ideal there for the development of the dawnman ; because the glacial ice ages of Europe missed this area . Westward and eastward from Gobi probably traveled those hairy primates whose descendants are now called Smith , Karpetsky , Hop Lee , Seraphino . <P> Last week Paleontologist Walter Granger motored 100 miles to a telegraph post to tell civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his wound was not serious . The gun was his own , accidentally discharged during an antelope hunt ; the leg was his own , accidentally in the way . It is probable that Antelope-Hunter Andrews quoted Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson 's famed remark , as he has done before : " Adventures are a mark of incompetence . "
