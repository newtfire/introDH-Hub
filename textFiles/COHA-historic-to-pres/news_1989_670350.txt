WARSAW  --  President Bush sought to support Poland ' s reform efforts with a modest mix of aid and trade incentives and several carefully calibrated political gestures . Chief among Mr. Bush ' s economic boosts to the faltering Polish economy was an agreement to allow Poland to delay repayment of about $1 billion owed to the U.S. government . Mr. Bush also vowed to press Poland ' s other creditors to support " an early and generous " rescheduling of the remainder of that country ' s $39 billion foreign debt . Discussions on the issue , which will take place when the president attends a summit of the major industrial nations in Paris later this week , would be aimed at allowing Poland to postpone payment of about $5 billion this year , White House officials said . In an address to the newly elected Polish parliament  --  the first in the East bloc with substantial opposition membership  --  Mr. Bush also said he would ask Congress to authorize a $100 million grant to shore up Poland ' s nascent private sector . And he promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment , mostly for air and water pollution control equipment for the city of Krakow . Under the new debt agreement , the Polish government will be granted a five-year grace period on the $1 billion in loans , and then would have 10 years to pay them off , according to White House officials traveling with Mr. Bush . Poland ' s total debt to the U.S. government is about $2. 2 billion . The country owes U.S. commercial lenders about $250 million . In announcing the new initiatives , Mr Bush sought to encourage progress toward a more open political and economic system in the East bloc without appearing to be provocative toward Moscow . " The West works not to disrupt , not to interfere , not to threaten any nation ' s security , but to help forge closer and enduring ties between Poland and the rest of Europe , " Mr. Bush said . At the same time , the president ' s modest proposals seemed designed to satisfy critics of the unrestricted aid the U.S. provided to Poland during the 1970s . Many analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state enterprises . Thus , Mr. Bush , as well as Secretary of State James Baker , repeatedly emphasized the need for Poland ' s leaders to move ahead with difficult economic changes as well as increased political freedom . " We understand in my country the enormous economic problems you face , " Mr. Bush said . " Economic privation is a danger that can threaten any great democratic experiment . And I must speak honestly . Economic reform and recovery can not occur without sacrifices . " He added , " The reform of the Polish economy presents an historic opportunity . There can be no substitute for Poland ' s own efforts . But I want to stress to you today that Poland is not alone . " Mr. Bush said he would press the World Bank to proceed with $325 million in loans to Poland to improve productivity in agriculture and certain industries . He said his various economic moves wouldn ' t undercut efforts by such institutions as the " Paris Club " of creditor nations or the International Monetary Fund . In addition , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist government and the opposition led by the Solidarity trade union . In contrast to his last visit here in 1987 , where he enraged government leaders by openly backing Solidarity , Mr. Bush carefully offered words of praise and encouragement for both Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski and Solidary leader Lech Walesa . He was host at a lunch at the American Embassy for members of the ruling Communist Party , Solidarity , and some minor party members . Mr. Bush also announced his support for expanded cultural-exchange programs between the U.S. and Poland . Mr. Bush ' s latest economic moves were in addition to an earlier proposal to let Poland participate in the Generalized System of Preferences , a program that allows developing countries to ship certain products to the U.S. free of duties . The president also has proposed allowing the Overseas Private Investment Corp. , a federal agency , to insure U.S. companies that invest in Poland . Legislation conferring both benefits on Poland already has been passed by the House and is pending in the Senate . The president ' s reception in Poland was warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovation at the end of his speech to the parliament . But only about 4 , 000 people were on hand when he attended a wreath-laying ceremony at Poland ' s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . His trip may become more emotional today when he travels to Gdansk to meet Mr. Walesa and to lay a wreath commemorating workers killed by the Polish government during a strike in 1970 . Mr. Bush plans to travel to Hungary before going to Paris for the economic summit meeting . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
