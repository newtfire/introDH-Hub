The State De : partment to-night gave out the following statement concerning the discussion between the members of the Cabinet and the Peace Commission to-day : " The members of the Peace Commission . with the exception of Senator Gray , whose absence was due to his inability to withdraw as counsel in a case in which he was engaged some time before his appointment as one of the Peace Commissioners , have spent the greater part of yesterday and today in a free discussion of the duties with the discharge of which they have been intrusted by the President . Senator Gray is expected during the evening , and before sailing will have a full conference with the President and his associates , " While , for obvious reasons , it was determined that the nature of the instructions as to the negotiations about to be entered upon should for the present be kept secret and made known only after definite results shall have been reached , it is possible to state authoritatively that the commission goes to Paris fully prepared to follow a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultations of the last two days . " At the very outset , it will be made clear to the Spanish Commissioners that , as in the case of the preliminary protocol , there can be no deviation from or modification of the demands made by the United States . The decision reached by the President , after a full consultation with the members of the commission , subsequently red-rived the cordial and unanimous approval of the Cabinet at a meeting held at 3 o'clock this . - aaernoon . ' The President consumed the day in discussing the Philippine question . He met the Peace Commissioners . except Senator Gray , this morning and held a special Cabinet meeting this afternoon for the pdrpose of again going over the entire subject . The President 's Farewell Dinner . To-night all of the Commissioners , except Mr. Gray . dined with the President . The dinner was given in the private dining room , and was ccnfined entirely to gentlumen . It began at S o'clock and the guests remained for some time . A section of th Marine Band was stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , while the Red , Blue , and Green parlors , and the main corridor of the mansion were thrown open for the convenience of the guests . While the dinner was intended as a social courtesy to the departing Commissioners . it gave an opportunity for a more or less informal discussion of the work to be undertaken by them . The guests included the following : Secretary of State Day , Sena t 2r De vis . Senator Frye , the Hon. Whitelaw Reid , Secretary of the Navy Long . Secretary of the Treeeury Gage , Attorney Gen ' cal Griggs . Postmaster General Emory Smith , Secretary of the Interior Bliss . Secretary of Agriculture Wilson , the Hon. John W. Foster , Assistant Secretaries Moore and Adee of the State Department , and Adjt . Gen. Corbin . Senator Gray . one of the Peace Commissioners , was unavoidably absent from the dinner , having failed to reach the city in time . The talk with the Commissioners in the morning was for the most part informal , and the subject matter was reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some new points were broached by the Commissioners , which led the President to cad the special meeting of the Cabinet . The Commissioners are reticent as to what this new phase of the question is , but it is believed to be that the American delegates wish to know more definitely what the Administration expects of them upon the question of holding all or only a part of the Philippines . Commission Without Discretion . At the Cabinet meeting all the Secretaries were present except Mr. Alger . The Philippines were again the subject of a long discussion . After the meeting , Secretary Long said that the commission would go to Paris with definite instructions . This much was decided at the meeting . Nothing , it seems , is to be left to the discretion of the members . They are to raise no issues , make no arguments , except for the amusement of the thing , and calmly insist upon the demands of this country . What these demands are , as formulated by the Cabinet , is not positively known . Both the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of grave reserve and diplomatic reticence upon the matter . I- , seems to be the general impression , however , that the President wishes the demands to be kept secret , in order that an opening may be left for a change In position should public sentiment become more positive and peremptory than it is now . It is thought that Spain , if forced to give up the Island of Luzon , will not care to attempt to hold the rust of the group and wage perpetual war with the insurgents . If this country neglects to occupy the entire archipelago , it is the consensus of the best opinion here that the islands , other than Luzon , will soon fall into the hands of Germany or England , and that the position of this country at Manila would be rendered insecure . It is not at all improbable that the committee will insist upon holding the entire group . The President is aware that the drift of popular sentiment is in this direction , and he is becoming more and moriconvinced that the people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arran , gen ents have been completed for the departure of the commission and its staff . Most of the party will leave ' ashington at 4 o'clock to-morrow after noon for New York , but it is said may be detained by some of the Commissioners until the midnight train . The Campania sails at 2 P. M. Saturday and explicit instructions have been given all the members of the party to be on hand at that time . Special baggage tags have been printed for the belongings of the members , and a small paper pester , showing red and blue bars crossed on a white background , gives a handy way of making a " red , white , and blue " identification of the personal and general luggage of the party . A number of stout cedar chests have been made to carry the books , pamphlets , typewritten papers , &c.,; forming a part of the American case . The chests are like a shallow steamer trunk , so that they may be shoved under the berths . and thus be available on the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steamer . This will permit considerable work on the trip , and it is expected that the Commissioners will hold meetings on shipboard . The party will go direct from Liverpool to London , and there stop for a day 's rest , then proceeding to Paris by the way of Dover and Calais . Senator Frye Non-Committal . Senator Frye called at the War Department during the afternoon and had a. talk with Acting Secretary Meiklejohn . While they were together Representative William Alden Smith of ' Michigan , who-is a memlfe't of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs , joined them . In the course of a good-natured exchange , Mr. Smith urged Senator Frye to hold on to the Philippines as an entirety , as well as all other territory Of which we were possessed as a result of the war . Mr. Frye diplomatically avoided committing himself , beyond remarking that this idea . seemed to be growing . As Mr. Frye came from the department he was asked if he favored a retention of the Philippines , to which he replied : never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
