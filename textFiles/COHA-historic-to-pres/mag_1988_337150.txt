" I can not conceal my remorse , " read the ad splashed across the front page of every daily newspaper in South Korea . Unusual though it was , the public apology by Opposition Leader Kim Young Sam , 60 , was only the first to be offered by losers of South Korea 's first free presidential election in 16 years . Rival Dissident Leader Kim Dae Jung , 62 , issued his mea culpa two days later , conceding his " unbearably heavy responsibility " for the victory two weeks ago of Roh Tae Woo , 55 , the candidate of the ruling Democratic Justice Party . By splitting the opposition vote , the two Kims had allowed Roh to win with only 36.6% of the ballots cast . <P> Though their concessions were painfully apt , neither Kim backed away from charges that Roh won by cheating . Kim Dae Jung , who finished third with 27% of the vote , seemed especially bitter : " It 's utterly incomprehensible that I , who was able to mobilize millions of people at my campaign rallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Young Sam , who drew 28% , said his party would work with Roh to revise laws for National Assembly elections . The offer seemed aimed at repairing Kim 's credibility as an effective political force . Said Lee Chul , an opposition National Assembly member : " The two Kims are now turning into obstacles for democratic developments in our country . At the mention of their names , many people grimace . " <P> Meanwhile , Roh Tae Woo moved confidently into his new role as President- elect . To help strengthen South Korea 's relations with Japan , the former general met with Shintaro Abe , secretary-general of Japan 's Liberal Democratic Party , and chatted by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita . Roh promised to seek improved relations with China after he takes office on Feb. 25 . Any warming between the two nations could reduce tensions between Seoul and Communist North Korea , a staunch Beijing ally . <P> Roh promised to hold a national vote of confidence after next September 's Olympic Games in Seoul and to step down if he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prayed with Buddhist monks and met with Presbyterian leaders . Roh delayed a meeting with Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan at Seoul 's Myongdong Cathedral , where a band of students was demonstrating against the election . He worked hard to keep his campaign image of the ordinary man , urging a delegation of garbage collectors to call him Mister instead of the customary Your Excellency . But his ultimate sacrifice may have been giving up the traditional presidential vehicle , a bulletproof Cadillac , in favor of the far more modest Korean-made Grandeur sedan .
