The phone rang at about 11:15 yesterday morning . My friend and producer Matt Kelliher was calling with the news that Bo Schembechler had collapsed while taping a television show and was in critical condition in a suburban Detroit hospital . My reaction was completely nonchalant . <p> Schembechler was 77 years old . He had a 37-year history of heart disease and was diabetic . But it hardly crossed my mind that Schembechler would die now  --  not on the eve of the biggest Michigan-Ohio State game ever , not the morning after addressing the Wolverines in Ann Arbor , Mich. , before they would set out for Columbus , Ohio . Schembechler was one of those men you could n't really see giving in to death . His life was one stubborn comeback after another . Bo himself called it cheating death . <p> Schembechler did that on the eve of his first Rose Bowl in 1970 . He did it after his quadruple bypass in 1976 . <p> He slipped right past death after his second heart attack , in 1987 , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year . Just last month , after collapsing in that same television studio , Bo spent a few days in the hospital and emerged , his photo appearing under the newspaper headline , " I 'm a Miracle ! " It 's hard to imagine anybody was tougher than Glenn Schembechler . During that hospital stay , a nurse reportedly asked Schembechler how much he weighed and he answered , " 205 pounds of twisted blue steel . " <p> The next phone call , just after noon , brought the news that Schembechler had died , unbelievably about 27 hours before " The Game " was to kick off . Almost immediately , we began seeing the clips of Bo stalking the sideline , or Bo and Woody Hayes , or Bo throwing a clipboard to the ground with such force he fell on his can . . . probably at the Rose Bowl , a game that he failed to win in his first five trips . <p> Even Schembechler had to die sometime , and there 's something poetic about him dying now , at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in his role in making it the single greatest college football rivalry in America , in his charismatic 21-year run as head coach at the University of Michigan . <p> Truth is , I was one of those sons of the Midwest who grew up hating Michigan . There was no real reason to hate the Wolverines ; probably it was because my brother Don loved them , loved Bo . But even as a teenager , I came to realize you only hate worthy teams , winners , consistent powerhouses who did n't appear to need any help or assistance in beating anybody , teams such as the Yankees and Celtics , Notre Dame and Michigan . <p> I always rooted for Ohio State to beat Michigan , so it was stunning to see undefeated and top-ranked Ohio State , one win from a shot at a second straight national championship in 1969 , lose to Michigan and its first-year coach , Bo Schembechler , 24-12 . The whole thing must have overwhelmed Bo , too , because he had a heart attack six weeks later . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three straight seasons ruined by Hayes and the Buckeyes . Hayes would n't refer to Michigan by name , only as " the school up north . " The saddest thing about Hayes hitting that Clemson player in some bowl game at the end of the 1978 season was that Bo vs . Woody was done forever . The rivalry endures , but it 's not as much fun . The games are n't as Neanderthal . During the Ten-Year War , as it 's called in the Midwest , Woody 's Ohio State teams threw a total of three touchdown passes , and Bo 's Michigan teams threw a grand total of four . Nobody scored more than 24 points . <p> It took Schembechler six tries to win a Rose Bowl , and I reveled in every defeat . I wondered why Bo seemed to take all of his football philosophy from Hayes , under whom he played for one season at Miami ( Ohio ) , and none from the father of the passing game , Sid Gillman , who coached Schembechler his first three years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools would bring Bo so much misery . <p> " Five times , my team and myself have been lower than a snake 's belly , " Schembechler said in reflection . <p> He coached the Wolverines long enough for me to become a sportswriter , covering college football for The Washington Post in the mid-1980s . I remember being completely nervous before an interview that had been set up in Schembechler 's office in Ann Arbor . I was told I had 10 minutes . Bo was n't as big as I expected , but he looked younger . His voice sounded exactly the way I imagined Gen. George Patton 's voice sounding . <p> He sort of barked at me , " You 're pretty young to be working for The Washington Post . . . . Where did you go to school , young man ? " I told him I 'd gone to Northwestern and he said , " Did you know I worked as an assistant at Northwestern ? " I had run across that in his rsum the night before . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ara Parseghian 's staff in the late 1950s . <p> Schembechler told me stories about his two years at Northwestern . We talked about how difficult it was to win there . <p> My 10 minutes turned into 20 , then 30 . He was a lot of things Woody Hayes was n't , such as interested in the world outside football . He had the cadence of a great orator and wasted no words . God , the man could talk . <p> Lou Holtz , the former great coach who is now an ESPN analyst , likes to say that " Bo could convince you a banana was really an orange . You 'd wind up saying , ' Yep , it 's an orange . ' " <p> So , just like most Ohioans who met Bo Schembechler , I had to make a concession , that I could n't possibly dislike him , even though he never won a national championship . He was too charismatic , too smart , ran too clean a program at a time when , say , the Southwest Conference was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine enough coach to win 10 games 11 times in his years at Michigan . He told me not to screw up my career , to make my school proud , and sent me on my way . <p> Bo only coached three or four more seasons after that ; fittingly , he beat Ohio State in his final try to get to the Rose Bowl one last time . <p> But that did n't mean his influence at Michigan was waning . ( Even President Bush , from Hanoi , issued a statement of condolence upon hearing of Schembechler 's death . ) <p> Bo , in fact , does have one NCAA championship to his credit . . . well , probably . <p> In 1989 , when the Michigan basketball team was preparing to start the NCAA tournament , Bill Frieder had accepted the head coaching position at Arizona State but planned to coach Michigan in the tournament . Schembechler , then Michigan 's athletic director , testily said : " I do n't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team . A Michigan man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frieder was shown the door , and Schembechler replaced him with Steve Fisher . . . who led the Wolverines to the Final Four , then the NCAA championship . Most athletic directors would have let lame duck Frieder stay , but not Bo . <p> So " The Game " goes on Saturday , as it should . Some folks , even those in Ohio who grieve for Schembechler at the same time as they hope the Buckeyes whip the Wolverines , still do n't believe Bo is really dead . A friend of a friend joked yesterday afternoon that Bo Schembechler , considering what 's at stake today , probably ducked out of that TV studio in suburban Detroit and checked into a hotel in Southfield or someplace , giving his Wolverines the ultimate motivational device . And given the pleasure he got out of beating Ohio State and cheating death , how great a weekend would that make ? Only if it could be true .
