Dark clouds hung low on the rugged Cantabrian mountain peaks , and storm warnings were posted all along the Spanish coast . Out in the Atlantic , aboard his 32-foot trawler Flower of Spring , Fisherman Candido Solana Hoz listened to the radio while he scanned the seas with practiced eye . Of all the captains sailing out of the little Basque village of Santona , Candido was the ablest . For 50 years he had followed the sea , and with his three husky sons Ricardo , Constantino and Manuel for a crew , he seldom failed to bring the Flower back with a fine catch . As the storm whipped the seas around him , however , Candido put aside all thoughts of the catch . " We will make for home , " he told his sons . <P> All went well until they stood a mere mile from Santona 's lighthouse . Then the Flower 's engine sputtered to a stop . The youngest son tinkered with the dead machinery . " Quick , Manuel , or we 'll be caught , " urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . As the other boys tried in vain to rig a sail , the waves were already crashing on the deck . Ashore , where the lighthouse keeper had spread the alarm , Santona 's fishermen tried to launch lifeboats , but the angry seas tossed them back like corks onto the jagged reefs . Behind them black-shawled women gathered on the beach to kneel and pray in the driving rain . <P> The helplessly drifting Flower was only a few hundred yards from the harbor when Candido called to his sons , " Try to swim it , boys . Leave me here . I 'm all right . " But before the boys could reply , he slipped and fell to the deck . Without a word , Ricardo , Constantino and Manuel went to work . They seized fishing nets bordered with cork buoys and tied them securely around their father . A moment later a huge wave broke over them . On shore , the praying watchers-gave a cry , and the village priest made a sign of the Cross . Neither the Flower nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coast-guard cutter , steaming belatedly from Santander , spied a white head bobbing in the water . It was Candido , battered but still alive . <P> " My boys ! " mourned Candido next day as he lay safe at home in his iron bed , surrounded by grandchildren . " My boys ! They should have let me go down . "
