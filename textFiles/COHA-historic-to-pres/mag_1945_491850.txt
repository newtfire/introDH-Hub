POST The Philippines Never Surrendered By E D WARD M. KU E R With PETE MARTIN Long blacked out by military security , here at last is the exclusive story of the guerrilla fighting on the still-unliberated island of Mindanao . . . an epic of incomparably brave men told by one of their leaders . A NOWING how to die well is not the rare thing fiction writers pretend it is . In this war , many men have done it They have done it both when placed against a wall fac-ing a firing squad , with the small black holes in the muzzles of rifles looking at them , and in the stinking chaos of battle . But it is still possible for one man to die better than others . If the Mindanao Moros who told me about it were telling the truth  --  and we certainly believed at the time that they were doing just that  --  Brig . Gen. Guy O. Fort died that way . When we heard that he had gone , some of the steel that had been his backbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle against the Japs in the Philippines after the regular troops surrendered . Fort had been sent down to Mindanao just before New Year 's Day , 1942 , to take over its defense and make a last-ditch stand there . He was a general in the Philippine army with many years ' experience behind him , and he was nearing sixty , but he did n't look his age . He had the unmistakable stamp of the old soldier on him . His face was baked a weathered brick-red by the sun , and he wore an old-style , handle-bar , cavalry mustache . He was set in his ways and , once he said something , it was hard to argue him out of it , but he was liked and respected . He put up a good fight with green and untrained troops . At the beginning of the fighting in Mindanao , at the crossing of the Metaling River , his men had killed 1000 Japs and a Jap general . But some of his small army were equipped only with blade weapons and some with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins fashioned of nails . And the Japs had machine guns and tanks and planes . He put up still another bitter scrap at Baculud Grande before his troops split into the helpless fragments of an army . When further organized fighting seemed hopeless , he evacuated civilians to refuge camps he had previously selected , gathered the shreds of his troops around him and took them out into the thickly forested mountains , from which he planned to wage a harassing , hamstringing warfare . Finally he received orders to surrender from his superior , Major General Sharp  --  who , in turn , had got his instructions from Lieutenant . General Wainwright  --  and he capitulated on May 27 , 1942 . He was kept in a Jap prison camp until the first of November , 1942 , when his captors brought him to Lana ? Province , hoping to use him as an instrument in pacifying the Moms , for by that time the Mores had already begun to give the Japs the throbbing , persistent headache for which they were never able to find a remedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he , the chief representative of the United States in Lanao , had surrendered , they were disobeying the orders of the United States Army in continuing to fight and in not giving up all the weapons they had . Fort resolutely refused to talk to the Mores , and he told his captors that , though it was true he had surrendered , it was not up to him to do anything more . The story of his death came to us in small pieces . like the sections of a patchwork quilt , and we stitched them together into a tragic whole . Those story fragments added up to this : On November 4 , 1942 , the Japs paraded him through the city of Dansalan , giving him a last look at scenes once familiar to him . Among other places , they took him to Camp Keithley , the Philippine Constabulary barracks on the other side of the river . While he was away , laborers dug a hole on the boundary line between what had been toy quarters and those of my former neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor . When the general returned , a Jap officer handed him a cigarette , which he lit and smoked . Then the Jays asked him for the last time . " Will you speak to the people now ? " Once more he refused . Then one of the Jap officers said , " Look the other way . " When Fort turned , he saw the pit the laborers had dug to be his grave . He spun on his heels , saying sharply as he did so , " Not in the back . " Then they shot him , and he toppled into the pit . Despite this account of the general 's death that came to me from trustworthy sources , it is only fair to add that the International Red Cross reported in July , 1943 , that General Fort was still alive and a Jap-held prisoner of war . I hope from the bottom of my heart that the Red Cross report is true  --  their reports usually are correct  --  but I fear that in this case it is n't . At any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened as I have told it , for he was a man to take a stand and stick to it , even in the face of death . During the time between his coming to Lanao and the time when the Japanese overran the province , I had served him as a contact man between the Mohammedan and Christian natives and the military . And the new of his death dealt me a stunning blow . I think , however , that before his death  --  if he is dead  --  he knew of the guerrilla movement even then taking shape . His mind was prophetic enough to guess that when the American troops did land , the guerrilla troops would be so well-knit and so effective that they would help speed MacArthur 's victories by tying up a large number of Japs in the interior . Certainly , knowing the Filipinos as well as he did , he had a clearer idea of what would happen than did the millions of Americans listening to radios and reading the headlines back home . For , even after the guerrillas had hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Philippines ; were blacked out to the outside world by a strict military censorship , and no hint ofthe guerrilla movement emerged from behind that blackout . It is only now that the full story can be told . By the time the news of Fort 's death reached us , we had already made a beginning , and he must have heard about it in his prison camp . Or , if he had n't , the fact that the Jape needed him as a pacifier must have told him what was going on . In the weeks before he surrendered , he had done what he could to plant the seeds of resistance , and he planted well , for , when finally left on an American submarine , bound for Australia to find the medical and surgical care that I hoped would save my life , the movement was in full swing . By that time , there were tens of thousands of men on our guerrilla rosters in all the Philippines , and that number increased rapidly as the Americans drew nearer . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their policy of brutal and murderous subduing of the Philippines to one of virtual pleading with the Filipinos to take the occupation lying down . We had even  --  and , to me , this was a believe-it-or-not to end believe-it-or-nots  --  organized a civil government and had set it up right under the Jap noses . We held courts , collected taxes , repaired roads , printed money , ran a welfare-and-relief fund for the widows and orphans of those killed fighting the enemy , appointed governors , deputy governors and other officials , and did everything but open the schools again . That I refused to do , because the Japs might have bombed those schools and left windrows of youthful dead . The story of how we did those things seems to me one of the most extraordinary stories of the war . For we held on in spite of a gnawing fear that help from outside would never reach us in time , no matter how grimly we sank our teeth into the enemy 's heel and refused to let go . There were many times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like dark water . At first we worked in a vacuum , cut off from the world , hearing only the boasts of the Japs that they were taking Australia , had the Panama Canal and had bombed San Francisco . And while we did n't swallow such stories in two , still , so far as we knew , the enemy had n't been stopped anywhere , and such fantasies might just be true . At times , we felt like puny , helpless little men left isolated in a world inundated by a Jap flood . We knew that the Japs had taken Singapore two and a half months before  --  on February 15 , 1942 ? that Bataan had fallen , that ' General MacArthur had gone to Australia , that the Japs , with a rain of bombs , were teaching the American public that there were such places as Port Darwin and Port Moresby . We knew what had happened to our planes , parked like sitting ducks around Manila , and that the only ones we had in the Pacific were far away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our fleet at Pearl Harbor from a naval officer , after promising not to repeat it , for fear of spreading panic . So , knowing those things , I knew that we must endure for years  --  not weeks or months  --  if we wanted to survive . Slowly , painfully , with countless setbacks and discouragements , we began to dig in to await the day of deliverance ; only , sometimes , in the wakeful hours of the night or tramping along with my chin sunk against my chest bone in fatigue , I doubted if that day would come while we were still alive  --  any of us . But , while we were working and slaving , it never occurred to us that there was anything extraordinary about it or that we could have done anything else . Even while we were planning ambushes of Jap motor convoys and sieges of Jap strongholds , I knew one thing , and that was that , though the advantages of being part of a democracy sometimes seem nebulous , the Philippines was one place where those principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than half a century , paid dividends . They paid dividends even with people like the Moros , who lop off heads at the drop of fancied insult and , though fantastically brave , still have many among them who readily turn outlaw . So , when the Japs took over , the Filipinos were willing to fight and die for the things they had lost . My work with the guerrillas was divided into three parts . At first , I hid out with them while a succession of dates  --  Moro headmen  --  offered me sanctuary . I kept shifting from place to place , seeking a data and his followers who were not overawed by Jap might . After I had found such a man , my job was to offer advice as to how the Japs could best be met and killed with the minimum loss of life to the Filipinos themselves . The third and last part of my work came after 1 left hiding and went to join those who had headed the organized guerrilla troops . It was then that I was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running it . For me , all these things centered on the island of Mindanao . It was there that I saw the fight being waged , and lived and talked with the people doing the fighting . Guerrilla units were operating in all the islands , but the greater part of my story will deal only with what happened in Mindanao  --  or , to subdivide it still further , in the province of Lanao on Mindanao ? because that is what I know most about . One of the difficulties of telling my story or any story of a people Living in a country unfamiliar to those who read it is an inevitable confusion about the geography in which the action takes place . The Philippines look like a broken clay pigeon scattered on the sea . To the north is a jagged fragment of land called Luzon , about the size of Pennsylvania . There is a central part of seven or eight islands called the Visayas  --  Leyte and Samar are two of them  --  like so many Rhode Islands and Delawares and Connecticut &; At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants ? it had that many before the war  --  and some 36,000 square miles in area . It is as large as Indiana . In shape , Mindanao resembles a fat turkey gobbler facing west and feeding . Just above the gobbler 's neck , between his head and his back , is Iligan Bay , with the DRAWING BY ROBERT RIGGS town of Iligan on one side of it and the town of Misamis , where the guerrillas finally set up their headquarters , on the other . About where the gobbler 's gizzard would be lies Lake Lanao , with the city of Dansalan at its northern end . It was around this lake that most of the fighting took place . On the shores around Lake Lanao 's **25;2219;TOOLONG surface live 100,000 Morrie , and another 100,000 are not too far away in the still higher hills  --  mountains  --  around it . When the guerrilla army took shape , it did so in Lanao under the leadership of two men , Wendell W. Fertig and Charles W. Hedges . Together with various loyal Filipino leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , its brains and its internalcombustion engine . Fertig is about six feet tall , middle-aged , has twinkling blue eyes and a neatly trimmed , small , squarish beard . He is humorous and kindly in conversation , and patient , polite and courteous in his dealing with the Filipinos . This last is a very desirable and necessary trait . He was Pennsylvania Dutch out of Colorado by way of Mineral County , West Virginia , and he had been a mining engineer in various parts of the Philippines before joining the Army of the United States shortly before the war . As a lieutenant colonel in charge of engineers , he had been supervising the construction of Army airfields along the highway on the northern coast of Mindanao when hostilities began . He was caught between the Jap landing on that coast and the Japs who fought their way up from the south . Abandoning his auto , he - made his way back into the mountainous country of Bukidnon , northeast of Lanao . There he met Hedges , who in peacetime had been head logger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abundant Lanao forests . Both Fertig and Hedges are married , but , when the Japs came down on the Philippines , their families were back home in the United States . Hedges was a man of great mechanical and managerial ability . He knew how to handle Filipino mechanics and how to get work out of them . His activities for the lumber company had given him a detailed knowledge of the terrain and , before the Japs invaded Lanao , General Fort had given him a temporary commission as captain and had placed him in charge of a military motor pool . ( Conantiod on Page 57 ) THE PHILIPPINES NEVER SURRENDERED ( Continued from Page if ) Later , Fertig made him a lieutenant colonel . He had been told to destroy the motor pool as the Japs advanced . After which  --  because General Fort did n't know that our forces in the neighboring province of Bukidnon had already been beaten  --  he had been told to go to Bukidnon to do the same kind of work there . Which was why he had also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fertig , Hedges has dark hair , and gray eyes beneath straight black brows . Between them is a super-Roman nose . He is scrawny as a gnawed sparerib , and is tough in mind and body . His subordinates looked about them first to make sure he was n't around , and then spoke of him half admiringly and wholly respectfully as " Colonel Goddam . " He could and did lead combat patrols personally , and for a long time he kept his division H.Q. within two miles of the nearest Jap outpost to hearten his men . Fertig and Hedges stuck together . Because of a lack of proper food , they both fell sick , but they were able to rest and get hold of a little medicine . After Fort surrendered , they made their way slowly into the southwestern corner of Lanao to the Kapatagan Valley , where they began to lay the groundwork for pulling the various warring guerrilla groups into one well-organized whole . Then , when they had begun to have a grip on things , they sent for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to their headquarters and did all that I could do to help . But , before I went in with them , enough happened to me to fill an average man 's life to bursting . After the fight at Baculud Grande , there was nothing to stop the Japs . In spite of the fact that I knew nothing about such a weapon , I had offered to man a machine gun in the fighting that took place there . But I had been busy working for General Fort , evacuating civilians when the fighting broke out , and was unable to be on hand . When I found that the Japs were on their way to Dansalan , the capital of Lanao Province , I had a talk with the native employees in my office . They asked me what they ought to do when the Japs came . " You are civilians , " I told them . " You are not supposed to fight . If you fight and are captured , you wo n't be treated as prisoners of war ; you 'll be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to surrender ? " I knew why they were curious about my plans . During the weeks that had gone before , I had n't joined in the chorus that voiced its belief in the quick coming of aid , and I had been looked upon as a pessimist . I knew what had happened to our planes at Manila , and I had been told about what had happened to our fleet at Pearl Harbor . So , in bull sessions , when some of the American officers said , " We are going to get help ; I know it . If we do n't get it , we 'll have to surrender . They ca n't let us do that , " I had remained noncommittal . I did n't say help was n't coming . I simply said nothing at all . Now , when I answered my office force , I said , " No , I am not going to surrender . " " Why not ? " they asked . " We have heard other American civilians say it is useless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surrendering , for this reason : If I 'm going to be mistreated , I 'd father be hurt by hardships than by the Japs . If I 'm going to die in misery , I would rather die in misery free than inside a prison camp . " They looked at one another and said , " We will see , sir . " Then they left . As it turned out , only one of them followed my advice . The others followed may example . Preceded by airplanes that bombed the town , the Jape came into Dansalan on May second . I left an hour before that bombing . My car was the last civilian car to leave the town . When I reached the head of Lake Lanao , I stopped and turned off the road to warn a friend  --  a Moro data called the Sultan sa Ramain He followed me back to the road and asked , " Where are you going ? " I told him I thought I was duty bound to take one last look at Dansalan , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoke pouring from it . The sultan , his sons and some of my houseboys who had come with me surrounded me and said firmly , " No , sir . It is too dangerous . " They made no effort to put their hands on me or to hold me , but barred my path silently . I made a move toward my car , but one of my boys , who stood nearest me , stepped squarely between me and the car , and looked at me almost pleadingly . So I stayed with the sultan . He protected me during those first hazardous weeks , and without that protection I do n't believe I could have survived . I spent that night and the next one in a house separated from the highway by wide , muddy rice fields . By that time the Japs had patrols farmed out along the road in our direction , and we moved up a stream about a kilometer . The next day we went still farther . We tramped along in the bed of the stream itself . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift and wide . Sometimes we crept along its bank or climbed spurs jutting out into the boiling water . I was carrying only a leather portfolio full of spare ammunition  --  someone else carried my pack and bed roll  --  but when the Moros saw me beginning to stumble , they laughed among themselves and carried it for me . They tried not to let me see them laughing , for , although the Moro shies brash and violent things , he sets great store by courtesy . Once I had walked a long distance with a daft ) , pacing off an improvised airfield to take the place of the one the Japs had bombed at Dansalan , and I had picked up a stone in my shoe that bruised my foot . To make me feel less self-conscious about my softness , the dote gravely took off his own shoe and bandaged his own horny foot . While I was in my upstream hiding place , one of my host 's sons reported that General Fort , most of the American officers , a number of American soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Filipino soldiers were established in Fort 's forest headquarters , and that Fort knew of my whereabouts . I made up my mind that , when things quieted down , I would join him . One of the sultan 's followers invited us to move to another place , where he had built a house especially to shelter us , and we accepted . It was then May , and the Japs were completely in control of things . And the news of the fall of Corregidor on May sixth had worked its way to us . Their next move was to try to disarm the Moms . Solemnly and with straight faces , each Moro , in turn , claimed he was a good Moro and had no firearms . To prove their virtue , they surrendered a few homemade shotguns and defective rifles , from which General Fort 's soldiers had removed the bolts or parts of the mechanism before throwing them away , when they retreated before the Jap onslaught . The Japs also announced that all blade weapons must be turned in , and that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; those they were willing to let the Moros keep to do such chores as splitting firewood . The Mores assured the Japs that they had no such weapons . Only the bad people had them , they said . Once more , to lull the Jape into a feeling of security , they gave up a few rusty , worthless old dull blades , In the wake of our flight , the Japs had found a quantity of our .30-caliber ammunition . The Jap rifle was a .256-caliber , so they reloaded the .30-caliber cartridges with dynamite and filtered them into the black market , knowing they would be sold to those natives who were still hanging on to their guns . Moro guns exploded and injured people all over the place . But , instead of frightening the Moros , the trick enraged them . To them , it was worse than a dirty one . It meant they had to go out and buy new guns on a skyrocketing market . And a man who had sold his work animals to get a gun , thinking that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace those he had sold , did n't relish being stripped of his financial resources in that way . It was while I was in my specially built hiding place that Captain Lane came to see me . Lane was an ex-AmericanNorwegian missionary who had been useful in persuading the Chinese merchants to dig up their hidden stocks of goods when supplies of all kinds ran low just before the Jap invasion . He asked me what I planned to do , and I told him I thought I would go down and see General Fort . " I would n't , " Lane said . " He is glad to have you here with this sultan . The general is planning to use this area as a base for guerrilla operations . He wants you to stay with these people and hold them in line to help get us food and guns and ammunition and supplies of all kinds . " When I explained Fort'a idea to the sultan , he was pleased . " That , " he said , " is more like it . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guns they could lay hands on . Not long afterward , one of the sultan'a sons  --  a boy named Madki , who had been a law student in Manila  --  came home for a visit . Madki had acted as if he were throwing in with the Japs , and had gained their confidence to such an extent that they had taken him around with them to use him as a propagandist . They had even given him permission to come home , thinking he might bring his father over to their side . He brought with him careful notations as to the size of the Jap forces , the location of their ammunition dumps , their barracks and where their tanks were parked at night . I sent his notes to General Fort . He was still there with us when Fort was ordered to surrender  --  although he left to rejoin the Japs later  --  and he asked me if I was going to surrender too . I did n't know just what my status would be if Fort sent me instructions to give myself up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Let me advise you , air . Do n't surrender , Never stu -- render . " When I asked him , " Why not ? " he said , " You ca n't trust . the Japanese . I have been with them , and I know . They are the most brutal , cruel , insincere people I have ever seen . I never imagined there could be such people . " He went on to tell me about their love for slapping and about their looting and the horrible things they had done to their military prisoners and civilians . They had burned them alive in their homes , had given them the water treatment by pouring water into their mouths and noses , and had placed cartridges between their fingers and squeezed their hands , which resulted in exquisite torture . As it turned out , Fort did advise the American civilians to surrender , but did not advise me to . On the contrary , he Bent me his radio to keep for him , and in an accompanying letter he asked me to hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I trust , will not be long in coming . " Poor fellow  --  he had no idea how tong that would be . When my Moro friends found out he had surrendered , together with all those who remained with him  --  about 10 per cent of his original force  --  they were bewildered and asked me , " What is this thing  --  surrender ? " To them , a fight was something that went on until one or the other of two opponents was killed , and they thought of mass fighting in the same terms . When I tried to explain , they asked scornfully , " What kind of fighting is that ? " And they wanted to know , " Now that the general has surrendered , what shall we do with all the guns we have gathered to turn in to him ? " Feeling sure that , if they held on to those guns , sooner or later they would use them on the Jape , I said , " Keep them . " They nodded their heads and said " Mapiapia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and if they mean " very good , " they dress it up by stretching it out to " mapiapia . " With me in my hideaway I had some of my Sulu high-school boys who had followed me to Mindanao a few months before , when I was transferred there . I found that in packing some of my belongings , one of them had put some copies of The Saturday Evening Post in my bag . There were advertisements in those magazines showing American military weapons being manufactured , and the Moros who came to see me sat and gazed at those guns by the hour , clicking their tongues and whistling , the way a G.I. back home whistles when a sleek and bosomy girl passes him on the street . Still another high-school boy showed up , grinning , to join us , with a story that gave us a deep and soul-satisfying laugh . With a number of other Moro boys , he had been standing near a Jap camp where a Jap sentry was posted . The sentry was flourishing his bayonet and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever tangled with them , while an interpreter explained his boasting . The boy began to compliment the sentry on his skill and tell him what a big bayonet it was and how beautiful it looked flashing in the sun . Then he said , " We appreciate the friendship the Japanese have shown us in driving out the Americans . But we Moros know a little about weapons , too , and if you will trust me , I would like to show you how we would use such things against the Americans . " The sentry gave him his gun , and the boy did fancy footwork with it , lunging at imaginary Americans . But with every lunge he made , the invisible Amer ican was farther away from the sentry . Finally , the boy began to chase " the American " down the road and , before the sentry got wise , he had disappeared , and came to join us , bringing the gun with him . I did n't spend all my time in my bamboo-shaded hiding place , listening to such tales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plane-tank-gun defeat of our ill-armed , poorly trained forces lay heavy on the minds of many of the people . They had seen whole villages burned as punishment for a sniper 's shot . They had seen American soldiers in barbed-wire stockades and American civilians in the guardhouses where criminals had once been confined . Among the things that contributed to their feeling of dread were incidents like the one that happened during the fighting on the night of May 1 , 1942 . Hidden by darkness , Captain Pastrana , a Philippine Constabulary commander , had drawn up a detachment of his men in a roadside grove . They had become separated from the other Filipinos and were waiting to get in touch with their comrades . During the night , they heard soldiers marching , and , thinking them part of the constabulary , fell in behind them . Unfortunately for Pastrana , they turned out to be Japs , and they discovered his identity before he recognized them . Some of the Filipinos were killed , and those who remained were captured . In the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large caldrons . Two of the Filipinos , a sergeant and a corporal , were led to a caldron near a house . There , tied to a post , was Captain Pastrana . His legs were free  --  although he had been wounded in one thigh  --  but his hands were tied and a rope held him to the post . When the corporal failed to manage his cooking fire to the satisfaction of the Jape , one of them snatched up the smoking-hot ladle from the caldron and smashed him savagely in the face with it . It left a livid burn that shot agony through him as if someone had flung molten lava at his cheek . Striking him again and again with the ladle to speed him up , his tormentor drove him to gather more fuel . Then , after they had eaten , the Japs took the sergeant and corporal to a clump of banana trees and bayoneted them . The sergeant died quickly , but the corporal 's wounds were n't immediately mortal and , dizzy with pain ? and loss of blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fainted , but the last thing he saw before the darkness of unconsciousness closed down over him was Captain Pastrana still tied to his post . Tears of helpless rage streamed down the captain 's face . He strained at his lashing and , despite his wounded leg , kicked out furiously at the near-by Jape , shouting , " Kill me now , you awine ! " Later that day , a More dato and some Moro teachers who lad been fighting and were still near by saw a low-flying Jap airplane near them . He and his men ducked into the shade of a banana clump under which the wounded corporal and dead sergeant were still lying , and cut loose at the plane . They had the satisfaction of seeing it zip sharply upward . Theq it buzzed angrily up and down the road . The date was leading the plane with his rifle , like a duck hunter , when a voice from one of the two apparently dead men reached him faintly . " No ' more shooting . . ? I will be finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dato and his men carried the cor-poral to a safe place , made a pack of ( Continued on Penn . 60 ) ( Con f in is nil from Page 58 ) banana leaves and placed it over his worst wound to keep his intestines from coming out , and the wounded man lingered a day longer before he died . Other Filipinos , hearing similar stories , naturally felt that their fate as captives might be the same or worse . My Huller ' host received a sharp warning that , if he did n't submit to the Japs , ' 1000 Japanese troops would be sent after him , so he called a family council to consider his position . I was invited to attend that meeting . His children , grown and growing , and his huge , deep-voiced , hottempered brother urged him to fight , while his wife and her wealthy relatives pointed out the folly of continued resistance . In the end , those who advocated submission prevailed . The huge brother , whose hatred of the Japs had rumbled in my ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draped it over his head in shame to hide his face . The sultan followed me into my room and sat facing me . His jaw shook and tears stood in his eyes , but he told me that he would still protect me and that he would have other secret camps built for me deeper in the forest . I thanked him , but refused , I knew he was basing his offer on the hope of an early American return to the islands . Extravagant rumors had flown daily to our forest camp . American troops had landed at Davao . American warships had shelled Parang . They had one thing in common . None of them were true . I made up my mind to keep moving until I could find Moro friends who had decided definitely that they would fight the Japanese . The next day I sent a Sulu boy across Lake Lanao to Bayang , where Pangandaman , one of my trusted employees of many years , lived . " Tell him , " I said . " to get a house ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to round up his people and come to get me . " Three days later , when Pangandaman and his men arrived , my eyes bugged out . Every man had a Springfield or an Enfield , one man had a machine rifle , another a Browning automatic rifle , and well-filled ammunition belts were slung over their shoulders . With Pangandaman was his father , the Dato Aguam , who had been the mayor of a large Mindanao town . Eying his scraggy gray whiskers and hearing his gentle voice , I could n't tell that in a few more months he would have his own band , made up of similar graybeards and hard-bitten farmers and callow high-school boys . Before long , that band would catch a part of the Jap garrison that had taken over his town out on a highway patrol , and would give it such a trouncing that the Japs would never dare use that road again . Some of my new friends were turbaned , some in head cloths . They wore khaki clothing or denim trousers and vivid shirts with =tangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket . , Their faces ranged from light tan to coffee brown . But all of them had the direct , hard Moro gaze that bores into you like a sharpened metal rod . My blankets , my spare clothing , a few books and one precious bottle of Bacardi went into my barracks bag , which was hoisted on a friendly shoulder . Another back carried my kit , my spare ammunition , my 20-gauge ammo belts and my five-load automatic shotgun . Then I said good-by to the sultan . It was dark . There was a new moon , but the air was misty and the moonlight was diffused . When we came down out of the forest into a valley filled with rice paddies , the walking was harder than any march I could ever remember . The only paths were along the tops of the dikes , which were narrow , muddy and slippery . All of a sudden I would hit a soft spot . skid off and go down , up to my knees in mud . The Moros knew where to step to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like a frog in a well , climbing up three hops and falling down two . It wks very tiring and exhausting and , as we drew near houses , where silence was important , the Moros with me kept turning around and looking at me every time I fell and made a splash or muttered under my breath . They were afraid that those who lived in the houses might shoot first and ask questions afterward , for the sight of a large group of armed strangers passing near his home at night makes a Moro 's trigger finger itch uncontrollably . At last we came to a spot where the ground was firm and bore a grove of trees and several houses . We should have skirted those habitations , but , because I was so tired , Pangandaman decided to take our party straight across the area . We were almost across it when we ran into dog trouble . Suddenly a dog ran out at us , barking . It was then that two of the Moros in our party did a thing I had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere elsge . Deliberately , they excited the dog to make it rush at them and , when he seemed on the point of springing , they squatted on the ground with their arms folded . The first time I had seen it done by the Moro children , I expected to see them slashed open . But that dog did just what the dog did on this occasion . He stopped , thrust his feet out , braced himself , dropped his tail , whimpered and beat a retreat . I have no explanation for it . Perhaps the secret of the thing lies in its unexpectedness . The dog comes out all set for a spring , but before he can launch himself into it he sees the object of his wrath squatting down , looking at him coolly , and it disconcerts him . After about three hours of travel , we reached the Lake Lanao shore . Pangandaman had borrowed a Dieselpowered Moro launch from his wife 's relatives , and it was there , ready and waiting for us . These launches have a large dugout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and so narrow that they would capsize , were it not for the large , stout outriggers attached to them . By the time we got aboard and headed south , it was darker and more cloudy and misty than before and beginning to rain . I was glad to see that bad weather , because the Japs had established patrol boats on the lake , and in order to get to Bayang we had to pass Dansalan . We passed it about five miles out ; and although that was a fairly good distance , one of those patrols might have been spying around , and it was still too close to feel comfortable . Sometime before morning , we reached Bayang and started out from the beach to the house that had been made ready for me . The hide-out they had selected had successfully sheltered outlaws for two years , despite the grim probing of the constabulary patrols . The trail began to climb , flanked by hedges and clumps of bamboo and fruit trees and plants used to mark boundary lines . We went down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we could see only the night sky overhead . After n while , we started up art old , dry stream bed , where I fell and gave my knee a bad twist . We went on and on until , after what seemed hundreds of years , we came out on a sloping plateau , in the middle of which was a tiny lawig . A lawig is a place in which a watcher stays when the crops are ripening . He strings lines from it across the field and shakes them to frighten the birds away from the ripening grain . ' n He can also see if any of his neighbors come around by moonlight to do a little sly harvesting at his expense . The floor of the but was covered with rice straw . I spread my mat over that , stripped off my muddy clothes and slept . To me , that straw was as soft as eider down . I stayed in that but for about a week while Pangandaman worked on another house for me farther up the mountainside in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been scooped out by a bulldozer . At the mouth of the valley , there was a fringe of heavy vegetation . I t was impossible to see through this lush growth , and the tops of bamboo clumps curled over the little glen so it could n't be seen from above . It was there that they had built the house in which I was to live . It was a perfect hiding place . I had Pangandaman bring up the books and papers I had sent to him for safekeeping after the first bombing of Dansalan , and I put in time getting them sorted out . I discarded what I did n't want and packed the rest neatly and stowed them in Moro bags made of handwoven hemp fiber . Pangandriman 's wife , Maruki , sewed the bags shut for me and we put them into a galvanized-iron water tank and buried them under the house . A few days after I had moved into my valley hiding place , the sons of the sultan who had first befriended me , ' and with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me for safekeeping . found a good battery somewhere  --  possibly from an abandoned automobile or a truck  --  and one of my Filipino teachers , who had been my farm mechanic at the agricultural school , hooked up the radio and the battery . Over it , they got the news of the Battle of Midway , which had taken place from June third to sixth  --  lacking one day , it was exactly six months after Pearl Harbor . That battle had been going on while I was making my way toward Bayang , walking through those slippery rice paddies ; only , of course , I had n't known about it then . It was our first big victory , and it meant more to me than I can ever put into words . When I heard about those four Jap aircraft carriers blazing , I thought , with a great joyous lift of the heart , We are an our way . It was so wonderful to hear that , almost fiercely , I tried to beat down my elation . I told myself that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands of miles of sea and land and atoll and island and mainland that the Japs had taken . I knew that they still threatened Australia and Burma and , through Burma , India . I knew what a task  --  perhaps an even impossible one  --  it would be to send General MacArthur men and supplies over the longest sea haul in the world from the United States to the Antipodes , so he could start out on the stubborn , bloody road back to us . Over another near-by radio I got word that the Japs had seized Attu and Kiska on . June twenty-fourth , and I brooded over the possibility that they would use those places as bases from , which to launch bombing attacks on our ' , Vest Coast or even attempt an invasion of Washington and Oregon . But , closer at hand , things were beginning to happen that had a bearing on the question that was always before us . Would we be hunted down and tortured or starved behind barbed wire ? Would the Filipinos turn defeatist and , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What 's the use ? Let us give in and make the best of it , and , if need be . let us turn over to the Japs all those who would rouse their anger at us . " The answer to that question lay in the hands of such people as Is/lanais ? . Nlanalao was the first person in the province of Lanao to attack the . Japs after our forces had been defeated . His father had made a hopeless and suicidal rush against a Jap tank in the early diys of the invasion , Seeing a head protruding from the top of the turret , he had charged , waving his sword like a bigleague pitcher winding up . But the other Jap member of that tank team had blown his head off . When he heard about his father 's death , Manalao registered a vow that he would fight the Japs and would kill as many as he could before he himself was killed . He was a smart and effective fighter . He did n't rush blindly at the Japs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . All the Moros eventually got hold of guns , for that matter , and it was then that they justified the remark one of Fort 's colonels had.made as he watched a More battalion drilling , armed only with bolos . " It is better to give the Moros guns , " the colonel said . " than to send them out to fight with blades . " General Fort had been reluctant to give them rifles , because his long experience with them had taught him that giving a gun to a Moro was like giving a blowtorch to a pyromaniac . Once they had rifles , however , they became the worst problem the Japs ran into anywhere in the Philippines , and Lanao was the province that gave the Japs their major attack of indigestion . It was there that they first gave up force and resorted to persuasion and propaganda . ( Cu , , ( in.rel Puy. , t , 3 ) ( Continued front Page 61 ) Manalao ranged far and wide over the province . He caught two Japanese Lanka at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japs had brought up from Singapore  --  and gutted the tanks with burning gasoline , killing the crews . He took another oath that he would not cut his beard until the Japs were defeated . And he let it grow until it gave him an astonishing appearance and made him look like a Moro General Grant . He was a man of violent temper and was extremely " hot-eyed . " " Hot-eyed " is a Moro term describing the way the eyes are set deeply and close together in the head , with a certain slant of-the eyebrows . After he burned those Jap tanks , he traveled over the province gathering more arms , stirring up the people , incitling them and persuading more and more of them to join him , until the Japs were finally forced to do something about him . Early in July of 1942 , barely two months after they arrived in Lanao , they sent out a strong patrol from Dansalan to currycomb the little town of Uyaan , where they had heard he was . Some of the Filipino quislings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go west about twelve kilometers , and you 'll find the schoolhouse at Uyaan near the little Uyaan Lake , with the American flag flying over it . " Jap eyes slitted then . " We know what to do with American flags and we 'll do it , and in the enforced presence of the public , " they said . The quislings began to regret their tattling . Stories of Manalao 's hot temper ran through their minds and they began to think about what he might do to them if he found that they had betrayed him . Finally , they sent him a carefully doctored warning . But he was n't to be found . A report of a cache of firearms far to the southeast of Lake Lanao had drawn him away . At last the worried messengers managed to catch up with Manalao 's rear guard , commanded by his brother-in-law , Abubakar . Abubakar was six feet tall , and big for a Moro . He was very light in color and could have passed for a Chinese mandarin . With only sixteen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered fifteen more followers . In the meantime , on the way to Uyaan , the Japs had attacked the village of Gadungan . A scant half dozen riflemen tried to defend it , but they had to fall back . Then , leaving a patrol in Gadungan , the Japs turned west toward Uyaan . From my hide-out WE LIKE THE YANKS , BUT - ( Continued from Page 36 ) Let me illustrate with a very homely item . No article of equipment is used by the soldier more frequently than his mesa kit . The American issue is made of light alloy , carefully shaped and slotted so that it can all be easily immersed in boiling water for cleaning in a single dip . The Australian equivalent is heavier , less durable and can only be washed as separate articles . With an impatient line waiting behind , this is a distinct disadvantage . The several implements could probably be handled nicely by an octopus with asbestos-tipped tentacles , but for a mere two-handed , jostled soldier it is not so easy . When one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murky depths of a cleaning can , it is inevitable that comparisons be made ? and , if possible , some American utensils procured . One forgets , of course , that an industrially small nation may not have plentiful supplies of the lighter metal or that a switch-over to a new dosign , however desirable , might be impracticable . 63 across the lake , I could see smoke billowing up from burning houses , and I wondered what kind of hell 's broth was cooking up . In my mind 's eye , I could see flames crackling around the desks and blackboards and books for which we had worked so hard . Manalao had got the news by that time , and sent a runner to tell Abubakar the best place in which to fight . Abubakar placed himself in a wooded stream bed , and a volley crashed out of a little grove into the Jap column . The Jap center went down . The van closed on the rear . The rear thought the van was runMng , and got out of its way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japs wavered . Abu bakar 's Browning automatic rifle thuttered along the Jap column . The Japs had enough . They abandoned their dead and their muleborne mortars . Then the sound of firing came from Gadungan . The Gadungan men had received help from near-by Moro villages . and the Japs were pinned between two fires . The way back to the lake was downhill , and the Japs went faster and faster . It was n't a complete rout , for the Moros ran low on ammunition . Manalao was on his way over a heartbreakingly steep short cut to Uyaan when he heard the noise of the clash between Abubakar , the Gadungians and the Japs . When the sound swung away from him , he realized that he had missed the fun . In a little while , he heard the sound of trucks approaching , carrying what remained of the Jap expedition . With yells of joy , Manalao and his men opened up . They saw men fall in the trucks . One of the big motor vans stalled . The men in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to Dansalan . The Moros counted fifteen Jap dead at the grove where Abubakar had made his attack . After that , Manalao sent many letters to the Japs to come to Uyaan and see the American flag . But they never came during all the time I was in Lanaoalthough several times they bombed the schoolhouse over which it waved . The teacher guarding the flat would leave it to pop into his foxhole . Then , when the raid was over , he would come out and sing an impromptu ballad about the mysterious power of the piece of bunting the Japs could neither take by force nor destroy from the air . Editor 's Note  --  Thin it the fiat of five articles by Mr. Kuder and Mr. Martin . The second will appear neat week . American entertainment material is much more evident . " Why the hell ca n't our people do that ? " demands the exasperated Australian . Again arithmetic provides the answer . America builds so many more ships than the few Australian yards that shipping space can not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many other factors contrib. uting to the general good opinion held by Australians of Americans . But I shall not enlarge upon them here . Let them be deduced from the undeniable fact that history has no example of two military forces of different nations fighting together side by side , sharing death and glory , with so little friction or such a high degree of mutual understanding . This excellent partnership has been achieved in circumstances most difficult for Australia . For it is not a happy experience for a proud race suddenly to find itself largely dependent on another nation for survival . The fact that the other nation was also serving its own vital interests in preserving Australia did not greatly alter the position , How would the average independent businessman feel if his company suddenly faced extinction , and was saved only by a Cott tinu eil on Page 65 )
