CompulsionNo . Alone . At least , go on a way toward doing it alone . Judd pictures himself driving to her house to pick her up . Take the pistol along , as Artie would ? The lunch date is known ; her mother would know . If he did only the rape , without the killing , a girl would n't tell . The soldiers dragging the girls  --  the killing was n't always part of it . But an absolute part of it is the girl being a virgin . He has to find out for sure at lunch . After all , she goes out with this newspaper fellow ; you can never know. *The maid knocked . In an odd voice , constricted , the maid said there were two police officersdownstairs who wished to speak with him . Judd told himself he was delighted to observe there was no panic in him , none whatsoever . Undoubtedly they had traced the glasses . Now everything depended on his savoir-faire . Should he phone Artie , warn him ? No , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they applied torture , have the strength to avoid naming Artie ? As he dressed , without undue haste , Judd could not help noticing a subtle fleeting sense of pleasure that they had come . He had slept late ; the old man had gone downtown , and Max was out golfing . Lucky they were out . No , suppose it became serious ? The maid could tell them . Judd descended the stairs . Two policemen stood there . On their faces there was nothing to go by ; or did he detect a shade of deference for the neighborhood , the house ? The nearer one said Captain Cleary would like to ask him some questions . At the South Chicago station . The easy way they talked , it could n't be that they had anything serious . " South Chicago ? " Judd repeated as though completely mystified . " Why ? " The cops exchanged glances , and now the second one said , respectfully , " He just told us to bring you in for some questions . " Should he act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But obliging . " Is it for speeding or something ? " He smiled . They smiled back but did n't answer . Judd shrugged , and acted indulgent though a trifle worried as anyone should be when called for by the police . If only Artie had been watching ! The Crime of Our Century 141Feeling the two of them bulking huge behind him , Judd led the way to the door . Would there be a police wagon ? No , a Marmon . Should he ask if he were under arrest ? That might show too much anxiety . One policeman got into the back seat with him . Judd glanced hurriedlyaround . The street was inordinately quiet ; kids were still being kept indoors . Nobody had seen , he guessed . There was sunlight on the trees . Everything appeared curiously motionless , at rest . Judd offered his Helmars . The cop 's fingers seemed almost too thick to grasp a cigarette . With a comforting snort he remarked , " It 's just something routine . " But why the South Chicago station ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being handled by the chiefs downtown . If the glasses had been identified , surely they would be taking him downtown and not to an outlying police station . Then Judd recalled , on our date the night before , my talking about interviewing the captain out there . About nature students . That was certainlyit . Somehow they had got his name . Because of that punk reporter . That smart-aleck reporter , Sid Silver , had to go nosing around . Rape his girl for him , would serve him right . And Judd imagined himselftelling the whole thing to Artie , afterward , and Artie 's laughter . But something could go wrong . And if they kept him under arrest , there would be no rape ; in fact , Ruth would even be stood up on her lunch date . The cops were talking about the chances of the Cubs in the coming season . It would have been useful for him now , Judd reflected , if he could discuss batting averages . Finally the car halted in front of the twostorybrick station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been taken as a kid when some cops picked him up in Jackson Park with his .22 , shooting birds . The old man had straightened that out quickly enough . Dragging a well-brought-up boy of good family into a police station ! Indeed , Pater practically had the police apologizing , afraid of what he could do to them with his influence . " Why , this boy is already a recognized ornithologist ! " And the old man had got him the only permitin the entire city , to use his gun in the parks . " You see ? " His father had wanted him to be impressed . Judah Steiner , Sr. , could handle anything , get anything he wanted in Chicago . Well , let the old man get him142 Compulsionout of this one ! Out ? If they really had him in . And there arose in Judd that curious mixture of resentment and expectancy that came when he thought of his father . This whole thing was like a final challenge between them . He walked with the cops into the vacant-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare floor and the stale smell . He still could not be sure but that this represented the remainder of his life . A cop in shirt sleeves stood by a window , gazing out on a vacant lot , his gun important-looking in the hip holster . Turning , he said , " The captain wants you , inside , " motioning to a partition , with a door . Judd reached over the railing to undo the catch on the gate , and walked across to the private office . The captain was writing at his desk . Giving Judd a glance , he motioned to a chair . He was middle-aged , fat , even easy-looking . " Judah Steiner , eh ? Well , I 'll tell you , you been around out in Hegewisch quite a lot , the game warden tells me . " " Yes , sir . " It would be nothing at all , he already felt sure . He felt calm and safe , and glanced at his wrist watch ; he could get back in time for the date with Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had conductedthe last group out there only a week ago . With respectful curiosity , the captain inquired just what they were studying about birds , and Judd spoke of the mating habits of several species at this season . The captain became interested . Oh , and who was in the class ? Judd would be glad to supply a full list . In this particular group there were several young married women . The captain chuckled . The mating season , eh ? Then , returning to business : " Ever been out there around the Pennsy tracks , there by that culvert ? " " You mean where the Kessler boy was found ? " Judd said easily . " I know the precise spot quite well , as it happens . " " How does that happen ? " " Only the last time I was out there , I recall climbing over the tracks , because I slipped , coming down , and got my feet wet . It 's quite swampy there . " Thus , Judd felt , he had paved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case they had already been traced to him . They might have fallen out of his pocket when he slipped . The Crime of Our Century 143 " You ever know of this Kessler kid going out there ? " " He certainly was n't in any of my groups , but he might have gone out with a school group . It 's used quite a lot , as you know . It 's the nearest place to the city where you find so much wild life . " The captain had picked up a file card of some kind , and he tapped it against his desk . He swiveled and faced Judd . " You use glasses ? " Perhaps this was the moment to say it . To say , " As a matter of fact , those glasses found out there were mine . I must have lost them last week , but I did n't notice it until I read about the case in the papers , and then  --  I guess it 's quite natural  --  I was rather frightened of becoming involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean field glasses ? For observingthe birds ? " " No , I mean regular eyeglasses . " " Why , yes , I do  --  or did . For reading , at home . I had them prescribed for headaches last year , but the headaches stopped , and I have n't used my reading glasses for several months . " The captain nodded . " Any of those people with you , or anybody you know goes out there , wear eyeglasses ? " Judd gave himself time for reflection . " Well , as a matter of fact , a few of the women wear glasses , and I have an assistant , occasionally  --  Jerry Harris is his name . He wears glasses . He 's quite nearsighted . He was with us last week . But I 'm sure he would have mentioned it to me , if he had lost his glasses . " The captain took down the name and address , writing slowly , in a schoolboy hand . He did n't ask for the phone number , and it occurred to Judd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain just sat there as though trying to think of more questions . Judd did n't want to appear anxious to leave . He was indeed beginning to enjoy the situation , beginning to form an account of it in his mind , for Artie . Still , the silence became somewhat tense , and he allowed himself to glance at his watch . " As a matter of fact , " he remarked , " I have a date to take a girl birding this afternoon , but I guess we wo n't be going to Hegewisch . " The captain 's flesh wobbled with his chortle . " That 's a new name for it . Birding ! " Judd took a full breath. 144 Compulsion " Okay , " the captain said , pushing a sheet of paper toward him . " Tell you what , son . You write me out a little statement , all you just said , the facts you just stated , for the record . " As he opened his fountain pen , Judd felt in himself , perhaps a little more faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had experiencedwhen he had first read in the papers of the glasses being found . For he had after all come under suspicion . This had been a mild third degree . He had acquitted himself . He had gone through the sieve . " I 'll have the boys drive you home , so you wo n't be late for your datebirding . " The captain chortled again . Judd watched himself , so as not to write too much . A paragraph . He wrote fast in a careless hand ; one thing was sure , this would n't match his lettering on the envelope of the ransom letter . " This all right ? " He passed the sheet to the captain . The officer read it over slowly ; he was a lip-reader , but concealed it by mouthing a cigar . He nodded , pushing the paper under a corner of the blotter on his desk . " I 'm afraid I have n't been of much help , " Judd said , rising . A clear , mathematical conviction of superiority had come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Artie had to succeed ; they could not be caught , any more than two and two could make five . " Well "  --  the captain leaned back  --  " it 's a downtown job now . But we 've all got to give them all the help we can . " Judd went to the door , opened it , even enjoying a fluttery feeling that a peremptory voice could still halt him . His two escorts were sitting , idle . They arose as though they had expected him , and led him out to the car . So he was now checked off the list . He thought of asking them to drop him at Artie 's . That was how Artie would have done it  --  try to scare the piss out of him by pulling up in a police car . But for himself , Judd reflected , he could enjoy the thought as much as the deed . Artie was excitable ; if Artie saw a police car pull up without warning , he might even shoot , or do something equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was just time to keep his date with Ruth . The two cops dropped him at the house . The maid rushed forward as though she had been waiting at the door . Judd laughed at her . " I 'll bet you were scared I 'd never come back . " The Crime of Our Century 145 " Oh , no . " " It was just some routine junk about my bird-watching classes , " he said , so she would n't be spreading stories . He went upstairs . There was an elation in him now over the way he had handled the interrogation . His victory was like a confirmation of his entire code of behavior . He was right , right , right ! I SEE JUDD then , starting for his date with Ruth , picking up his field glasses to prove he really meant it about going bird-watching . And besides  --  aweapon ? Does he definitely intend . . . ? Let her fate hang on chance . That will he more exciting . Let there be some omen . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) o it . When the bell rings , Ruth goes to the door , while her mother looks out the window and notices the red Stutz . " My , my ! My daughter is gettingpopular these days , " she comments . " Who is this one ? Have I met him ? " " He was out with us last night , " Ruth says . " Artie 's friend , Judd Steiner . " " And you 've got a date already ? Fast work , " says her mother . " The Steiners . Is that the millionaire Steiners ? Poor Sid , what kind of competitionare you giving him ? " " Oh , do n't jump to conclusions , Mother , " Ruth protests . " We just like to talk . He 's very brilliant . He just passed his exam for Harvard Law School , besides being Phi Beta Kappa at seventeen . " She picks up her scarf and her handbag . " Are n't you going to ask him up to introduce him ? " her mother demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Judd waits in the hallway . Coming down , she makes a kind of illumination for the brown-walled stairhall  --  her reddish hair , her yellow pleated skirt , her bare forearms , the streak of her scarf , giving a passing gladness to the hall . Ruth feels friendly  --  curious , she would say  --  toward Judd . Despite his reputation among the coeds . They ca n't say what is wrong with him , but have listed him as n.g . Some say Judd gives them the creeps . Ruth has n't found him at all repellent . It 's true that he shows off his brilliance a little too much , but Ruth already feels a kind of pity for this . He is somehow a stray person , and her upbringing has been in a house of146The Crime of Our Century meetings and collected Yiddish poets visiting from New York , or stray anarchists , or intense-looking men with long hair who were vaguely " studying . " Often a half dozen derelicts of this kind would be discoursing around her mother 's plentiful table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd rather attracts Ruth . And physically , though Judd is quite short , he is not smaller than she ; they danced quite well together . He is something of a change from her gangling reporter . There is in her , that day , the unworried adventurous confidence of a girl who has a devoted steady and yet is uncommitted , who may tease herself that perhaps there is yet something unknown , something supreme , in romance to be encountered . With his curious perfection of manners that contains a touch of condescendingirony for the custom itself , Judd opens the door of his car for her . Then he walks around to his own side . As she settles into the fancy car , her skirt rimming her knees , Ruth smiles to Judd . " I almost expected to see you with Artie , " she says . " You 're practically inseparable , are n't you ? " " Oh , I have a life of my own , too , " he parries . As he drives away with her , he wonders at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this a feeling of happiness ? More likely an enjoyment of the power in himself , of his secret imaginings . Can there really be something special about this girl , about having her sitting next to him , and feeling her interestin him ? Wryly , Judd permits himself to appreciate the image of the pretty girl and himself , gay youth breezing through the town in his Bearcat ! She too must be feeling the image , for she leans back with a delighted sigh , saying how perfect the day is for a ride . Then Judd has a suggestion : " Instead of going to a restaurant for lunch , why not pick up some hot dogs on the road ? " And Ruth says , " Oh , that sounds scrumptious . " He heads through the park and along the lake . A hackneyed refrain comes into his mind . " A pretty girl is like a melody . " He drops one hand from the wheel and catches her knowing smile , but at least she does n't make any callow remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , against her thigh , so warmly firm through the short pleated skirt . She remarks that she has been wondering about his friendship with Artie , because they really are so different . Artie acts like a college sheik , while he is so quiet and even shy . Of course , as everyone says , Artie is very brilliant , and she supposes there are n't many people around who "  --  can meet my lofty requirements ? " Judd says . " There is no sense in false modesty . " That 's true , she agrees . The average man at the university is interested only in football and his frat . " You 're not a frat man , are you ? " " No , " he says . " Sid practically dropped out , " Ruth remarks . She smoothes her dress , for it has crept up , leaving a little gap above her rolled stockings and showing , too , the soft dip in the flesh made by her round garters . " Is Sid your lover ? " Judd asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , tinged with a knowing smile , over his so quickly opening the usual subject  --  " it 's not that I believe strictly in the conventions . But I do n't believe in rushing things either . I mean , if I were really certain I was in love and we wanted each other , and for some reason we could n't get married , then I should give myself . " There is something almost prim in the way she makes this announcement . It excites him . " And you 're not sure you 're in love ? " " Oh , " she says thoughtfully , " I sometimes feel as if it 's already settled that I 'm going to marry Sid . Though there 's no engagement or anything . And then sometimes I feel as if some wonderful unknown thing still has to happen . " " Does he intend to marry you ? " She laughs softly . " Even after he gets out of school  --  a reporter does n't earn enough to get married on . And Sid wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see . " They are silent for a moment . " You do n't mind my being so inquisitive ? " " Do n't you have to find out if the coast is clear ? " Again her soft laugh . " Is it ? " He reflects how cleverly this female has put him into the roleof a possible serious suitor . Now she only smiles , without answering hisquestion . Judd finds himself saying , " Perhaps Sid will win the rewardon the murder case  --  he 's working so hard on it . And then you can getThe Crime of Our Century 149married . " Why has he mentioned the case ? He is getting as bad as Artie . But it seems a normal subject to her . " Oh , is there a big reward ? " " The papers said several thousand dollars , I think . " " I do n't think anybody needs a reward to try to catch them , " she remarks . And after a musing silence : " I 'm not really ready to get married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like what ? " " Oh , go abroad . " She recalls that he is to go in a few weeks , and she says she envies him , and Judd offers the expected persiflage about her coming along , and she says she would if she only had the money , and he finds himself saying , " Well , I 've got an idea how to get the money for you ! I 'll confess to the murder ! I 'll get the reward  --  and that will pay for your trip ! " " There 's only one thing wrong with that "  --  she takes up the game  --  " you would n't be able to come along ! " And then : " Would you really do that for me ? " " Why not ? " he says . " And it would be an experience to see if I could make them believe me . " " I 'm afraid I could n't accept such a sacrifice , " she says , but then her voice drops . " It 's cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " he demands . " Why is it cruel to joke about death ? After all , what is one creature more or less in the world ? " Her mouth opens . But then , as though catching onto his line , she says , " I think you say things just to shock people , to be different . You 're not really so bad . " A tiny spasm of irritation runs through him at her words . Unaccountably , Judd thinks of his mother , of the first time he brought down a bird , a robin , with a B-B gun they had given him , as a little kid . How Mother Dear softly explained to him that he really did n't want to kill the bird for no purpose . People made guns that could kill , it was true , Mother Dear had said , but they used their guns always for a reason . To protect themselves from wild beasts , or to hunt for food . Or to study animals , like the mounted birds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheated . And the same shadowy feeling of resentment has come over him now at Ruth 's sententious words . With a secret pleasure , he heads for the stand where he stopped with Artie . " They 've got wonderful hot dogs here , " he says. 150 CompulsionRuth leans back . " Oh , I 'm so hungry I could eat an elephant . " " With mustard and piccalilli ? " " Everything ! " She sits waiting as he goes to the stand . She looks so right , the pretty girl in the car . Judd tells himself she is n't precisely beautiful ; it is rather a supremely blooming quality that gives her such appeal . It is the sex urge that is causing him to endow his reactions with aesthetic value . He is conscious of the hot-dog man , in need of a shave , with sleeves turned up over hairy arms , a wop or Polack probably , holding out the frankfurters , grinning approvingly , showing a couple of gold teeth . And momentarily the balance wavers the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ca n't he simply take a nice girl out on the dunes ? He turns down the side road toward Miller 's Beach , stopping the car at the edge of the sand . Ruth gets out ; she stands for a moment , breathingfull , her blouse rising with her breath . Judd takes the binoculars from the side pocket . " Is this where you come to watch the birds ? " " This is one of the best places . " He tells her it was here that he discovered the Kirtland Warbler . " Discovered ? " The species had n't been seen for decades , he informs her , and was assumedto be extinct . " I do n't go by other people 's assumptions , " he says . It is this kind of remark that makes people dislike him , Ruth realizes . But ca n't they see that he has to do it , from some need , some weakness ? Judd tells her how he searched all last spring . Not far from here , where the beach is unusable , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , one day , he recognized the warbler 's call . " But you had never heard it before ? " " When I heard it , I knew it . " " That must be such a wonderful feeling , " Ruth says , " to be the discoverer , to be the first . " " I 'd like to be the first with you , " he remarks , with the expected double meaning . Boys feel they have to say things like that , Ruth knows , and momentarily it even gives her a sunny sensation that Judd has made a silly remark , like an ordinary boy . She feels a surge of sureness  --  someThe Crime of Our Century 151thing good is happening  --  and she gives him her hand so he may pull her up a steep dune . She is thinking about him . Everyone likes being " different , " but with Judd it is such a terrible passion . Like the way he has to brag about the different courses he takes at school , how he is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his pleasure seems to have been not so much in what he discovered but in having been alone to prove others were mistaken . Even the freethinkers who used to come to her mother 's table wanted to gather together with others who had freethinking views , but Judd seems to need to prove himself unique , alone . He drops her hand and hurries ahead . There is a dip between dunes , an area of stunted bushes , forming clusters in the sand . She comes alongsidehim and stands still , as he is standing . " Oh , it 's so wonderful here , " Ruth says . " The sand is untouched . It looks as if no one in the whole world had ever been here before . " He moves a few steps , and she moves , but then Judd makes a halting gesture with his hand , and Ruth freezes , her arm arrested gracefully . Judd listens . There are a few calls . Not the warbler . " Hear anything ? " he asks . " I was afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe , " he says . " Does n't it frighten them to hear people talk ? " " You can talk . Just naturally , so the voices fit in . " " I think I never listened to nature before , " Ruth says . " I mean , just to the air . It 's as though the sky itself had a sound , not quite a sound , but  --  " " I know , " Judd says . And he is startled , at a feeling as of anguish risingup in himself . He leads her farther , over several dunes , until they are well away from where any beachgoers might wander . Then he slips down on the sand , nesting down behind some shrubs . She settles herself beside him , her legs neatly folded . " Is this where you found your bird ? " she asks . Judd draws out his wallet to show her the picture of the warbler perched on his hand , feeding . This is the same picture that his father has enlarged to keep on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not forgotten his purpose in coming , and the self-wager he made over the call of the bird . Then they listen for calls . She sits alert , listening . " A mating call , " he152 Compulsionremarks . He focuses the field glasses , and directs her to a low distant branch , the birds flickering around it , alighting , circling , alighting . As she tries to follow his pointing , a curl of her hair moves against his cheek . " This is what you really love , is n't it ? " Ruth says . Judd does n't reply . He feels a choking rush of conflicting emotions ; he feels invaded by her , and he turns against this a scorn for her , for her female sentimentality . And yet the same sense of anguish has returned , as though her voice had touched upon some unbearably sensitive mechanismwithin him . Now , on the binoculars , their fingers touch . " I mean , this seems so far from being a lawyer , " Ruth says . Then she has kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in him . " I can always do this , " he says . He puts the glasses to her eyes . After a moment Ruth remarks , " It makes you wonder if we ourselves might be watched , like this , by superiorbeings . " This breaks the spell , he tells himself . And he tells her she might just as well ask if the birds are speculating about being watched by human gods . " Why not ? " she says . " Last night you were arguing that birds have intelligence and can think . " " Then perhaps we exist only in the minds of the birds , " he says . He feels he is not at his best ; a resentment is growing . Ruth smiles ; she seems to settle in , a little lower , to relax alongside him in the sand . " Philosophy 3 , " she says . " Berkeley . " " Well , why not ? " he persists , irritated . " What proof is there of anything else ? If God exists , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if man can conceive of God , then God is less than man  --  he is merely a conception in man 's consciousness . Is n't that right ? " " I know it 's logical , " she says softly , " but it seems so conceited . Accordingto that idea , everyone is his own God . " " Why not ? " he demands again . She is once more merely the female , refusing to recognize logic ! Ca n't she see that a person , a consciousness , can be sure only of itself ? Of itself alone ? A flood of ideas rushes through his mind  --  the " God is dead " of Nietzsche  --  but it is no use explaining to her . Judd sees the archaic bearded gods , the Jehovah  --  allThe Crime of Our Century 153those gods that little men had invented to fill up their areas of fear . Even his father does n't have the nerve to swing out alone into the universe , to admit God is dead . No . He still sends checks to the Sinai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thought . " I thought you were an atheist , " she says . " Are your folks atheists , too ? " It angers him that she has touched on his folks . What should that have to do with his beliefs ? " My father still adheres to vestiges of Jewish superstition , " he declares . " He still belongs to a temple . " " Do you have brothers and sisters , Judd ? " she asks . He feels even more resentful ; she has diverted him from the main discussion . " I have two older brothers , " he mutters . " But they 're just Bab-bitts . " Looking up at the sky , Ruth tells him , " My folks are agnostics . I think I am too . " Then , with almost an apologetic note : " Oh , Judd , sometimes the world seems so beautiful , like here , do n't you feel that things have to be good ? " " Good ?

" What about the beauty in evil ? " he challenges . " What about Baudelaire ? " Ruth says , " Of course , there is a deeper kind of experience , as in Dostoevski , an evil that has good in it too . " " No ! There is only experience itself ! " Judd insists . And he feels he is almost ready now for his intention . He feels that somehow she has revealed herself , she is really from the other side , from the enemies of his own kind . He guides the conversation now to the Medici , to Aretino , to the rare book he wants to translate , listing all the forms of perversion . " Are you trying to excite me ?

I suppose all girls feel something like that . " " It 's well known , " he says , " that every woman really wants to be raped . " " Oh , do n't talk like a callow youth with a line , " Ruth answers . " I thought you 'd have a more original line than that . " " Well , you invited it , " he snaps , beginning to feel the necessary anger toward her .

" When I was a little girl , we used to live in a downstairs flat where there were bars on the windows , and I used to imagine that was why the bars were there , but that somehow my Lochinvar would come in , even through the bars . It used to give me kind of nightmares , but I knew I wanted to have those nightmares . " He moves so that the whole length of their bodies touch , as they lie side by side in the sand .

" But the higher the type of mind , Judd says , the more there is to be discovered . And then she says it . Lightly . She hopes he does n't feel , because he has such a brilliant mind , that it is his duty to taste every crime like rape and murder . " Oh , the murder now wo n't be necessary , " Judd remarks , almost idly . And he catches himself . But she is too confused to notice meanings within meanings .

You would be more likely to keep it a secret and becomemy mistress . " She is breathing quickly . If she makes a move to get yip and run away , he knows her movement will unleash him from the last restraint . His arm , his hand holding the heavy field glasses , will describean arc .. . But she does not move . Are tears coming into her eyes ? There is such a questioning in them , such a dismay . And now the moment has come for him , for an act of will . Inwardly Judd feels tumultuously threatened ; lie does n't dare examine what doubts may be rising in him , but some horrible upheaval is there , as if all , all he were ever sure of were suddenlycrossed out , wrong ! And it is a partner-feeling , too , to the strange sense of almost  --  almost  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaining ! The same feeling that he experienced the other night , beside t he cistern . To reach the sense of having done , done ! With an act of will , he rolls his body upon her . Ruth 's body is rigid . 1 fer face is so utterly close to his that Judd can no longer see it , only the eyes , still puzzled and hurt. i56 Compulsion " Please do n't , " she begs . " Judd , please do n't . " It can still be thought a tussle such as any boy and girl might find themselves in after letting themselves go a little too far in their petting . He tries to insert his knee between her legs , and recalls some definition in a piece of sex literature that it is really impossible to rape a woman , that in the last moment , even against her conscious will , she physically consents . With his free hand he tears at his clothing . She seems not so much to be resisting as to have become unliving , frozen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He alone . " Judd , Judd , I 'm afraid for you ! " Ruth calls , with awful anxiety , and he seems to hear the call over a distance of years in the voice of his mother as he tries to walk atop a fence . And all at once her arms are around him , holding him close , close , somehow protectively . In that moment it is n't predominantly a fear of what might happen to herself that pervades Ruth , but a dreadful anguish for the boy , for the sick , sick eyes , for the tyrannic needs in him  --  not only his sex lust but something far beyond , some horror . And her intuitive gesture is to draw the sick soul into herself , not the drawing in of sex that might come to a mature woman , but the girlish impulse , the drawing in to her heart . And then , suddenly , he is spent . Her head turns sidewise , under him , and he rolls from her . Now if death could come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it is not only the after-sorrow and the physical disgustof spilling ; it is the whole sense of failure , incompetence to live , that invades him . He lies motionless as she looks at him . He supposes , somehow , he will have to say he is sorry , and he tries to move his lips . Ruth says , " Do n't . I understand . I want to understand . " And she makes a slight , tentative gesture , as to touch him , but withholds , knowingshe must not touch him . Presently the tension lessens . And then a thought begins to come up in Judd , like some distant memory . One way in which the experience has perhaps succeeded , or meant something . For through the entire attempt , even at the most urgent moment , the moment when it always came , there had not come the image of Artie . The Crime of Our Century 157Could he , then , only be like everyone else ? Could it be possible that he may come really to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even marrying , raising a family ? Would the whole idea of what that is all about , what ordinary life is all about , come to him , too ? But if he can be ordinary . He shudders in horror and fear , as of losing his very self , and at the same time he experiences a frightful sense of something wasted , the murder as a false and wasted act . He has to make an effort to confirm the murder experience as part of his own being . And then it has returned into him , with even a more terrible sense of doom and error , because if the newer self is the real one , he has in previous dark error forsworn it . On the way back , they do not refer to the experience . They scarcely speak , and yet Judd does not find himself uncomfortable with her . When he leaves her at her house she asks , " Shall I see you again ? " " Do you want to ? " Judd says . " If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CRIME HAD become our total obsession . I worked with Tom , runningafter the police and with the police and ahead of the police from one glimmer to another , and watching the other reporters , and eluding the other reporters , and conjecturing and imagining and listening , and gathering more and more the feeling in the city that some hitherto unknownterror was among us . The child 's fear of wolves prowling in the forest , wolves that will cat you up -- even when the child lives in a city where there are no forests , even though he has been told that really there are no such wolves anywhere around him  --  this childhood fear seemed now to have leaped awake in every soul in Chicago , and the wolves were the primordial menace , some unknown beast , more savage than any beast ever encountered by man . There was a growing anxiety , a growing presage that something new and terrible and uncontrollable , some new murder-germ , was here involved . The entire police force was at work in the search . The entire city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the logic of life itself , for we must have sensed , beyond the touchable aspects of the mystery , that some killing factor , some element purely murderous , had broken loose . Even before the boys were arrested , there was this dreadfulforeknowledge of the escape of some always present , imperfectly contained violence , and if we did not capture it , if we did not hold it and examine it and master its containment , we were all unceasingly exposed , lost . Tom and I were only a couple of reporters caught up in this hysteria . Yet we could see how , among the police chiefs , there was a growing bewilderment . Their statements daily became more contradictory . Every hour there would be a new crop of sensational clues ; by nightfall everything would have been disproven ; and on the next day the chiefs would again announce that the murderer would soon be caught . On Saturday morning , Nolan still declared , in an interview in the Tribune : " There is no doubt in my mind that the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidnaping letter . " But by noon the poor suicide had been discounted , forgotten . And a number of other suspects  --  teachers , even relatives of teachers who owned Un-158The Crime of Our Century 159derwood portable typewriters  --  were suddenly being discharged . For though the first expert had stated that the ransom note had been typed on an Underwood , a new expert declared that the machine was a Corona . The Kessler mail was flooded with tips , and with abuse . There were threats to kidnap the other Kessler children . " Those questioned are innocent . Better watch Adele  --  she is next ! " one letter warned , and the guard was increased . Chief of Police Schramm told us that nearly all of his men were working extra shifts , with leaves canceled , for a veritableepidemic of kidnaping threats had broken out on the South Side , and along the North Shore 's Gold Coast , too . It was always like that after a big crime , he said , but this was the worst . And actually , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an elaborate plot to have Kessler bring $25,000 or risk the abduction of his other children . The plotters were caught and arrested . But the imitative fever and the released flood of evil continued unabated . All the quiet-faced people of the city , all the open-faced youngsters  --  were they all cunning madmen ? " You dirty , stingy  --  ! If I had you here I would strangle you to death . We will go a little farther , so watch yourself . You could n't keep your dirty mouth closed . To hell with the police . You are crying . You made your money honest . Hah hah . But you will suffer minute by minute you low-down skunk . So low you could walk under a snake . And now every time you disobey us we will strike . Go ahead . " Anonymous . From these hate letters , police turned again to the revenge theory . But not one out of a thousand of those letters could have come from people who ever had known Charles Kessler . What weird , filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , walking around in coats and pants of ordinary men , in dresses of ordinary women ! The police passed around to us a number of their scrawls , the obscene symbols , the daggers and mystic suns and moons , and the religious quotations and admonitions ! Surely so ghastly a punishment , they wrote , was a visitation for some ghastly sin . Yet each day what was known for sure seemed to be diminishing . Even the suspected teacher , Steger , had not confessed , and doubtlessly the police had used everything on him . Mike Prager came out with a story that Steger had finally admitted to an unnatural liking for youngz6o Compulsionboys . But no one could find out where the teacher was being held . Even Tom Daly 's brother , on the force , could n't tell us . We kept asking CaptainNolan . We kept trying the office of State 's Attorney Horn . Then suddenly , instead of merely shrugging , " I have n't got him , " Horn changed his reply . " For all I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building on Dorchester . Within seconds , a half-dozen cabs with other reporters pulled up . No one answered the bell , no one responded to our knocking , though neighbors kept saying knowingly , " He 's in there . " Through the teacher 's door , Mike Prager called offers for an exclusive story . " Name your own price . " We kept calling questions . " Are you going to sue for false arrest ? Did you get the third degree ? " And : finally a tormented , imploring howl came through the closed door . " Let me alone , ca n't you ! " The questions , the offers increased . A sob sister , Peg Sweet , was given a chance to speak quietly while the rest of us all pretended to walk down the stairs , going away , making a big clatter with our feet . But the siege proved futile . After some time , a brother of the teacher arrived with a doctor . " Leave him alone , ca n't you ! Be human , ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After more useless badgering , we finally gave up , leaving in little groups as our deadlines passed . Even the idea we had had of the criminal as an educated man seemed to become uncertain . For this idea had been founded on the wording of the ransom letter . Now , from New York , came a story that the letter was virtually copied from a ransom letter in the previous month 's issue of Detective Magazine . The murderer could be anyone who could read and copy what he read . The letter was in a story called " The Kidnaping Syndicate , " and the author , interviewed , declared , " The murderers will be caught because they demonstrated a total lack of inventiveness and cunning , without which escape from the law is impossible . " Yes , the murderers would be caught soon , soon , everyone declared . As fright increased in the city , the Tribune 's front-page cartoon showed a cowering man , huddling in a dingy hotel room , clutching a newspaper , with other papers scattered over the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie and Judd , following the editions , as yet felt no such dismay . Only once during those days was Artie irked . A late edition of the News appeared without the murder in the banner headline . Instead , The Crime of Our Century r6rthe headline was about some exclusive interview obtained in Rome . The new boss of Italy had given an audience to a crack foreign correspondent . " Fascism is a spiritual movement , " Artie read . And he suggested to Judd , " Say , while you 're over there in Italy , how about buying a couple of those black shirts ? They look pretty snazzy . " Judd read the rest of the interview , becoming rather excited . " Listen , I must try to see him ! " This Mussolini certainly understood the philosophy of Nietzsche . It was by the will to power , Mussolini declared , that Italy would rise again . Artie laughed and pulled away the paper to turn to the pictures of the newest murder suspects . There were some good ones . A picture of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , she really was . She had been living with a confidence man , and she herself had phoned the police . She suspected her friend was the murderer . He kept all kinds of poisons in their room , she said , and he possessed a portable typewriter . She was pointing to it , and to a row of poison bottles , in the photograph . Her friend had behaved strangely since the murder , the woman said , and a day ago he had disappeared . That was a good suspect , Chief Nolan stated . And the police were also investigating a man who lived only a block away from Hartmann 's Drugstore and who had formerly taught scienceat the Twain School . The man 's neighbors had tipped off the police . They were suspicious of him because he owned a portable typewriterand he liked small boys . Police were checking , too , on relatives of the school 's athletic coach . Several of them had been picked up for questioning . Meanwhile , Artie read , preparations were being made to provide absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a floral bouquet arrived at the Kessler home , with condolencesfrom " Harold Williams . " Police cars , cabs rushed to the florist shop , not ten blocks away . The shop was closed . Four of us located the owner in a nearby flat . Yes , he had sold the bouquet , but he had not noticed the name on the card . We told him  --  the same name as on the ransom letter . Slowly , his first fright-reaction was replaced by a sense of importance , for was he not the sole being who had actually seen162 Compulsionthe kidnaper-fiend in person ? The florist concentrated on recalling the appearance of the customer . Only a few hours ago . Yes . A tall man , about thirty , wearing gray clothes . Wearing glasses ? No , but he squinted slightly . From this , a portrait of the killer was evolved ; newspaper artists drew the picture , everyone was alerted to be on the lookout for a thinnish man  --  long face , high forehead , age about thirty  --  wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The florist was certain he had seen his customer drive away in a Winton . Thus he corroborated the story told by the little boy who had seen Paulie get into a gray Winton with a tall , thin man ! And on Sunday morning we were all pretty sure of his identity . He was a druggist named Clement Holmes , who had just tried to commit suicide . Holmes had been taken to the South Side Hospital . He was tall and thin . Police had questioned his wife and daughter , who told how strangely Holmes had been acting . He was half wild . He had been terriblyworried about money matters , having recently lost his drugstore . Saturday , he had left the house . . . . Was it at the time " Harold Williams " had appeared at the florist ? It proved to be during the very same hour . Later , Holmes had returned in a terribly agitated state and had chased his wife and daughter out of the apartment . When they venturedback , they had found him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the hospital , Holmes had been restored to consciousness , but to all questions he gave only babbling , meaningless replies . In the morning , the florist was rushed to the hospital to identify the suspect . ButHolmes had vanished ! SUSPECT FLEES HOSPITAL ! Would the madmanturn up at the funeral ? Somehow , the funeral was held with a degree of dignity . On the plea of the bereaved millionaire and of his friend judge Wagner , all editors were prevailed upon to restrain their coverage . A police cordon kept photographers at a distance . We agreed among ourselves not to try to interview Paulie 's mother , watching respectfully from across the street as she walked , trancelike , almost carried by her husband and his brother , to the black limousine . Judge Wagner had given us the list of pallbearers , Paulie 's classmates , the richest boys on the South Side . We watched from across the street as they came out , in their knickers andThe Crime of Our Century 163black stockings ; each of them might have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gravity . At the cemetery we all stood in a knot , whispering and conjecturing as to whether the murderer might appear . The police formed another small group , with re-enforcements discreetly deployed on a side street . The family procession passed into the grounds , and we followed , remainingat a respectful distance . I heard the rabbi , speaking briefly  --  the crime was not mentioned ; he spoke only of a young life taken in purity . Then the Kaddish , recited very softly by the father . And thus was Paulie Kessler buried a second time . We came away hurriedly , for there was a police tip that Clement Holmes had been seen , in a Winton , on Skokie Road . Monday , police were checking every registered Winton owner in Chicago . One had even turned up whose name was Harold Williams . But it seemed he had an absolutely airtight alibi . In the afternoon there was a sudden wild alarm , and we followed police cars to an address on Harper Avenue . The sidewalk was filled with people asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorways ; police were scouring the alleys . It seemed that a tall man in a gray suit , wearing a fedora hat , had come hurrying into a rooming house saying excitedly , " I want a room right away . I 've got to get off the street ! " He had behaved so strangely that the landlady had whispered to a roomer to call the police . The stranger must have heard , for he had turned and run out of the house . There had been a wild chase through back yards . But the suspect had got away . By then we were looking for a woman , too . The clue came from the glasses . A Lieutenant Cassidy had been detailed to try to trace the spectacles , and he had consulted an optician near the Bureau . The lenses were of a common prescription , as we all knew . But the frame , the opticiansaid , was not a style that he handled . It was a tortoise-shell frame manufactured , he believed , outside of Chicago . Perhaps the murderer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite narrow . He judged that the glasses might have been worn by a woman . Someone with a thin nose bridge and a narrow forehead . Pictures were drawn of the1.64 Compulsionfemale accomplice of the man in the gray suit , both of them sitting in a gray Winton car . Nearly a week had gone by without a single serious indication that the murderer might be found . We began to hear stories of pressure . The almost mythical multimillionaire founder of the Weiss-Straus enterpriseshad appeared in the office of State 's Attorney Horn . He had come down with judge Wagner . The magnate had asked pointedly about the progress of the investigation . For though the slain boy had been only remotely related to the Straus clan , there were among his classmates two of Weiss 's favorite grandsons . Were they safe ? Were any children in Chicago safe as long as this monster remained uncaught , unknown ? An editorial of the same tenor appeared in our own paper and in the Post . Suddenly , police raids were taking place . Flophouses were combed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the headlines by announcing that he had dropped the ransom theory andnow favored the pervert theory . ROUND UP ALL DEPRAVED , we headlined . The police were combing their files , checking on every known pervert . Petty ex-convicts , floaters , queers were brought into the stations by the score , and we went and looked at them in the sour-smelling Canal Street lockup , the restless little men with puffy faces , the whisperers , the morons , as we called them . How many were kicked around , battered , abused ? Who knew ? Who cared ? Then Captain Nolan , chief of detectives , recaptured the headlines from the chief of police . " Dope will be found at the bottom of it all , " he announced in one of his exclusive interviews with the Tribune . And every dope addict in town was to be picked up and examined . But as Nolan and Schramm failed to provide convincing suspects , our headlines were turned over more and more to State 's Attorney Horn and his eager staff of investigators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we declared , had been provided by Horn , whose men had been questioning a railroad switchman oddly overlooked by the police . The switchman , who worked only a few miles from the scene of the crime , was certain that on the night of the deed he had seen the actual murderers , a woman and three men , in a sedan . In fact , he had talked to them . In Horn 's office we all listened to the switchman 's story . An elderlyThe Crime of Our Century165man with the scrubbed look of the intensely sober , he was quite convincing . On Wednesday night about midnight , he said , he had been driving home to Gary , and just past Hegewisch he had come upon a car stuck on a little side road . A dark sedan . It was a Nash or a Moon , not a Winton . He had given the car a push to get it back onto the road . Those people had been carrying a bundle of some kind , like something wrapped in a tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a hell of a time to go camping . " They had thanked him for the push . And one detail he remembered : their car had a broken front bumper . All garagemen were asked to notify the police if they had repaired any such bumper on any such car . More and more rewards were offered for information leading to the capture of the murderers . And then Detective Chief Nolan issued an extraordinary statement : " I ask everybody in Chicago to look around and ask whether his neighbors , friends , or acquaintances showed signs of muddy clothes last Wednesday night , or were away from their usual haunts or callings last Wednesday afternoon or evening . " " Hey , I saw mud on your shoes last Wednesday ! " became the jest of the day , but Nolan 's invitation was followed by a new wave of telephone tips , letters , denunciations , arrests . Everyone was looking at his neighborwith strange eyes . An alert citizen forwarded to the police an envelopeon which the address was hand lettered , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a draftsman , jobless , and the owner of a Winton ! After a severe day , the man declared he would sue the police , but nothing came of his threat . And at night , police pounced upon a group of people in a vacant lot at Cottage Grove and 94th  --  a few blocks from the Kessler home . There were two men and a woman . They had been acting strangely , burning something on the lot . And they carried a small bundle . It proved to be a shirt wrapped around something hard , which was nothing else than a broken typewriter ! But it turned out to be an Oliver . And near Aurora , police saw two cars stop . Their drivers got out , talked . A portable typewriter exchanged hands . The cars drove off in different directions . The police car chased one , and an officer cornmandeereda passing automobile to pursue the second fleeing vehicle . But the exchange proved to have taken place between a typewriter repairman and a respectable customer. 166 CompulsionNeighbors of a mysterious redheaded woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder . " I know all about the case , " they had heard her say . She was arrested as she was parking her old gray car . In the car was a shoemaker 's hammer , a weapon that might well have caused the death wounds on the boy 's head . She turned out to be a harmless eccentric . Then we were haunting Steger 's block again . An anonymous telephonecaller had informed the police that the dead boy 's clothing would be found " inside that block . " " We ca n't afford to pass up anything , " Chief Schramm said , and the police combed the block . A woman was noticed acting suspiciously , running and peering under shrubs . But it was proved that she had merely lost her cat . Meanwhile a truck filled with street laborers arrived , the block was closed off , and the men began breaking open the pavement . With the other reporters , I ran up and down the stairs that led to Steger 's apartment . Front and back doors were locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rearrested . Nobody would confirm a thing . One of the officers who was friendly to Tom , Lieutenant Cassidy , arrived on the scene , and Tom dogged him for half an hour . Cassidy swore he did n't know anything new about the schoolteacher . As for the digging operation , he only repeated our own guesses . " Maybe the sewer is stuffed up . " Maybe Paulie Kessler 's clothes would be found stuffed in the sewer . The job continued into the darkness . Special lights were set up around the trench . In the crowd , the wisecracks flew , and the shocked , self-conscious giggles of flappers could be heard , as suggestions were made about what people might want to get rid of down the sewer . Among the bystanders there was a paunchy man with a low , almost monotonous voice who said he was a plumber ; he was reciting to Tom in a friendly way the list of foul and bestial things he had found stuffed in various pipes  --  females were the worst , he said ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting things that went down the drains of the city . And in that same crowd , inevitably , Artie Straus had turned up with his satellite , Judd , hailing me , pausing to add a few horrors to the plumber 's list , and swirling away among the watchers . I had a momenTheCrime of Our Century 167tary impression of Artie 's voice laughing above some girlish shrieks , and then the sewer was finally opened . They found only a lot of muck . In this muck , all the activity seemed to have come to a dead end . Of the hundreds of perverts and morons arrested and grilled , a score were still being held , among them an ex-policeman . We had taken to filling out our stories about them with the views of alienists , as we called them in those days . We quoted Dr. Arthur Ball , whose own grandson had been a playmate of Paulie Kessler and who declared that the killer would be found to be a degenerate of " the same mental type as Fitzgerald , " the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutilatinga little girl . After the alienists came the turn of the psychics . From Detroit , the police received a telegram signed by a Mme. Charlotte High , who declaredshe had had a vision of the killing and could describe the killers . Reese had me get her on long distance . A strange voice , breathless , masculine , poured out the detailed vision . " There are two men ; one has a sort of gray streak in his hair . I see him hiding , in a big place , a hotel , in the southwest part of the city . The boy 's clothes are there . In my revelation I saw a car , " she continued . " It is not a Winton , as the police think , but a Buick . I traced the course of the car . It started in Evanston and doubled back . A woman wrapped her skirt over the boy 's mouth to gag him , and he strangled . They went to a red frame house on Wabash Avenue at the end of the line where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a day or two , someone will attempt to commit suicide . There will be a confession . " And indeed on the next day someone did try to commit suicide . It was again the poor deranged druggist , Clement Holmes , who had escapedfrom the hospital . Now the news came from Louisville , where Holmes had been found in a rooming house , again nearly dead from poison . Police were waiting at his bedside for a confession . Only a thread of life remained . Would he live long enough to confess ? The report had come late in the day . Tom and I hurried back to the Bureau , hoping for the confession . If Holmes lived , Tom was to take the sleeper down to Louisville . As we walked across the Loop , we felt that our job together on this story was drawing to an end . Somehow it was in the air  --  the murdererr68 Compulsionwas about to be caught . Perhaps it was n't even that poor dying druggist . But we both felt , with our fagged-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together without rest all week . I had cut my classes , certain that in this assignment I was at last gaining my maturity . AlreadyI was treated as one of the men , a regular . And with Tom I had experienced something I had never known before , a kind of partnershipthat I was to find rather rare even as 1 went on in my newspaper work . More and more as the week wore on , we had taken to keeping together , going out on the leads together instead of dividing them up . We had n't invaded each other , yet I felt that each knew the inside of the other . I knew only the barest facts about Tom Daly 's life , and he knew little more about mine . Yet we could curse each other out , call each other Hehe and Mick ; each could tell when the other had reached a limit of fatigue , yet each would overcome his own fatigue to run down one more clue . And while Tom kidded me about my literary ambitions , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become writers ; some thought of eventually becoming managing editors . And so , as we entered the Bureau , it came over me that when Tom went down to Louisville , I would feel that something good was over . Tom would get the last part of the story down there , and I would go back to graduate . I 'd have time to be with Ruth again . The Bureau was tense . The case was coming to a head . We could n't see Nolan ; Cassidy was just going in . Tom caught Cassidy 's sleeve as he passed . " All set for Louisville ? " " Hell , what do we want with Louisville now ! " Cassidy let out excitedlyas he hurried to his chief . What could he mean ? We looked at each other . " You chase over to Horn 's , " Tom said . " I 'll see what I can get here . " I found the State 's Attorney 's suite strangely quiet . The large outer office was deserted . But at a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ward heeler on a sinecure . " Everybody gone to Louisville ? " I asked . He smiled slyly . " They do n't have to go that far on this case . " That was all he would tell me . Clearly , Horn and his staff were quesTheCrime of Our Century 169tioning some new suspect , in secrecy . Or did all the other reporters know ? Where were they all ? " Dick Lyman been here ? " I asked . " Mike Prager ? " He waved his hand reassuringly . " I told them boys all to go home . " I hurried back to the Bureau . I found our rivals were all on hand . In the same mysterious way that had worked with us , others too had felt impelled to look in on the Bureau . Word had spread to Louie 's Place , and a few laggards were hurrying in now . Someone had recalled it was to the tracing of the spectacles that Cassidy had been assigned . Finally Nolan emerged with his arm around Cassidy , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horn rims had a slightly unusualhinge . Cassidy 's optometrist across the street did n't handle any such rims , but from a catalogue he had found the name of the firm that made them , in Brooklyn . Cassidy had written to the Seemore Company , and discovered that only one store in Chicago handled their product . For the time being , Nolan said , he had to withhold the store 's name . We all shouted our guesses . When Almer Coe , the biggest optical shop on Michigan Avenue was mentioned , we could see from Cassidy 's face that we were right . " That special frame , on that prescription of the glasses  --  it cuts the prospects down , " Cassidy said . " How many ? " we all wanted to know . Chief Nolan shook his head , smiling . " Just a few , just a few . " Now would we please play square with him ? He had played square with us . He could not divulge that little list , and it would be no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every one of those people . Nolan could not divulge to us where Mr. Horn was , with the suspects . But before the night was over , he promised , the owner of the glasses would be known . ON MONDAY , Ruth was sitting in the university library . She had drawn a large volume filled with pictures of birds , and she was reading in it when Judd sat clown next to her . It was somehow an impulse that took hold of students , when a new romance was coming upon them , either to linger around Sleepy Hollow or to go and sit in the main reading room , with its cathedral windows and the soft light lying across the tables . So if anyone was interested in anyone , he would wander through the library just to see if anyone was around . Judd had caught her nicely . Had she really become interested in bird behavior ? he asked . Mostly , she replied , in what it might explain about people . And she did n't want to seem such a nitwit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library voice he asked whether she was angry with him about Saturday . She looked at him , her eyes fully open . She shook her head . " I suppose you could n't help it . " In those remaining few days , were they in love ? Judd was living under heightening tension . A week , he and Artie had agreed , might be enough to let them feel in the clear . The week had not quite passed . The pressure was still within him to live as if each day were his last , as if the gripping hand might fall at any moment upon his shoulder ; this was indeed what he had sought  --  the intensification of life . And he carried it , containing in himself all the pressure , with no outward change in his manner . But inwardly Judd seethed with a sense of being on the verge of a whole new area of cognition . It was not only the murder that had so sharpened his awareness , he felt . It was what had happened to him with Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person of really unusual intelligence to permit himself to enter into an ordinary experience of ! love , to see what would happen ? He might transmute that love into something hitherto unknown , something unusual , for it had to be said that Ruth was quite intelligent , exceptionally so for a female . As to the idea of the rape , it had turned in another direction ; the force of the idea had propelled him into what might prove to be a novel experiment . Was there still time for this other kind of experience ? What if he began some-17oThe Crime of Our Century 171thing of importance to himself with this girl and in the meantime were caught ? Would n't he then suffer more than if he allowed no feeling to develop about loving a girl ? And Judd even found himself thinking , Would it be fair to the girl ? They had their date that evening , and spent their time analyzing what they might feel for each other . The discussion started over dinner , in the Coconut Grove . Judd maintained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always be reduced to self-interest or physiological response . " In your presence , " he explained , " I experience a certain ocular stimulation that causes a heightened activity in my glands . " Glands were a constant topic just then , and Judd went on to explain about nerve paths and brain cells , elements combining in a whole pattern of reactions called love . Ruth sat smilingly before him . But why , she inquired , should this stimulation be higher in the presence of certain members of the opposite sex than in that of others ? And even if you explained the entire physical mechanism , she said , were n't you still left with the same question ? If you felt a longing for one certain person , and just wanted to be with that person and not with anyone else , did n't you have to admit it was more than physiological ? I find it somewhat painful even today to project myself into this love scene between Ruth and Judd , for as I summon her up , I respond to the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small , round table with the menu card against the flower glass . I hear the music , " The Japanese Sandman , " and see all the couples around us , the trick dancers , the cheek-to-cheek dancers , and feel Ruth 's own wonder at what was happening in herself , in regard to this boy , and in regard to me . Was she going to discover that what she felt for me was only " girlish attraction " and that her fate was with this tangled and intense boy , sometimes a genius , sometimes so childish about the most obvious things ? Judd must have tried to analyze what , in particular , drew him . He had a few times before experienced sudden compelling drives to " make " some certain girl  --  you gave the girl a rush , but always with the feeling of hurrying back to tell Artie . Now , since that stupid spilling of Saturday , he had n't wanted to tell Artie anything about himself and Ruth . He felt an endless need of exploration with this girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time nearing for his172 Compulsiongoing-over ? Another day , another day , and would the emotion grow deep enough in him to hold ? So I torment myself with their little scene , with the certainty that while sophisticated words poured out , their fingers touched , and they reacted like any two kids made goofy at the contact ; I imagine them dancing together , and smiling in intimate joy . I see them later in the car , sitting mooning by the lake , and Judd not even trying to pull her heavily to him , perhaps only their hands clasped on the seat i etween them . And he is still talking , talking as he never before talked to a girl , or to anyone . The slight clacky accents of self-satisfaction , so often irritating when Judd speaks , fade down and vanish . He is earnest . He tells her , his tone just barely tinged with sorrow , that he has never had a true friendshipwith a woman and has never thought it possible , because every connection between men and women becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suspects that sexual desire will ruin things . ( There wings through his mind the image of his father , his mother , but how could his father ever have understood the delicacy , the fastidious quality , the purity of Mother Dear ? The times when they must have copulated , since children were born , Judd banishes as gross , gross moments that did n't really count in her life . ) And so he explains to Ruth that pure love , disinterested love , can be felt only between men , just as Socrates said , for only then is nature unable to intrude her ulterior motive and to make people imagine they are in love . Yet as he speaks , Judd reserves within himself the knowledge that he includes the componentof physical love between men . This knowledge gives him a feeling of power over her , the power of deception , but tinged with a tender shade of protectiveness  --  she need not know this thing in him , and how he has always felt toward Artie . As he talks , headlong , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chained to the purpose of procreation , it is almost as though he were staving off some moment , exorcising the moment when he will be caught by that same dreadful purpose , by the demands of real life , that make a bond between men and women . He is still free , and perhaps in the crime he has committed with Artie he has made himself free forever , for as the toils of natural love reach toward him , the toils , also , of the punishing law may be reaching to seize him . The Crime of Our Century 173And thus as Judd talks , his sense of inverse pleasure increases : it is as though a self-thrust knife were already in his flesh , to cut off this prospect of love , and as he twists and turns in his emotions the heighteningtension of his muscles presses exquisitely against the ready blade . This , too , in her innocence Ruth can not know . And Judd hints only darkly ; he says he does not believe happiness ever to be obtainable for himself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just having Weltschmerz , " he pretends perhaps she is right , but lets her feel there may indeedbe something more , something dark and personal . " But what is it , Judd ? " Ruth begs . " Why do you have these fits of melancholy ? " " Oh , the whole world , " he says . " It disgusts me . The things people do . " " I know , " she says . " Sometimes you wonder how human beings can be so ugly , when they are capable of beauty , too . The meanness , and the crimes . " He plays with the idea of a sudden Dostoevskian confession . To tell her everything , the crime , and even how he intended to rape her . What would she do ? Could he possibly discover in Ruth a soul so deep that it could encompass the horror of his own ? Or would she jump out of the car ? He feels she might burst into prolonged tears . That would finish everything . But perhaps the black knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the time , the breathless night , when Artie had let him guess about the body pushed into the lake . From that night , he had felt sealed to Artie ; and the whole need to take part with Artie in another such crime was perhaps a need to put himself beyond the reach of ever squealing on Artie . Could Ruth be up to it ? In the remaining days , if only days remained , to treat all of life like some Huysmansesque Black Mass ! Could she join him in a carnival of the senses ? " A penny , " she says . And with a short laugh Judd reminds himself that Ruth is neverthelessa nice girl , that this is a component part of his permitting himself to be drawn to her , as an experiment . Perhaps a girl like Myra could go into some mad final carnival , but not Ruth . So he responds to her conventional query with , " Oh , just the same old subject . " 174 Compulsion " Dat old dabbil sex , " she quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Judd makes some remark about Paris , soon  --  Paris , where they know how to make the most of such pleasures  --  and she mock-slaps his wrist , and he says well , of course , he believes in the same freedom for women as for men . Ruth begins to say , " Would you like it if I  --  " but cuts it short , and Judd says , with a show of self-surprise , " You know I do believe I would feel quite furious ; I would feel possessive about you , " and she iaughs softly . " You see , all our smart theories  --  " And there is a lapse , and she remarks that she heard his brother is getting engaged . Oh , he had meant to invite her  --  the party is Wednesday , Judd says . But is he sure it is n't meant to be strictly a family party ? Ruth asks . Perhaps she would be . . . " Oh , no ! " he insists . " It 's a big brawl . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a family party "  --  he feels suddenly peculiarly not himself to be saying a thing like this , yet tells himself he means it  --  " you must come ! " And the girl , his brother 's girl , Ruth asks , what is she like ? Has he met her ? Max met her in New York , Judd tells her ; it was one of those conventional things , a perfect match , a Mannheimer ; they do business with the old man . Their oldest brother , who lives in New York  --  Joseph  --  arranged it . The girl is said to be very nice , quite pretty . She will arrive day after tomorrow for a visit , to meet Max 's friends , and from then on Judd is sure the house will be unbearable . It will be filled with their engagement talk , and what he wants .. . Suddenly he remarks that he has often thought of simply going away , leaving home on his own , bumming around , something like Harry Kemp tramping on life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an impulse . And he continues , saying with a self-consciouslittle laugh , " Or maybe even getting married . " " Now , " Ruth says , " that is surprising . " Yes , Judd says , he has thought how it would be to have a wife and a home , but with someone quite different from his own family . Ruth says she understands how he may sometimes feel a stranger at home , because even in her own home  --  though her mother and father are angels , and her mother is very young in feeling , more like a girl friend  --  still , parents ca n't really tell you everything ; you have to find out for yourself . The Crime of Our Century 175Then Judd is speaking of his mother . An invalid for many years , she was ethereal , he says  --  she was like a Botticelli madonna  --  and within himself he goes on to say that truly she was a madonna , a virgin , and she was like Ruth  --  from Ruth there is something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself being held aloft by a virgin mother . Though he is an infant , he is a person fully developed , speaking and able to walk , and already complete in intelligence . He hears himself telling Ruth deprecatingly how he was indeed a prodigy , speaking his first words at the age of four months . She laughs softly , saying it is difficult to imagine him as a baby , and he declares he never was a baby ; he resents the idea of having been a helpless baby . Ruth has become so tender toward him ; now their talk drifts into silence , and they sit looking at the dark lake , and their faces turn with the same impulse , and there is a slow tender kiss , the lips touching without weight , simply as though they were of one being . A lovely melancholy fatedness rises in their hearts . And it seems to Judd that he has the power to make the whole deed with Artie turn nonexistent . It seems to him that he must somehow have drawn back that deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule of time . In bed that night , Judd could not summon the image of Ruth . He could not summon the madonna image of his mother . He could not summon the image of Artie . Instead there was his brother in the darkblueuniform with the brass buttons , the uniform of the military academy . He remembered when Max came home the first time in that uniform , Max , so huge , so strong , and Judd just a shaver eying him from the hallways . And he remembered , too , the morning he was still in bed and Max caught him doing it and said if he kept on , the thing would come off and he would be a girl . Then way , way back there was fat Trudy , his nursemaid , her huge mouth open , laughing , the irregular teeth , and suddenly her head swooping down , and his terror , her laughing sounds through it all , and her joking threat that he would be no more than a girl , and the torture , pleasure , torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds . . . . " I love my little boy , my little man ! " 176 CompulsionThe following morning all this was absent ; he awoke with only the strange tenderness in him . The sense of wanting to see Ruth persisted . And as he drove to school , a whole new drama was being enacted in his mind ; the play continued during class . He might perform it tomorrow at Max 's engagement party . " I have an announcement to make ! " Oh , that would be a good one on brother Max , the self-satisfied groom , with the cigar always fat in his face  --  Max , the center of attention , suddenly fadinginto the background while the startled gasping crowd listened to his kid brother . Judd had to stand on a chair for his head to rise above their shoulders , to get their attention , and he announced  --  was it his own engagement or the crime ? As he sat through the lecture his fountain pen was busy : again a hawk , the talons open , sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made , over and over in different sizes , patterns of the sun , with streamers of energy flowing out . Now , spread-winged on a cross , a great bird , an albatross . But still he was following something the instructor was saying about compound crimes  --  sometimes in compoundcrimes the lesser crime took precedence ! And Judd 's mind was already darting along a plan of argument . Suppose they traced the glasses . To him . Suppose they somehow traced the letter . His . And it was he who had rented the car . ( The cleverness of Artie ! Judd smiled inwardly in appreciation . ) But if he were caught by these items , was n't he free to make his own deal ? Suppose even now they were coming awfullyclose . Would n't it be better to confess and make a deal ? Premeditatedmurder was death . But if the kidnaping had been a prank , the death accidental , if he made a deal for a charge of manslaughter , there might be only a few years in jail . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth waiting , and coming to visit him , and waiting .. . What could you get , then , for kidnaping alone ? Judd was shading in the initials on the cross , class was ending , and he managed to walk out alongside the instructor . It was n't difficult to steer the conversation to the Kessler crime , as a striking current example of a compound crime . Suppose the criminal were apprehended , Judd asked , in preparing a defense would it not be advantageous to let him stand for the kidnaping instead of the murder ? Well , in some states , yes , that would be a distinct advantage , the instructorsaid . But in Illinois , kidnaping had quite recently been made a capital offense  --  since that miserable case of the abducted little girlThe Crime of Our Century 777assaulted in the coal cellar , the Fitzgerald case . A law had been passed . So there would be no tactical gain . " And in this crime , " said the instructor , " if they ever catch the perpetrators , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are times when law seems pointless  --  any verdict short of hanging would be corrected by a lynch mob , I imagine . " He flashed an academic smile that had in it a touch of their shared superiority to the mob . She was n't in Sleepy Hollow . Judd did n't see her on any path , walking with her books . After his next class he met Artie . They strolled across the Midway , Artie hooting about the latest stupidities of the cops  --  checking every Winton in town . They even had the car wrong ! And the two tramps and the vagabond woman who had been caught with a busted typewriter  --  nowthat was something ! And that reminded him . " How 'd you make out last night , Jocko ? Did you get in ? " " Oh , " said Judd , " it was n't that kind of a date . " Ruth was just a nice girl . Artie horse-laughed . She 'd been running around with a frat brother of his , and Sid was no chump  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been together on Friday , had n't Judd been able to see that the girl was Sid 's push ? Did he think a newspaperman would be wasting time with a girl that did n't come across ? Artie was willing to bet a ten-spot he could lay Ruth on his first date . Judd was silent . When he reached home , Aunt Bertha was already there , busily directingEmil in hanging summer curtains and draperies . It should have been done long ago ! No woman in the house ! Ah , at least this would give the house a lighter air for the big festivities tomorrow . A pity Max 's bride would n't be living here but still , she and Max were right : a young couple should have a place of their own . And suddenly Aunt Bertha fixed her eyes on Judd , examining him , coming up to him and touching his sleeve . " And how are things with you , Judd ? You 're looking worried . What can a boy like you have to worry about ? He passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week he 's running off to sow his wild oats in Europe , and he 's worried ! " He smiled . She contracted her brows . " Maybe you are in love ? " " Maybe I am , " he said , to give Aunt Bertha some excitement . " You just hate to have Max do something you ca n't do , " she remarked , pleased at her shrewdness . And with a sigh : " If only your mother had lived for this . You see , Judd , it 's the same way with sisters , too . They 're jealous of each other and still they love each other . " He kept the smile fixed on his face . Jealous of Max the Mope ! " I was jealous of your mother when she married first , " his aunt said . Then , with a streak of asperity she added , " You know something ? I was almost jealous of her for passing away first and being done with it all . " It was this in her , this cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while feel you could talk to Aunt Bertha . She might even understand the whole thing with Artie , the whole long game ; if any of them could get a glimmer of it , Aunt Bertha would be the one . No , she would put the blame on Artie , as his mother would have done . Just as they had blamed others every time he got a childhood disease . " He was exposed , he was exposed ! " Judd remembered suddenly the one year when he had gone to public school , and his mother had admonished him , " Do n't ever touch anything . You 'll get germs . Do n't sit on the toilets . You must absolutely wait until you get home , Judd dear , you understand ? They 're just common children . " And it had indeed scared him , because being sick all the time with hives and boils and eruptions on his skin , he was in horror of more hurting and more ugliness of oozing and scabs . Judd recalled how he had felt all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking him back , and the kids jeering , but keeping their distance . And in the corridors of the school , he had always tried to walk so as not to touch or be touched , until it seemed there had always been a space around him , everyone leaving him alone . Until that one day .. . " What is it ? Something bothering you ? " his aunt appealed . " You know , I may not be going to Europe , " Judd remarked . For an instant he was going to add , " I might get caught . " But instead he let the story of his love affair come out , saying he was quite interested in a new girl and might not care to leave just now . " A new girl ! And you 'd give up your trip for her ! Well , that 's reallyThe Crime of Our Century 179serious ! Tell me ! Who is she ? " Aunt Bertha was beaming with curiosity , yet there was a slight anxiety in her glance . Someone she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a shikseh ! Even with her supposedly liberal philosophy , there was this automatic horror . But Aunt Bertha covered it at once , giving him her lecture about how of course if he were truly in love with a nice gentile girl of good family , it would be no tragedy  --  there had been some good intermarriages on the South Side . Look at Artie 's mother , a Catholic . But still it was always luckier if you happened to fall in love with someone from your own background  --  like Max going to New York and meeting a wonderful girl at his brother 's , a Mannheimer , too ! But suddenly she halted , eying him with new apprehension . It was n't some little tramp like that one he nearly got into trouble with last year , a pickup ? Judd shook his head . " This is serious , I assure you . " Then he told her about Ruth , a brilliant student . Her family were respectable little people ; her father owned a drugstore . " Russian Jews , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , there could be worse tragedies . " But you 're so young , Judd , a brilliant boy . Your father would be disappointed if  --  " If he did n't get the best , a high-class GermanJewishfamily , a Straus girl , a Mannheimer . Then his aunt observed that perhaps the trip would really be the best thing . If he found himself still interested in the girl when he returned , and if she would wait until he got through Harvard Law SchoolWait . The word instantly brought an image ; he was coming out of prison , his hair white at the temples , and Ruth was waiting at the gate , her dear face softened with years of faithfulness . Then a gush of grief came up in Judd , almost breaking out as tears , and at the same time he chided himself in disgust for this cheap sentimentality . With her eyes still on his face , his aunt had caught the passing emotion . " It 'll be all right , Judd . It 's youth , youth . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . At dinner everything centered on Max . All the arrangements were reviewed again , to the last detail , for the arrival of his girl and for the engagement party . Uncle Adolph permitted himself some smutty jokesr8o Compulsionabout Max 's impatience , with advice about what to do during the engagementperiod  --  " put it in the icebox "  --  and even the old man laughed indulgently . Max carried it all off with a large air of tolerance . There was talk of honeymoon plans . " Kid , we might even meet you in Italy . " And Judd was squirming more and more at this smugness , while at the same time a choking self-pity was in him . " Never for me , never anything so ordinary and simple as happiness . " Then he took an inward vow  --  if he were n't caught , if he got away with the thing , it would be a sign , an omen for him to marry Ruth and be conventional all his life . They were sitting down for a little family game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dopey pleasure in the ritual , perhaps for the last time . Then Artie burst in . Ignoring Max 's invitation  --  " Sit , sit down . You can play if you do n't start those wild stakes of yours "  --  Artie shouted , waving his long arms , " Jocko , you 've got to see this ! They 're tearing up the whole street where Steger lives ! The sewer is stuffed up ! They think he shoved the clothes down there . " " Steger ? " It took the family a moment to think back to poor Paulie Kessler . " But I understood they let that teacher go , " Max said . " They arrested him again . " Artie could hardly keep the laughter out of his voice . Judd hurried him from the house . " Like a couple of kids to a fire , " he heard his aunt say as they rushed out . The street was blocked off , and lights had been brought up , flaring over the small area where the crew chopped away at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the faces around , three , four rows of them , and cast shadows over groups lingering on the sidewalk , all the way to the corner . " We should have thought of this too , " Artie whispered . " Stuffing the clothes down there . " Getting out of the car , Artie remarked that this was a good place to pick up some gash  --  easy to start a conversation . " How about those two ? " Then began the game of undressing the girls with their eyes . That one 's bones would go through you ; that other one  --  look at her blotches  --  she 's got syph , sure . Artie pushed up against a pair and in great innocence asked what wasThe Crime of Our Century r8rgoing on , requiring a full explanation of the Kessler case . " Hey , do n't you even read the newspapers ? " He gave them the bootlegger act . " We 've been up to the border for a shipment . " Judd tugged , getting him away . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped at him . " Their teeth were bad , " Judd said . " Oh Christ , just for a lay , you examine a twat as if you 're going to marry her . " He started on another pair , cute ones , full blown , with knowinglooks . By this time Judd felt almost uncontainably excited . The peculiar feeling of tension , of expectancy about seeing Ruth , with which he had awakened that morning , seemed to have been multiplying progressivelyall day until now it was a general uncontainable lust . If being in love with one girl should make you lose your want for any others , then , he told himself , he was certainly the opposite of other men , and with far greater needs . The presence of Artie had excited him even more than always ; from the moment Artie came into the house , the need had been unbearable . And now it was the pressure of the bodies , Artie 's among them , until all the bodies seemed Artie 's , and something even more , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust , the smutty things they were talking about . And perhaps compressed with it all , with Max 's engagement and the marriage talk , there was the danger in being here within arm 's reach of dozens of policemen . A cop was right in front of the girls , and Artie , instead of drawing the girls aside , started a conversation with the officer . This time Artie was an ex-pupil of Steger 's , sure that the police were on the right track . Pressed against the girls and against Artie , and tormented by the tumultuous raging need , Judd could have torn the bastard apart . " Come on , " he urged Artie . But there was no moving him . " They 're just getting there ! " Artie exclaimed . And someone wisecracked that the diggers had found a dead skunk . No , Artie said , it was a five-month baby ! With a shocked gasp , the girls walked off . Artie pressed after them , loudly telling tales about the dreadful things women did  --  women were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , the way they were made , they had their own sewer pipe . And in that moment Judd recalled a chart in a drugstore window , 182 Compulsionfirst seen in childhood , with square-angled pipes going through a crosssectionof a human body , a woman 's . And was there a baby curled in one part , or had he seen that in a medical book ? But the picture remained in his mind , ugly , horrible . Yes , what was a female , down there , but a mess of sewer pipe ! A nausea came over him ; he backed out of the crowd . That nursemaid , Trudy , a . d even his mother , and even Ruth , the way a baby was made in there  --  no , it was too disgusting , too filthy in there . Females ! He leaned against the car , feeling weak and ill . Just then Artie spotted me in the group of reporters talking to the captain . He waved and pushed his way to me . " Anything new on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circles , " I said . " They 're even listening to a medium ! " I told him about that crazy phone call . " She predicted a confession on Friday . " " That 's only the day after tomorrow , " Artie said . " Want to bet on it ? " I said I would n't be sorry if it happened ; I had n't had any sleep for a week . " You 'd better watch out . Judd is making time on you , he 's stealing your girl , " Artie said . We all laughed , and as they pulled away Artie blew the horn . Judd was annoyed by that last remark ; it was a night when everything that Artie did or said rubbed him the wrong way . And yet this only heightened his need . He was sure Artie was teasing him . They ended up in a cat house , Judd agreeing to go just to get the stuff out of his system . But when the moment came when he always imagined himself doing it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The act itself lasted longer , and for a time he imagined a wedding scene  --  Ruth in white , a shining bride , coming toward him . He would not picturehimself doing it to her . There came back the scene on the beach , and then a kind of blank grief was in him , and , at his climax , a dreadful trembling , a sense of tumbling , like giants crashing in a circus act . Going home , Artie was half potted . Judd still felt querulous ; the postTheCrime of Our Century 183coital compound of disgust and remorse was on him , and with it some dreadful unidentifiable anticipation . Artie started to tease him about Ruth , making cracks . " Did you think of her when you threw it in ? That 's a test . The girl you think of is the one you love . " " Shut up , " Judd said . " Wow , " said Artie . " This is getting serious . " " Aaw , cut the crap ! " He looked at Artie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the way he had seen it the very first time when his mother brought him over to Artie 's house : he saw it as long-jawed and pasty . A tumult of revulsions and fears raced through Judd ; everything , everything in the whole past of creation was wrong . In that moment he knew Artie , knew him objectively , as a being apart from himself . He was momentarily freed of longing , and it passed through Judd 's mind that Artie was demonic . In the thing that they had done , they had not been doing the same thing . Artie had been doing something else , something he had done before , like the one in the lake , and the ones Artie had made dark hints about  --  the campus fellow who had been found shot , the taxi driver found castrated . Artie was driven by some demonic force , and in himself it was not the same . Had everything , then , been a gargantuan mistake ? When he had believed himself to be participating , joining with Artie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If that could be so , then what  --  what had he been doing there ? The possibility was a gasping void . Judd closed it out of his mind , and yet found it continuing into another thought : when people imagined they could be immersed together performing the act of love together , it was also like that : each was doing a separate thing . Judd was silent the rest of the way home . Artie once or twice took gulps from the flask , then brooded . He got off at his house , saying in no obvious connection , " All right for you , you shit . " The tumultuous sense of some impending change , something tre-:nendously imminent , remained in Judd through half the night . He could not analyze it , though he attached it to Ruth , Ruth . In the morn-z8  --  Compulsioning the feeling was still with him , and with it he felt a compulsion to talk . If he met Ruth , he would perhaps babble out everything . Instead , he found himself talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse he was visiting a young married woman , a member of his birding class . She was one of the more interested ones , or at least she pretended a serious interest  --  a nice-looking young matron , Mrs. Cyrilla Sloan  --  and his excuse for ringing her apartment bell on South Shore was the delivery of a book he had promised her . It had come upon him , that morning , that he must leave no promise unfulfilled ; it was as though he were propitiating the nonexistent gods of luck . And maybe he had always felt that Mrs. Sloan was encouraging him to make her . Just after his ten-o'clock class , he found her looking morning-fresh , neat ; Ruth would be a young wife like that , a secret bird in her nice neat little package of an apartment . Mrs. Sloan offered him coffee , drew him into conversation . He must be looking forward to going abroad and then going to Harvard . And presently Judd was talking in a rush , more easily than to Aunt Bertha , saying he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps he would get a job as a teacher instead of going to law school . Of course , this might displease his father , but " Do n't tell me you 've fallen in love , Judd ! " She smiled warmly as though she now understood his sudden visit . She wanted to know all about the girl , surely a very remarkable girl , to attract a man with a brain like his ! And as he described Ruth , Judd became convinced it was really love  --  he wanted only to be with Ruth ; all the tumult in him was the result of some complete change-over . She kept smiling , letting him talk , telling him that she was glad he had found someone to be interested in , that she had always felt he needed someone . But he must n't be too emotional , she said ; he must n't let his emotions run away with him . For now he was talking about getting married secretly , about going away somewhere to live . After all , the young matron said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must not assume they would be opposed to her . Even if she was from a . . . less selective background , after all , she was a university girl . The tumult in him was subsiding a little . Judd had no idea why heThe Crime of Our Century 185had made up all these things about family opposition , going so far with the drama . But he felt easier now , felt somehow that he was beginning to know about women  --  they were n't all so stupid . It was another kind of sense that they had . It seemed to him that she held his hand lingeringly , perhaps invitingly , as he was leaving . Only by telling her he was in love he had caused her to change toward him . It was as though he had inadvertently used a password for the closed little world of ordinary people . As he came out of the apartment building Judd felt relieved , eased as never even by intercourse . He heard himself whistling . He spied Ruth with a little group in Sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowd would begin to talk of them as a pair . It was an idyllic scene . Someone had left a newspaper lying on the grass , and after the first glimpse of the headlines , Judd made himself avoid looking at it . They were still churning , churning over the city . But he would be safe . He was changing ; he had to be safe to find out what he was going to be like . The house had a different atmosphere ; there were plants all around , huge green potted palms and rubber plants , and there were vases filled with flowers . Against an entire wall of the so-called library were the catering tables . Cases of real stuff from Canada were stowed in readiness under the boards . Max , hustling everywhere , showed Judd all this while telling him what a good buy he had got on the liquor , and that Sandra would be down in a minute ; she was resting . Then , as though she had sensed the young brother 's arrival , Sandra appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been thought out in advance so that every word was precise . But as he had expected , her remarks had the utmost banality . " So this is the genius of the family , " she said , offering her hand and pressing his for a second , with proper sincerity . " I wonder if you know how proud your brothers are of your accomplishments ! I understand you speak eleven languages . " She stood alongside Max , who was smiling fondly at her  --  the perfect picture of an engaged couple . I86 CompulsionMax said that Sandra was interested in literature , especially the French , so they would have much in common . Judd tried her quickly , mentioning Huysmans , Verlaine , Anatole France . She had not read any of them  --  if she had even heard of them  --  but she declared she would make a mental note to look them up , and you could see her inscribing the titles on her mind . She had made a study at college of Balzac . She had not even read Baudelaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd had a sense that it was he who appeared to have failed . Max was looking at them almost desperately , wanting everything to be right and fine , and Judd even felt a surge of warmth toward his brother on this day . " Looks like it 'll be some party ! " he remarked stupidly , and suddenly wished nothing would go wrong . If they were going to catch him , let Max have his dumb engagement party first , unspoiled . The dinner was in grand style , the full table , all the aunts and uncles , and the old man at his best , even genial , with cigars like huge bullets in all his pockets , and everybody toasting happiness  --  a real feast of the high bourgeoisie , Judd told himself , and when he went to fetch Ruth he prepared her in that vein . She looked as if she belonged perfectly in the crowd , he was surprised to find  --  her dress , shoes , all . She was as shining as any girl at the party . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Bertha gave Ruth her knowing scrutiny , then told him privately , " I do n't blame you  --  she 's charming . This time you ca n't be blamed . " Then she added conspiratorially , " You have n't told anybody ? Nobody knows ? " " I have n't told even her , " he said . He felt gay , suddenly crazily elated . The whole South Side was there , all right , the Weisses and the Strauses in force , including Artie 's entire family . The moment Artie came in he began to make a noisy play for Ruth  --  " I saw her first ! " Then Judd had a peculiar feeling , as if everything he had been building up in the last few days about himself and Ruth was an act ; in Artie 's presence it all fell apart . Artie was taunting Ruth about that reporter , Sid . Did Sid know Judd was giving her the big rush ? " Oh , Sid 's so busy I ca n't even see himThe Crime of Our Century 187to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the crime again , full of the latest reports , and  --  hey , here was an idea for her boy friend , the reporter . What about the other unsolved killings on the South Side during the last year ? That university student who had been shot , and the young man who had disappeared , just a few blocks from here , in April , Perry Rosoff  --  maybe the same fiend was responsible for them all ! She ought to tell Sid to investigate the connection . Myra appeared just then , touched Artie 's arm , and they started dancing . Judd danced with Ruth , feeling he was dancing better than ever in his life . Even Myra was behaving half decently to him tonight . Later they were all at the punchbowl . Ruth was flushed . Judd was becoming somewhat drunk . Again , everybody was around Artie , talking about the crime . Judd signaled , trying to shut Artie up . But it was as though his excitement flashed between Artie and Ruth in an alternating current . Perversely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard himself laughing loudly at a monkey-gland joke about the castrated taxi driver . He was losing control of himself . In sudden need of escape , he went upstairs . A moment later he realized Ruth had followed him . So this was his room . " How strange , " she said . " It is n't like a room to be lived in at all . " It was so like a museum , with all these birds in their display cases . The collection was the work of ten years , he told her " But , Judd , " she said , " were n't you ever a boy ? " The word shocked him . What did she mean ? Of course it was a thing boys did , collecting insects and birds . But the way he had done it , so seriously . " I just meant , you never seem to have had a real childhood . Always so precocious . " Her words , peculiarly , affected his lachrymal glands , misted his eyes . Judd did n't let anything show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with risque illustrations . But scarcely glancing at them , Ruth said , " You know , Judd , I can see you must feel all alone in your family . They 're not at all like you  --  your father and brother . " She understood him , she understood him truly , he told himself ; she was the first one , the only one . Then he felt a sweep of panic . He must get out , get out with her , escape ! No , he was becoming intoxicated ; he had been drinking since afternoon , mixing whisky with champagne. 188 CompulsionBut Artie was certainly going to give everything away  --  he should stay and watch Artie ! No , it was hopeless ; he should flee . " Let 's get away from this , " he said . " Let 's go somewhere . " Ruth would perhaps have wanted to stay  --  longer at the party , yet in another sense she was an outsider . It was really an affair of the big South Side millionaire families , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam . If she were to become truly close to Judd , if anything really developed between them , then she would have to be brought into his circle in some other way ; she would not slip in by means of a crowd . In the car he put his arm around her and they laughed . Being outside , away from those gasping , grinning faces , Judd felt all right again . He tried to think of a place to go  --  perhaps this was even a night for consummation ; he should have brought a suitcase just in case . The way Artie said he always did . Judd turned west ; out on the Cicero road there was a place with a dance floor and booths . Maybe even rooms upstairs . They danced . Then they were sitting and talking intently , again about love . Judd began sardonically : " My brother and that self-satisfied girl of his  --  could people like that really be in love ? " Ruth brought him down neatly . Could someone as conceited as he be in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and smiled , and then she said the essence of love was completely knowing each other . She hoped if she ever loved someone , they would always tell each other everything , no matter what they did , even infidelities . Her words were banal , Judd told himself  --  she was after all ordinary  --  and yet the tug of her was more powerful than ever . He told himself that the two of them really looked like an ordinary nice college couple . Was that what he wanted so much , wanted to tears ? To acquiesce in the commonplace , and to be two people who tried telling each other everything , everything ? Something far inside him was laughing . It was as though he were with Artie , laughing at the sight of Judd sitting here with this girl . Then a thought came , one of those awfully simple things you suddenly recognize , things that everyone else must always have known . To experienceeverything , to experience every possibility of life  --  why , that includednot only the unusual , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crime of Our Century 189have included the other side too ; the other range of experience should have come first . How could he , now ? How could he ever experience the most everyday common feelings , love and truth , with a girl like this ? How could he know whether after all this common thing might not be the most important of all ? An overwhelming sense of deprivation came to him because of what he had missed , what the simplest stupe , a prosaic soul like Max , could possess and enjoy . And he had gone too far away now ever to secure it . Why had he not at least tried that ordinary experiencebefore he went this far ? In the dim pink lamplight , Judd knuckled his eyes , as if he had a headache . Ruth suspected there were tears . But why ? Why ? " Is something very wrong ? " " Yes , " he said . " Tell me . " " I ca n't . " And Ruth began to feel that it was more than youthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they assume a Hamletmoodiness and seek comforting . This was something serious and real . But what evil could she know ? Seeing Judd so profoundly depressed , there came to her only the dread bogeys of childhood fantasies , used to explain any threat of great sorrow . They were the primal threats of girlish imaginings . What would I do if I loved a man and there was insanity in the family ? There even appeared the specter of the ghastly disease : perhaps he had caught syphilis in his running around with Artie . But she cleared all that away . There could be nothing wrong in the family since his brother was getting engaged , and another brother in New York was married . And in this modern age diseases were curable . No , perhaps much more reasonably Judd was still disturbed about the occurrence on the beach . Being alone with her like this , that powerful male sexual desire that boys had to cope with , so much more powerful a desire than women 's , must be upon him again . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perhaps afraid it would again force him to do something that would spoil things . But ugly as the moment had been , Ruth wanted to comfort Judd , to tell him she understood . What girl had not sensed similar things ? Sometimes in dancing close , men pressed their sex against you and then could not control themselves , until you felt the small convulsion in their bodies , and sensed something in their190 Compulsionclothes , poor helpless creatures . But what could people do ? These were the compelling things of nature , and especially if you loved  --  if you began to have a feeling for a man  --  you only sympathized with him for it . True , that moment on the beach had had another kind of strangeness , disturbing , for an instant even terrifying , but Judd had mastered himself for her sake , and in a sense that made Ruth feel he did respect her . If he was " different , " even moodier than Sid , this was perhaps what attracted her ; this was the challenge of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinary girl , an extraordinary woman , to be equal to a man like Judd . And he had never found one , he had been so lonesome . Now perhaps she could give him the first happy feeling of true friendship , and even love might develop . " Judd , " she said , " if it 's something about me , you must n't worry . " You 'd never hurt me . " He shook his head . " I know I 'd hurt you . I 'd make you miserable . " She touched his hand , and moved her head forward with the tender smile of a woman who has no wish to belittle a man 's suffering but yet sees that other times will come . " Let 's dance , " she said . Then later , I picture them sitting in a car in a small woods along the Desplaines River . The despondency has come over Judd again , even more darkly . Between kisses , Ruth chides him , " But , Judd , what 's so terrible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what you want out of life . " " You do n't know , " he says . " I just feel  --  " Gradually she begins to feel his hurt , to feel it powerfully , deeply , to know that there is something more , some unknowable sorrow stemmingperhaps even from the brilliance of his mind  --  his mind apprehendingsome fated evil that ordinary people can not see , some inescapableworld sorrow . And Ruth begins to believe that anything , anything must be done to assuage such a hurt , a hurt that comes only from very life itself . If sexual release may lift away even a little of this dreadful pain in man , then the whole structure of purity becomes meaningless . She wants , wants to help him , by some magic womanly touch to dispel his ache . Yet it is not her ignorance or even her own innocence , she feels sure , that impedes her . This trouble of his is something uncommon , asThe Crime of Our Century 191Judd is uncommon . This intensity of pain is not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her bosom . " Tell me , tell me , " she whispers , desperate over her own inadequacy  --  a girl trying to play the role of a woman . He is silent , caught in some bleak indescribable horror ; it is surely the life-horror that comes over people at times . Her dress has small buttons all down the front , and in a chaotic wish to help him , Ruth undoes the buttons and draws down the edge of her chemise . His cheek rests against her bare breast . As it touches her , Ruth feels a warm pulse through her entire body , and in her sex , and she wonders whether now , now she will become a woman . His lips touch , and she wishes that her body could draw from him all the hurt , all the grief of living . She places her hand on his head . She feels a slight shudder going through his body . Is he weeping ? Judd sees the boy . For the first time , he sees the face of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nighttime water . And staring at him with a child 's unblinking candor , the face becomes his own . Ruth is white-faced . She sits utterly still . And she hears Judd say , " I wish I had never been born . " The words stagger Ruth ; there is a strangeness in the intonation . It is not the way people usually say this . She can only press his head tightly , feeling in herself a great distress that she can not help this man , a great tugging to relieve his suffering , and a frightened wonder  --  can this be love ? Judd puts his hand on the gearshift . With an effort of will , he starts the car . Once the machine is in movement it is easier . He even is able to tell himself he has done a noble thing . He could have had Ruth tonight , and he refrained . Perhaps it will count , in a kind of bargain exchange with his fate . Perhaps it will help him not to get caught . ON THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seen-lore spectacle owners  --  Judd was telling Artie how he had made Ruth . Describing the seduction , Judd assured himself he was talking that way only to keep himself from really talking about her to Artie . So he told how he had lifted her out of the car . Artie 's face wore a loose , skeptical look ; no one was taking him in . That meant he was believing it . " You bastard ! " Artie cried . " Why did n't you take me along ? You know I always had my eye on her ; I knew she was tail . Let 's the two of us get her tonight  --  " Judd shrugged . For one thing he was n't interested in her any more , he said . " Okay , you bullshitter . I do n't believe you ever Iaid her . " That was when the maid came in to say some gentlemen wished to see Judd . Artie and Judd were in the library playing casino , not even for money ; the debris of the engagement party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its horses , and the cases of empty bottles underneath . Now Artie sank far down in his chair , holding his cards in front of his face . Two Iarge men entered . Obviously they were not entirely at ease in this imposing house . Their hands hung stiffly . " Who is Judah Steiner , Jr. ? " Judd arose . Let Artie see he could handle it . After all , he had been through it once ; Artie had n't . He had faced the police and got away with it . Now Artie would see him do it again . " What can I do for you gentlemen ? " Judd said . " The state 's attorney wants to talk to you , Mr. Steiner . We 'll take you downtown . " " Is this about the Kessler case ? " he said blandly , watching their faces . One of them reacted as though he had been handed a confession . The other looked suspicious . " Huh ? " he said . " Well , I 'd be glad to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already talked to Captain Cleary out in the South Chicago station last Saturday . " 192The Crime of Our Century 193 " Captain Cleary ? " They exchanged glances . Perhaps , mentally , the detective was already crossing him off the suspect list , and cursing at the duplicated effort . " Yes , " Judd said . " Out there where the poor kid was found . I go birdingout there , and the captain asked me if I could help out , give him any ideas as to who might habitually visit the swamp out there . " The impassive look came back over their faces . Then this was more . This time it must be the spectacles . The second detective said , " We do n't know about all that . We 're just supposed to  --  " "  --  bring me in , " Judd said easily , and they all chuckled . " Sure , let 's go . " He glanced toward Artie . All kinds of things were on Artie 's face . It was almost the way Artie looked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening , and was n't really taking part . " Artie , " Judd said , " would you tell my folks , should they want to know my whereabouts ? " Then he introduced the cops . " This is Artie Straus , a friend of mine , Mr.  --  " " McNamara , " the first one introduced himself . The other said his name was Peterson . A third dick was at the wheel of the car . Judd sat in the rear with McNamara . He offered cigarettes . No conversation started , so he tried the Carpentier fight as an opener . The cop thought the Frenchman would win . He hoped he could get there , but he might be busy . " This case is keeping you on the go , I 'll bet . " " You said it . " " Perhaps it will be solved by then . " The dick said nothing . This was more serious than last Saturday , Judd felt sure . But assume they did have the glasses traced to him . Or suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fingerprints ? Anything . The telltale atoms in the universe . Each atom left its trace . But apparently they still had nothing on Artie . Artie should stay out unless caught . There was the wish for Artie to be with him , and a sly kind of counterwish , to be alone , to suffer punishment that would make him worthy of Ruth . No , no sentiment . It was his mistake . The glasses in his pocket where they could fall out. ' 94 CompulsionHe was a stoic . He knew that all in the end was fated badly . A man should combat the putridity of life to the limit . Therefore he would go through everything without changing , without breaking . He would show himself consistent in his beliefs . Even to the execution . But not Artie . Not Artie , dead . A wave of emotion returned as from some far distance , engulfing and washing out everything Judd might have felt for Ruth , his silly puppy love of the last few days , making him ashamed of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had loathed Artie 's face . He saw Artie now , the laughing , easy collegeguy whom everyone loved  --  Artie standing at Judd Steiner 's execution , watching , talking with clever pity about the poor Judd he had known , a deranged genius . With the old quick pleasure , Judd saw himself on a scaffold , his hands tied behind him  --  on the scaffold as on a platform where slaves were sold in ancient times , sold or executed . Multitudes stood below , and great , immortal words of parting came from him , his legacy to mankind . Ruth would weep . Crap . He would not be defeated , not by such clods as were beside him , like this beefy McNamara , a bull stuffed into a human suit of clothes . Now was the real test ; now he would outwit everyone . Now was the chance to prove to himself that he was of another mental caliber , of anotherorbit entirely . When the car stopped in front of the La Salle Hotel , Judd was surprised . The men escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all nothing . " We 've got a suite here , " Peterson offered . " The state 's attorney do n't want to expose people , you know , if the papers get hold of it . " It was a dead giveaway , then . They did n't have anything for sure . The outcome depended on himself . It was not only to protect innocent people from publicity that Horn had moved over to the hotel . There had been no such consideration for other suspects during the previous week . The schoolteachers , the crazy drug clerk , the unemployed architect who owned a Winton  --  they had all been thrown to us , as though to stop our mouths . But after that frustrating , killing week , here was at last a hard clue . And Horn wasThe Crime of Our Century 195simply at nerves ' end . His staff was exhausted . He did n't want any distraction while he dealt with this one good lead . Because if this one petered out , the case seemed hopeless . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad if the case remained unsolved . But in the midst of the work , I doubt if the state 's attorney , any more than we reporters , thought predominantly of an effect on elections . All of us , including the police , were much more deeply embroiled . We were struggling with the first and lifelong problem of man  --  to find out how things happen . Now , from the optometrist , Horn had three names . Only three pairs of glasses of this prescription , encased in this new , expensive brand of frame , had been sold in Chicago . Those three names could bring only bafflement and dismay to the prosecutor . One was a middle-aged lady piano teacher , who lived on the North Side . The other was a fairly prominent accountant . The third was the son of a millionaire , living in the Kessler neighborhood . The piano teacher was quickly eliminated . Her glasses were on her nose . The accountant had been out of town for the past three weeks . He had his glasses with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone designated by the authorities . That left Judah Steiner , Jr . A last chance . It might all blow away in a fizzle , this great clue of the spectacles . Maybe the glasses came from some other town . In the inner room of the suite , Horn gave his instructions . With his characteristic , choppy motion of the elbows , he emphasized that this had to be it . He would n't have a trick remain untried even if the youth were the son of the mayor himself . Horn left the preliminaries to Joe Padua . He would hold himself in reserve . Padua had a liquid voice and liquid eyes , a touch of Rudy Valentino in the fluid way he moved . He was a tripper , because he could go along , polite and soft-toned , and then , in the conventional manner of a stage prosecutor , suddenly turn cold and murderous , a gun . So Judd was brought up the elevator and into the suite . Joe Padua introduced himself , and his handshake was affable . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a graduate of John Marshall or one of those downtown diploma mills . At once , Judd told of his interview with Captain Cleary . Padua , too , he saw , had known nothing of it . Glibly , Judd repeated how he frequently took his birding classes to196 Compulsionthat very area . He was sure he felt his opponent 's hostility shrinking . The glasses might have been lost out there at any time . Nevertheless , Padua tried . " We just wanted to ask you , Mr. Steiner , you do wear glasses ? " " Well , as I told Captain Cleary  --  in fact , I left a statement in writing with him  --  I did wear glasses for a while , when I was boning . " He put on a you-know-how-it-is smile . " I 'm studying law , and this is quite interesting to me , my first practical contact ; but as I was saying , the readingcan get pretty heavy . " " Do n't I know . " Padua gave him back the smile . " I was getting headaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition disappeared a few months ago . " " You stopped boning ? " Judd chuckled . " Well , it 's curious , I still read just as much , but in any case the headaches ceased , so I do n't believe I 've made use of the glasses in two or three months . " " I see . " Padua picked up the glasses from the table , one of those hotelroomwriting tables that look like vanities , and handed them to Judd . " Are these yours ? " Judd felt them against his hand , with that sense of natural contact given by a familiar possession . He put them on . " Well , " he said , " I would say they were mine , if I were n't sure that mine are at home right now . " He laughed shortly . " That is , unless someone swiped them , though I ca n't imagine why . " If it went that far he could suggest a whole flood of possibilities . He might have left his glasses at the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He was certainly safe if he played it right , because with this bit of evidence alone  --  and it was clear it was all they had  --  they would n't dare go to court . Not against a son of Judah Steiner ! " You say your glasses are at home ? " " Why , yes . As I have n't worn them for months . " He turned to McNamara , who was sitting by the door . " If you 'd have mentioned it at my house , I 'd have produced them for you . " " Well  --  " Padua smiled  --  " it wo n't take long to pick them up . " McNamara arose from the chair . Judd placed the glasses on the desk . " I believe mine are a very commonprescription , " he said , and then checked himself . He did n't want toThe Crime of Our Century 197seem to have been thinking about the case . Could it be possible that they had called in everyone in town with glasses of that prescription ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some other factor leading to him . What could it be ? He smiled at his questioner , and made an abortive gesture to shake hands on leaving . But Padua did n't stand up , did n't reach out his hand . As he left with McNamara , Judd felt that he had not exactly won the first round . A draw . He felt subdued . In any case , he decided , he ought not to talk so much . Just treat the whole thing as an understandable nuisance . He thought over the interview . It was a little disturbing that his antagonist had been so brief . Why had n't they asked for his alibi ? Or perhaps that was on the good side . As for the glasses , perhaps Almer Coe had recognized them in some way as their product . Even so , a big firm like Almer Coe must have sold hundreds of the same prescription . Would Artie still be in the house ? Perhaps he had fled . Artie could run up to Charlevoix , take his boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had so often dreamed of doing . Perhaps they should both have beat it up there , and they would be living there together now , hermits bound together for the rest of their lives . Max had just come home ; he was dressing to take his fiancee to the theater . Judd explained curtly , annoyed with Max for being there , " These men are from the state 's attorney 's office . It seems the glasses found in the Kessler case are similar to mine . They 've been checking all the people who have similar glasses . " Max blinked once or twice , as though uncertain whether to take an insulted attitude toward the authorities or make a gag of it . " I 'm just going to get my glasses and show them , " Judd said . " They 're in my room . " But McNamara and Peterson followed him upstairs . On entering the room , the detective was startled . " What 's this , a museum ? " Judd explained that he was an ornithologist . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him . He was now someone queer . Trying to recover , he made an effort to impress the detective , telling him this was the most complete collection in the Midwest , and that he had a special permit to shoot specimens , even in the city parks . The man 's dumb-animal stare altered . A glint of respect had come into it. 198 CompulsionMeanwhile Judd made a show of looking among his papers , on his desk . Then he opened a few drawers . " I have n't used them for such a long time  --  " At the second drawer he said , " Oh , here ! " He picked up the spectacle case , then held it in his hand with a puzzled look . McNamara took the empty case from him , as though he had expected something like this . " I ca n't imagine  --  " Judd frowned . " They must be around here somewhere . " He poked aside a pile of books . The maid had come to the door . " Have you seen my glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used them for some time . I ca n't imagine where I left them last . " " Why , no , " she said . " Did you look downstairs in the library ? " He never read in the library . The last one who read there had been his mother ; not a book had been added since . Frowning , Judd started downstairs , to make a show of it . " There was a mob in here yesterday ; we had an engagement party , " he remarked . " A lot of our friends got tight and turned the house upside down . " McNamara nodded but did not at once follow him to the stairs . It swept through Judd 's mind that they would search his room . In that moment he tried to visualize everything that was in his desk , every scrap of paper . The ransom letter had been typed on stationery bought outside . The envelope was not from his stock , either . No , the place was safe . And yet he felt uneasy . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that be bad , arousing suspicion ? But McNamaraturned away from the desk and came downstairs . The other one , Peterson , still stood there . Judd made a big show of searching the library , the living room , irked as they followed him from room to room . Peterson had come down , finally ; he remained aloof , but McNamara seemed to want to be helpful , picking up a magazine here and there as if expecting to find the glasses underneath . Or was he a cagey brute , using this means to rub it in ? Judd said , " Well , I really ca n't explain it . I must have lost them somewhere without realizing it . " Max , all dressed up , ready to leave , appeared in the hallway . " Look , kid , what 's this all about ? " " Ca n't you see ! " Judd snapped . " I 'm looking for my glasses . " " Well , so you lost your glasses , so what ? " And to the detectives MaxThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he checked himself . " Of course , I realize you have to go through with it and make a thorough checkup . But " " I 'll have to go downtown with them again , " Judd said , " and explain . " " Say  --  " Max half laughed at the idea of even having to make such a statement , but he told the detectives , " anyone you want to vouch for the kid here  --  why , judge Wagner is a friend of my father 's . I understand , I 've read in the papers , the Judge has been very helpful to the Kessler family . Now , Judge Wagner 's known Judd since he was a kid . Why do n't you give him a ring ? " " Well , that would depend on them downtown , " McNamara said . " Do you want me to come along , Judd ? " Max offered . " Why , no ! What for ? " Judd was smiling again , but his hostility to his brother was rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Judge Wagner a buzz if there 's any complication , " Max repeated . Now on the drive downtown the silence was ominous . Whatever he thought of saying might be interpreted the wrong way . Judd remarked only that he hoped his carelessness was n't going to keep them working very late . It was all right , they said ; they were used to it . McNamara asked about the birds , and Judd started to talk enthusiastically . " A kind of hobby ? " the policeman inquired . " Well , it 's more than that . " And he gave them examples of puzzling things about migration and mating . Perhaps all this would show them he was unworried . The hotel room looked messier . The men had had sandwiches and coffee sent up ; plates and cups were scattered on desks and chairs . As they looked up toward him , Judd had a schoolboyish sense of shame , as though he had struck out . McNamara handed the empty spectacles case to Padua . " He could n't find the glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his desk , slipped them into the case . He made nothing special of the little action , but , gesturingwith the same hand , introduced Judd to an older man . " This is Mr. Horn , the state 's attorney , " Padua said . On first sight , Horn had a way of confusing people . He was not so much ugly as odd-looking ; his face was exactly half-moon in shape , with200 Compulsion The Crime of Our Century 201a tiny , almost caved-in nose . His torso was bulky , his legs were very short , his movement was abrupt . And his voice had a shrill , rather femininepitch . Horn 's presence had intensity . There was never anything relaxed about him . He had an intensity , I suppose , beyond his capacity ; otherwisehe would have become a very important man . The drive was there . " Do you want to admit now that these are your glasses ? " he demanded in his shrill voice . Judd retained his schoolboy smile . " I do n't want to admit anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Horn went in again . " You know this looks serious , Mr. Steiner . " " Indeed I do , " Judd said . " It 's quite embarrassing . They may even be my glasses . But after all , my family is quite well known . Judge Wagner is a friend of the Kesslers and he knows me quite well " " Do you want to talk to Judge Wagner ? " Horn said . " Well , he could tell you something about me . " " All right . " Horn tilted his head to Padua . " Let 's get Judge Wagner on the line . " They all subsided into a kind of neutrality while Padua tried the Judge 's home , and finally reached him at the Kesslers . Padua handed the phone to Judd . " Judge Wagner , " he began , " this is Judah Steiner , Jr . . . . Yes , fine , thank you . I 'm calling you in rather unusual circumstances , from the state 's attorney 's office , or rather his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose glasses resemble those found in the Kessler case , and mine happen to fit . Well , I thought , or my brother Max thought , you might want to say a word  --  " Smiling , he handed the phone to Horn . The least it could do , Judd told himself , was to keep them from pulling any rough stuff . If they did n't lay hands on him , he was sure he could ride it through . Charles Kessler leaned close in to Judge Wagner , listening . Their faces had the same expression , troubled , disappointed and yet persistent . Of all they had hoped for , when the glasses would be identified , only this had come. judge Wagner repeated that Judd was a brilliant boy , a Phi Beta Kappa at seventeen , a law student , and the son of one of the most respectedmen in Hyde Park . " Still , you have your investigation to make , " he said . " Let justice take its course . " Sighing as he hung up , he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some kind of accidental coincidence . " Horn replaced the receiver , musing . Padua turned to Judd , as with a new thought . " Tell us this , Mr. Steiner  --  Judah " " My friends call me Judd . " " Well , Judd , if I may  --  you say you 've been out to the field there , in Hegewisch ? " " I should say a couple of hundred times . As I told Captain Cleary , I was out there quite recently , the Sunday before this awful event . I even remembered running across the mouth of the culvert there . I was trying to get a shot at a species of crane , and I tripped . " " You tripped ? " They were all staring at him . " Why yes , I recall it distinctly . " He waited for one of them to make the connection , and Padua obliged . " You could have dropped your glasses then ? " " Well , it does n't seem probable . I do n't recall bringing them along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months . Unless  --  " he reflected "  --  unless I had quite simply left them in the pocket of my jacket and entirelyforgotten they were there . " They all looked at each other . A chubby , silent one , in a corner , taking notes , he did n't like . " Well , " Padua said , with that impersonal air of having to go on until every detail was clarified , " when you saw all this in the papers about the glasses , and you knew you had been on the spot , and even had tripped there , did n't it occur to you that these might be your glasses ? " The moment had come for a decision . " Well , no , " Judd said . " No ? " Horn put in , " Did n't you check up to see if you had your own glasses ? " " Well , even if it had occurred to me , I believe I would have avoided checking on it . " " How 's that ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " he laughed , a bit nervously202 Compulsion "  --  one would n't have wanted to risk having to get involved . I might even have had some silly notions about the third degree . " They all chuckled . Then Horn said , " Now Judd , you , a law student , ought to know better than that . " " There were all those stories about what was happening to that teacher . " " What stories ? " " Well , I happen to be acquainted with a newspaperman on the case , and - " They wanted to know what newspaperman . And what had the newspapermansaid . Oh , he had n't said anything specific , but it was just one of those popular ideas . " Well , all right . No one denies there is a lot of talk about the third degree . " In Padua 's smile there was almost a hint of " you 'll see for yourself . " But he persisted , " So even as a law student , you did n't think it your duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind , whether they were your glasses , so you could identify them and save the state a lot of trouble if they were . And you also must have realized that in the meantime we were running down false clues , and giving the real culprit more opportunity to get away . " " There might have been a question in the back of my mind , " Judd said . " But in the situation  --  " Horn said , " Then you admit now that these are your glasses ? " " Why , I ca n't say for sure . It could be possible . " A point had been reached . There was a prodigious relaxation in the room ; the note-taker put down his book ; men moved around ; Horn whispered something to McNamara , who went out . Everyone was smilingnow . So they had pinned that on him . But what was it ? Nothing . His explanationwas perfectly logical . No one could ever prove it had happenedotherwise . There were half a dozen witnesses to vouch that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , crossed the room in the most casual way  --  oh what a cheap show they were putting up ; wait till he imitated Horn for Artie ! Horn took the glasses from the case , and put them in his breast pocket . " You carried them in your pocket like this ? " " Why , yes , that was where I would habitually carry them . I could haveThe Crime of Our Century 203left them in the pocket of my jacket . I had n't worn the suit for some weeks . But  --  I believe it is this suit I have on now . " Suddenly Horn performed a curious little shuffle with his feet , and half flopped over , like a vaudeville dancer in a buck-and-wing , nearly losing his balance . Startled , Padua and the others lunged to catch their chief . But Horn steadied himself , grasping the back of a chair . He straightened up . Then he touched his hand to his breast pocket . The glasses were still there , intact . " Would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the glasses dropped out ? Especially since you have on the same suit . " " Why , it seems to me that when I did use them habitually , they were always falling out of my pockets when I bent over . " Horn was holding out the spectacles . Judd slipped them into his coat pocket , smiling . " How did they fall ? Will you show us ? " " Well , I 'm not much of an actor , " he said , chuckling . " Just let 's see if they fall out . " " Well , the terrain is n't exactly the same , you know . I tripped , I think it was down an incline , down the overpass of the railway tracks there . " " You do know the site quite well , " Padua remarked . " Still , " Horn said , " let 's give it a try . " With a slight frown at being put in a situation where he had to make a fool of himself , but yet a forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the center of the room , and then fell forward , landing on his palms . As he straightened himself , he had difficulty concealing an angry sense of humiliation . But he made himself chuckle . " Of course when you try it never happens . " They smiled with him . Padua now came forward and arranged a little pile of stuff in the middle of the floor ; there were a couple of telephone books , with a few smaller books on top . " Do you want me to break my leg ? " Judd said . " I 'll risk mine first . " Padua reached out his hand for the spectacles , but then corrected himself , putting them aside , " Anybody got another pair ? We might be needing these some day in court , who knows . " The secretarial fellow , now introduced as Czewicki , also an assistant state 's attorney , handed over his shell-rims . " Be careful . You want to leave me blind ? " 204 Compulsion " Do n't worry , " Horn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Padua slipped Czewicki 's glasses into his pocket , walked back a few steps , then allowed himself , with a certain elegance , to trip over the phone books . Nothing happened . He offered the substitute glasses to Judd . " Want to try ? " Judd thought of protesting at this point . Still , this nonsense could turn in his favor . " I suppose I might stand on my head , " he joked . " That ought to do it . " Then he let himself trip over the books , pitching forward . At least , he wished that the bastard 's glasses would be smashed . But no such luck . It became too stupid . Five , six times , he must have tried it . Horn was sitting there like a schoolteacher watching some inept pupil try an ordinaryexperiment . Frowning , he rose and said , " I 've got an idea . Would you mind taking off your coat ? " " Why , no , " said Judd , " I 'm getting hot from all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jacket and placed it on the floor . Then , as one absorbedly performing some abstract demonstration , he picked up the jacket by its bottom . The glasses slipped soundlessly from the pocket and lay on the carpet . All looked at Horn as though he had performed a great feat . " That 's how it might have happened , is n't it ? " said Horn , helpfully . " Why , obviously , " said Judd , " glasses can fall out that way . But I do n't recall having my coat off that day . " Instantly he wanted to kick himself . Why had n't he said sure , he had taken off his coat , and let it go at that . He tried to backtrack . " But of course I might have . " Padua was shaking his head , thoughtfully . " You would n't pick upyour coat that way . " " Why ? " " You 're pretty careful about your clothes , " Padua said . " I noticed it , because I 'm the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps  --  in the dark  --  " Judd stared back at the fellow , unblinkingly . Certainly , he told himself , he was superior in intelligence to this wop . He must simply be careful not to be tripped by his own overconfidence . He must not try to prove them wrong on each remark , as he had done so far . He would let this remark pass entirely . The Crime of Our Century 205Receiving no reply , Padua resumed , " Another point confuses me . When you spoke to Captain Cleary last Saturday , the question of the glasses did come up . " So during the last hour , they must have been in touch with Cleary . They must now have the report he had written at the station . " Yes . I told him I used to wear glasses . " " Then , surely when you got home you checked up ? " " No , " Judd said . And as they stared at him : " Perhaps that was when it crossed my mind , and I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated to see my family get involved over an unhappy coincidence of that kind . " Horn nodded . Padua took a long breath , and said , quietly , " As a matter of fact , you knew they were your glasses the whole time . You lied both to Captain Cleary and to us . " " I resent that ! " Judd snapped . Horn looked toward Padua . There might have been a hint of disapprovalin his expression . With elaborate casualness , Padua said , " You 've seen this ransom letter in the papers . What did you make of it ? " " Well , I did n't study it very carefully . " " Here . " Judd was handed the letter . He made himself read it over , word for word , so as not to seem familiar with it . " Judd , what sort of man wrote that letter , do you think ? " " Well , obviously he is not uneducated . I would say at least a highschoolgraduate . There do n't appear to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidnaped . It is spelled here with two p 's . " " Is n't that correct ? " " I think it would be the British way , " he said . " I believe we would use one p . But either could be called correct . " How he had argued with Artie about it ! But now , Judd felt that making this point separated him from the letter . He replaced the letter on the desk . After a short silence , Horn said , rather formally , " Suppose you tell us where you were on the afternoon and evening of May 22 . " " May 22 ? " Now , this would be the last round . " Oh , the day of " " Yes . " " Well , offhand , I suppose it was a day like any other day . I went to my classes . . . . " Should he say he had had classes in the afternoon ? No , they206 Compulsioncould easily check on that . Now he was approaching the barrier . The alibi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using the alibi was technically over . Today was Thursday . " May 22  --  that was a Wednesday , was n't it ? " " Yes . A week ago yesterday . " " I do n't recall any special activity on Wednesday . " " But surely , only one week ago  --  you 've got a pretty good memoryabout almost tripping out there in Hegewisch a few days before that . " " Well , I had my Harvard exam on Friday morning , so I was prettybusy studying . " " Friday morning  --  you took an exam ? " " For Harvard Law , " he said modestly , so as not to antagonize these cheap cram-school grads . " How 'd you make out ? Was it tough ? " asked Czewicki . " Of course it was only an extrance exam , and I boned up pretty well . " " A Phi Bete would have no trouble , " Padua said . " That 's a great school , " Czewicki said . " You 'll probably come back here and beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be doing corporation work , " Padua remarked . Horn brought them back to the topic . " What time did you leave the university ? On Wednesday . " " About noon . " And where had he lunched ? At home ? " Well , I usually lunch with friends . Yes , Wednesday I believe I lunched at the Windermere with a few friends  --  Willie Weiss and Artie Straus . " They wrote down the names . Artie 's name . For the first time , he had brought Artie into it . " Wednesday , Wednesday  --  I recall driving my aunt and uncle home , in the evening . " " What time was that ? " " About ten . Perhaps a little after . " " They had been visiting ? " " Yes . For dinner . " Let them assume he had been home for dinner . " You were home for dinner ? " Too easily checked . " No . I was out . I came home to drive them . " Now he would have to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Why had he and Artie chosen to put a time limit on the alibi ? They should have agreed to stick to it until he sailed . He tried desperately to think ofThe Crime of Our Century 207some other plausible story , but his mind seemed frozen , blank . There was only this path . " Were you out alone ? " " With a friend . " " Girl friend ? " Padua said . " Well , yes , in a way . " Respectfully : " Can you give us her name ? " Judd hesitated . After all , Padua kidded , the girl 's honor was scarcely at stake , since he had come home by ten o'clock . Perhaps he could still keep Artie out of it . He said he could n't tell the girl 's name because he did n't really know her name . It was a pickup . They exchanged looks again . " I thought you were so busy studying , " said Horn . " Well , you know how it is before an exam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always do . I stay up all night before the exam , as I find that a sleepless night makes me extremely alert . So I did my intensive studying on Thursday . " " And Wednesday you were out on the town . " Padua clucked his tongue . Judd gave them the alibi , but without Artie . How he had gone bird-i ng most of the afternoon in Lincoln Park , then he had n't returned home for dinner because  --  well , his dad might then have expected him to stay in and study , as his dad was a bit overanxious about that Harvard business . So he had eaten in a restaurant , and then cruised around . He had picked up this girl on 63rd Street , and taken her to the wooded island in Jackson Park , and tried to make her , but she would n't come across , so finally he had let her out to walk home . She had said her name was Edna . And just where had he picked her up ? He gave the corner again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung around that neighborhood . He was pretty sure he could recognize her . " By the feel ? " Padua cracked and they all laughed . Padua resumed . And was there no one else to substantiate his whereaboutson that day ? Judd smiled , as if to recognize that it sounded pretty208 Compulsionfishy . But all the more reason for them to believe it . Surely a guilty person would have prepared a pat alibi . " A lone wolf , " Padua said . They went over the whole thing again , and again and again . Horn , sitting on the edge of a table , remarked in a toneless voice , " Look , Judd , you see where that leaves us . Now , we 've talked to the judge and he vouches for you . Your family is one of the most respected in town . Now , we do n't want to prolong this . If there is anyone at all who can corroborate this account of yours , that would be a great help . " For what happened at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through with it on his own . What made him bring Artie in , he never quite understood , unless it was a sense of fairness  --  he had been going through this ordeal for a couple of hours , and it was only fair for Artie to share part of it . Perhaps there was even a feeling that Artie would want to share the experience . And beyond this was a certain terror . Despite all their soft expressions , he had reached a stone wall . There was nowhere else to turn . " Well , " he said , " I would n't want to involve anyone . " They jumped on it . Surely it would simplify things if someone had seen him , been with him . " Well , a friend of mine was along with me , but the fact is , his mother is a highly refined woman and it would be quite a shock to her to hear that her son participated in such  --  " "  --  pastimes ? " He waited . " Perhaps we could handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horn said . " You notice we are over here in the hotel , so as not to attract any unnecessary attention . " Padua asked , " You had another fellow with you when you picked up this girl ? " " Who was it ? " Horn demanded . He could n't back out of it now . " Artie Straus . " Once more , the sigh of relaxation spread through the room . Judd hated baseball , but from way back in his Twain School days , when they had tried to get him into things by making him the baseball manager , he recognized the feeling among the men : the second out . " Straus was with you when you picked up this girl ? " The Crime of Our Century 209 " Well , we picked up a couple . The fact is , we had some drinks , in the afternoon while we were watching for the birds . " Somehow that always tickled them . " And we thought we had a little too much on our breath to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coconut Grove for dinner , and then we drove around and picked up these girls . " " Straus , " Horn repeated as he wrote down the name . " That the Straus Corporation ? " Judd nodded . A low , appreciative whistle came from Czewicki . " Can you give us his address ? " McNamara was already coming forward to take the slip of paper . " Say , that 's right across from the Kessler house , " he said . " Say , I know this Artie Straus  --  he gave us all that dope on the schoolteachers . " " He 's been extremely interested in the crime , " Judd said . " His little brother was in Paulie 's class at Twain . And Artie is a kind of amateur detective . " As McNamara left , Horn stood up , smiling . " How about some dinner ? " he suggested , in the tone of a man who has done a good day 's work . " I 'm starved . " " I could eat , " Padua agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Judd 's surprise , Horn suggested they all go down to the dining room . It was an amiable meal . Not once during that hour did they touch on the crime . Various law schools were discussed , and , as Judd had suspected , it turned out that Padua was a product of evening courses at a downtown school . The University of Chicago 's law school was outstanding , Padua said  --  it would certainly have been good enough for him , without going off to 1-larvard . " My father insists on Harvard because Harvard is the best , " Judd remarked . " That has always been his attitude . Buy the best . " IIe said it inadvertently . He would not have wanted to antagonize them . And indeed , none of them seemed to take it as a bragging remark . During that dinner , the feeling began to grow in Padua that he would soon understand this case . No such feeling had come to him with any of210 Compulsionthe other suspects . With that poor , broken schoolteacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances had seemed to fit , and he had dutifully pounded down every scrap of Steger 's resistance . He had left Steger in the fishbowl to experience other tactics , and had come back to pound down farther on the jellied brain of that misbegotten , denuded suspect . But he had done it all by rote . Now , with Judd Steiner , Padua had that unmistakable glimmering , the feeling that , even aside from the material facts of the case , the crime would become comprehensible . Why had it come just now ? Had the glint in his mind come from Judd 's remark about buying the best , always having the best ? A pamperedkid , a prodigy , a young man who had always had everything he wanted . How did that lead to the murder ? And the ransom ? To prove he could get something on his own ? Padua remained quiet while the conversation flowed into other channels . Judd was discoursing on ornithology now , explaining about the stuffed birds McNamara had seen in his room , throwing in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had discovered . One of the squad , a sergeant named Fleury , said bird shooting was his favorite sport ; he knew a fine lake in Wisconsin . It was n't the shooting part , Judd broke in . He did n't particularly enjoy killing birds , but when there was a scientific reason , the killing became incidental . He went on elaborating his point , his voice becoming somewhatclacky as his self-assurance mounted . But once more , a word , a phrase , had glimmered for Padua. " . . . the killing became incidental . " Toward the end of the meal , Judd wanted to go to the men 's room . He had been drinking a great deal of water  --  was his thirst a sign ? As he arose , Fleury made an involuntary movement to follow the suspect , but Horn shook his head . The moment Judd was away from the table , the discussion began . " That was a pretty fishy story about those broads , " Sergeant Fleury offered , to make an impression on Horn . Czewicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a whole week to fix up a better story , if he had anything to do with it . " " I think he did it , " Padua said . The Crime of Our Century 211They all looked to Horn . " We 'll damn well find out , " he said , his voice rather shrill . When the detectives picked up Judd , Artie felt excited to the point of elation . Of course Judd would get out of it , the bugger . Or were they swatting him ? Judd could n't stand a scratch . He 'd bawl . He 'd confess . Maybe the best idea would be to scram , right now . But if he beat it , the game would be up . What did the cops have so far ? If they knew anythingmuch , they 'd have arrested him , too . Then , if it was only Judd , it could be the glasses . Or it might be only some more questioning about birding . That was it . The police were baffled . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had picked up Steger a second time . Judd had got through it once ; he 'd do it again . Artie prowled around Judd 's house . No , it might be dangerous to stay there . He decided to go home and wait for Judd to call . Suppose he beat it up to Charlevoix ? That could be natural  --  merely running up there ahead of the Memorial Day crowd . And then , if he heard anything bad about Judd , he could jump into a boat , hide out among the islands . Go across to Canada , up to Alaska ... . At home , Artie retreated to his room . Two hours had passed . Surely Judd was back from downtown . The little bastard was teasing him . Artie phoned the Steiners . The maid answered . She told him in an anxious puzzled voice , Mr. Judd had come back with those men , but he had gone again . " What ? " Yes , they had all come back , to look for Mr. Judd 's eyeglasses . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max go with Judd and those detectives ? " No , Mr. Max had gone out to a social engagement , she believed . Artie hung up . Still , it could n't be too bad , or Max would have gone along with Judd. * * *His mother was talking about the week end at Charlevoix . Did he want to invite anyone special ? Artie held back the news about Judd . He made all kinds of funny suggestions about Charlevoix . How about Fatty Arbuckle ? There was a good man for a party ! 212 Compulsion " Arthur ! Fun is fun , but do you have to be so vulgar ? " Putting on a record , Artie snapped his fingers to the music . He seized her and danced her around for a moment . Then , all through dinner , he was subdued . Mumsie even remarked on it . He was thinking of his future , Artie said , and everyone laughed . His father remarked , " Well , in fact it 's about time . " But Mumsie said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upstairs window . And he saw the Marmon drive up . That goddam little bastard , could he have confessed ! Artie rushed into his room , seized his automatic . Should he shoot it out ? Should he lam the back way ? His mother approached , calling from the stairs in a puzzled voice that there were some gentlemen to see him . Artie threw the pistol into the drawer . Carrying a gun might spoil things . Coming down with Mumsie , he recognized McNamara and the other guy . " Hi ! " he said . And to his mother : " It 's some friends of mine from the detective force . I 've been helping them on the Kessler case . There 's an important new clue . " " Oh God , I hope they 've found the culprit , " she said . As he went out the door with them , Artie said , " I 've always wanted a ride in one of your Marmons . " " You 've got it , " said McNamara . With a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attorney 's office . We had been there for hours . Somewhere , we knew , Horn was questioning the possible owners of the glasses . All we could do was wait . A couple of squad men were on duty , and whenever one of them left the room , several reporters jumped up and followed , hoping to be led to Horn . Most often , it would be to the toilet , and we 'd all guffaw . Whenever the phone rang , to be answered by Olin Swasey , an assistant on duty , we pleaded to talk to his chief , if that was Horn on the wire . But he only smiled , shaking his head . It was then that Artie Straus came in with McNamara . We all stirred . But Artie was not an unfamiliar figure , and it actually did not occur to us that he was brought in for questioning . " Well for crissake ! Are you on the force now ? " I joked . " The boy reporter ! " he greeted me . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glasses ? " The Crime of Our Century 213Before I could fully grasp the immensity of his remark , the whole crowd converged on him . Judd ? Judd who ? Startled , Artie turned silent . The pack wheeled on me , on McNamara . Meanwhile Swasey rushed Artie into a private office . The morning-paper men beat angrily on the door . Why should the Globe get all the breaks ? they complained . Since the Globe man knew who this Judd was , everyone had a right to know . Swasey said he would telephone for instructions . A moment later he emerged and said all right , the glasses belonged to Judah Steiner , Jr. , a law student at the University of Chicago . Artie Straus was a friend of his . That was all . Everyone knew the Straus family . And the Steiners ? The word spread that they too were multimillionaires . Instantly , we were all on the phones , trying to contact the two families . At the Steiners , no one was home . I saw Mike Prager hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing out there to see if he could find someone . At the Straus mansion , a brother , James , made a statement . Artie had been trying to help from the beginning , he said , and would surely do all he could to aid the police now . As for Judd Steiner and his spectacles , he was confident some reasonable explanation would be forthcoming . Meanwhile Olin Swasey had begun to question Artie . The interrogationwas matter of fact , and had Artie then given the same story as Judd , about the two girls , suspicion might have been turned away from them for a time , perhaps altogether . But the week of their alibi compact was over , and so Artie utilized their agreement that after one week it was " each man for himself . " He was the master criminal making his own getaway . Wednesday ? he repeated . He 'd hung around the frat , maybe played ; trds . He 'd eaten at the frat and gone home . No , he had n't been with Judd Steiner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going over the story a few times , he left Artie sitting with McNamara , and slipped out through a side door . But as it happened , an extra man from the Examiner , just arriving , recognized Swasey coming out of the building and followed214 Compulsionhim across to the hotel and up to the mysterious suite . Thus , the hiding place of the state 's attorney was uncovered . Soon enough we were all there . We could n't get to see Judd Steiner . But from Sergeant Fleury we learned that Steiner had definitely taken a bird-lore class out there to Hegewisch the Sunday before , when he must have dropped his glasses . That seemed the end of all the excitement . A false alarm again . And the best clue was eliminated . Tom and I went into a Raklios for coffee . I started to speculate on whether it was even remotely possible that Judd could have committed such a crime . Why , I had been out with him last Friday . Ruth had been going out with him since then . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet been disclosed , came over me again , and I believed it was possible . Tom brushed speculation aside . The hell with the psychology , he said ; that comes later . So far we knew Judd claimed to have lost the glasses on Sunday . Suppose we could find someone who had seen him wearing them between Sunday and Wednesday ? " Is n't Judd the fellow we saw Artie talking to , coming out of that law exam , the day Artie helped us locate the drugstore ? " Tom recalled . " Maybe some of the boys in his law class would remember when he wore his glasses the last time . " Then the whole drugstore incident stood in a new light . Artie 's weird insistence on our going out with him in the rain , to search for it . And anotherrecollection struck me . How Artie had said , about Paulie , " If you were looking for a kid to kidnap , that 's just the kind of a cocky little sonofabitch you would pick .... " The crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better stay with it downtown . I took the I.C. train , wanting , somehow , the few moments of sitting by a window on a train , instead of hurtling through the streets in a cab . The light spilling from the windows touched up the ragged edge of the lake , and there came into my mind a scary image . It was once when I was a kid in Racine , and some other kids had taken me to the lake shore , and we had stayed after dark , and they had told me of monsters that crawled in the bottom of the waters and crawled out at night reachingto pull you under . Slimy shapeless monsters , you could n't even imagine . The Crime of Our Century 215There came again to me the whole perverted side of the story , and I found myself matching Judd to it . That night at the Four Deuces , his ceaseless sex talk , his lustrous eyes . I began to visualize him with the murdered boy . And then a shuddering anger took hold of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with Ruth ! She was downstairs in the drugstore , taking care of the soda fountain , as she usually did when her parents went out . Ruth was wearing one of those white waitress coats that I loved to see her in . A middle-aged man was eating a sandwich . I went to the other end of the counter . Like her mother , Ruth made you eat something right away ; and it was true , I had n't had any dinner , only coffee and sandwiches at odd hours . But I felt also that her busying herself immediately was a sign that she did n't know where she stood with me . Something had been happening in her . Ruth drew coffee , and as she leaned to give it to me , I wanted to take her face in my two hands . She had put on a provocative smile , and was goingto inquire about my big activities , but changed as she saw my own expression . " Is anything wrong , Sid ? " Then : " You look so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , the glasses in the Kessler case , they 've found out they belong to Judd Steiner . " She kept staring at me , her pupils getting dark . " He says he dropped them out there , the Sunday before , when he was hirding . " I had meant to be roundabout ; perhaps I had even intended to try to find things out about Judd from her . But under her gaze I had to say it all at once , so as not to seem to be personally accusing him . Without taking her eyes from me , Ruth came around the counter . This was an old signal ; we would go to the back of the store , to the prescription cubicle . We had used to go there , and swiftly kiss . Through a slot that showed the store proper , you could see if anyone was coming . Ruth seized both my hands . " Sid . You want to prove he did it . " " I want to find out , " I said . Her mouth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her cheeks . I could not know , then , about the night before at his brother 's engagement party , and about the ride she had taken with Judd , and the misery in him she had felt , against her breast . I could not know216 Compulsionabout the strange time on the beach . Yet it was all conveyed , somehow . I knew something had happened in Ruth , some kind of love for him . And if I had not seen her in these last days , if I had stayed away , it had not been only because I was so busy ; surely I had remained aside , with the instinct of a man who knows he must give a rival emotion a chance to prove itself , or to run itself out . My heart hurt for her . It seems that I can still feel the ache of it , today . " You poor kid , " I said . I held her close , to comfort her . " Sid . " She controlled herself enough to talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  things happened between us . I feel he is somebody , somebody who  --  you ca n't explain . " I stroked her hair . The man at the counter had finished ; there was a pharmacist on duty , who came from behind the drug counter to take his money . Still holding Ruth , I watched them as though there were some importance in the transaction . I kept saying to myself with murderous irony , Now you can get a scoop , the girl angle , Judd Steiner 's girl , exclusive story . Or would I now become one of those people trying to keep a girl 's name out of the papers ? My own girl , who happened to have had a few dates with Judd Steiner while I was busy on the story . And what was Ruth to me now ? Was she still my girl ? Had n't somethinghappened in her during this last week ? If Judd proved really to have done the crime , and got convicted and executed , would I not always feel that but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed ? " Ruth , ca n't you tell me ? " I begged . " Not for the paper . For us . " " Oh , Sid . I do n't know what I feel . Only , last night , he was so terribly , terribly unhappy about something . " She gasped . I thought that perhaps we were both being melodramatic . Judd might simply have been frightened , all this week , knowing that the glasses could be identified . His whole story could be true . He might really have lost them out there . I tried to tell this to Ruth , sitting her on a stool by the prescription bench . She became calmer . But now we could n't meet each other 's eyes at all . We both knew the dreadful truth of her first intuitive reaction . It could be Judd . Knowing him closely now , she had admitted it was not impossible . Presently I left . I walked past Woodlawn . I did n't go to the frat . A bitternessand a grief for Ruth kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Century 217image of Judd Steiner , someone like myself , my own age , a prodigy like myself , graduating at eighteen , in the same school , reading the same books , and attracted to the same girl . If we were in so many ways alike , surely I would come to understand him . And yet he had done that most incomprehensible , that most horriblemurder . Yes , he had done it . I knew it . Ruth had known it instantly , and now I knew it . And since I knew it , I would somehow find the means to prove it . It was a fury that seized me then . A fury that there were so many things in Judd like those in myself . I would find what else there was in him , to prove that he was far , far different from myself . I had walked to the Fairfax . I remembered that coming home from the Four Deuces last Friday , Artie 's girl Myra had told me I must call her , at the Fairfax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that had led me from Judd 's girl  --  for so I must now think of Ruth  --  to Artie 's girl . Myra was home . Her voice had that combination of surprise and knowingness that girls have for young men who they were sure would one day phone . I said I was downstairs ; could I come up ? Myra was heartbroken , but she was going out  --  why had n't I given her more warning ? I told her I was there in my working capacity and she became quite intrigued . Her date had n't yet arrived , so would I please come up ? I entered the huge living room , overlooking the park and the lake . Myra introduced me to her mother , who then withdrew , and Myra settled me beside her on a huge custom-built sofa . I told her the news . Her thin cigarette-stained fingers clutched my sleeve . Could anything happen to Artie ? Myra 's voice , in excitement , had a hoarse quality ; it seized you , like her fingers . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he had been with Judd on Wednesday . Judd had to be checked in every detail , because of the glasses . " That little worm . That devil . Oh , Sid ! " Her eyes glowing darkly , she became solemn . " Do you think Judd could have done it ? " Myra sucked in her lower lip , like a little girl who has said something forbidden . I did n't answer . " I always told Artie Judd would get him into real trouble . You know , Artie likes to have fun , and he 'll do wild things , but he 'd never hurt218 Compulsionanybody . But Judd  --  " Then she said no , this was beyond Judd . How could the police even imagine , even of someone a bit strange like Judd , how could they imagine  --  ? And yet she was imagining it , with me . " Did Artie say he was with him ? " " I do n't think so . " Oh , Artie had probably been out chasing girls that night . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , too , she said . All his playboy act was a cover-up . He could be extremely sensitive . Whereas Judd reallygave her the creeps . She had nearly broken up with Artie over his constant companion . Judd was always tagging along , like the other night when we had our double date at the Four Deuces . And did I know that Judd had been taking out my little friend , that attractive , lovely girl , Ruth ? Judd had taken her last night to his brother 's engagementparty . " Yes , I know . In fact  --  " I stopped . Myra 's huge burning-coal eyes examined me . She moved a trifle closer , and lowered her voice . It was as though we were both , in our ways , jealous of this same Judd . " You know , Judd 's never really had a girl , " she said . " I mean  --  if there is really something serious between you and Ruth  --  he 's probably just experimenting . He likes to experiment . " I shrugged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hurried on , " I do n't mean there 's anything wrong with him ; it 's just he 's such a conceited intellectual . He thinks women are inferior . " She was babbling as though to distract herself from the real , the dreadful question . But it had been running on , underneath her babble . " You know what he sometimescalled Artie ? Dorian . " Myra sucked in her lip again . We looked at each other . Then I asked if she could remember about Judd 's glasses . Had she seen him wearing his glasses early last week ? Between Sunday and Wednesday ? She shook her head . " I 'm almost ashamed to try , " she began . Then , again , intimately : " Sid , you do n't really think he could have  --  " Soon she went on : of course , this would n't be for the paper , I must swear . But we were friends , were n't we ? Well , from what she had heard was done to that poor little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crime of Our Century 219to be ready to face the ugliest truths in the world . Did n't I remember the other night how he kept bringing perversions into the conversation , the perversions of Aretino ? Of course some boys utilized talk like that to excite girls , but with Judd it was different , she was sure ; he was alwaysbringing up such things . In fact he had translated some especially pornographic thing from Aretino , the thirty-two perversities . And he was always talking about the decedents , Oscar Wilde and Sade . " I used to think it was a pose . " I said maybe it was . Nothing had as yet been proven . Myra clutched my arm again . " Oh God , Sid ! " And then , determinedly : " I 'll say I was with Artie on Wednesday . " But it was with a feeble laugh , at the pathetic preposterousness of anyone like herself taking part in an alibi . Her mother came in , and Myra said we were talking about books , and her mother asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with modern writing because of Myra , she said , and she thought Sherwood Anderson was very interesting . Suddenly Myra jumped up . " Sid is taking me downtown , " she told her mother . " Artie arranged to meet us at the Sherman . " " Oh ? " her mother said , and smiled . " You youngsters all went out together last week , did n't you ? That 's nice , I like it better when you go in a group . Have a good time , dear , and do n't stay out too late . " All the way downtown , Myra talked incessantly , a flood of coquetry , of sophistication , shot through with sudden worried remarks about Artie , but simply as though he were in a scrape , another of his scrapes , and quite confidentially she told me now , Artie was always in scrapes , a wild driver , for one thing  --  there was the time he had nearly killed someone , in Charlevoix , and nearly killed himself too in the accident , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen out the back window to drive to a dance . She giggled . But it was only things like that he did , madcap things ; Artie would never hurt anybody deliberately . And then she would suddenly be quoting from Amy Lowell , and A. E. , and arguing about something I had said in class about Keats . Then some gasping questions about law , as though at moments the possible reality struck her . Then she would tell me all about Artie 's girls  --  Artie220 Compulsiontold her everything , how far he went with each one . Of course every flapper on campus was chasing him , but for all his flamboyance , for all his clowning , she said , Artie was really very unsure of himself . Could I believe it ? We got out by the County Building , and I showed her the lighted windows on the eighth floor , where Artie was ; but no , I told her , she could n't go up , and I walked her over to the College Inn . She begged me to go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hurried over and talked to Tom . I had Artie 's girl at the Inn , I told him , but I did n't want to use her name , and as for Judd , she could n't remember seeing him with his glasses . Tom said nobody was bothering Artie much ; he was just sitting in there . And Judd , across at the LaSalle Hotel , was still sticking to his alibi about their picking up the two girls . But Artie did n't confirm Judd 's story . Late into the night , the situation remained unchanged . Judd had no idea that Artie was failing to corroborate his talc . Cool , in perfect control of himself , he kept repeating the details of the story , how they had picked up the girls , Edna and Mae , how they had taken them to the Coconut Grove and then to Jackson Park . He even appealed to Horn to have the newspapers request the girls to come forward . And so detailedwas Judd 's story , in contrast to Artie 's vagaries , that Padua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Padua remarked , that he could n't recall what he had done nine days ago . " Well , can you ? " Artie challenged . Padua tried , and after a while , managed . But Artie had had his laugh . Then Padua asked , had Artie ever had dinner at the Coconut Grove ? " The Grove ? Lots of times . " He had dragged all kinds of dates there . Had he been in one of the parks , that Wednesday ? Jackson Park ? Lincoln Park ? Had he ever heard of a girl named Edna ? Or Mae ? So Artie surely knew , then , that Judd was using the alibi ; still he did not corroborate the story . He became a little more doubtful , saying maybe he had cruised around  --  he must have been blotto most of that day ; he could n't remember anything for sure . The Crime of Our Century 221Padua left Artie and returned to Horn 's suite at the LaSalle . Now the questioning of Judd became a little harder . They shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Kessler 's name and address . Then over again . And again . Several times I stepped out of the College Inn to see if the lights were still on , up on the eighth floor . " Do you think he is getting the third degree ? " Myra would ask breathlessly when I returned , and I would reassure her . But she recalled the tales Artie had told her , all week , about that schoolteacher getting the third degree . " Artie looks strong but he is n't , " she said . " They could make him confess to any-t hingl " I reminded her that the state 's attorney would be a little more careful with a Straus than with a mere schoolteacher . Myra shuddered . " Ply me with liquor , " she said , and I replenished her glass . Then we danced . Dancing belly to belly , Myra whispered she wished she could get up the nerve to give herself to Artie . Not as a way of holding him , but becauseanything else was dishonest . Virginity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her convictions . She did n't want to be a fake  --  did I think she was a fake , a false alarm ? " I 'm a tease , I 'm no good , " she repeated . But then , it was n't only sex attraction between her and Artie . She was his real friend . As far back as when he had that awful governess , Miss Nuisance  --  Newsome . Again , Myra sucked in her underlip . What a game it had been for years to fool Miss Nuisance , who practically never let Artie out of her sight , making a model boy out of him . The triumph was every Saturday afternoon , when Artie wanted to see the serial movies  --  you know , where the heroine was tied to the tracks , and the train was coming . Artie loved them , The Perils of Pauline , and of course Miss Nuisance would never allow him to see such things . So on Saturday afternoons he was supposed to go to the Children 's Symphony , with Myra , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went shopping , and then Artie would slip out to a movie on South State Street , and Myra would cover up for him . Oh , the angelic face on Artie when he told Miss Nuisance about the symphony ! I thought of the college-boy face on Artie , upstairs now answering222 Compulsiontheir questions , and I thought of the easy laugh of Artie at the frat , tellingus how he had got by some gullible prof with a borrowed term paper , and then I thought of that ghastly remark about the " cocky little punk . " Something must have shown in my face , for suddenly Myra 's fingers dug into my shoulder , frantically . " Oh , Sid , I 'm saying all the wrong things . Sid , you believe he could have done it ! " We stood there , the sweet music flowing around us . " You do n't know him , you do n't know him ! " she pleaded desperately . " Artie could n't have done it . He 's just a playful kid . Judd is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done anything ! " She was limp on my arm , and I guided her back to the table . In her hoarse , almost sepulchral voice , Myra kept begging me to say I did n't believe Artie could have done a thing like that . Instead , something in me kept pressing forward those words of Artie 's ; I kept wanting to tell her his remark : " the cocky little punk . " But I could n't let myself add to her fear . I began arguing it down in myself . A murderer would never have made a remark like that , a dead giveaway . I ended by reassuring her . Artie would come out all right . We left the Inn . Up there in the County Building , the lights had gone out . " Do you think he is still there ? " Myra asked . I said probably he had been taken somewhere for the night . Where ? Where would they take him ? Not to jail ! Oh , why did n't Artie just leave that devil Judd to his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the quiet Loop streets . Myra could n't bear to go home yet ; she wanted to walk to the lake . As we walked , her spirits lifted . She quoted Edna St. Vincent Millay , about burning the candle at both ends , and about the ferryboat , and then I quoted Carl Sandburg about the lake and the fog coming in on little cat feet . Someday , she said , perhaps I would get to know the real Artie who was like us , who was only trying to escape the futility , the nothingness , of the world . It was nearly four when we got into a cab . She rested her head on my shoulder . In the lobby of her hotel , there were only a few all-night lights . Out of sight of the desk , she told me good night , and then turned her whole body to mine , her mouth to be kissed . It was partly the conventional good-night kiss of a date , and yet it was voracious , with a ghastly emptiness . Her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were openThe Crime of Our Century 223with a kind of beady look , child-eyes watching for the result of a naughtiness . Then in her husky voice , she begged that whatever I did , I would n't put her name in the paper , would I ? I said of course not , as if it were sacred . I had the driver take me back downtown to the LaSalle . Tom was just coming through the lobby . " They took them someplace to sleep , " he said . " That 's all for tonight . " A couple of other reporters speculated with us for a moment , then drifted off . It was no use going home . We were too keyed up . We sat in an alInightThompson 's . We went over everything again . I described both girls , feeling myself a betrayer , but telling myself it was not for the paper ; it was truly to help solve the crime that I betrayed their emotions . I told about Ruth . " She really feels Judd could have done it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few days  --  I do n't know . But when I told her about the glasses  --  " " That 's your girl , Ruth , " Tom said . I nodded . He passed me his cigarettes . I said Myra too believed Judd could have done it . But not Artie . Tom looked up with an odd smile . Nobody had really suggested it could have been Artie . He was only being held because of Judd 's attempt to involve him in a phony alibi . So why had Artie 's girl felt she had to deny the possibility ? Then I recognized that Myra was as afraid as Ruth . The families , Tom said , seemed not to be worried . They had called Horn , and he had assured them the boys would be sent home as soon as certain technicalities were clarified . And that seemed all that was known . " Listen , " I said to Tom , " I promised we would n't use the names of the girls . " He shrugged . We went out and picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus talk about Judd : " a brilliant atheist . " His friend Artie Straus , it said , had not yet confirmed Judd 's alibi . And there was one new item , exclusive . A chisel had been picked up on the night of the murder by a private night watchman who had seen it thrown from a car , on Ellis Avenue , not far from the Kessler house The blade of the chisel was wrapped in adhesive tape . There was blood on the tape . The chisel was believed to be the murder weapon. 224 CompulsionAnd the car from which it had been thrown was a dark sports model . It could have been a Stutz , like the one owned by Judd Steiner . The Examiner had more about the millionaire playboy suspects . Judd was a strange sinister genius who kept to himself . Artie , whom Judd was trying to involve in his alibi , was one of the most popular men on campus , especially with the girls . Myra 's name was mentioned , as was Dorothea Lengel 's  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went up to the office . At daybreak , there was n't a soul in the Globe building . We walked up to the newsroom on the second floor . The desktops were clear , the wastebaskets were empty . It did n't look like a place we knew . We went to Tom 's desk , and on a sheet of paper began to enumerate the points against Judd . The glasses . An unproven alibi . Now , the chisel . Coldly enumerated , in the calm of that huge empty room , each point in itself seemed dubious , and the whole monstrous accusation seemed a nightmare . But for me , the strongest point of all , unwritten , was Ruth 's weeping . Yet with the distance of morning , this too seemed to have a thousand possible meanings . Perhaps she had wept in dismay that I could be trying to prove Judd a murderer , only because he had gone out with my girl . Tom too , starting to put together our story , said we had better be careful . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released by the time the noon edition was out . After all , they had been questioned a whole night , without results . Boys from families like that could n't be held much longer . Probably some big lawyer would appear the moment the courts opened , with a habeas corpus writ . Instead , we heard that Horn was permitting an interview . Thus the families could be reassured that the boys were receiving no rough treatment . After the late-hour questioning , Judd had been sent to rest up , at the South Clark Street station , and Artie to Hyde Park . I felt sure that when I saw Judd face to face , I would know . I would see him somehow as with Ruth 's eyes , with Ruth 's intuition . All that I had learned about him would help me to understand whether the Judd I now saw was capable of a perverted murder . The Crime of Our Century 225And when I saw him my instant reaction was one of shame , for having last night been half convinced of his guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assembled in the South Clark Street station . We were led to the rear detention cells . Judd was in one of them ; the door stood open for us . He greeted us with utter calm , chatting about his " adventure , " and answering , with politeness and gravity , even the silliest sob-sister questions . Some food had just been brought in for him ; there was coffee , but no spoon , and Judd eased the atmosphere at once by borrowing a pencil from Richard Lyman with which to stir his coffee . " I hope you have another one for your notes , " he said . And recognizing me , he said " Hello " with a smile that admitted social acquaintance , but made it clear that this would not give me an edge in the interview . There was a sandwich , and Peg Sweet had to know what kind , so Judd showed her that it was an egg sandwich , and offered to share it with her , and then he politely made sure no one else wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail , and Judd declared , that in Mr. Horn 's place he would do the same  --  it was the state 's attorney 's duty to make an absolutely thorough investigation . Lyman took the lead , and asked about the glasses . " It 's queer , " Judd said . " All along when I read in the papers about the glasses , I had a feeling they might be mine . " " Why did n't you check on it ? " Mike Prager cut in . " Well , I suppose there are things we do n't really want to find out . Would n't that be the psychology of it ? " The questioning got to his alibi . " I certainly hope those girls come forward , " Judd declared . " I wish all of you would appeal to them in your stories . It may be a bit embarrassing , but it is more embarrassing for me if they do n't . " We all laughed , and made the point about their honor being safe since they walked home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did walk home ? " Judd smiled amiably . Somebody behind me asked , " What would you do with ten thousand dollars ? " Eagerly Judd replied , " Why on earth should anyone imagine I would kidnap someone for ransom ? I get all the money I want from my father , and besides , I teach three classes in bird lore , and get paid for it . " He226 Compulsionseemed to be speaking directly to me . And in that moment I was sure he was innocent . What indeed had I been blaming him for ? An interest in sixteenth-century Italian pornography ? Was that any worse than guys at the frat showing you dirty postcards ? Did that make him a pervert and a murderer ? Confronting him , I found the whole idea impossible to believe , and from that moment , I suppose , there had to grow for me the mistrust of human confrontation that is so deep a mark upon our time . What could you truly know of anyone by looking into his face , his eyes ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's stock phrase  --  " What do you know for sure ? "  --  reverberated in my mind as I walked from the police station . For besides Judd 's story , there was Artie 's . If you believed one , you could n't believe the other . Yet both were polite , smiling , and eager to help solve the dreadful crime . Artie had been brought back to the state 's attorney 's headquarters . Through the glass door to the corner office I could see him talking to Padua . Artie waved to me , and presently Padua came out . " Listen , Sid , maybe you can help us . " Padua walked me to a quiet spot near the windows . Was n't I the one who had been with Artie that day , finding the drugstore ? And was n't I a fraternity brother of Artie 's ? I nodded , but said that did n't mean an awful lot . Still , he said , maybe I could talk to Artie . The other fellow , Judd , had at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember anything . " You know how it is . We do n't want to keep these fellows any longer than we have to . Ask him for God 's sake just to tell the truth . Maybe they were up to some kind of shenanigans  --  " I did n't believe Artie would tell me anything , but I could n't refuse to try . " Just one thing , " he said . " Do n't tell him Judd 's story . " I went in . " Hail the boy reporter ! " Artie said . " Hey , have you got me in the papers ? " " You 're famous . " " Am I a suspect ? Hey , this is the nuts ! " I grinned . " Well , you know this is a hell of a case , Artie , and the glasses were all they had to go by . " " Oh , I do n't blame them , " he said . " But my mother is kind of upset ; otherwise this would be fun . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Century 227she 's still upset . " He threw away a half-smoked cigarette and almost instantlylighted another . " Artie , look , " I said . " Why do n't you tell the truth , whatever it is , and get it over with ? Whatever you and Judd may have been up to , it is n't worth being suspected of the crime . " " You think I was up to something with Judd ? " he asked . " Oh , hell , you 're always together , " I said . " That what he said ? " He smiled back at my smile . " What do the guys at the house say ? " " I have n't been out there yet . " " Yah , you 've been busy making time with my girl ! " he kidded . " I 've got my spies in operation . Hey , what does Myra think ? She think Judd could have done a thing like that ? " " Well , those glasses were pretty embarrassing , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Wednesday makes it look worse for him . " " It looks bad for him ? " " Oh , I would n't say that exactly . But I guess the question has to be cleared up . " " Listen , you do n't think they 're going to make him confess , or any crap like that ? " he demanded . " You know Judd . If they start pushing him around ... " I said I did n't think there was any pushing around . " But , Artie , if you know anything , if you can help him out of it  --  you know him better than anybody . " " He says I was with him ? " " Well  --  " " Aw , can it . Why would the cops pick me up if it was n't to check on his story ? I did n't lose any glasses anywhere . " " Well , if you were with him , no matter what you were up to , " I repeated , " it ca n't be as bad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing to prove his story . " Artie stared at me . Again he flung away his cigarette . " Okay , kid . " He walked around , then perched on the desk . He cracked , " If you see Myra , do n't do anything I would n't do . " Then he said , " Stick around out there . I may give you another scoop . " 228 Compulsion Padua looked inquiringly at me as I came out . I smiled but shrugged . He hurried back into that office . Now Artie began to remember a few details about Wednesday . He had been all ginned up all that day and evening , he said , but some of it was beginning to come clear . I suppose Artie feared that with his story uncorroborated , Judd might break down . If Judd confessed , would he not in his bitterness involve his partner ? Then the only hope for both of them now was for him to help Judd get released . So Artie remembered that Wednesday . He now recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could even think of their names : his was Edna , kind of redheaded . They had picked up the girls on 63rd Street . . . . And so , point by point , he told the same story . Why had he waited so long to tell it ? " My mother does n't like me to run with these cheap broads , " he said . " And if it gets in the papers , it 's very embarrassing . " Yet , even his waiting could be interpreted favorably . For if it were simply an alibi that the boys had agreed upon , would n't Artie have come out with it at once , the way Judd had ? And so , that morning , the suspicion was lifting . Judd Steiner , cheerful and candid . And Artie Straus finally corroborating the story of Mae and Edna . Probably , because of their wealth , I thought , I had been resentfully ready to believe anything of them . As I entered the newsroom , Reese tilted his chin , a signal for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're clean , " I said . " Artie Straus just told exactly the same story as Judd Steiner , about the two girls . " He shoved the early edition of the American toward me , with part of their lead story circled in red pencil . It was a beat on us . A letter , a carbon found in Judd Steiner 's room . " Dear Artie , " it began . I stood there , reading , trying to understand the strange letter . It seemed to deal with some bygone incident between Judd and Artie and Willie Weiss , and at first glance I could not see its importance . There was some quarrel about whether Judd had betrayed to Willie Weiss a secret that Artie had confided to Judd . This letter was Judd 's denial of betrayal . It had been written after a big scene between them . A passage , printed in bold type , read : " When you came to my house this afternoon I expected either to break friendship with you or attempt to kill you unless you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Judd , to Artie . The letter continued : " You did , however , tell me ... Now , I apprehend , though here I am not quite sure , that you said that you did not think me treacherous in intent , nor ever have , but that you considered me in the wrong and expected such a statement from me . This statement I unconditionally refused to make until such time as I may become convincedof its truth .... " It was a strange letter , but what did it have to do with the case ? I glanced back at the date  --  months ago , last November . I moved away from Reese 's desk , and went on reading : " The only question , then , is with you . You demand me to perform an act , namely , state that I acted wrongly . This I refuse . Now it is up to you to inflict the penalty for this refusal  --  at your discretion , to break friendship , inflict physical punishment , or anything else you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , therefore , must rest with you . This is all of my opinion on the right and wrong of the matter . " I looked up , puzzled . Reese was watching me . I shook my head to show my mystification , and resumed reading : " Now a word of advice . I do not wish to influence your decision either way , but I do want to warn you that in case you deem it advisable to discontinue our friendship , that in both our interests extreme care must be had . The motif of a falling out of - - ' would be sure to be popular , which is patently undesirableand forms an irksome but unavoidable bond between us .... " Feeling Reese 's eyes still on me , I had drifted down the aisle , and was standing near Tom . At the moment it did n't even strike me as important that the paper indicated some words omitted after " falling out . " Perhaps they had been undecipherable . There was more to the letter . Judd begged Artie for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case they keep up an appearance of friendship such as " salutation on the street " and on all occasions when they might be thrown together in public . But what did it mean ? Aside from showing the intensity and violence of their relationship , what bearing could it have on the murder of Paulie Kessler ? Tom was typing rapidly , to catch us up on the story . He had a scrawled copy of the letter on his desk . That bastard Mike Prager had230 Compulsiongone out with the squad last night when the cops had ransacked Judd Steiner 's room . Mike had pocketed this letter . Only just now , after his paper was on the stands , had Mike turned the letter over to Chief Nolan . Tom handed me up his notes , made in Nolan 's office , containing the left-out words , where the dashes had been used . " The motif of a falling out of a pair of c ' would be sure to be popular .... " I saw again the naked body of the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the candid smile of Judd Steiner , whom I had just left , I saw the boyish smile of Artie Straus , whom I had just left , and I felt a sick bewilderment , an inadequacy . I was too innocent ; I was unable to recognize the ugly and the bestial that lay underneath the smiling world . They had seemed so bland . I had been equating them with myself . I had made a fool of myself just now , telling Reese , " They 're clean . " These diseased creatures , these perverts , they had been going out with me and with my girl . Judd had done something to Ruth , disturbed her deeply in some way . Perhaps something of this was what she had known . Through Judd 's ways , she knew they had done it . They had done it to Paulie Kessler . Then I held myself back . I tried to tell myself the word could have been used in jest , the way we commonly used it around the frat house . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , that still did n't prove they had done anything to Paulie . I tried to tell myself not to let my anger run away with me , at having been fooled , and at having been scooped by Mike Prager . " What do you think of your pals now ? " Tom said . " God , this looks like they really might have done it . " " You ca n't prove it from this , " he said . " And Horn looked about ready to let them go . " I told him of Judd , so easy in his interview ; I told how Artie had finally confirmed Judd 's alibi about picking up a couple of girls . " Picking up a boy , he means , " Tom said . While he typed , he handed me a few more pages , copied from Judd 's letters . First there was a document that had been attached to what was to becomeknown as the " c letter . " It was a legal-sounding document , and its purpose was explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still want you , to feel that we are on an equal footingThe Crime of Our Century 231legally , and therefore , I purposely committed the same tort of which you were guilty , the only difference being that in your case the facts would be harder to prove than in mine , should I deny them . The enclosed document should secure you against my changing my mind in admitting the facts , if the matter should ever come up , as it would prove to any court that they were true . " Then came the document : " I , Judah Steiner , Jr. , being under no duress or compulsion , do hereby affirm and declare that on this , the loth day of November , 1923 , I for reasons of my own locked the door of the room in which I was with one Arthur Straus , with the intent of blocking his only feasible mode of egress , and that I further indicated my intention of applying physical force upon the person of said Arthur Straus if necessary to carry out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of egress . " I stared at Tom . As he sent up his story , we tried to reconstruct what had gone on between the two boys , to bring Judd to compose the strange letter with its accompanying " document . " Judd was handing Artie " evidence " that he had locked Artie in a room , saying , meanwhile , " I purposely committed the same tort of which you were guilty . " So , apparently , in a bitter wrangle they had been locking each other up ! First Artie locking up Judd , because he claimed Judd had betrayed a confidence , had been " treacherous . " And then Judd locking up Artie . It had a weird overwrought echo of childhood games , locking someone in a closet  --  " I wo n't let you out until you tell me the secret . " But these were university graduates , prodigies of eighteen . Where on earth did Judd imagine , before what " court , " would Artie presumably ever produce Judd 's legal-sounding admission of a " tort " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plea for Artie to decide the whole issue . " Now , Artie , I am going to make a request to which I have perhaps no right , and yet which I dare to make also for Auld Lang Syne . Will you , if not too inconvenient , let me know your answer ( before I leave tomorrow ) ? This , to which I have no right , would greatly help my peace of mind in the next few days when it is most necessary to me . You can if you will merely call up my home before 12 noon and leave a message saying , Artie says yes , ' if you wish our relations to continue as before , and Artie says no , ' if not .... " I felt almost guilty , peering into so intimate a confession . Judd , at one232 Compulsionmoment pleading with Artie to judge him , to " inflict physical punish , ment , or anything else you like , " if he had been " treacherous , " and at the next moment arrogantly vowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few paragraphs later , abjectly begging his friend to leave a message so that he could have peace of mind . For the first time , I began to understand the strange bondage , to glimpse a love relationship entirelyoutside my knowledge . And what could Artie think Judd had betrayed that was important enough to have brought the boys to imprisoning each other and to threatening death ? " Something Judd knew about Artie , " Tom reasoned . Again , we studied the dense wording . At bottom it was a sort of " you said he said I said " affair . It had the ring of tempestuous accusations among children and  --  yes  --  among girls . One could see them , shrilling accusations against each other , screaming their threats , locking doors . And I tried to set this image against the two young men I had seen only an hour ago , sophisticated , self-possessed , superior to their little predicament . Tom handed me another sheet . This was a copy of a letter Judd had written two days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York . It was clear that Artie had in the meantime chosen to " continue their relationship " by taking back his accusation of " treachery . " And Judd was " forgiving " him . The point in the whole controversy , Judd said in the forgiveness letter , was to determine which of them was guilty of a mistake , for a mistake was the greatest crime a person of their sort could commit ! " But I am going to add a little more in an effort to explain my system of the Nietzschean philosophy in regard to you . It may not have occurredto you why a mere mistake in judgment on your part should be treated as a crime when on the part of another it should not so be considered . Here are the reasons . In formulating a superman , he is , on account of certain superior qualities inherent in him , exempted from the ordinary laws which govern ordinary men . He is not liable for anything he may do , whereas others would be , except for the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a mistake . " Now obviously any code which conferred upon an individual or upon a group extraordinary privileges without also putting on him extraorTheCrime of Our Century 233dinary responsibility , would be unfair and bad . Therefore , the superman is held to have committed a crime every time he errs in judgment  --  a mistake excusable in others . But you may say you have previously made mistakes which I did not treat as crimes . That is true . To cite an example , the other night you expressed an opinion , and insisted , that Marcus Aurelius Antonius was practically the founder of Stoicism . In so doing you committed a crime . But it was a slight crime , and I chose to forgive it . . . . " Tom repeated a phrase from the beginning , " . . . exempted from the ordinary laws which govern ordinary men . . . . " I read that part over : " In formulating a superman , he is , according to the superior qualities inherent in him , exempted .... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want , " Tom said . I was trying to recall things from Nietzsche , but then I realized that it really did n't matter what Nietzsche had said or meant . What mattered was the meaning expressed here by Judd himself  --  he and Artie were playing some kind of game , a superman game , and these were their rules . The rules perhaps did not provide a motive for murdering Faulk Kessler . But if Judd and Artie were " exempted from the ordinary laws which govern ordinary men , " then what would stop them from murder ? It was as though two dense curtains had shrouded the possibility of seeing these rich , clever boys as perpetrators of the crime . The outer curtain was the negative one , the one that excluded them from the action , a curtain of " why they would not . " For all the fears of punishment , all the laws of man provided a " why not . " And this curtain seemed now to be lifting . If they really believed in this idea of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not " for them . The inner curtain was the " why ? " and was still impenetrable , though the sexual motive provided a rent in it . Yet their superman idea was hard to grasp because I had seen them in everyday life . It was hard to grasp that people who lived in your own milieu , who abided by the day-by-day conventions and rules of life , paying their fares , buying their tickets , standing up for ladies  --  people who even followed the conventional rules of breaking the minor rules when you could get away with it , like speeding at times , or cribbing in an exam  --  it was hard to believe that within this very appearance of234 Compulsionliving under the same rules as the rest of us , they had their own contraryrules . It was hard to take their own words and believe them , just as it was to be hard , only a decade later in our lives , to believe that an entire nation could seriously subscribe to this superman code . And so I went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . What I had sensed emotionally , intuitively , the night before , from Ruth , I was now trying to justify by fact and by reasoning , and the effort seemed heavy , like trying to provide a mathematical formulation for an answer you had already glimpsed . In Horn 's office , too , they were puzzling over the letters . Horn was no reader of Nietzsche . He tended to brush aside the superman letter as show-off kid stuff ; you never could hang anybody with that . Perhaps he was right . We were to see the philosophy for a time as an explanation  --  itwas even offered as a kind of excuse . But could it ever have been a cause ? A rationalization , yes , even diverting us from the real source of human deeds in individuals , in nations , in ourselves . The first letter , Horn said , was only a lot of wild talk about some silly quarrel . Except for the one fact in it : the perversion business . But even that had to be taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out if these fellows had anything to do with young boys . One thing was sure after these letters : you could n't let these two fellows go so soon . Padua and Czewicki had a short discussion of their own . Padua had always meant to read Nietzsche , but never found the time ; perhaps Nietzsche could have helped him trip these wiseacres . Czewicki was n't so sure . He had read Ecce Homo in a Haldeman-Julius Little Blue Book . It did n't tell you you could go out and murder anybody . It was just philosophy . But the strange letters , published in the papers , even with the key words omitted , had raised an active apprehension in one other person who was to enter the case . Edgar Feldscher was a cousin of Randolph Straus , Artie 's father . A lawyer , engaged with his brother Ferdinand Feldscher in corporation work for various members of the family , EdgarThe Crime of Our Century 235Feldscher had interests outside the law . He was something of an aesthete , a bachelor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last trip he had brought back the very earliest edition of Ulysses and a few paintings by Braque . He read a great deal , and was fond of HavelockEllis and D. H. Lawrence . He was also acquainted with the works of Freud , and when people made jokes about suppressed desires or the inferiority complex , Edgar Feldscher was apt to start lecturing on the serious meaning of the terms . After reading over several times the newspaper quotations of Judd 's letters , Edgar Feldscher telephoned Artie 's father . He was a little disturbed , he said . Of course he knew the boys had been close to each other for several years . But if stuff like this was going to be dragged through the papers , it might prove harmful to them and to the families . Besides , who could tell what might turn up ? It might be time , he suggested , to get Artie , at least , out of the hands of the state 's attorney . " The harm 's already been done , " Randolph Straus said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unprinted word was in that letter . They had been calling him . In a way , he almost wished the police would give Artie a good pushing around , to teach him not to play detectiveand get himself into this kind of a mess . After all , what did Artie know about the Kessler murder ? But he supposed Artie would soon be released , having been held just long enough to blacken the family name and give nasty publicity to the Corporation . To go in now and demand his release might only make things worse , give the papers a story about the family trying to use influence . " Yes , there 's something to that , " Edgar Feldscher agreed . The feeling of apprehension was deepening in him , but he could n't find it in himself to utter the real question . No , it was impossible that the boys had done it . . . . He would keep in touch with the situation , he said . Perhapsput in a call to Horn 's office . Just to make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the university , I tried to find Willie Weiss . For it was he who had been involved in Judd 's wild letter to Artie . And was n't it Weiss who had lunched with Judd and Artie on the day of the kidnaping ? Perhaps he would tell me what kind of a secret it was , of Artie 's , that Judd was236 Compulsionsupposed to have betrayed . And also , Willie Weiss might remember whether Judd was wearing his glasses during lunch that Wednesday . I could n't find Weiss on campus . And no one answered the phone at his home . He was probably keeping out of the thing . It was hard to find anyone that afternoon  --  people were going away for Memorial Day . The frat was almost empty . I thought of two fellows I had seen coming out of that law exam with Judd Steiner  --  Harry Bass and Milt Lewis . Bass had already gone home to the North Shore , but Milt Lewis , one of the brothers said , might still be on the tennis court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , Raphael Goetz . God , he said , he was glad about only one thing in this mess  --  that Judd Steiner had never been let into the frat . It was bad enough with Artie , but if Judd had ever got into the Alpha Beta ! The papers would give people the idea that all that stun was going on at the house . They would make out we were all a bunch of perverts . Oh , he 'd been getting funny questions all morning , from police , from reporters . Well , I said , he knew he could trust me to handle anything he told me , in a way that would protect the frat as much as possible . But things were very serious , and whatever was known about the fellows would have to come out . We took a quiet walk down the alley . Raphael was a huge fellow , a halfback on varsity , a good student , and one of those men who endow any meeting with an atmosphere of earnest good will . In later years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now , putting his arm around my shoulders , he said , " Have they really got something on them ? " I showed him the story containing Judd 's letter . He already knew the omitted word . " That all happened when they were up in Michigan , " he said . His cousin had been in the chapter up there and had given him the inside story . And Goetz told me about the Morty Kornhauser incident . " He caught them at it , and they tried to take him out in a canoe and drown him . " We stopped . We stood facing each other , feeling gravely that the fate of others might be in our hands . " Morty even tried to get Artie thrown out of the frat . " But all the fellows thought it was Judd who was to blame . " Hell , you know Artie  --  he 'll try anything just for the hell of it . He 's happy-go-lucky , but Judd , there 's something that gives you the shivers about him . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about his bettingThe Crime of Our Century 237high stakes at cards , all that stuff , but you still could n't say he was capable of murder . He was just a loose character . He 'd been lectured , and given hell , he 'd been voted incapable of mentoring a pledge , but what was the use  --  being such a prodigy , he 'd been pampered since he was a kid , and with all that dough in the family , naturally the guy was spoiled . But you could n't say he was a pervert  --  why , hell , Artie was playing half the girls on campus . I said I knew . " I 'd believe anything of Judd Steiner , but if Artie is in trouble , I 'll bet that little bastard dragged him into it . " We started back toward the house . Raphael 's words reverberated . Artie would try anything once , and Judd was capable of anything at all , and if Artie was in trouble Judd had dragged him into it . And suddenly I saw why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd on Wednesday . For if they had been together , they could have beentogether committing the crime ! Judd was capable of anything . Why noteven of murder ? Artie 's hesitation in placing himself with Judd actually tended to confirm the crime . The story about the picked-up girls was a fake they had agreed upon in advance , but then Artie had held back from telling it , trying to save himself from implication with Judd should the alibi collapse . Artie 's hesitation was actually the proof ! And just then , as if the thought of their guilt in itself caused me to find the conclusive evidence , I noticed Milt Lewis . He was in his tennis clothes , hurrying into the house . I caught up with him . " Listen , Milt , " I said , " the early part of last week , do you remember if Judd Steiner was wearing his glasses ? " " I refuse to answer on the grounds of possible self-incrimination , " Milt cracked . " And who the hell could remember on what day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I know is I read in the papers that Judd Steiner lost his glasses in a very inconvenient place . " We were climbing up to his room . " That 's it , " I said . " He claims he lost them on Sunday . But if he was seen wearing them , between Sunday and Wednesday  --  " He began pulling off his sweatshirt . " Listen , " Milt said , " if you 're trying to hang that conceited bastard , I 'm with you . " He attempted little tricks of memory . Had he seen Judd reading anything in class ? in the library ? 238 Compulsion " He claims the last time he actually used them was in March . " " Hell no , I 'd say more recently than that . Wait a minute . " Milt Lewis seemed to pick an image out of the air . " At his house , about three weeks ago . A gang of us went there to make some notes on equity . Judd put his glasses on when he opened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there under all those birds , because I kidded him that he looked like one of those owls , with his horn-rimmed glasses . " A few weeks ago ? That still would n't prove anything . But  --  " You say he was typing on a portable ? " " Yah , it was a real hot session . We had two machines going . Harry Bass was using a big machine Judd had there , and Judd opened his portable . " " Did you notice , was it a Corona ? " " How should I know ? " He stared at me . " Hey listen , Hawkshaw  --  " Then he grinned . " All right , I 've got carbons of that typing , right here ; from both machines . " He began pulling out papers , folded in among his notebooks . There were indeed two kinds of typing . In itself there was nothing startling in the fact that there should be two typewriters in a millionaire 's house . The second machine might have belonged to his brother . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Arbor . I stared at the typing , feeling somehow silly to be going so far , and yet headily sure . I picked out some of the clearest sheets . " Anybody got a Corona in the house ? " Milt was excited now . We ran through a couple of rooms , located a Corona . The style of lettering seemed the same as on one set of notes . But still , there were millions of Coronas . For real comparison , I needed a copy of the ransom letter . It had been reproduced over and over in the papers , only a few days ago , but while the house was usually littered with old newspapers , we could now find nothing . The only sure place seemed to be downtown . I ran along the street , found a cab . The ad-taking counter at the office was just inside the main door . There was a file of papers kept for the public . I found the page , exactly a week ago , with the reproduced ransom letter . Our story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faulty p , 4The Crime of Our Century 239and that the tail printed faintly on the y . The same faults were on Judd 's law notes ! The same , the same . I tore the page from the file . Running the few blocks to the County Building , I felt I was watched by Judd 's eyes , morose , lustrous , unblinking . At the building , I checked myself . I stepped into the cigar store , and phoned Tom in the press room . He came down . We huddled in a corner , while I showed him the two samples . " Kid , if that bird hangs , you did it ! " he said , staring at the evidence . Then , to be more sure , we hurried out to find some kind of magnifying glass . A drugstore had one . We used it right there , on the counter . The similarity was unmistakable . Could we hold this till tomorrow , for our paper ? We decided it was too important . We had to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had all gone out to dinner , taking the suspects with them . Nobody knew j ust where . This was the famous dinner at the Red Star Inn , near Lincoln Park , an old-style eating place , renowned for its huge schnitzels , apfelkuchen , and other German specialties . If there was a moment when Artie and Judd savored their adventure , I suppose it was at the time of this dinner . For the sense that they had sought to achieve , the sense of power and superiority in knowing what others did not know , was theirs , here , and together , in the presence of baffled authority itself . This was the thrill , vibrating in the tension of their still undecided fate . They were so far the masters , and yet , like aerialists who have alreadycompleted their act but might slip before getting off the wire , they were under a delicious suspense . Until the cars drew up in front of the old-world restaurant on Clark Street , they could not know they would be together . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , and perhaps catch something in an unguarded moment of surprise and pleasure . Horn 's own car , with Judd , pulled up first , and Judd in a worldly manner expertized about the restaurant , remarking that his family always had a German cook at home , though they always had to teach the cooks Jewish seasoning . Just then the second car drove up , and
