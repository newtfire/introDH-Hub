West Berlin is a special city , quite as individual in its own way as Paris . Like New York with its Brooklynese and London with its cockney , Berlin has its own rapid give-and-take language ( it 's really more than a dialect ) , its own earthy humor and its own enthusiasms. // The city 's biggest enthusiasm at the moment is a prizefighter , a 28-year-old middleweight named Gustav Scholz , who would be called Gus in New York but whom no Berliner ever would call anything but Bubi. // It is a pet name as well as a nickname , and it indicates fully the feeling Berliners have for Scholz and why they have it . Bubi is hard to translate into English , but this may give you an idea of what it means : if a German mother had an especially attractive young son she would call him Bubi . All Berliners feel that way about Bubi Scholz. // He is almost six feet tall , slender , with black hair and brows , and he has a straight , unboxerlike nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . Indeed , he hobnobs with movie stars . A well-spoken young man , he is polite and always poised or , as one Berlin sportswriter put it , he can talk to his neighbor and he can talk to the Oberb ? rgermeister. // The rest of Germany follows Bubi 's career with as much avidity as Berlin , though not with the Berliners ' special warmth of ownership . // So up and down the length of West Germany for the past few weeks people were talking about and waiting for Bubi 's second fight with France 's Charles Humez , the fourth-ranked middleweight contender , to whom Bubi had lost a decision after being knocked down twice . Newspapers appraised his chances , not too optimistically , and reviewed his career . // The career began with Bubi hanging around a Berlin gym for months , hoping that he 'd be picked for a fight , though he had never fought before , even as an amateur . Then an opponent scheduled to face Werner Eichler , an experienced welterweight , fell ill . A frantic promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , and Bubi , though he showed neither experience nor skill , made good . He displayed the now famous Scholz guts and ability to recover from disaster . He was knocked down three times in four rounds , but he won . // That launched him . In time he acquired shrewd and wealthy Fritz Gretzschel , a businessman , as his manager . Together they plotted an assault on the world championship . By 1954 he was ready for Madison Square Garden where , as the first German to appear as a Garden main eventer in his first U.S. fight , he won a decision over Al Andrews . // The future was bright but Bubi fell ill of tuberculosis and retired to a Black Forest sanitorium . He fought not at all in 1956 and was told by a doctor , in fact , that he must never box or even train again . // But Bubi did begin training , in the spring of 1957 , and won the German middleweight title from Peter Muller . Berlin made him its darling again , thrilled as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Training for Humez , Bubi , who is , no longer a natural middleweight , had trouble getting down to the 160-pound limit . Breakfasts were a glass of red wine with an egg in it . He got nothing else until 5 p.m. when he had a steak and green salad . // With but five losses in 102 professional fights , Humez is still no one 's darling . He is quite unlike Bubi . An ex-miner , he looks it . He has a receding hairline , and his ears and nose are clearly those of a prizefighter . And in boxing style he is quite the opposite of Scholz , who fights from a straight-up , classic stance and is a lightning counterpuncher . Humez ' stance is crablike . He is a stalking , aggressive infighter. // The fight took place in the huge , 100,000-seat stadium built for the 1936 Olympics . About 30,000 persons were crowded into tiers at one end . Humez was greeted by a tight claque of French soldiers , but they were drowned out by the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As always in the first round of a fight , Bubi was pale and nervous . But in the second round Bubi opened the Frenchman 's nose , which bled badly for the rest of the fight , and as the rounds passed it became apparent that , probably because he had trouble breathing , Humez was tiring . By the eighth round Bubi had become the aggressor and chased Humez about the ring . In rounds 10 and 11 Humez tried desperately with wild , ineffective charges , and Bubi just loved them . He counterpunched savagely , and in the 12th round he punched Humez at will . Fifteen seconds before the end of the 12th , Humez just turned his back and walked away , not out , but completely defeated . From his corner a towel floated into the ring . // Even in Hitler 's day the stadium had not heard such shouting . After the fight the audience lighted matches twice , forming a wonderful band of color across the east end of the stadium . This is a special Berlin method of congratulation. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " It 's no use any more . " // But Bubi and his manager were planning to leave for New York to talk over with the International Boxing Club the possibility of a title fight with Sugar Ray Robinson .
