For Carole Beebe Tarantelli , spring became a savage season three years ago . On March 27 , 1985 , her 43-year-old husband , Ezio , a top Italian economist , was gunned down by Red Brigades terrorists . And from that bloody moment , in a parking lot at the University of Rome , her life and that of their young son , Luca , changed forever . " For a year and a half I suffered every waking moment and even , I suppose , when I was sleeping , " she says slowly . Sitting in the cluttered study of her airy apartment , she pauses and looks through its tall windows , open to a leafy walled garden beyond . " It was unbelievable to me the amount of suffering you can go through . The sun changed color ; it was metallic , hard . " A turning point , of sorts , came in June , 1987 . Running as an independent on the Communist Party ticket , she became the first American citizen ever elected to the Italian Parliament . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worker ' s party that is far less radical in tone than its Eastern European counterparts . ) She was permitted to retain her U.S. citizenship despite her Italian elected office . A small , trim woman with a thick blond bob and clean , snub-nosed all- American looks , Tarantelli was born in Elizabeth , N.J. , and was graduated from Wellesley College and then Brandeis University , with a doctorate in English . Since her election , she has taken a leave of absence from her post as an assistant professor of English at the University of Rome . " It was lucky for me , the candidacy and the election . Somehow , it was a project of hope for survival after tremendous pain , " she says , explaining that since her husband ' s death she has found the active life of a legislator easier to deal with than the more solitary , cerebral pursuits of the academic life . " I hope this is changing , and when it does , I ' ll know that , at least partly , I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fragmented that having a project and slowly working on that , reading and doing research , is not possible . It requires a mind that is free , not one that is working , on some very deep level , on what human violence , human destructiveness and the human desire to annihilate means . " A Jungian-trained psychoanalyst , who continues to see about seven patients a week , Tarantelli was amazed at the emotions that her husband ' s violent death brought out in her . " This is not just a problem of a small number of crazy people , " she says . " It ' s a problem also of our desire to annihilate the other person-and that ' s how I felt . When you desire to annihilate them , you ' re annihilating . You ' re part of that process . It ' s in you . It ' s not just in them . " An ardent feminist , Tarantelli , 46 , has emerged since her election as a champion of women ' s rights in Italy . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclassify rape from a " light " crime against public morality to the more serious offense of " crime against a person , " which carries with it mandatory prosecution ; and to protect battered women , in a country that still has no shelters for such women . But perhaps most striking of all , she has been extremely active in seeking greater understanding and study of terrorism . Indeed , one month after her husband ' s murder , Tarantelli went to meet members of the Red Brigades , face to face , in an Italian prison . A family friend and member of the Italian senate , who also had been a target of a terrorist attack , had received a letter from a group of imprisoned terrorists asking to meet with him and also expressing sympathy for the Tarantellis . Carole decided to accompany him . Even now , she struggles to explain that decision . " After Ezio was assassinated , I felt like there was a black hole in which there were these monstrous , horrible people . I mean , the black hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand who were the people who could do something like that . " The terrorists she met were not those who killed her husband . They were part of a growing number of imprisoned Red Brigades members called " dissociati , " former terrorists who have split from the terrorist movement . " It was in a conference room , and I felt totally immersed in death , frozen in death , but at the same time , in a strange way , totally open to see what there was to see . " I don ' t know how I could convey what your psychic state is after violence . It ' s as if an atomic bomb exploded in you and destroys everything . There ' s almost no contact with normal consciousness , the way we normally are . " Tarantelli is vibrantly articulate - except when discussing her late husband . Then her voice becomes soft , and the words stagger out . The Tarantellis met in Boston , when Carole was at Brandeis and Ezio at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Married in 1970 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . A leading political economist , Ezio was president of the Institute of Studies of Labor Economics . An econonic counselor to the Italian Federation of Labor Unions , he also was a professor of political economy at the University of Rome . That March day in 1985 , two men , armed with a submachine gun and a pistol , shot him dead in the university ' s parking lot , leaving a Red Brigades leaflet on the hood of his car . It is believed Ezio Tarantelli was targeted in retaliation for his part in helping to draft a government plan that curbed automatic wage increases for Italian workers , in an effort to reduce inflation . Though the ringleaders of the attack on Ezio , including the female head of the Red Brigades in Rome , were arrested , police have yet to find the gunmen who killed him . " I remember when they were arrested , " Carole says . " My first reaction was that I hoped they would torture them so they would confess . I didn ' t mean those horrible tortures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , you know , that kind of subtle torture where you disorient somebody and put them in light and keep them awake for days and days . " And then I thought to myself-I thought , I didn ' t feel-in order to torture somebody you have to have trained a torturer . And once you ' ve trained a torturer , you don ' t know who he ' s going to torture next . Then , you think , revenge means that you destroy another life , so you perpetuate the cycle of destruction . And destruction is never simply the destruction of one single person , who disappears without leaving ripples . That destruction brings other destructions : of sisters , brothers , children , parents , and it just goes on and on . " Given the destruction brought upon her own family in Italy , some might wonder why Tarantelli did not immediately return home to the United States , where her parents live , in Ohio . " The way I think of myself now , and this is really only since Ezio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " After his death , I felt that I had somehow earned the right to be Italian and to try and do something about what was happening in Italy with regard to terrorism . I wasn ' t an outsider and I wouldn ' t be looked upon any longer as a foreigner . " Part of me really missed everything about the United States , but I felt like it would be a way of saying that it was too much to deal with and a kind of sweeping what happened under the rug , if I left . I don ' t think that anybody is obliged not to do that , but I know , as a psychoanalyst , that if you do , you pay very heavily , because it doesn ' t go away . It comes out in other ways . " Most immediately , she says , " I didn ' t know if I could survive economically in the United States , you see , because I had built my career here . I had that obligation to support my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want was that his life change materially . I thought it was enough for him to have to deal with his father ' s death without having to deal with economic insecurity . " Now 16 , Luca , for whom Italian labor unions set up a college trust fund , provided another important reason to stay . Italy is his home . Although he appears to be doing well , Tarantelli is unsure about the final impact of the violence on her son . " We talk about his father and remember his father , but I think when you have to deal with violent , willed death , you ' re on completely uncharted territory . There ' s no one who has been there who can help you . " Tarantelli has seen changes in herself . " Ezio and I were very different in lots of ways , particularly personality . He was a volcano , so creative . But one thing I ' ve found is that so many of the things I observed in him , like making decisions and lots of things that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve passed on to me . " Recently Tarantelli testified at the trial of Barbara Balzarani , the head of the Red Brigades in Rome , and the woman Tarantelli believes masterminded Ezio ' s murder . " Fortunately she has decided not to come to court , so I don ' t have to see her , one person , behind bars , in a cage , facing the might , such as it is , of the state , " Tarantelli says . Though that trial is not over , Balzarani has received several life sentences in other cases . Asked if that is what sounds like sympathy in her tone , she says , " I don ' t know . She is a human being , too , right ? I didn ' t have to face whatever I would have had to face if she had come to court . But after it was over , I went to Parliament in the afternoon and I had to come home and go to bed . And I had to come home and go to bed the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarantelli opposes the concept of amnesty for terrorists . " The root of ' amnesty ' is the same root as the word ' amnesia . ' Amnesty says that the crime is no longer a crime . " The idea of amnesty surfaced in the Italian government last year , after imprisoned Red Brigades leaders announced that the " arms struggle is finished . " This came about 10 years after former Italian premier Aldo Moro was kidnaped and killed in Rome by the Red Brigades . In 1983 , 32 Red Brigades members suspected in the Moro killing were sentenced to life and 27 others received sentences of up to 30 years . Italy does not have the death penalty . Asked if she believes she has now come through the destruction visited upon her own family , she says , " I don ' t know . You never know . Maybe someday I ' ll be able to say , ' Yes , I ' ve made it . ' " She reflects a moment , then adds , " This summer , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun .
