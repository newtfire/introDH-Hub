UNCLE WADSWORTH : Why should I stop , Alvin boy ? ALVIN : Because it is n't so , Uncle Wadsworth . Dear old golden rule days !

UNCLE WADSWORTH : Why should I stop this time , Alvin boy ? ALVIN : Reading and writing and arithmetic ! What a curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illiterate ! How could a curriculum like that prepare you for Life ? No Civics , no Social Studies , no Health , no Home Economics , no Manual Training , no Physical Education ! And extracurricular activities ? where were they ? UNCLE WADSNIVORTH : Where indeed ? Where are the extracurricular activities of yesteryear ? Shall I go on , Alvin boy ? ALVIN : Go ahead , Uncle Wadsworth . UNCLE WADSWORTH : . Readin ' and ' ritin ' and ' rithmetic . Taught to the tune of a hick'ry stickALVIN : Stop ! Stop ! Stop , Uncle Wadsworth ! Honestly , Uncle , I do n't see how you can bear to say it . Taught to the tune of a hickory stick ! . . . Imagine having to beat poor little children with a stick , Thank God those dark old days of ignorance and fear and compulsion are over , and we have come out into the sunlight of ? of appealing to the child 's better nature , and getting him to adjust , and making him do what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Finished , Alvin boy ? ALVIN : Finished , Uncle Wadsworth . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Well , so am I. I ca n't seem to get going in this song ? every fifty yards I get a blow-out and have to stop for air . You go on for a while and let me interrupt you . Go ahead , Alvin . ALVIN : Go ahead where ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Go ahead about those dark old days of ignorance and fear and compulsion . It makes my flesh creep ? and I 'm just like the fat boy , I like to have my flesh creep . ALVIN : What fat boy ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : The one in Pickwick Papers . ( Silence from Alvin . ) You know , Pickwick Papers . ( Silence from Alvin . ) It 's a book , son ? a book by Charles Dickens . Ever read any Dickens ? ? ALVIN : Oh , sure , sure . I read the Tale of Two Cities in high school . And Oliver Twist ? well , really I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustrated Classics . And I saw Great Expectations in the movies . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Why , you and Dickens are old friends . But go on about the ? the schools of yesteryear . ALVIN : Well , I will , Uncle Wadsworth . After all , it 's only because I 'm lucky enough to be born now that I did n't have to go to one of those schools myself . I can just see myself trudging to school barefoot in my overalls ? because they did n't even have school busses in those days , you know UNCLE WADSWORTH : Not a one ! If a school bus had come for me I 'd have thought it was a patrol wagon someone had painted orange for Halloween . ALVIN : Well , there I am trudging along , and I 'm not only trudging , I 'm limping . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Stub your toe ? ALVIN : Stub my toe ! I 'm limping because I 'm sore ? sore all over , where the teacher beat me . UNCLE WADSWORTH : All over is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ALVIN : All right , all right . And when I get to the school is it the Consolidated School ? is there a lunchroom and a chute-the-chute and a jungle-gym ? is it ? is it like schools ought to be ? Uh-uh ! That school has one room , and it 's red . UNCLE WADSWORTH : You mean even in those days the CommunistsALVIN : No , no , not Red , red ! Red like a barn . And when I get inside the teacher is an old maid that looks like a broomstick , or else a man that looks like a ? that looks like Ichabod Crane . And then this Crane-type teacher says to me , real stern : " Alvin McKinley , stand up ! Are you aware , Alvin , that ; it is three minutes past seven ? " UNCLE WADSWORTH : Three minutes past seven ! What are you and Ichabod Crane doing at school at that ungodly hour ? ALVIN : That 's when school starts then ! Or six , maybe . . . . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible voice : " Three minutes tardy ! And what , Alvin , did I warn you would happen to you if you ever again were so much as one minute tardy ? What did I tell you that I would do to you ? " And I say in a little meek voice , because I 'm scared , I say : " Whip me . " And he says : " Yes , whip you ! " And I say UNCLE WADSWORTH : You say , ' Oh , do n't whip pore Uncle Tom , massa ! If only you wo n't whip him he wo n't never ? " ALVIN : Oh , stop it , Uncle Wadsworth . That 's not what I say at all , and you know it . Anyway , I say , " Please , Mr. Crane , it was four miles , and I had the cows to milk , and Ma was sick and I had to help Sister cook the hoe-cakes ? " UNCLE WADSWORTH : Hoe-cakes ! ( with slow relish . ) Hoe-cakes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . How 'd you hear about hoe-cakes , Alvin boy ? ALVIN : Uncle Wadsworth , if you keep interrupting me about irrelu-drreluvuncies , how can I get anywhere ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : I apologize , Alvin ; I am silent , Alvin . ALVIN : Then he looks at me and he smiles like ? like somebody in Dick Tracy , and he says : Alvin , spare your breath , And then he walks over to the corner next to the stove , and do you know what 's in the corner ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : What 's in the corner ? ALVIN : Sticks . Sticks of every size . Hundreds of sticks . And then he takes the biggest one and ? andUNCLE WADSWORTH : And ? andALVIN : And he beats me . UNCLE WADSWORTH ( with a big sigh ) : The Lord be praised ! For a minute I was afraid he was going to burn you at the stake . But go ahead , Alvin . ALVIN : Go ahead ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : It 's still just ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-day ? your dear old golden rule day . ALVIN : Well , then he says : " Take your Readers ! " And I look around and everybody in the room , from little kids just six years old with their front teeth out to great big ones , grown men practically that look like they ought to be on the Chicago Bears ? everybody in the room picks up the same book and they all start reading aloud out of the McGuffey Reader ! Hah-hah-hah ! UNCLE WADSWORTH : And why , Alvin , do you laugh ? ALVIN : Because it 's funny , that 's why ! UNCLE WADSWORTH : Have you ever seen a McGuffey Reader ? ALVIN : How could I of , Uncle Wadsworth ? I did n't go to school back in those days . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Your account was so vivid that for a moment I forgot that . . . you 've never seen such a Readet . Well , I have . ALVIN : Sure , sure ? you used one , did n't you ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not ; nor did I ever shake the hand of Robert . E. Lee , nor did I fight in the War of 1812 , nor did I get to see Adam and . Eve and the Serpent . ALVIN : I 'm sorry , Uncle Wadsworth . UNCLE WADSWORTH : No need , no need . , ? Alvin , if you will go over to the book-case and reach into the right hand corner of the lowest shelf , you will find a book ? a faded , reddish-brown , dusty book . ALVIN : Here it is . It says Appletons ' Fifth Reader . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Exactly . Appletons ' Fifth Reader . Week before last side by side with a bottle-green brandy-flask bearing the features of the father of our country , George Washington , I found this Reader . ALVIN : Look how yellow the paper is ! And brown spots all over it . . . . Gee , they must have used it all over the country : it says New York , Boston , and Chicago , 1880 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those old engravings . I guess they did n't have photographs in those days . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Guess again , Alvin boy . And what is the subject of this old engraving ? ALVIN : A girl with a bucket , and somebody is plowing , and it 's dawn . And there 's some poetry underneath . UNCLE . WADSWORTH : While the plowman near at hand Whistles o'er the furrowed land And the milkmaid singeth blithe . . ALVIN : That 's right ! You mean to say you memorized it ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Forty years ago , Alvin . Does n't any of it have a ? a familiar ring ? ALVIN : Well , to tell the truth , Uncle Wadsworth . . . UNCLE WADSWORTH : What does it say in small letters down in the right-hand corner of the page ? ALVIN : It says . . . " L'Allegro , page 420 . " , " L'Allegro ' 1 ! Sure ! Sure ! Why , I read it in sophomore English ; we spent two whole days on that poem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're by John Milton . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Yes , Milton . And in that sameALVIN : But Uncle Wadsworth , you do n't mean to say they had Milton in a fifth grade Reader ! Why , we were sophomores in college , and there were two football players that were juniors , and believe me , it was all Professor Taylor could do to get us through that poem . How could little kids in the fifth grade read Milton ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Sit down , Alvin . Do you remember reading Gray 's " Elegy " ? ALVIN : Sure , I remember that one ; I liked that one . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Well , Alvin , that very poemALVIN : Oh no , Uncle Wadsworth ! You 're not going to tell me that poem was in a fifth reader ! UNCLE WADSWORTH : No , Alvin , I am not . I want you to .. to steel yourself . That poem was not in Appletons ' Fifth Reader , that poem was in Appletons ' Fourth Reader . ( Alvin groans in awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophomore English ? ALVIN ( lifelessly ) : Uh-huh . UNCLE WADSWORTH : There are four of Wordsworth 's poems in Appleton 's ' Fourth Reader . ALVIN : I guess in the sixth grade they were reading Einstein . UNCLE WADSWORTH : No , but in the fifth reader ? run your eye down the table of contents , Alvin ? there are selections by Addison , Bishop Berkeley , . Bunyan , Byron , Coleridge ? the whole Ancient Mariner , Alvin ? Defoe , de Quincey , Dickens , Emerson , Fielding , Hawthorne , George Herbert , Hazlitt , Dr. Johnson , Jefferson , Shakespeare , Shelley , Sterne , Swift , Tennyson , Thoreau , Mark TwainALVIN : It 's hard to believe . UNCLE WADSWORTH : And there are also selections from simpler writersALviN : Yeah , simple ones .. . UNCLE WADSWORTH : . . . Simpler writers such as Scott , Burns , Longfellow , Cooper , Audubon , Poe , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Benjamin Franklin , Washington Irving . Alvin , have you ever ? at college perhaps ? ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Well , Alvin boy , if , after milking the cow and baking the hoe-cakes , you had limped four miles barefoot to that one-room red schoolhouse of yours , and been beaten by that Ichabod Crane of a teacher , you would still have got to read , in your Appletons ' Fifth Reader , one poem and five pages of prose from Wilhelm Meister . . . As it is you do n't limp , nobody beats you , and you read ? Whom do you read , Alvin ? Tell me some of the writers you read in the fifth grade . ALVIN : I do n't exactly remember their names . UNCLE WADSWORTH : There in , the book-case is the Fifth Reader of today . Days and Deeds , it is called ; it is , I believe , the most popular fifth reader in the country . That 's right , hand it over . Here on page 3 is its table of contents ; come , Alvin , read out to me the names of the writers from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature . ALWN : Well , the first one 's Fletcher D. Slater , and then Nora Burglon , and Sterling North and Ruth G. PlowheadUNCLE WADSWORTH : Plowhead ? ALVIN : That 's what it says . Then Ruth E. Kennell , Gertrude Robinson , P. A. Rollins , J. Walker McSpadden , Merlin M. ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : You 're sure you 're not making up some of these names ? ALVIN : How could I ? Merlin M. Taylor , Sanford Tousey , Gladys M. Wick , Marie Barton , Margaret Leighton , Edward C. James ? no , Janes , Leonard K. Smith , P. L. Travers , Esther Shepherd , James C Bowman , Dr. SeussUNCLE WADsWORTH : Land ! Land ! ALVIN : No , Seuss . Seuss . UNCLE WADSWORTH : I speak figuratively . I mean that here , at last , is a name I recognize , ALVIN : Oh . .. Then there 's Armstrong Sperry , Myra . ' M. Dodds , Alden G. Stevens , Lavinia R. Davis , Lucy M. Crockett , Raymond Janson , Hubert Evans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Boy Scouts . An Indian , no doubt . . . . Never heard of him . ALVIN : Heard of them . There 're three of them . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Three ? Thirty ! Three hundred ! They 're all Boy Scouts ! Alvin , these are names only a mother could love ? names only a mother would know . That they are honest names , respected names , the names of worthy citizens , I have not the slightest doubt ; but when I reflect that it is these names that have replaced those of Goethe , of Shakespeare , of Swift , of Cervantes , of Dr. Johnson ? of all the other great and good writers of The Appleton Fifth Reader ? when I think of this , Alvin , I am confused , I am dismayed . I am astounded . ALVIN : Uncle Wadsworth , you 've got all red in the face . UNCLE WADSWORTH : There are also in The Appleton Fifth Reader , Alvin , analyses of the style , rhetoric , and organization of the literary works included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the most effective ways of reading them aloud ; discussions of their scansion ; careful considerations of etymology , spelling , pronunciation , the general development of the English language . All . these are not written in the pre-digested baby-talk thought appropriate for children today . Here is one of the Fifth Reader 's typical discussions of logic . The question here involved is the old sophism of Eubulides .... It will he noticed that the perplexity comes Rom the fact of self-relation ; the one assertion relates to another assertion of the same person ; and the one assertion being conditioned upon the other , the difficulty arises . It is the question of self-contradiction -- of two mutually contradictory statements , one must be false . It is a sophism , but one that continually occurs among unsophisticated reasoners . All universal negative assertions ( and a lie is a negation ) are liable to involve the assertion itself in self-contradiction . ALVIN : Ohhhh . . . Ohhhhh ? . . . If I 'd gone to school then I 'd have known what that means in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or else you never would have got into the sixth grade . ALVIN : Well , I 'd be the oldest settler in the fifth grade , then , because I 'm a senior in college and I still ca n't understand it . UNCLE WADsWORTH : Yes , it is surprising what those fifth-graders were expected to know . The Reader contains a little essay called " Hidden Beauties of Classic Authors , " by an author named N. P. Willis . THE NEW REPUBLIC ALVIN : N. P. Willis .. . I guess he was Ruth G. Plow-head 's grandpa . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Yes , he is n't exactly a classic author himself . He tells you how he fell in love with the Faerie Queene , and Comas , and The Rape of the Lock ; he says that he knows " no more exquisite sensation than this warming of the heart to an old author ; and it seems to me that the most delicious portion of intellectual existence is the brief period in which , one by one , the great minds . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections . " Well , at the end of the essay there 're some questions ; what do you think is the first thing they ask those fifth-graders ? ALVIN : What ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : " Have you read Milton 's Comus ? Pope 's Rape of the Lock ? " ALVIN : Now Uncle Wadsworth , you 've got to admit that 's a terrible thing to ask a little boy in the fifth grade . UNCLE WADSWORTH : I think it 's a terrible thing . But they did n't . As a matter of fact , I think it 's a terrible thing to ask a big boy in his senior year in college . How about it , Alvin ? Have you read Milton 's Comus ? Pope 's Rape of the Lock ? ALVIN : Well , to tell you the truth , Uncle Wadsworth- , UNCLE WADSWORTH : Tell ahead . ALVIN : , Well , to ? well ? well , it just is n't the sort of question you can ' answer yes or no . I may have read Milton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of things like in our sophomore survey course ; I guess the chances are ten to one I read it , and two years ago I could have told you for certain whether or not I read it , but right now all I can say is if I did n't read it , it would surprise me a lot . UNCLE WADSWORTH : And The Rape of the Lock ? ALVIN : No . UNCLE WADSWORTH : No ? You mean you know you did n't read it ? ALVIN : Uh-huh . UNCLE WADSWORTH : How do you know ? ALVIN : I UNCLE WADSWORTH : Go on , go on . ALVIN : Well , Uncle Wadsworth , it seems to me that , a book with a title like that , if I 'd read it I 'd remember it . . . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Alvin , if you were n't my own nephew I 'd ? I 'd be proud to , have invented you . . .. Here 's another of those poems , the kind that you read in your sophomore year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader . Read it to me , Alvin ; and when you 've read it , tell me what it means . ALVIN : ( in careful singsong ) : Sunday . By George Herbert . 0 Day most calm , most bright , The fruit of this , the next world 's bud ; The endorsement of supreme delight , Writ by a Friend , and with his blood ; The couch of Time : Care 's calm and bay : The week were dark but for thy light ; The torch cloth show the way . The other days and thou Make up one man , whose face thou art , Knocking at heaven with thy brow : The working-days are the back part ; The burden of the week lies there ; Making the whole to stoop and bow , Till thy release appear . Man had ? man had Uncle Wadsworth , I 'm all mixed up . I 've been all mixed up . And if you ask me that fifth grade was mixed up too . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Where did you first begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . UNCLE WADSWORTH : Surely the first lineALVIN : Yeah . Yeah . The first line was all right . 0 Day most calm , most bright ! That means it 's Sunday , and it 's all calm and bright , the weather 's all calm and bright . Then it says , The fruit of this . . . The fruit of this . What 's the fruit of this ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : The fruit of this , the next world 's bud ? world is understood . ALVIN : Oh . . . The endorsement of supreme delight . ( Pauses ) The endorsement of supreme delight . . . Uncle Wadsworth , a line like that ? you 've got to admit a line like that 's obscure . UNCLE WADSWORTH : It means that ? it says that Sunday is like the endorsement of a check or note ; because of the endorsement this supreme delight , our salvation , is negotiable , we can cash it . ALVIN : Oh . . . Writ by a Friend ? Friend 's got a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written by a Quaker . ( Uncle Wadsworth laughs . ) But that 's what it does mean . If Friend does n't mean Quaker why 's it got a capital F ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Writ by a Friend , and with his blood . If you 're talking about church and Sunday and the next world and mention a Friend who has written something with his blood , who is that Friend , Alvin ? ALVIN : Oh .. . The couch of Time ; Care 's calm and bay . . . ( Pauses . ) Uncle Wadsworth , do we have to read poetry ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Of course not , Alvin . Nobody else reads poetry , why should we ? Let 's get back to prose . Here 's the way the Fifth Reader talks about climbing a mountain : Some part of the beholder , , even some vital part , seems to escape through the loose grating of his ribs as he ascends . . . . Vast , Titanic , inhuman Nature has got him at disadvantage , caught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty . She does not smile on him as in the plains . She seems to say sternly , " Why came ye here before your time ? . . . Why seek me where I have not called you , and then complain because you find me but a step-mother ? Shouldst thou freeze , or starve , or shudder thy life away , here is no shrine , nor altar , nor any , access to my ear . ' Chaos and ancient Night , I come no spy/With purpose to explore or to disturb/The secrets of your realm ? ' " ALVIN : Uncle Wadsworth , if the prose is like that , I 'd just as soon have stayed with the poetry . Did n't they have any plain American Writers in that Fifth Reader ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Plain American writers ? ? That was Thoreau I was reading you . Well , if he 's too hard , here 's what the Fifth Reader has to say about him . Its talking about his account of the battle between the black ants and the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the herdic style NOVEMBER 19 , 1956 of Homer 's Iliad , and is properly a " mock-heroic . " The intention of the author is two-fold : half-seriously endowing the incidents of everyday life with epic dignity , in the belief that there is nothing mean and trivial to the poet and philosopher , and that it is the man that adds dignity to the occasion , and not the occasion that dignifies the man ; half-satirically treating the human events alluded to as though they were non-heroic , and only fit to be applied to the events of animal life . ALVIN ( wonderingly ) : Why , it 's just like old Taylor ! UNCLE WADSWORTH : Professor Taylor would lecture to you in that style ? ALVIN : He 'd get going that way , and pretty soon he 'd see we did n't know what he meant , and then he 'd talk so we could understand him . . . . Well , if The Fifth Reader sounds like that about ants , I sure do n't want to hear it about scansion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to be able to understand it ? Do n't you wish you 'd had it in the fifth grade , and known what it was talking about ? ALVIN : I guess I do ! Boy , would I have made old Taylor 's eyes pop out ! All we ever had in the fifth grade was Boy Scouts going on hikes , and kids going to see their grandmother for Thanksgiving ; it was easy . UNCLE WADSWORTH ' : And interesting ? ALVIN : Nab , it was corny ? the same old stuff ; how can you make stuff like that interesting ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : How indeed ? ALVIN : But how did things like Shakespeare and Goethe and Dickens ever get in a fifth grade reader ? UNCLE WADSWORTH : Alvin , they 've always been there . Yesterday , here in the United States , those things were in the fifth reader ; today , everywhere else in the world , those things or their equivalent are in the fifth reader ; it is only here in the United States , ' today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Run , by Ruth G. Plowhead , and A Midnight Lion Hunt , by Three Boy Scouts . I read , in a recent bestseller , this sentence : " For the first time in history Americans see their children getting less education than they got themselves . " That may be ; and certainly for the first time in history Americans see a book on why their children ca n't read becoming a national best-seller , being serialized in newspapers across the nation . Alvin , about school-buildings , health , lunches , civic responsibility , kindness , good humor , spontaneity , we have nothing to learn from the schools of the past ; but about reading , with ease and understanding , the best that has been thought and said in the world ? about that we have much to learn . The child who reads and understands The Appleton Fifth Reader is well on the way to becoming an educated , cultivated human being ? and if he has to do it sitting ? in a one-room schoolhouse , if he has to do it sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off than a boy sitting in the Pentagon reading Days and Deeds . Here 's a jug of cider and two glasses ; Alvin , let 's drink a toast toALVIN : . . . to The Appleton Fifth Reader ! Long may she read ! The Life and Death of Thomas Wolfe by Malcolm Cowley N the summer of 1931 , Thomas Wolfe was living in the Assyrian quarter of Brooklyn , alone as always . lie was trying hard to write a second novel , while spending some of his nights with an attractive young woman in Manhattan . At last she wrote him one of those serious letters which , for lovers both living on the subway circuit , foreThe Letters of ? Thomas Wolfe , collected and edited by Elizabeth Nowell ( Scribner 's ; $10 ) . shadow either marriage or the end of an affair . Wolfe was n't looking forward to either alternative , but he did n't rush over to see the young woman , as she doubtless hoped he would do . Instead he wrote . another serious letter that began : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my first impulse on reading it was to call you up right away . But your letter seemed so fine and clear . to me that I thought I would try to answer you in ? the same way , before talking to you , and I wonder that I did not try it before ? this is my usual means of expression ? paper and pencil  - -  - and I believe I can be much more direct and less confused in this way than in conversation . The letter went on for more than 20 pages of Wolfe 's urgent scrawl . It was admirably frank and considerate , and it said at great length what could have been said less clearly , but more effectively for his purpose , in a few stamrhered words and an embrace . Wolfe was never - completely at home in those other languages that most persons employ in most of their intimate relations : the language of gestures , the language of hints and indirections . He was completely articulate only when he had a pencil in his long fingers , but then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . He thought as if with the pencil as it raced over sheet after sheet . Sometimes he wrote a letter to discover how he felt , and it might even be the writing that gave birth to his feelings . There are letters in which he started calmly , grew angry as he wrote , then furious , but overcame his rage in expressing it and was reconciled before the sprawled signature . Some of his most revealing letters were never mailed , but they had served a purpose ; they satisfied his passion for digesting every experience into written words . " - What he wrote he saved , as other persons save money or heirlooms or press clippings and photographs . This particular letter , not one of the unmailed ones , has a history that casts light on more than one aspect of Wolfe 's character . After the affair was broken off , he demanded that the letter be returned ? perhaps because he was afraid that the young woman would use it against him , for he had periods of unreasoning suspicion ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubtless he thought that it might eventually be used in a. section of the many-volumed novel ? " the book , " as he called it ? in which he tried to include
