Stripped to essentials , Fiasco is simply another novel about earthlings attempting to contact aliens in outer space . Yet those who have read any of Polish Author Stanislaw Lem 's numerous books know that even the most timeworn subject can be the occasion for fresh surprises . Lem 's international reputation rests on two qualities rarely found together in one mortal : he is both a superb literary fantasist , a la Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino , and a knowledgeable philosopher of the means and meanings of technology . Lem , 65 , not only builds castles in the air , he also provides meticulous blueprints and rationales for their construction . <P> Hence the ambitious expedition , sometime in the 22nd century , of the Eurydice , a mile-long , billion-ton spaceship that is trying to touch base with the inhabitants of Quinta , the " fifth planet of the sixth sun " in the constellation Harpy . The earthly powers cooperate in funding and launching this enterprise because all other attempts to detect intelligent life elsewhere in the universe have failed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for meaningful radio signals yielded nothing but static and was folly besides . The new theory favors the " window of contact , " the relatively brief span during which any civilization achieves industrial know-how and then either destroys itself or lapses into self-absorbed silence . As a physicist aboard the Eurydice explains , " Intelligence , in diapers , is invisible . And when it matures , out the window it flies . We have to pounce on it earlier . " <P> Quinta seems , from terrestrial observations , a promising target , and getting there is half of Lem 's fun . The Eurydice is constructed in orbit around a moon of Saturn ; its thermonuclear flowstream engines use hydrogen intake as fuel and can achieve a velocity of 99% the speed of light . While the scout ship Hermes , weighing a mere 180,000 tons , is sent off to reconnoiter Quinta , the Eurydice lingers in the vicinity of a black hole . When Hermes returns , the mother ship will execute an " incomprehensible maneuver called ' passage through a retrochronal toroid , ' thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun barely eight years after takeoff . Without that passage she would return 2,000 years later , which would be no return at all . " <P> Lem 's imaginative physics is consistently beguiling . But the elegant planning and wondrous machines he describes fail to anticipate a simple problem : the Quintans do not want to talk . Flying high above the planet , the crew of Hermes can see signs of a highly advanced society . But attempts to communicate are met first with silence and then with hostility ; unmanned probes carrying messages of peace are attacked . The earthmen begin to wonder whether the planners of their glorious mission " had invested billions and lifted mountains in order to find a civilization gone berserk . " <P> The Hermes has the power to force Quinta to respond or to destroy it , but such a victory would constitute a defeat . One crew member tells the captain , " Whatever you do  --  if you do not retreat  --  will result in a fiasco . " ( The captain has grown increasingly pessimistic : " Any detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like pieces of a broken mirror , would not yield a coherent picture ; they were the indistinct result , only , of the thing that had shattered it . "
