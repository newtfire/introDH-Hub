Counsel Frank Moss of the Legislative Investigating Committee denied yesterday the story that Mrs. Richard Croker had been subpoenaed to appear before the committee on Saturday . His denial was repeated by Chairman Mazet , who said that the committee has , and has had , no idea of summoning Mrs. Croker . Mr. Moss said : " We have no intentktin and we never have had any intention to subpoena Mrs. Croker as a witness . There are limits beyond which even a legislative investigating committee may not transgress . " As to the report that Mrs. Croker had made some revelations to him , Mr. Moss said : " Mrs. Croker came to my office Friday at her own instance . She asked me if she might be present at the hearing before the committee as a spectator , and I told her ' Certainly . ' She told me some things that may be of service to the investigating committee , and I have them stored away in my mind . I consider Mrs. Croker 's statements to me as entirely confidential , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is said that the first intimation Chairman Mazet had of Mrs. Croker 's presence in the County Court House Saturday was when a card was handed to him while he was presiding at the investigation . He then requested that she wait for a few moments , and he would see her . It is believed by the members of the committee that her visit to Mr. Moss and to the Court House was due entirely to some natural anxiety about the effect of the subpoena that had been sent out for her son , Frank Croker . The committee will meet at lO o'clock this morning in the rooms of the Board of Trade and Transportation , Mail and Express I3uilding . Chief of Police Devery will be again on the stand , to be examined as JO the gambling houses , pool rooms , and policy shops that are running , and the saloons that keep open after hours .

Mr. Moss said that he did not know whether he would summon as a witness Cornelius Daly , known as " Con " Daly . Mr. Daly is the saloon owner and real estate dealer who Mr. Tostevin testified had asked him for 52,000 in return for his influence with the Building Department . Mr. Moss said that probably all Mr. Daly would say would be to deny Mr. Tostevin 's testimony . It was reported , however , that subpoenas had been issued for both Daly and John A. Dooner , Superintendent of the Building *Department , and that Mr. Dooner could not be found by the officer . Richard Croker said last night that he did not care to discuss the subject of Mrs. Croker 's visit to Mr. Moss or the investigation .

Cornelius Daly was not at his home during the afternoon or evening , nor at his real estate office . At his saloon the waiter on duty said he did notknow where his employer was . " Mr. Daly was here a while ago . " he said . " but went away . " Thomas J. Brady .
