The speaker was addressing the assemblage in Latin , Wolfe recalled . And to his further amazement , the students in the audience were laughing and applauding , apparently at the appropriate places . Such erudition ! Wolfe learned later that the whole thing was an ' ' earnest and learned charade . ' ' The speaker had never studied Latin , and the audience was following a written script. // // Many may think the episode an apt sign of the state of the classics in America . But the approximately 300 Latin teachers and scholars gathered at Columbia early this month were of a more hopeful mind . To be sure , there was lamenting of bygone glory : Bishop Edward M. Egan of New York described in moving terms a Latin education that is no more . Yet , after many decades of decline - high school Latin enrollments reached a peak of nearly a million in the 1930s , then plummeted to 150 , 000 by 1976 - the graph is inching upward again . Major cities such as Chicago , Philadelphia , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin in the elementary grades to develop language skills , and teachers are finding new utility in the polyglot inner-city schools for the language that once united ' ' all Christendom . ' ' New York City , which had but one fully licensed Latin teacher during the last six years , is adding six more this fall. // ' ' We are here to enthuse a little bit , ' ' said Edmee Slocum , executive director of the Wethersfield Institute , the New York-based foundation that promotes Latin , which sponsored the event. // ' ' The survival of the Latinate tradition may be in North America , ' ' rather than in Europe , said Prof. George Kennedy of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. // One sign of the prevailing enthusiasm was a packed house at 9 : 30 a. m. on Sunday morning ( mirabile dictu ) to hear a panel of teachers talk about their methods . The tedious drills in noun declensions and verb conjugations that many remember from high school ( ' ' haberdashers of moods and tenses , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going by the board . Marion Polsky , a live wire who helped design New York City ' s ' ' Cornerstone ' ' Latin program for elementary schools , said they are teaching Latin much more like the way modern languages are taught . Students ' ' hear it first , ' ' and learn the grammar by using it . Latin is a ' ' joy to teach ' ' this way , she said. // The radical of the group was the Reverend Mr. Reginald Foster , who teaches at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome . With his shining pate and slate-blue garb , Fr . Foster had few accoutrements of ' ' personality , ' ' but he lit up the room nevertheless . ' ' No text . No grades . No exams , ' ' he said of his classes . He ' ' passes over in silence ' ' the tables of declensions and conjugations . The only book his students bring to class is a dictionary .

' ' You can see Qaddafi in Cataline ( a Roman conspirator ) , ' ' said Sara Rayburn during a morning break . She teaches Latin at the Dwight School on New York ' s Upper East Side . ' ' The Helvetians ' ' - a Celtic tribe that Caesar conquered - ' ' were sort of like the American Indians . Cicero on Cataline was a little like Reagan on Libya . He was telling them , ' Act now . Don ' t wait. ' ' ' // ' ' See ? The problems of today are no different.

( ' ' If you learn it , you will love it , ' ' one wrote . ) Yet , it is a cultural dimension that appears to make the language especially valuable in urban schools : // ' ' It ' s a leveler , ' ' Polsky said . For once , children from Hispanic households ' ' start out on the same footing ' ' with their Anglo classmates . If anything , Hispanics have a slight advantage because Spanish , like other Romance languages , is closer to the Latin root . When Polsky gives her students Latin names , she says , it plays down somewhat their ethnic and racial divisions , thus reviving in a small way the ancient dream of Latin as a lingua franca among the Babel of the world ' s languages. // Why a Latin revival at this time ?

Ben Franklin , our patron pragmatist , bashed the classics primarily for this reason , and Tom Wolfe cited economist Thorstein Veblen ' s observation that they ' ' serve to lower the economic efficiency of the new learned generation. ' ' // The cultural badge has not disappeared entirely , however . Latin ' ' is refined , ' ' Wolfe exclaimed . ' ' It goes along with the Mercedes and BMWs and exercise classes. ' ' // Sara Rayburn mentioned the next day that she gins up interest in her well-to-do students by reminding them that if they become successful doctors , they will surely want to be able to discuss an opera such as ' ' Dido and Aeneas ' ' intelligently with their patients . But if upward mobility is driving the train , then Wolfe advised the assemblage to ride it anyway . ' ' If the rebirth has to take place in the presence of flying , prostrate forms of bond traders , arbitrageurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he concluded , ' ' it ' s all to the good . Let your eye wander to the longer run , and hope for the best. ' ' // //
