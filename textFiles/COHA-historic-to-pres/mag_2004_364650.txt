Muqtada ! Muqtada ! Muqtada ! " The chants of the faithful drown out the gunfire around the mosque in Kufa . Thousands have gathered to hear Muqtada al-Sadr , Iraq 's best-known rebel cleric , lead Friday prayers . A fire fight is raging for control of a nearby bridge , between members of al-Sadr 's Mahdi Army and U.S. forces . There 's another battle up the road in al-Sadr 's hometown , Najaf . As the mosque broadcasts reports of glorious victories over U.S. tanks , the worshippers seem unmoved by the fighting . " The U.S. troops do this every Friday , " says one of the faithful , Sheik Halim al-Fatlawi . " The Americans want to terrorize us into not coming to prayers . " <P> For the past six weeks , Kufa and the two cities that house the holiest shrines of Shi'as , Najaf and Karbala , have been the center of al-Sadr 's revolt . His militia claim to be protecting the shrines from U.S. forces that have besieged the cities . U.S. commanders insist al-Sadr is a small-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry young men . But judging by the number and intensity of worshippers thronging the mosque in Kufa last Friday , the U.S. may be underestimating the rebel leader . In fact , the more the U.S. aims its guns at al-Sadr , the more popular he seems to become . According to a recent poll , he is now second in popularity to the Grand Ayatullah Ali Husaini Sistani , the Shi'ites ' spiritual leader . <P> Al-Sadr 's adherents use their intimate knowledge of the terrain to outwit the Americans . As supporters stream from Baghdad 90 miles south to Kufa for Friday prayers , U.S. troops finally manage to cut the road just outside the city . In response , locals begin flagging down approaching cars , warning drivers of the checkpoints ahead and showing them how to avoid the blockade by taking a circuitous side route . Later , when U.S. troops close the road between Kufa and Najaf , prayergoers snake around back streets , along dusty trails and through a massive garbage dump . The mounds of trash give cars almost perfect cover as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd at the mosque erupts when al-Sadr appears . At 30 , he is pudgy and pale faced . He stands at the lectern draped in his burial shroud , a symbol of his determination to die for his faith . He reads his address at high speed , his head down , his body occasionally rocking from side to side . Al-Sadr speaks to the crowd with no rhetorical flourishes or demagogic appeals but makes his purpose plain just the same . He takes a swipe at the Shi'ite hierarchy , which has withheld its support for his uprising . " When I die , " he says , " do n't let my death stop the resistance . Continue with the struggle and never disband the Mahdi Army . " <P> Al-Sadr seems almost to be courting death at U.S. hands , knowing that it , more than anything else , would spark a broad Shi'ite insurgency . His followers call him " the living shahid , " or martyr , according to Fatah al-Sheikh , editor of the pro  --  al-Sadr newspaper Ishraqatal Sadr . If the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faced with a " revolution that will never end . " Al-Sadr 's supporters , he adds , " will kill all Americans , civilians or otherwise . "
