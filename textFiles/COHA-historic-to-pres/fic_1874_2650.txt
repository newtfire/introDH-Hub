Not the intrinsic merits of this story embolden me to inscribe it to you , my dear friend , but the fact that you , more than any other man , are responsible for its writing . Your advice and encouragement first led me to book-making ; so it is only fair that you should partake of whatever obloquy ( or honor ) the practice may bring upon me . The ensuing pages may incline you to suspect their author of a repugnance to unvarnished truth ; but ,  - -  without prejudice to Othello ,  - -  since varnish brings out in wood veins of beauty invisible before the application , why not also in the sober facts of life ? When the transparent artifice has been penetrated , the familiar substance underneath will be greeted none the less kindly ; nay , the observer will perhaps regard the disguise as an oblique compliment to his powers of insight , and his attention may thus be better secured than had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-of-fact life has moods when the light of romance seems to gild its earthen chimney-pots into fairy minarets ; and , were the story-teller but sure of laying his hands upon the true gold , perhaps the more his story had of it , the better . Here , however , comes in the grand difficulty ; fact nor fancy is often reproduced in true colors ; and while attempting justly to combine life 's elements , the writer has to beware that they be not mere cheap imitations thereof . Not seldom does it happen that what he proffers as genuine arcana of imagination and philosophy affects the reader as a dose of Hieroglyphics and Balderdash . Nevertheless , the first duty of the fiction-monger -- no less than of the photographic artist doomed to produce successful portraits of children-in-arms -- is , to be amusing ; to shrink at no shifts which shall beguile the patient into procrastinating escape until the moment be gone by . The gentle reader will not too sternly set his face against such artifices , but , so they go not the length of fantastically presenting phenomena inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own beguilement . The performance once over , let him , if so inclined , strip the feathers from the flights of imagination , and wash the color from the incidents ; if aught save the driest and most ordinary matters of fact reward his researches , then let him be offended ! De te fabula does not apply here , my dear friend ; for you will show me more indulgence than I have skill to demand . And should you find matter of interest in this book , yours , rather than the author 's , will be the merit . As the beauty of nature is from the eye that looks upon her , so would the story be dull and barren , save for the life and color of the reader 's sympathy . Yours most sincerely , JULIAN HAWTHORNE . IDOLATRY I. THE ENCHANTED RING . One of the most imposing buildings in Boston twenty years ago was a granite hotel , whose western windows looked upon a graveyard . Passing up a flight of steps , and beneath a portico of dignified granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roomy vestibule , you would there pause a moment to spit upon the black-and-white tessellated pavement . Having thus asserted your title to Puritan ancestry , and to the best accommodations the house afforded , you would approach the desk and write your name in the hotel register . This done , you would be apt to run your eye over the last dozen arrivals , on the chance of lighting upon the autograph of some acquaintance , to be shunned or sought according to circumstances . Let us suppose , for the story 's sake , that such was the gentle reader 's behavior on a certain night during the latter part of May , in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-three . If now he will turn to the ninety-ninth page of the register above mentioned , he will remark that the last name thereon written is , " Doctor Hiero Glyphic . Room 27 . " The natural inference is that , unless so odd a name be an assumed one , Doctor Glyphic occupies that room . Passing on to page one hundred , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helwyse , Cosmopolis . Room 29 . " In no trifling mood do we call attention to these two names , and , above all , to their relative position in the book . Had they both appeared upon the same page , this romance might never have been written . On such seemingly frail pegs hang consequences the most weighty . Because Doctor Glyphic preferred the humble foot of the ninety-ninth page to the trouble of turning to a leading position on the one hundredth ; because Mr. Helwyse , having begun the one hundredth page , was too incurious to find out who was his next-door neighbor on the ninety-ninth , ensued unparalleled adventures , and this account of them . Our present purpose , by the reader 's leave , and in his company , is to violate Doctor Hiero Glyphic 's retirement , as he lies asleep in bed . Nor shall we stop at his bedside ; we mean to penetrate deep into the darksome caves of his memory , and to drag forth thence sundry odd-looking secrets , which shall blink and look strangely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes should ever behold them ! Yet will he not resent our , intrusion ; it is twenty years ago ,  - -  and he lies asleep . Two o'clock sounds from the neighboring steeple of the Old South Church , as we noiselessly enter the chamber ,  - -  noiselessly , for the hush of the past is about us . We scarcely distinguish anything at first ; the moon has set on the other side of the hotel , and perhaps , too , some of the dimness of those twenty intervening years affects our eyesight . By degrees , however , objects begin to define themselves ; the bed shows doubtfully white , and that dark blot upon the pillow must be the face of our sleeping man . It is turned towards the window ; the mouth is open ; probably the good Doctor is snoring , albeit , across this distance of time , the sound fails to reach us . The room is as bare , square , and characterless as other hotel rooms ; nevertheless , its occupant may have left a hint or two of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no trunks or other luggage ; evidently he will be on his way again to-morrow . The window is shut , although the night is warm and clear . The door is carefully locked . The Doctor 's garments , which appear to be of rather a jaunty and knowing cut , are lying disorderly about , on chair , table , or floor . He carries no watch ; but under his pillow we see protruding the corner of a great leathern pocket-book , which might contain a fortune in bank-notes . A couple of chairs are drawn up to the bedside , upon one of which stands a blown-out candle ; the other supports an oblong , coffin-shaped box , narrower at one end than at the other , and painted black . Too small for a coffin , however ; no human corpse , at least , is contained in it . But the frame that lies so quiet and motionless here , thrills , when awaked to life , with a soul only less marvellous than man 's . In short , the coffin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Doctor must have been fiddling overnight , after getting into bed ; to the dissatisfaction , perhaps , of his neighbor on the other side of the partition . Little else in the room is worthy notice , unless it be the pocket-comb which has escaped from the Doctor 's waistcoat , and the shaving materials ( also pocketable ) upon the wash-stand . Apparently our friend does not stand upon much toilet ceremony . The room has nothing more of significance to say to us ; so now we come to the room 's occupant . Our eyes have got enough accustomed to the imperfect light to discern what manner of man he may be . Barely middle-aged ; or , at a second glance , he might be fifteen to twenty-five years older . His face retains the form of youth , yet wears a subtile shadow which we feel might be consistent even with extreme old age . The forehead is wide and low , supported by regular eyebrows ; the face beneath long and narrow , of a dark and dry complexion . In sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can readily imagine the waking face to be not devoid of a certain intensity and comeliness of aspect , marred , however , by an air of guarded anxiety which is apparent even now . We prattle of the dead past , and use to fancy that peace must dwell there , if nothing else . Only in the past , say we , is security from jostle , danger , and disturbance ; who would live at his ease must number his days backwards ; no charm so potent as the years , if read from right to left . Living in the past , prophecy and memory are at one ; care for the future can harass no man . Throw overboard that Jonah , Time , and the winds of fortune shall cease to buffet us . And more to the same effect . And yet it is not so . The past , if more real than the future , is no less so than the present ; the pain of a broken heart or head is never annihilated , but becomes part and parcel of eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly troubles have been over years ago , yet , as our fancy sees him , he is none the calmer or the happier for that . Observe him , how he mumbles inarticulately , and makes strengthless clutchings at the blanket with his long , slender fingers . But we delay too long over the external man , seeing that our avowed business is with the internal . A sleeping man is truly a helpless creature . They say that , if you take his hand in yours and ask him questions , he has no other choice than to answer -- or to awake . The Doctor -- as we know by virtue of the prophetic advantages just remarked upon -- will stay asleep for some hours yet . Or , if you are clairvoyant , you have but to fall in a trance , and lay a hand on his forehead , and you may read off his thoughts ,  - -  provided he does his thinking in his head . But the world is growing too wise , nowadays , to put faith in old woman 's nonsense like this . Again , there is -- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of photographic plate , whereon is registered , had we but eyes to read it , the complete history of itself . What an invaluable pair of eyes were that ! In vain , arraigned before them , would the criminal deny his guilt , the lover the soft impeachment . The whole scene would stand forth , photographed in fatal minuteness and indelibility upon face , hands , coat-sleeve , shirt-bosom . Mankind would be its own book of life , written in the primal hieroglyphic character ,  - -  the language understood by all . Vocal conversation would become obsolete , unless among a few superior persons able to discuss abstract ideas . We speak of these things only to smile at them ; far be it from us to insult the reader 's understanding by asking him to regard them seriously . But story-tellers labor under one disadvantage which is peculiar to their profession ,  - -  the necessity of omniscience . This tends to make them top arbitrary , leads them to disregard the modesty of nature and the harmonies of reason in their methods . They will pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , and for the truth of which they bring forward no evidence ; thus forcing the reader to reject , as lacking proper confirmation , what he would else , from its inherent grace or sprightliness , be happy to accept . That we shall be free from this reproach is rather our good fortune than our merit . It is by favor of our stars , not by virtue of our own , that we turn not aside from the plain path of truth to the by-ways of supernaturalism and improbability . Yet we refrain with difficulty from a breath of self-praise ; there is a proud and solid satisfaction in holding an unassailable position could we but catch the world 's eye , we would meet it calmly ! Let us hasten to introduce our talisman . You may see it at this very moment , encircling the third finger of Doctor Glyphic 's left hand ; in fact , it is neither more nor less than a quaint diamond ring . The stone , though not surprisingly large , is surpassingly pure and brilliant ; as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvels whence , in the dead of night , it got together so much celestial fire . Observe the setting ; the design is unique . Two fairy serpents -- one golden , the other fashioned from black meteoric iron -- are intertwined along their entire length , forming the hoop of the ring . Their heads approach the diamond from opposite sides , and each makes a mighty bite at it with his tiny jaws , studded with sharp little teeth . Thus their contest holds the stone firmly in place . The whole forms a pretty symbol of the human soul , battled for by the good and the evil principles . But the diamond seems , in its entirety , to be an awkward mouthful for either . The snakes are wrought with marvellous dexterity and finish ; each separate scale is distinguishable upon their glistening bodies , the wrinkling of the skin in the coils , the sparkling points of eyes , and the minute nostrils . Such works of art are not made nowadays ; the ring is an antique ,  - -  a relic of an age when skill was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . To deserve such a setting , the stone must have exceptional qualities . Let us take a closer look at it . Fortunately , its own lustre makes it visible in every part ; the minuteness of our scrutiny need be limited only by our power of eye . It is cut with many facets ,  - -  twenty- seven , if you choose to count them ; perhaps ( though we little credit such fantasies ) some mystic significance may be intended in this number . Concentrating now our attention upon any single facet , we see -- either inscribed upon its surface , or showing through from the interior of the stone -- a sort of monogram , or intricately designed character , not unlike the mysterious Chinese letters on tea-chests . Every facet has a similar figure , though no two are identical . But the central , the twenty-seventh facet , which is larger than the others , has an important peculiarity . Looking upon it , we find therein , concentrated and commingled , the other twenty-six characters ; which , separately unintelligible , form , when thus united , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred printed pages , and having for subject nothing less than the complete history of the ring itself . Some small portion of this narrative -- that , namely , which relates more particularly to the present wearer of the ring -- we will glance at ; the rest must be silence , although , going back as it does to the earliest records of the human race , many an interesting page must be skipped perforce . The advantages to a historian of a medium such as this are too patent to need pointing out . Pretension and conjecture will be avoided , because unnecessary . The most trifling thought or deed of any person connected with the history of the ring is laid open to direct inspection . Were there more such talismans as this , the profession of authorship would become no less easy than delightful , and criticism would sting itself to death , in despair of better prey . So far as is known , however , the enchanted ring is unique of its kind , and , such as it is , is not likely to become common property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the morning are slipping away ; we must construe our hieroglyphics without further palaver . The sleeper lies upon his side , his left hand resting near his face upon the pillow . Were he to move it ever so little during our examination , the history of years might be thrown into confusion . Nevertheless , we shall hope to touch upon all the more important points , and in some cases to go into details . Concentrating our attention upon the central facet , its clear ray strikes the imagination , and forthwith transports us to a distant age and climate . The air is full of lazy warmth . A full-fed river , glassing the hot blue sky , slides in long curves through a low-lying , illimitable plain . The rich earth , green with mighty crops , everywhere exhales upward the quivering heat of her breath . An indolent , dark-skinned race , turbaned and scantly clothed , move through the meadows , splash in the river , and rest beneath the palm-trees , which meet in graceful clusters here and there , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dirty villages swarm and babble on the river 's brink . Were there leisure to listen , the diamond could readily relate the whole history of this famous valley . For the stone was fashioned to its present shape while the thought that formed the Pyramids was yet unborn , and while the limestone and granite whereof they are built lay in their silent beds , dreaming , perchance , of airy days before the deluge , long ere the heated vapors stiffened into stone . Some great patriarch of early days , founder of a race called by his name , picked up this diamond in the southern desert , and gave it its present form ; perhaps , also , breathed into it the marvellous historical gift which it retains to this day . Who was that primal man ? how sounded his voice ? were his eyes terrible , or mild ? Seems , as we speak , we glimpse his majestic figure , and the grandeur of his face and cloudy beard . He passed away , but the enchanted stone remained , and has sparkled along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and cities which to us are nameless , or but a half-deciphered name . It has seen the mystic ceremonies of Egyptian priests , and counts their boasted wisdom as a twice-told tale . It has watched the unceasing toil of innumerable slaves , piling up through many ardent years the idle tombs of kings . It has beheld vast winding lengths of processions darken and glitter across the plain , slowly devoured by the shining city , or issuing from her gates like a monstrous birth . But whither wander we ? Standing in this hotel of modern Boston , we must confine our inquiries to a far later epoch than the Pharaohs ' . Step aside , and let the old history sweep past , like the turbid and eddying current of the mysterious Nile ; forbearing to launch our skiff earlier than at the beginning of the present century . The middle of June , eighteen hundred and sixteen : the river is just beginning to rise , and the thirsty land spreads wide her lap to receive him . Some miles to the north slumbers Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbous domes . Southward , the shaded Pyramids print their everlasting outlines against the tremulous distance ; old as they are , it seems as though a puff of the Khamsin might dissolve them away . Near at hand is a noisy , naked crowd of men and boys , plunging and swimming in the water , or sitting and standing along the bank . They are watching and discussing the slow approach up stream of a large boat with a broad lateen-sail , and a strange flag fluttering from the mast-head . Rumor says that this boat contains a company of strangers from beyond the sea ; men who do not wear turbans , whose dress is close-fitting , and covers them from head to foot ,  - -  even the legs . They come to learn wisdom and civilization from the Pyramids , and among the ruins of Memphis . A hundred yards below this shouting , curious crowd , stands , waist-deep in the Nile , a slender-limbed boy , about ten years old . He belongs to a superior caste , and holds himself above the common rabble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rank him with the rest , were it not for the talisman which he wears suspended to a fine gold chain round his neck ; a curiously designed diamond ring , the inheritance of a long line of priestly ancestors . The boy 's face is certainly full of intelligence , and the features are finely moulded for so young a lad . He also is watching the upward progress of the lateen-sail ; has heard , moreover , the report concerning those on board . He wonders where is the country from which they come . Is it the land the storks fly to , of which mother ( before the plague carried both her and father to a stranger land still ) used to tell such wonderful stories ? Does the world really extend far beyond the valley ? Is the world all valley and river , with now and then some hills , like those away up beyond Memphis ? Are there other cities beside Cairo , and that one which he has heard of but never seen ,  - -  Alexandria ? Wonders why the strangers dress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would like to find out about all these things ,  - -  about all things knowable beside these , if any there be . Would like to go back with the strangers to their country , when they return , and so become the wisest and most powerful of his race ; wiser even than those fabulously learned priestly instructors of his , who are so strict with him . Perhaps he might find all his forefathers there , and his kind mother , who used to tell him stories . Bah ! how the sun blisters down on head and shoulders : will take a dive and a swim ,  - -  a short swim only , not far from shore ; for was not the priest telling of a boy caught by a great crocodile , only , a few days ago , and never seen since ? But there is no crocodile near to-day ; and , besides , will not his precious talisman keep him from all harm ? The subtile Nile catches him softly in his cool arms , dandles him , kisses Him , flatters him , wooes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the multitudinous feet of the current are hurrying him away . The slow-moving boat is much nearer than it was a minute ago ,  - -  seems to be rasping towards him , in spite of the laziness of the impelling breeze . The boy , as yet unconscious of his peril , now glances shorewards , and sees the banks wheel past . The crowd of bathers is already far beyond hearing yet , frightened and tired , he wastes his remaining strength in fruitless shouts . Now the deceitful eddies , once so soft and friendly , whirl him down in ruthless exultation . He will never reach the shore , good swimmer though he be ! Hark ! what plunged from the bank ,  - -  what black thing moves towards him across the water ? The crocodile ! coming with tears in his eyes , and a long grin of serried teeth . Coming !  - -  the ugly scaly head is always nearer and nearer . The boy screams ; but who should hear him ? He feels whether the talisman be yet round his neck . He screams again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the scaly snout is close upon him . A many-voiced shout , close at hand ; a splashing of poles in the water ; a rippling of eddies against a boat 's bows ! As the boy drifts by , a blue-eyed , yellow-bearded viking swings himself from the halyard , catches him , pulls him aboard with a jerk and a shout , safe ! The long grin snaps emptily together behind him . The boy lies on the deck , a vision of people with leg-coverings and other oddities of costume swimming in his eyes ; one of them supports his head on his knee , and bends over him a round , good-natured , spectacled face . Above , a beautiful flag , striped and starred with white , blue , and red , flaps indolently against the mast.  --  Precisely at this point the sleeper stirs his hand slightly , but enough to throw the record of several succeeding years into uncertainty and confusion . Here and there , however , we catch imperfect glimpses of the Egyptian lad , steadily growing up to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lives and moves amid civilized surroundings : Egypt , with her pyramids , palms , and river , we see no more . The priest 's son seems now to be immersed in studies ; he shows a genius for music and painting , and is diligently storing his mind with other than Egyptian lore . With him , or never far away , we meet a man considerably older than the student ,  - -  good- natured , whimsical , round of head and face and insignificant of feature . Towards him does the student observe the profoundest deference , bowing before him , and addressing him as " Master Hiero , " or " Master Glyphic . " Master Hiero , for his part , calls the Egyptian " Manetho " ; from which we might infer his descent from the celebrated historian of that name , but will not insist upon this genealogy . As for the studies , from certain signs we fancy them tending towards theology ; the descendant of Egyptian priests is to become a Christian clergyman ! Nevertheless , he still wears his talismanic ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does his Christian enlightenment not set him free from such superstition ? So much we piece together from detached glimpses ; but now , as the magic ray steadies once more , things become again distinct . Judging from the style and appointments of Master Hiero Glyphic 's house , he is a wealthy man , and eccentric as well . It is full of strange incongruities and discords ; beauties in abundance , but ill harmonized . One half the house is built like an Egyptian temple , and is enriched with many spoils from the valley of the Nile ; and here a secret chamber is set apart for Manetho ; its very existence is known to no one save himself and Master Hiero . He spends much of his time here , meditating and working amidst his books and papers , playing on his violin , or leaning idly back in his chair , watching the sunlight , through the horizontal aperture high above , his head , creep stealthily across the opposite wall . But these saintly and scholarly reveries are disturbed anon . Master Hiero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , handsome , indolent young woman , with dark hair and eyes , and a rather haughty manner . Helen appears , and thenceforth the household lives and breathes according to her languid bidding . Manetho comes out of his retirement , and dances reverential attendance upon her . He is twenty-five years old , now ; tall , slender , and far from ill-looking , with his dark , narrow eyes , wide brows , and tapering face . His manners are gentle , subdued , insinuating , and altogether he seems to please Helen ; she condescends to him ,  - -  more than condescends , perhaps . Meantime , alas ! there is a secret opposition in progress , embodied in the shapely person of that bright-eyed gypsy of a girl whom her mistress Helen calls Salome . There is no question as to Salome 's complete subjection to the attractions of the young embryo clergyman ; she pursues him with eyes and heart , and seeing him by Helen 's side , she is miserably but dumbly jealous . How is this matter to end ? Manetho 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard not to suspect a secret understanding between him and Salome . He has ceased to wear his ring , and once we caught a diamond-sparkle from beneath the thick folds of lace which cover Helen 's bosom ; but , on the other hand , we fear his arm has been round the gypsy 's graceful waist , and that she has learnt the secret of the private chamber . Is demure Manetho a flirt , or do his affections and his ambition run counter to each other ? Helen would bring him the riches of this world ,  - -  but what should a clergyman care for such vanities ?  - -  while Salome , to our thinking , is far the prettier , livelier , and more attractive woman of the two . Brother Hiero , whimsical and preoccupied , sees nothing of what is going on . He is an antiquary , an Egyptologist , and thereto his soul is wedded . He has no eyes nor ears for the loves of other people for one another.  --  Provoking ! The uneasy sleeper has moved again , and disorganized , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such fragments as reach us , it must have been a momentous epoch in our history . From the beginning , a handsome , stalwart , blue-eyed man , with a great beard like a sheaf of straw , shoulders upon the scene , and thenceforth becomes inextricably mixed up with dark-eyed Helen . We recognize in him an old acquaintance ; he was on the lateen-sailed boat that went up the Nile ; it was he who swung himself from the vessel 's side , and pulled Manetho out of the jaws of death ,  - -  a fact , by the way , of which Manetho remained ignorant until his dying day . With this new arrival , Helen 's supremacy in the household ends . Thor -- so they call him -- involuntarily commands her , and so her subjects . Against him , the Reverend Manetho has not the ghost of a chance . To his credit is it that he conceals whatever emotions of disappointment or jealousy he might be supposed to feel , and is no less winning towards Thor than towards the rest of the world . But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom ? Does the conflict which it symbolizes beset her heart ? The enchanted mirror is still again , and a curious scene is reflected from it . A large and lofty room , windowless , lit by flaring lamps hung at intervals round the walls ; the panels contain carvings in bas-relief of Egyptian emblems and devices ; columns surround the central space , their capitals carved with the lotos-flower , their bases planted amidst papyrus leaves . A border of hieroglyphic inscription encircles the walls , just beneath the ceiling . In each corner of the room rests a red granite sarcophagus , and between each pair of pillars stands a mummy in its wooden case . At that end farthest from the low-browed doorway -- which is guarded by two great figures of Isis and Osiris , sitting impassive , with hands on knees -- is raised an altar of black marble , on which burns some incense . The perfumed smoke , wavering upwards , mingles with that of the lamps beneath the high ceiling . The prevailing color is ruddy Indian-red , relieved by deep blue and black , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone pave the floor , and dimly reflect the lights . In front of the altar stands a ministerial figure , none other than Manetho , who must have taken orders ,  - -  and joins together , in holy matrimony , the yellow-bearded Thor and the dark-haired Helen . Master Hiero , his round , snub-nosed face red with fussy emotion , gives the bride away ; while Salome , dressed in white and looking very pretty and lady-like , does service as bridesmaid , such is her mistress 's whim . She seems in even better spirits than the pale bride , and her black eyes scarcely wander from the minister 's rapt countenance . But a few hours later , when bride and groom are gone , Salome ,  - -  who , on some plausible pretext of , her own , has been allowed to remain with brother Hiero until her mistress returns from the wedding-tour ,  - -  -  Salome appears in the secret chamber , where the Reverend Manetho sits with his head between his hands . We will not look too closely at this interview . There are words fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherent promises , distrustful bargains ; and it is late before they part . Salome passes out through the great tomb-like hall , where all the lamps save one are burnt out ; and the young minister remains to pursue his holy meditations alone . We are too discreet to meddle with the honeymoon ; but , passing over some eight months , behold the husband and wife returned , to plume their wings ere taking the final flight . Another strange scene attracts us here . The dusk of a summer evening . Helen , with a more languid step and air than before marriage , saunters along a path through the trees , some distance from the house . She is clad in loose-flowing drapery , and has thrown a white shawl over her head and shoulders . Reaching a bench of rustic woodwork , she drops weariedly down upon it . Manetho comes out all at once , and stands before her ; he seems to have darkened together from the shadow of the surrounding trees . Perhaps a little startled at his so abrupt appearance , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , the light pressure of the enchanted ring against her bosom feels like a dull sting , and her heart beats uncomfortably . He begins to speak in his usual tone of softest deference ; he sits down by her , and now she is paler , glances anxiously up the path for her delaying husband , and the hand that lifts her handkerchief to her lips trembles a little . Is it at his words ? or at their tone ? or at what she sees lurking behind his dusky eyes , curdling beneath his thin , dark skin , quivering down to the tips of his long , slender fingers ? All in a moment he bursts forth , without warning , without restraint , the fire of the Egyptian sun boiling in his blood and blazing in his passion . He seizes her soft white wrist ,  - -  then her waist ; he presses against his , her bosom ,  - -  what a throbbing !  - -  her cheek to his ,  - -  how aghast ! He pours hot words in torrents into her ears ,  - -  all that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and years ! all ,  - -  sparing her not a thought , not a passionate word . She tries to repel him , to escape , to scream for help ; but he looks down her eyes with his own , holds her fast , and she gasps for breath . So the serpent coils about the dove , and stamps his image upon her bewildered brain . Verily , the Reverend Manetho has much forgotten himself . The issue might have been disastrous , had not Helen , in the crisis of the affair , lost consciousness , and fallen a dead weight in his arms . He laid her gently on the bench , fumbled for a moment in the bosom of her dress , and drew out the diamond ring . Just then is heard the solid step of Thor , striding and whistling along the path . Manetho snaps the golden chain , and vanishes with his talisman ; and he is the first to appear , full of sympathy and concern , when the distracted husband shouts for help . Next morning , two little struggling human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is no mother to give them milk , and cherish them in her bosom . There sits the father , almost as still and cold as what was his wife . She did not speak to him , nor seem to know him , to the last . He will never know the truth ; Manetho comes and goes , and reads the burial-service , unsuspected and unpunished . But Salome follows him away from the grave , and some words pass between them . The man is no longer what he was . He turns suddenly upon her and strikes out with savage force ; the diamond on his finger bites into the flesh of the gypsy 's breast ; she will carry the scar of that brutal blow as long as she lives . So he drove his only lover away , and looked upon her bright , handsome face no more . Here Doctor Glyphic -- or whoever this sleeping man may be -- turns heavily upon his face , drawing his hand , with the blood-stained ring , out of sight . We are glad to leave him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' t is time we were off . The eastern horizon bows before the sun , the air colors delicate pink , and the very tombstones in the graveyard blush for sympathy . The sparrows have been awake for a half-hour past , and , up aloft , the clouds , which wander ceaselessly over the face of the earth , alighting only on lonely mountain-tops , are tinted into rainbow-quarries by the glorious spectacle . III . A MAY MORNING . King Arthur , in his Bohemian days , carried an adamantine shield , the gift of some fairy relative . Not only was it impenetrable , but , so intolerable was its lustre , it overthrew all foes before the lance 's point could reach them . Observing this , the chivalric monarch had a cover made for it , which he never removed save in the face of superhuman odds . Here is an analogy . The imaginative reader may look upon our enchanted facet-mirror as too glaringly simple and direct a source of facts to suit the needs of a professed romance . Be there left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even for conjecture . Let the author seem occasionally to consult with his companion , gracefully to defer to his judgment . Bare statement , the parade of indisputable evidence , is well enough in law , but appears ungentle in a work of fiction . How just is this mild censure ! how gladly are its demands conceded ! Let dogmatism retire , and blossom , flowers of fancy , on your yielding stems ! Henceforward the reader is our confidential counsellor . We will pretend that our means of information are no better than other writers ' . We will uniformly revel in speculation , and dally with imaginative delights ; and only when hard pressed for the true path will we snatch off the veil , and let forth for a moment a redeeming ray . In this generous mood , we pass through the partition between No. 27 and No. 29 . In the matter of bedchambers -- even hotelbedchambers -- there can be great diversity . That we were in just now was close and unwholesome , and wore an air of feverishness and disorder . Here , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the breeze from Boston harbor -- slightly flavored , it is true , by its journey across the northern part of the city -- has been blowing into the room all night long . Here are some trunks and carpet-bags , well bepasted with the names of foreign towns and countries , famous and infamous . One of the trunks is a bathing-tub , fitted with a cover -- an agreeable promise of refreshment amidst the dust and weariness of travel . A Russia-leather travelling-bag lies open on the table , disgorging an abundant armament of brushes and combs and various toilet niceties . Mr. Helwyse must be a dandy . Cheek by jowl with the haversack lies a cylindrical case of the same kind of leather , with a strap attached , to sling over the shoulder . This , perhaps , contains a telescope . It would not be worth mentioning , save that our prophetic vision sees it coming into use by and by . Not to analyze too closely , everything in this room speaks of life , health , and movement . In spite of smallness , bareness , and angularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and expand to full-grown day . It is now about half past four , and the crisp new sunshine , just above ground , has clambered over the window-sill , taken a flying leap across the narrow floor , and is chuckling full in the agreeable face asleep upon the pillow . The face , feeling the warmth , and conscious , through its closed eyelids , of the light , presently stretches its eyebrows , then blinks , and finally yawns ,  - -  Ah - -  h ! Thirty-two even , white teeth , in perfect order ; a great , red , healthy tongue , and a round , mellow roar , the parting remonstrance of the sleepy god , taking flight for the day . Thereupon a voice , fetched from some profounder source than the back of the head ,  --  " Steward ! bring me my -- Oh ! A land-lubber again , am I ! " Mr. Balder Helwyse now sits up in bed , his hair and beard ,  - -  which are extraordinarily luxuriant , and will be treated at greater length hereafter , his hair and beard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-opened dark eyes , which contrast strangely with his fair Northern complexion . Next comes a spasmodic stretching of arms and legs , a whisking of bedclothes , and a solid thump of two feet upon the floor . Another survey of the room , ending with a deep breathing in of the fresh air and an appreciative smack of the lips . " O nose , eyes , ears , and all my other godlike senses and faculties ! what a sensation is this of Mother Earth at sunrise ! Better , seems to me , than ocean , beloved of my Scandinavian forefathers . Hear those birds ! look at those divine trees , and the tall moist grass round them ! By my head ! living is a glorious business !  - -  What , ho ! slave , empty me here that bath-tub , and then ring the bell . " The slave -- a handsome , handy fellow , unusually docile , inseparable from his master , whose life-long bondsman he was , and so much like him in many ways ( owing , perhaps , to the intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once been confounded with him ,  - -  this obedient menial --  No ! not even for a moment will we mislead our reader . Are we not sworn confidants ? What is he to think , then , of this abrupt introduction , unheralded , unexplained ? Be it at once confessed that Mr. Helwyse travelled unattended , that there was no slave or other person of any kind in the room , and that this high-sounding order of his was a mere ebullition of his peculiar humor . He was a philosopher , and was in the habit of making many of his tenets minister to his amusement , when in his more sportive and genial moods . Not to exhaust his characteristics too early in the story , it need only be observed here that he held body and soul distinct , and so far antagonistic that one or the other must be master ; furthermore , that the soul 's supremacy was the more desirable . Whether it were also invariable and uncontested , there will be opportunity to find out later . Meantime , this dual condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helwyse , at times when persons less happily organized would become victims of ennui . Be the conditions what they might , he was never without a companion , whose ways he knew , and whom he was yet never weary of questioning and studying . No subject so dull that its different aspects , as viewed from soul and from body , would not give it piquancy . No question so trivial that its discussion on material and on spiritual grounds would not lend it importance . Nor was any enjoyment so keen as not to be enhanced by the contrast of its physical with its psychical phase . Waking up , therefore , on this May morning , and being in a charming humor , he chose to look upon himself as the proprietor of a body-servant , and to give his orders with patrician imperiousness . The obedient menial , then , to resume the thread ,  - -  sprang upon the tub-trunk , whipped off the lid , and discharged the contents upon the bed in a twinkling . This done , he stepped to the bell-rope , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk tapping at the door . " Please , sir , did you ring ? " " Indeed I did , my dear . Are you the pretty chambermaid ? " This bold venture is met by silence , only modified by a low delighted giggle . Presently ,  --  " Did you want anything , sir , please ? " " Ever so many things , my girl ; more than my life is long enough to tell ! First , though , I want to apologize for addressing you from behind a closed door ; but circumstances which I can neither explain nor overcome forbid my opening it . Next , two pails of the best cold water at your earliest convenience . Hurry , now , there 's a Hebe ! " " Very good , sir , " giggles Hebe , retreating down passage . It is to be supposed that it was the plebeian body-servant that carried on this unideal conversation , and that the patrician soul had nothing to do with it . The ability to lay the burden of lapses from good taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is sometimes convenient and comforting . Balder Helwyse , master and man , turns away from the door , and catches sight of a white-robed , hairy-headed reflection in the looking-glass , the phantom face of which at once expands in a genial expression of mirth ; an impalpable arm is outstretched , and the mouth seems thus to speak :  --  " Stick to your bath , my good fellow , and the evil things of this life shall not get hold of you . Water is like truth ,  - -  purifying , transparent ; a tonic to those fouled and wearied with the dust and vanity of this transitional phenomenon called the world . Patronize it ! be thy acquaintance with it constant and familiar ! Remember , my dear Balder , that this slave of thine is the medium through which something better than he ( thyself , namely ) is filtered to the world , and the world to thee . Go to , then ! if the filter be foul , shall not that which is filtered become unclean also ? " Here the rhetorical phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touched with unusual skill , in the next room . The phantom vanished , but Mr. Helwyse seated himself softly upon the bed , listening with full enjoyment to every note ; his very toes seeming to partake of his appreciation . Music is the mysterious power which makes body and soul -- master and man -- thrill as one string . The musician played several bars , beautiful in themselves , but unconnected ; and ever and anon there sounded a discordant note , like a smirch upon a fair picture . The execution , however , showed a master hand , and the themes betrayed the soul of a true musician , albeit tainted with some subtile deformity . " Heard him last night , and fell asleep , dreaming of a man with the brain of a devil and an angel 's heart.  - -  Drop in on him presently , and have him down to breakfast . If young , shall be our brother ,  - -  so long as there 's anything in him . If -- as I partly suspect -- old , and a father , marry his daughter . But no ; such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Helwyse runs his hands dreamily through his tangled mane , and shakes it back . If philosophical , he seems also to be romantic and imaginative , and impressionable by other personalities . It is , to be sure , unfair to judge a man from such unconsidered words as he may let fall during the first half-hour after waking up in the morning ; were it otherwise , we should infer that , although he might take a genuine interest in whomever he meets , it would be too analytical to last long , except where the vein was a very rich one . He would pick the kernel out of the nut , but , that done , would feel no sentimental interest in the shell . Too much of this ! and yet who can help drawing conclusions ( and not always incorrectly ) from the first sight and sound of a new acquaintance ? There is a knock at the door , and Mr. Helwyse calls out , " Hullo ? Ah ! the cold water , emblem of truth . Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I 'm going to open the door ! " We also will retire , fastidious reader , and employ the leisure interval in packing an imaginary carpet-bag for a short journey . Our main business , during the next few days , is with Mr. Helwyse , and since there will be no telling what becomes of him after that , he must be followed up pretty closely . A few days does not seem much for the getting a satisfactory knowledge of a man ; nevertheless , an hour , rightly used , may be ample . If he will continue his habit of thinking aloud , will affect situations tending to bring out his leading traits of character ; if we may intrude upon him , note-book in hand , in all his moods and crises , with all this in addition to discretionary use of the magic mirror , it will be our own fault if Mr. Helwyse be not turned inside out . Properly speaking , there is no mystery about men , but only a great dulness and lethargy in our perceptions of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret than is the answer to a school-boy 's problem . A mathematician will draw you a triangle and a circle , and show you the trigonometrical science latent therein . But a profounder mathematician would do as much with the equation man ! While Mr. Helwyse is still lingering over his toilet , his neighbor the fiddler , whom he had meant to ask to breakfast , comes out of his room , violin-box in hand , walks along the passage-way , and is off down stairs . An odd-looking figure ; those stylish clothes become him as little as they would a long-limbed , angular Egyptian statue . Fashion , in some men , is an eccentricity , or rather a violence done to their essential selves . A born fop would have looked as little at home in a toga and sandals , as did this swarthy musician , doctor , priest , or whatever he was , in his fashion-plate costume . Then why did he wear it ? There are other things to be followed up before attending to that question . But the man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making his acquaintance . Had he been an hour earlier , had any one of us , for that matter , ever been an hour earlier or later ,  - -  who can tell how the destinies of the world would be affected ! Luckily for our peace of mind , the hypothesis involves an impossibility . IV . A BRAHMAN . Whoever has been in Boston remembers , or has seen , the old Beacon Hill Bank , which stood , not on Beacon Hill , indeed , but in that part of School Street now occupied by the City Hall . You passed down by the dirty old church , on the northeast corner of School and Tremont Streets , which stands trying to hide its ugly face behind a row of columns like sooty fingers , and whose School-Street side is quite bare , and has the distracted aspect peculiar to buildings erected on an inclined plane ;  - -  passing this , you came in sight of the bank , a darksome , respectable edifice of brick , two stories and a half high , and gambrel-roofed . It stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocrat might withdraw from the stream of modern life , and fancy himself exclusive . The poor old bank ! Its respectable brick walls have contributed a few rubbish-heaps to the new land in the Back Bay , perhaps ; and its floors and gambrel-roof have long since vanished up somebody 's chimney ; only its money -- its baser part -- still survives and circulates . Aristocracy and exclusivism do not pay . The bank , perhaps , took its title from the fact that it owed its chief support to the Beacon Hill families ,  - -  Boston 's aristocracy ; and Boston 's standard names appeared upon its list of managers . If business led you that way , you mounted the well-worn steps , and entered the rather strict and formal door , over which clung the weather-worn sign ,  - -  faded gold lettering upon a rusty black background . Nothing that met your eyes looked new , although everything was scrupulously neat . Opposite the doorway , a wooden flight of stairs mounted to the next floor , where were the offices of some old Puritan lawyers . Leaving the stairs on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a glass door , when behold ! the banking-room , with its four grave bald-headed clerks . But you did not come to draw or deposit , your business was with the President . " Mr. MacGentle in ? " " That way , sir . " You opened a door with " Private " painted in black letters upon its ground-glass panel . Another bald-headed gentleman , with a grim determination about the mouth , rose up from his table and barred your way . This was Mr. Dyke , the breakwater against which the waves of would-be intruders into the inner seclusion often broke themselves in vain ; and unless you had a genuine pass , your expedition ended there . Our pass -- for we , too , are to call on Mr. MacGentle -- would carry us through solider obstructions than Mr. Dyke ; it is the pass of imagination . He does not even raise his head as we brush by him . But , first , let us inquire who Mr. MacGentle is , besides President of the Beacon Hill Bank . He is a man of refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelled , and , it is said , could handle a pen to better purpose than the signing bank-notes . In his earlier years he studied law , and gained a certain degree of distinction in the profession , although ( owing , perhaps , to his having entered it with too ideal and high-strung views as to its nature and scope ) he never met with what is vulgarly called success . Fortunately for the ideal barrister , an ample private estate made him independent of professional earnings . Later in life , he trod the confines of politics , still , however , enveloping himself in that theoretical , unpractical atmosphere which was his most marked , and , to some people , least comprehensible characteristic . A certain mild halo of statesmanship ever after invested him ; not that he had at any time actually borne a share in the government of the nation , but it was understood that he might have done so , had he so chosen , or had his political principles been tough and elastic enough to endure the wear and strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned men in the Senate were known to have been his intimates at college , and he still met and conversed with them on terms of equality . Between law , literature , and statesmanship , in all of which pursuits he had acquired respect and goodwill , without actually accomplishing anything , Mr. MacGentle fell , no one knew exactly how , into the presidential chair of the Beacon Hill Bank . As soon as he was there , everybody saw that there he belonged . His social position , his culture , his honorable , albeit intangible record , suited the old bank well . He had an air of subdued wisdom , and people were fond of appealing to his judgment and asking his advice ,  - -  -  perhaps because he never seemed to expect them to follow it when given ( as , indeed , they never did ) . The Board of Directors looked up to him , deferred to him , nay , believed him to be as necessary to the bank 's existence as the entire aggregate of its supporters ; but neither the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's financial theories in the conduct of the banking business . Let no one hastily infer that the accomplished gentleman of whom we speak was in any sense a sham . No one could be more true to himself and his professions . But -- if we may hazard a conjecture -- he never breathed the air that other men breathe ; another sun than ours shone for him ; the world that met his senses was not our world . His life , in short , was not human life , yet so closely like it that the two might be said to correspond , as a face to its reflection in the mirror ; actual contact being in both cases impossible . No doubt the world and he knew of the barrier between them , though neither said so . The former , with its usual happy temperament , was little affected by the separation , smiled good-naturedly upon the latter , and never troubled itself about the difficulties in the way of shaking hands . But Mr. MacGentle , being only a single man , perhaps felt lonely and sad . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In youth , he may have believed himself to be the only real flesh and blood ; but in later years , the terrible weight of the world 's majority forced him to the opposite conclusion . And here , at last , he and the world were at one ! Suppose , instead of listening to a personal description of this good old gentleman , we take a look at him with our own eyes . There is no danger of disturbing him , no matter how busy he may be . The inner retreat is very small , and as neat as though an old maid lived in it . The furniture looks as good as new , but is subdued to a tone of sober maturity , and chimes in so well with the general effect that one scarcely notices it . The polished table is mounted in dark morocco ; behind the horsehair-covered arm-chair is a gray marble mantel-piece , overshadowing an open grate with polished bars and fire-utensils in the English style . During the winter months a lump of cannel-coal is always burning there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much on its good behavior to give out very decided heat . Over the mantel-piece hangs a crayon copy of Correggio 's Reading Magdalen ,  - -  the only touch of sentiment in the whole room , and that , perhaps , accidental . The concrete nature of the President 's surroundings is at first perplexing , in view of our theory about his character . But it is evident that the world could never provide him with furniture corresponding to the texture of his mind ; and hence he would instinctively lay hold of that which was most commonplace and non-committal . If he could realize nothing outside himself , he might at least remove whatever would distract him from inward contemplation . There is , however , one article in this little room which we must not omit to notice . It is a looking-glass ; and it hangs , of all places in the world , right over Mr. MacGentle 's standing-desk , in the embrasure of the window . As often as he looks up he beholds the reflection of his cultured and sad-lined physiognomy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain man ? His worst enemy , had he one , would not call him that . Nevertheless , Mr. MacGentle finds a pathetic comfort in this small mirror . No one , not even he , could tell wherefore ; but we fancy it to be like that an exile feels , seeing a picture of his birthplace , or hearing a strain of his native music . The mirror shows him something more real , to his sense , than is anything outside of it ! Well , there stands the old gentleman , writing at this desk in the window . All men , they say , bear more or less resemblance to some animal ; Mr. MacGentle , rather tall and slender , with his slight stoop , and his black broadcloth frock-coat buttoned closely about his waist , brings to mind a cultivated , grandfatherly greyhound , upon his hind legs . He has thick white hair , with a gentle curl in it , growing all over his finely moulded head . He is close-shaven ; his mouth and nose are formed with great delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional reminiscence of youthful fire . The eyebrows are habitually lifted ,  - -  a result , possibly , of the growing infirmity of Mr. MacGentle 's vision ; but it produces an expression of half-plaintive resignation , which is rendered pathetic by the wrinkles across his forehead and the dejected lines about his delicate mouth . He is dressed with faultless nicety and elegance , though in a fashion now out of date . Perhaps , in graceful recognition of the advance of age , he has adhered to the style in vogue when age first began to weigh upon his shoulders . He gazes mildly out from the embrasure of an upright collar and tall stock ; below spreads a wide expanse of spotless shirt-front . His trousers are always gray , except in the heat of summer , when they become snowy white . They are uniformly too long ; yet he never dispenses with his straps , nor with the gaiters that crown his gentlemanly shoes . Although not a stimulating companion , one loves to be where Amos MacGentle is ; to watch his quiet movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally bears the stamp of thought and intellectual capacity , and at first strikes the listener as rare good sense ; yet , if reconsidered afterwards , or applied to the practical tests of life , his wisdom is apt to fall mysteriously short . Is Mr. MacGentle aware of this curious fact ? There sometimes is a sadly humorous curving of the lips and glimmering in the eyes after he has uttered something especially profound , which almost warrants the suspicion . The lack of accord between the old gentleman and the world has become to him , at last , a dreary sort of jest . But we might go on forever touching the elusive chords of Mr. MacGentle 's being ; one can not help loving him , or , if he be not real enough to love , bestowing upon him such affection as is inspired by some gentle symphony . Unfortunately , he figures but little in the coming pages , and in no active part ; such , indeed , were unsuited to him . But it is pleasant to pass through his retired little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we would gladly look forward to seeing him once more , when the heat of the day is over and the sun has gone down . V. A NEW MAN WITH AN OLD FACE . About an hour before noon on this same twenty-seventh of May , Mr. Dyke heard a voice in the outer room . He had held his position in the house as confidential clerk for nearly or quite twenty-five years , was blessed with a good memory , and was fond of saying that he never forgot a face or a voice . So , as this voice from the outer room reached his ears , he turned one eye up towards the door and muttered , " Heard that before , somewhere ! " The ground-glass panel darkened , and the door was thrown wide open . Upon the threshold stood a young man about six feet in height , of figure rather graceful and harmonious than massive . A black velveteen jacket fitted closely to his shape ; he had on a Tyrolese hat ; his boots , of thin , pliant leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane , with a handle of chamois-horn ; to a couple of straps , crossing each shoulder , were attached a travelling-scrip and a telescope-case . But neither his attire nor the unusual size and dark brilliancy of his eyes was so noticeable as his hair and beard , which outgrew the bounds of common experience . Beards , to be sure , were far more rare twenty years ago than they have since become . The hair was yellow , with the true hyacinthine curl pervading it . Rejoicing in luxuriant might , it clothed and reclothed the head , and , descending lower , tumbled itself in bold masses on the young man 's shoulders . As for the beard , it was well in keeping . Of a purer yellow than the hair , it twisted down in crisp , vigorous waves below the point marked by mankind 's third shirt-stud . It was full half as broad as it was long , and lay to the right and left from the centre-line of the face . The owner of this oriflamme looked like a young Scandinavian god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than meets the eye . Sons of Esau , whose beards grow high up on their cheek-bones , who are hairy down to their ankles , and to the second joints of their fingers , are generally men of a kindly and charitable nature , strong in what we call the human element . One remembers their stout hand-grip ; they look frankly in one 's face , and the heart is apt to go out to them more spontaneously than to the smooth-faced Jacobs . Such a man was Samson , whose hair was his strength ,  - -  the strength of inborn truth and goodness , whereby he was enabled to smite the lying Philistines . And although they once , by their sophistries , managed to get the better of him for a while , they forgot that good inborn is too vigorous a matter for any mere razor finally to subdue . See , again , what a great beard Saint Paul had , and what an outspoken , vigorous heart ! Was it from freak that Greeks and Easterns reverenced beards as symbols of manhood , dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber , as a violator of divine law ? No one , surely , could accuse that handy , oily , easy little personage of evil intent ; but he symbolized the subtile principle which pares away the natural virtue of man , and substitutes an artificial polish , which is hypocrisy . It is to be observed , however , that hair can be representative of natural evil as well as of good . A tangle-headed bush-ranger does not win our sympathies . A Mussulman keeps his beard religiously clean . Meanwhile the yellow-haired Scandinavian , whom we have already laid under the imputation of being a dandy , stood on the threshold of Mr. Dyke 's office , and that gentleman confronted him with a singularly inquisitive stare . The visitor 's face was a striking one , but can be described , for the present , only in general terms . He might not be called handsome ; yet a very handsome man would be apt to appear insignificant beside him . His features showed strength , and were at the same time cleanly and finely cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plenty of eye-room beneath them . He took off his hat to Mr. Dyke , and smiled at him with artless superiority , insomuch that the elderly clerk 's sixty years were disconcerted , and the Cerberus seemed to dwindle into the bumpkin ! This young fellow , a good deal less than half Mr. Dyke 's age , was yet a far older man of the world than he . Not that his appearance suggested the kind of maturity which results from abnormal or distorted development ,  - -  on the contrary , he was thoroughly genial and healthful . But that power and assurance of eye and lip , generally bought only at the price of many years ' buffetings , given and taken , were here married to the first flush and vigor of young manhood . " My name is Helwyse ; I have come from Europe to see Mr. Amos MacGentle , " said the visitor , courteously . " Helwyse !  - -  Hel - -   " repeated Mr. Dyke , having seemingly quite forgotten himself . His customary manner to strangers implied that he knew , better than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that what he knew was not much to their credit . But he could only open his mouth and stare at this Helwyse . " Mr. MacGentle is an old friend ; run in and tell him I 'm here , and you will see . " The young man put his hand kindly on the elderly clerk 's shoulder , much as though the latter were a gaping school-boy , and directed him gently towards the inner door . Mr. Dyke regained his voice by an effort , though still lacking complete self-command . " I beg your pardon , Mr. Helwyse , sir ,  - -  of course , of course , it did n't seem possible ,  - -  so long , you know ,  - -  but I remembered the voice and the face and the name ,  - -  I never forget ,  - -  but , by George , sir , can you really be --  ? " " I see you have a good memory ; you are Dyke , are n't you ? " And Mr. Helwyse threw back his head and laughed , perhaps at the clerk 's bewildered face . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both shook hands very heartily . " Beg pardon again , Mr. Helwyse , I 'll speak to the President , " said Mr. Dyke , and stepped into the sanctuary of sanctuaries . Mr. MacGentle was taking a nap . He was seventy years old , and could drop asleep easily . When he slept , however lightly and briefly , he was pretty sure to dream ; and if awakened suddenly , his dream would often prolong itself , and mingle with passing events , which would themselves put on the semblance of unreality . On the present occasion the sound of Helwyse 's voice had probably crept through the door , and insinuated itself into his dreaming brain . Mr. Dyke was too much excited to remark the President 's condition . He put his mouth close to the old gentleman 's ear , and said , in an emphatic and penetrating undertone ,  --  " Here 's your old friend Helwyse , who died in Europe two years ago , come back again , younger than ever ! " If the confidential clerk expected his superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. MacGentle unclosed his eyes , looked up , and answered rather pettishly ,  --  " What nonsense are you talking about his dying in Europe , Mr. Dyke ? He has n't been in Europe for six years . I was expecting him . Let him come in at once . " But he was already there ; and Mr. Dyke slipped out again with consternation written upon his features . Mr. MacGentle found himself with his thin old hand in the young man 's warm grasp . " Helwyse , how do you do ?  - -  how do you do ? Ah ! you look as well as ever . I was just thinking about you . Sit down ,  - -  sit down ! " The old President 's voice had a strain of melancholy in it , partly the result of chronic asthma , and partly , no doubt , of a melancholic temperament . This strain , being constant , sometimes had a curiously incongruous effect as contrasted with the subject or circumstances in hand . Whether hailing the dawn of the millennium ; holding playful converse with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever rhetorical conditions , Mr. MacGentle 's intonation was always pitched in the same murmurous and somewhat plaintive key . Moreover , a corresponding immobility of facial expression had grown upon him ; so that altogether , though he was the most sympathetic and sensitive of men , a superficial observer might take him to be lacking in the common feelings and impulses of humanity . Perhaps the incongruity alluded to had not altogether escaped his own notice , and since discord of any kind pained him , he had mended the matter -- as best he could -- by surrendering himself entirely to his mournful voice ; allowing it to master his gestures , choice of language , almost his thoughts . The result was a colorlessness of manner which did great injustice to the gentle and delicate soul behind . This conjecture might explain why Mr. MacGentle , instead of falling upon his friend 's neck and shedding tears of welcome there , only uttered a few commonplace sentences , and then drooped back into his chair . But it throws no light upon his remark that he had been expecting the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead two years . Helwyse himself may have been puzzled by this ; or , being a quick-witted young man , he may have divined its explanation . He looked at his entertainer with critical sympathy not untinged with humor . " I hope you are as well as I am , " said he . " A little tired this morning , I believe ; I never was so strong a man as you , Helwyse . I think I must have passed a bad night . I remember dreaming I was an old man , an old man with white hair , Helwyse . " " Were you glad to wake up again ? " asked the young man , meeting the elder 's faded eyes . " I hardly know whether I 'm quite awake yet . And , after all , Thor , I 'm not sure that I do n't wish the dream might have been true . If I were really an old man , what a long , lonely future I should escape ! but as it is -- as it is --  " He relapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the tall and graceful youth , full of romance and fire , who roamed abroad in quest of adventures with your trusty friend Thor Helwyse , the yellow-bearded Scandinavian ? Do you fancy this fresh , unwrinkled face a mate to your own ? and is it but the vision of a restless night ,  - -  this long-drawn life of dull routine and gradual disappointment and decay ? Open those dim eyes of yours , good sir ! stir those thin old legs ! inflate that sunken chest !  - -  Ha ! is that cough imaginary ? those trembling muscles ,  - -  are they a delusion is that misty glance only a momentary weakness There is no youth left in you , Mr. MacGentle ; not so much as would keep a rose in bloom for an hour . " Have you seen Doctor Glyphic lately ? " inquired Helwyse , after a pause . " Glyphic ?  - -  do you know , I was thinking of him just now , of our first meeting with him in the African desert . You remember !  - -  a couple of Bedouins were carrying him off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin among the sand-heaps . What a grand moment was that when you caught the Sheik round the throat with your umbrella-handle , and pulled him off his horse ! and then we mounted poor Glyphic upon it ,  - -  mummied cat and all ,  - -  and away over the hot sand ! What a day was that ! what a day was that ! " The speaker 's eyes had kindled ; for a moment one saw the far flat desert , the struggling knot of men and horses , the stampede of the three across the plain , and the high sun flaming inextinguishable laughter-over all !  - -  and it had happened nigh forty years ago . " He never forgot that service , " resumed Mr. MacGentle , his customary plaintive manner returning . " To that , and to your saving the Egyptian lad ,  --  . Manetho , you owe your wife Helen : ah ! forgive me ,  - -  I had forgotten ; she is dead , she is dead . " " I never could understand , " remarked Helwyse , aiming to lead the conversation away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manetho . " " That was only a part of the Egyptian mania that possessed him , and began , you know , with his changing his name from Henry to Hiero ; and has gone on , until now , I suppose , he actually believes himself to be some old inscription , containing precious secrets , not to be found elsewhere . Before the adventure with the boy , I remember , he had formed the idea of building a miniature Egypt in New Jersey ; and Manetho served well as the living human element in it . ' Though I take him to America , ' you know he said , ' he shall live in Egypt still . He shall have a temple , and an altar , and Isis and Osiris , and papyri and palm-trees and a crocodile ; and when he dies I will embalm him like a Pharaoh . ' ' But suppose you die first ? ' said one of us . ' Then he shall embalm me ! ' cried Hiero , and I will be the first American mummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment in working this vein of reminiscence . He sat back in his low arm-chair , his unsubstantial face turned meditatively towards the Magdalen , his hands brought together to support his delicate chin . Helwyse , apprehending that the vein might at last bring the dreamer down to the present day , encouraged him to follow it . " It must have been a disappointment to the Doctor that his protege took up the Christian religion , instead of following the faith and observances of his Egyptian ancestors , for the last five thousand years ! " " Why , perhaps it was , Thor , perhaps it was , " murmured Mr. MacGentle . " But Manetho never entered the pulpit , you know ; it would not have been to his interest to do so ; besides that , I believe he is really devoted to Glyphic , believing that it was he who saved him from the crocodile . People are all the time making such absurd mistakes . Manetho is a man who would be unalterable either in gratitude or enmity , although his external manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why , as long as he wore an Egyptian robe , and said his prayers in an Egyptian temple , it would be all the same to Glyphic what religion the man professed ! " " Doctor Glyphic is still alive , then ? " The old man looked at the young one with an air half apprehensive , half perplexed , as if scenting the far approach of some undefined difficulty . He passed his white hand over his forehead . " Everything seems out of joint-to-day , Helwyse . Nothing looks or seems natural , except you ! What is the matter with me ?  - -  what is the matter with me ? " Helwyse sat with both hands twisted in his mighty beard , and one booted leg thrown over the other . He was full of sympathy at the spectacle of poor Amos MacGentle , blindly groping after the phantom of a flower whose bloom and fragrance had vanished so terribly long ago ; and yet , for some reason or other he could hardly forbear a smile . When anything is utterly out of place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men are always secretly inclined to laugh at old ones ! " Why should not Glyphic be alive ? " resumed Mr. MacGentle . " Why not he , as well as you or I ? Are n't we all about of an age ? " Helwyse drew his chair close to his companion 's , and took his hand , as if it had been a young girl 's . " My dear friend , " said he , " you said you felt tired this morning , but you forget how far you 've travelled since we last met . Doctor Glyphic , if he be living now , must be more than sixty years old . Your dream of old age was such as many have dreamed before , and not awakened from in this world ! " " Let me think !  - -  let me think ! " said the old man ; and , Helwyse drawing back , there ensued a silence , varied only by a long and tremulous sigh from his companion ; whether of relief or dejection , the visitor could not decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more assurance . Either from mortification at his illusion , or more probably from imperfect perception of it , he made no reference to what had passed . Old age possesses a kind of composure , arising from dulled sensibilities , which the most self-possessed youth can never rival . " We heard , through the London branch of our house , that Thor Helwyse died some two years ago . " " He was drowned in the Baltic Sea . I am his son Balder . " " He was my friend , " observed the old man , simply ; but the tone he used was a magnet to attract the son 's heart . " You look very much like him , only his eyes were blue , and yours , as I now see , are dark ; but you might be mistaken for him . " " I sometimes have been , " rejoined Balder , with a half-smile . " And you are his son ! You are most welcome ! " said Mr. MacGentle , with old-fashioned courtesy . " Forgive me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very old man , Mr. Balder ; so old that sometimes I believe I forget how old I am ! And Thor is dead ,  - -  drowned , you say ? " " The Baltic , you know , has been the grave of many of our forefathers ; I think my father was glad to follow them . I never saw him in better spirits than during that gale . We were bound to England from Denmark . " " Helen 's death saddened him ,  - -  I know ,  - -  I know ; he was never gay after that . But how -- how did --  ? " " He would keep the deck , though the helmsman had to be lashed to the wheel . I think he never cared to see land again , but he was full of spirits and life . He said this was weather fit for a Viking . " We were standing by the foremast , holding on by a belaying-pin . The sea came over the side , and struck him overboard . I went after him . Another wave brought me back ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to , it was too late . " Helwyse 's voice , towards the end of this story , became husky , and Mr. MacGentle 's eyes , as he listened , grew dimmer than ever . " Ah ! " said he , " I shall not die so . I shall die away gradually , like a breeze that has been blowing this way and that all day , and falls at sunset , no one knows how . Thor died as became him ; and I shall die as becomes me , as becomes me ! " And so , indeed , he did , a few years later ; but not unknown nor uncared for . Balder Helwyse was a philosopher , no doubt ; but it was no part of his wisdom to be indifferent to unstrained sympathy . He went on to speak further of his own concerns ,  - -  a thing he was little used to do . It appeared that , from the time he first crossed the Atlantic , being then about four years old , up to the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been journeying to and fro over the Eastern Hemisphere . His father , who , as well as himself , was American by birth , was the descendant of a Danish family of high station and antiquity , and inherited the restless spirit of his ancestors . In the course of his early wanderings he had fallen in with MacGentle , who , though somewhat older than Helwyse , was still a young man ; and later these two had encountered Hiero Glyphic . About fifteen years after this it was that Thor appeared at Glyphic 's house in New Jersey , and was welcomed by that singular man as a brother ; and here he fell in love with Glyphic 's sister Helen , and married her . With her he received a large fortune , which the addition of his own made great ; and at Glyphic 's death Thor or his heirs would inherit the bulk of the estate left by him . So Thor , being then in the first prime of life , was prepared to settle down and become domestic . But the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the children she had borne him , drove him once more abroad , with his baby son , never again to take root , or to return . And here Balder 's story , as told by him , began . He seemed to have matured very early , and to have taken hold of knowledge in all its branches like a Titan . The precise age at which he had learned all that European schools could teach him , it is not necessary to specify ; since it is rather with the nature of his mind than with the list of his accomplishments that we shall have to do . It might be possible , by tracing his-connection with French , or German , or English philosophers , to make shrewd guesses at the qualities of his own ! creed ; but these will perhaps reveal themselves less diffidently under other tests . The last four or five years of his life Balder had spent in acquiring such culture as schools could not give him . Where he went , what he did and saw , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his means and his social rank left him free to go as high as well as low as he pleased , to dine with English dukes or with Russian serfs . But a fine chastity inherent in his Northern blood had , whatever were his moral convictions , kept him from the mire ; and the sudden death of his father had given him a graver turn than was normal to his years . Meanwhile , the financial crash , which at this time so largely affected Europe , swallowed up the greater part of Balder 's fortune ; and with the remnant ( about a thousand pounds sterling ) , and a potential independence ( in the shape of a learned profession ) in his head , he sailed for Boston . " I knew you were my uncle Hiero 's bankers , " he added , " and I supposed you would be able to tell me about him . He is my only living relative . " " Why , as to that , I believe it is a long time since the house has had anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , abstractedly gazing at Balder 's high boots ; " but I 'll ask Mr. Dyke . He remembers everything . " That gentleman ( who had not passed an easy moment since Mr. Helwyse 's arrival ) was now called in , and his suspense regarding the mysterious visitor soon relieved . In respect to Doctor Glyphic 's affair he was ready and explicit . " No dollar of his money has been through our hands since winter of Eighteen thirty-five -- six , Mr. Helwyse , sir ,  - -  winter following your and your respected father 's departure for foreign parts , " stated Mr. Dyke , straightening his mouth , and planting his fist on his hip . " Hm -- hm ! " murmured the President , standing thin and bent before the empty fireplace , a coat-tail over each arm . " You have heard nothing of him since then ? " " Nothing , Mr. Helwyse , sir ! Reverend Manetho Glyphic -- understood to be the Doctor 's adopted son -- came here and effected the transfer , under authority , of course , of his foster-father 's signature . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns , neither the President nor I can inform you , sir . " " Hm -- hm ! " remarked Mr. MacGentle again . It was a favorite comment of his upon business topics . " It is possible I may be a very wealthy man , " said Balder , when Mr. Dyke had made his resolute bow and withdrawn . " But I hope my uncle is alive . It would be a loss not to have known so eccentric a man . I have a miniature of him which I have often studied , so that I shall know him when we meet . Can he be married , do you think ? " " Why no , Balder ; no , I should hardly think so , " answered Mr. MacGentle , who , at the departure of his confidential clerk , had relapsed into his unofficial position and manner . " By the way , do you contemplate that step ? " " It is said to be an impediment to great enterprises . I could learn little by domestic life that I could not learn better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without woman , you know . " " If I could marry Woman , I would do it , " said the young man , unblushingly . " But a single crumb from that great loaf would be of no use to me . " " Ah , you have n't learned to appreciate women ! You never knew your mother , Balder ; and your sister was lost before she was old enough to be anything to you . By the way , I have always cherished a hope that she might yet be found . Perhaps she may , perhaps she may . " Balder looked perplexed , till , thinking the old gentleman might be referring to a reunion in a future state , he said ,  --  " You believe that people recognize one another in the next world , Mr. MacGentle ? " " Perhaps , perhaps ; but why not here as well ? " murmured the other , in reply ; and Balder , suspecting a return of absent-mindedness , yielded the point . He had grown up in the belief that his twin-sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be under a different impression . " I shall go to New York , and try to find my uncle , or some trace of him , " said he . " If I 'm unsuccessful , I mean to come back here , and settle as a physician . " " What is your specialty ? " " I 'm an eye-doctor . The Boston people are not all clear-eyed , I hope . " " Not all ,  - -  I should say not all ; perhaps you may be able to help me , to begin with , " said Mr. MacGentle , with a gleam of melancholy humor . " I will ask Mr. Dyke about the chances for a practice he knows everything . And , Balder , " he added , when the young man rose to go , " let me hear from you , and see you again sometimes , whatever may happen to you in the way of fortune . I 'm rather a lonely old man ,  - -  a lonely old man , Balder . " " I 'll be here again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murder or some such enormity , " rejoined Helwyse , his long mustache curling to , his smile . They shook hands ,  - -  the vigorous young god of the sun and the faded old wraith of Brahmanism , with a friendly look into each other 's eyes . VI . THE VAGARIES OF HELWYSE . Balder Helwyse was a man full of natural and healthy instincts : he was not afraid to laugh uproariously when so inclined ; nor apt to counterfeit so much as a smile , only because a smile would look well . What showed a rarer audacity ,  - -  he had more than once dared to weep ! To crush down real emotions formed , in short , no part of his ideal of a man . Not belonging to the Little-pot-soon-hot family , he had , perhaps , never found occasion to go beyond the control of his temper , and blind rage he would in no wise allow himself ; but he delighted in antagonisms , and though it came not within his rules to hate any man , he was inclined to cultivate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . His love of actual battle was intense : he had punched heads with many a hard-fisted school-boy in England ; he bore the scar of a German schlaeger high up on his forehead ; and later , in Paris , he had deliberately invaded the susceptibilities of a French journalist , had followed him to the field of honor , and been there run through the body with a small-sword , to the satisfaction of both parties . He was confined to his bed for a while ; but his overflowing spirits healed the wound to the admiration of his doctors . These examples of self-indulgence have been touched upon only by way of preparing the gentle reader for a shock yet more serious . Helwyse was a disciple of Brillat-Savarin ,  - -  in one word , a gourmand ! His appetite never failed him , and , he knew how wisely to direct it . He never ate a careless or thoughtless meal , be its elements simple as they might . He knew and was loved by the foremost cooks all over Europe . Never did he allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Man , " he was accustomed to say , " is but a stomach , and the cook is the pope of stomachs , in whose church are no respectable heretics . Our happiness lies in his saucepan ,  - -  at the mercy of his spit . Eating is the appropriation to our needs of the good and truth of life , as existing in material manifestation : the cook is the high-priest of that symbolic ceremony ! I , and kings with me , bow before him ! But his is a responsibility beneath which Atlas might stagger ; he , of all men , must be honest , warm-hearted , quick of sympathy , full of compassion towards his race . Let him rejoice , for the world extols him for its well-being ;  - -  yet tremble ! lest upon his head fall the curse of its misery ! " This speech was always received with applause ; the peroration being delivered with a vast controlled emphasis of eye and voice ; and it was followed by the drinking of the cook 's health . " The generous virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " arise from the cultivation of the stomach . From man 's very earthliness springs the flower of his spiritual virtue . We affect to despise the flesh , as vile and unworthy . What , then , is flesh made of ? of nothing ?  - -  let who can , prove that ! No , it is made of spirit , of the divine , everlasting substance ; it is the wall which holds Heaven in place ! If there be anything vile in it , it is of the Devil 's infusion , and enters not into the argument . " A man who had expressed such views as these at the most renowned tables of France and England was not likely to forget his principles in the United States . Accordingly , he arose early , as we have seen , on the morning after his arrival , and forced an astonished waiter to marshal him to the kitchen , and introduce him to the cook . The cook of the Granite Hotel at that time was a round , red-lipped Italian , an artist and enthusiast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation ; and , although his salary was good , he contemplated throwing it over , abandoning the Yankee nation to its fate , and seeking some more congenial field . Balder , who , when the mood was on him , could wield a tongue persuasive as Richard the Third 's , talked to this man , and in seven minutes had won his whole heart . The immediate result was a delectable breakfast , but the sequel was a triumph indeed . It seems that the aesthetic Italian had for several days been watching over a brace of plump , truffled partridges . This day they had reached perfection , and were to have been eaten by no less a person than the cook himself . These cherished birds did he now actually offer to make over to his eloquent and sympathetic acquaintance . Balder was deeply moved , and accepted the gift on one condition ,  - -  that the donor should share the feast ! " When a man serves me up his own heart ,  - -  truffled , too ,  - -  he must help me eat it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after faint resistance , agreed to ; the other episodes of the bill of fare were decided upon , and the Italian and the Scandinavian were to dine together that afternoon . It still lacked something of the dinner-hour when Mr. Helwyse came out through the dark passage-way of the Beacon Hill Bank , and paused for a few moments on the threshold , looking up and down the street . Against the dark background he made a handsome picture ,  - -  tall , gallant , unique . The May sunshine , falling , athwart the face of the gloomy old building , was glad to light up the waves of his beard and hair , and to cast the shadow of his hat-brim over his forehead and eyes . The picture stays just long enough to fix itself in the memory , and then the young man goes lightly down the worn steps , and is lost along the crowded street . Such as he is now , we shall not see him standing in that dark frame again ! Wherever he went , Balder Helwyse was sure to be stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never thought of speculating about what people thought of Mr. Helwyse ; but to his own approval -- something not lightly to be had -- he was by no means indifferent . Towards mankind at large he showed a kindly but irreverent charity , which excused imperfection , not so much from a divine principle of love as from scepticism as to man 's sufficient motive and faculty to do well . Of himself he was a blunt and sarcastic critic , perhaps because he expected more of himself than of the rest of the world , and fancied that that person only had the ability to be his censor ! If the Christian reader regards this mental attitude as unsound , far be it from us to defend it ! It must , nevertheless , be admitted that whoever feels the strong stirring of power in his head and hands will learn its limits from no purely subjective source . The lesson must begin from without , and the only argument will be a deadly struggle . Until then , self-esteem , however veiled beneath self-criticism , can not but increase . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from vulgar self-pollution , Satan must intrust his spear to no half-fledged devil , but grasp it in his own hand , and join battle in his own person . Undismayed by this fact , Helwyse reached Washington Street , and followed its westerly meanderings , meaning to spend part of the interval before dinner in exploring Boston . He walked with an easy sideways-swaying of the shoulders , whisking his cane , and smiling to himself as he recalled the points of his interview with the President . " Just the thing , to make MacGentle tutelary divinity of so elusive a matter as money ! Wonder whether the Directors ever thought of that ? For all his unreality , though , he has something more real in him than the heaviest Director on the Board ! " How composedly he took me for my father ! and when he discovered his mistake , how composedly he welcomed me in my own person ! Was that the extreme of senility ? or was it a subtile assertion of the fact , that he who keeps in the vanguard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is a distinct person chiefly by virtue of that containing power ? " Why did n't I ask him more about my foster-cousin Manetho ? Egyptians are more astute than affectionate . Would he cleave to my poor uncle for these last eighteen years merely for love ? Why did he transfer that money so soon after we sailed ? Ten to one , he has in his own hands the future as well as the present disposal of Doctor Hiero Glyphic 's fortune ! The old gentleman has had time to make a hundred wills since the one he showed my father , twenty years ago ! " Well , and what is that to you ? Ah , Balder Helwyse , you lazy impostor , you are pining for Egyptian flesh-pots ! Do n't tell me about civility to relatives , and the study of human nature ! You are as bad as you accuse your poor cousin of being ,  - -  who may be dead , or pastor of a small parish , for all you know . And yet every school-girl can prattle of the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own living ! I have a good mind to take your thousand pounds sterling out of your pocket and throw them into Charles River ,  - -  and then begin at the beginning ! By the time I 'd learnt what poverty can teach , it would be over , or I am no true man ! Only they who are ashamed of themselves , or afraid of other people , need to start rich . " Nevertheless , he could not do otherwise than hunt up the only relative he had in America . Subsequent events did not convict him of being a mere egotist , swayed only by the current of base success . He did not despise prosperity , but he cared yet more to find out truths about things and men . This is not the story of a fortune-hunter ; not , at all events , of a hunter of such fortunes as are made and lost nowadays . But , when one half of a man detects unworthy motives in the other half , it is embarrassing . He acts most wisely , perhaps , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , at the given moment , decide . Our compound life makes many compromises , whereby our progress , whether heavenward or hellward , is made slow -- and sure ! Here , or hereabouts , Balder lost his way . When thinking hard , he was beside himself ; he strode , and tossed his beard , and shouldered inoffensive people aside , and drew his eyebrows together , or smiled . Then , by and by , he would awake to realities , and find himself he knew not where . This time , it was in an unsavory back-street ; some dirty children were playing in the gutters , and a tall , rather flashily dressed man was walking along some distance ahead , carrying something in one hand . Helwyse at first mended his pace to overtake the fellow , and ask the way to the hotel . But he presently changed his purpose , his attention being drawn to the oddity of the other 's behavior . The man was evidently one of those who live much alone , and so contract unconscious habits , against which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some imaginary dialogue ; and so imperfectly could his fleshly veil conceal his mental processes , that he gesticulated everything that passed through his mind . These gestures , though perfectly apparent to a steady observer , were so far kept within bounds as not to get more than momentary notice from the passers-by , who , indeed , found metal more attractive to their gaze in Helwyse . Now did the man draw his head back and spread out his arms , as in surprise and repudiation ; now his shoulders rose high , in deprecation or disclaimer . Now his forefinger cunningly sought the side of his nose ; now his fist shook in an imaginary face . At times he would stretch out a pleading arm and neck ; the next moment he was an inflexible tyrant , spurning a suppliant . Again he would break into a soundless chuckle ; then , raising his hand to his forehead , seem overwhelmed with despair and anguish . Occasionally he would walk some distance quite passively , only glancing furtively about him ; but erelong he would forget himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the man curiously , but without seeming to perceive the rather grisly similitude between the latter 's vagaries and his own . " What an ugly thing the inside of this person seems to be ! " he said . " But then , whose thoughts and emotions would not render him a laughing-stock if they could be seen ? If everybody looked , to his fellow , as he really is , or even as he looks to himself , mankind would fly asunder , and think the stars hiding-places not remote enough ! How many men in the world could walk from one end of the street they live in to the other , talking and acting their inmost thoughts all the way , and retain a bit of anybody 's respect or love afterwards ? No wonder Heaven is pure , if , our spiritual bodies are only thoughts and feelings ! and a Hell where every devil saw his fellow 's deformity outwardly manifested would be Hell indeed ! " But that ca n't be . Angels behold their own loveliness , because doing so makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vileness and live . They think their hideousness charming , and , when the darkness is thickest about them , most firmly believe themselves in Heaven . But the light of Heaven would be real darkness to them , for a ray of it would strike them blind ! " Helwyse was too prone to moralizing . It shall not be our cue to quote him , save when to do so may seem to serve an ulterior purpose . " I would like to hear the story that fellow is so exercised about , " muttered his pursuer . " How do I know it does n't concern me ? That violin-box he carries is very much in his way ; shall I offer to carry it for him , and , in return , hear his story ? If the music soothes his soul as much as the box moderates his gestures --  " Here the man abruptly turned into a doorway , and was gone . On coming up , Helwyse found that the doorway led in through a pair of green folding-doors to some place unseen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , or worse . Did the musician live there ? Helwyse paused but a moment , and then walked on ; and thus , sagacious reader , the meeting was for the second time put off . When he reached his hotel , he had only half an hour to dress for dinner in ; but he prepared himself faultlessly , chanting a sort of hymn to Appetite the while . " Hunger , " quoth he , " is mightiest of magicians ; breeds hope , energy , brains ; prompts to love and friendship . Hunger gives day and night their meaning , and makes the pulse of time beat ; creates society , industry , and rank . Hunger moves man to join in the work of creation , to harmonize himself with the music of the universe , to feel ambition , joy , and sorrow . Hunger unites man to nature in the ever-recurring inspiration to food , followed by the ever-alternating ecstasy of digestion . Morning tunes his heart to joy , for the benison of breakfast awaits him . The sun scales heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him supperwards , and night brings timeless sleep , to waft him to another dawn . Eating is earth 's first law , and heaven itself could not subsist without it ! " So Balder Helwyse and the cook feasted gloriously that afternoon , in the back pantry , and they solemnly installed the partridges among the constellations ! VII . A QUARREL . That same afternoon Mr. MacGentle put his head into the outer office and said , " Mr. Dyke , could I speak with you a moment ? " Mr. Dyke scraped back his chair and went in , with his polished bald head , and square face and figure ,  - -  a block of common-sense . He was more common-sensible than usual , that afternoon , because he had so strangely forgotten himself in the morning . Mr. MacGentle was in his usual position for talking with his confidential clerk ,  - -  standing up with his back to the fireplace , and his coat-tails over his arms . Experience had taught him that this attitude was better adapted than any other to sustain the crushing weight of Mr. Dyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting position would have been to lose breath and vitality before the end of five minutes . " Mr. Helwyse has thoughts of settling in Boston to practise his profession , " began the President , gently . " I told him you would be likely to know what the chances are . " " Profession is -- what ? " demanded Mr. Dyke , settling his fist on his hip . " O -- doctor -- physician ; eye-doctor , he said , I think . " " Eye-doctor ? Well , Dr. Schlemm wo n't last the winter ; may drop any day . Just the thing for Mr. Helwyse ,  - -  Dr . Helwyse . " And the subject , being discussed at some length between the two gentlemen , took on a promising aspect . His house was picked out for the new incumbent , his earnings calculated , his success foretold . Two characters so diverse as were the President and his clerk united , it seems , in liking the young physician . " Married ? " asked Mr. Dyke , after a pause . " Why , no , no ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is quite young ; perhaps he may , later on in life , Mr. Dyke . " The elderly clerk straightened his mouth . " Matter of taste -- and policy . Gives solidity ,  - -  position ;  - -  and is an expense and a responsibility . " Mr. Dyke himself was well known to be the husband of an idolized wife , and the father of a despotic family . " He never had the advantage of woman 's influence in his childhood , you know . His poor mother died in giving him and his sister birth ; and the sister was lost ,  - -  stolen away , two or three years later . He does not appreciate woman at her true value , " murmured MacGentle . " Stolen away ? His sister died in infancy ,  - -  so I understood , sir , " said the clerk , whose versions of past events were apt to differ from the President 's . But the President -- perhaps because he was conscious that his memory regarding things of recent occurrence was treacherous -- was abnormally sensitive as to the correctness of his more distant reminiscences . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , just before Thor Helwyse went to Europe , I think , " said he . " Beg your pardon , sir , " said Mr. Dyke , with an iron smile ; " died ,  - -  burnt to death in her first year , yes , sir ! " " Mr. Dyke , " rejoined MacGentle , dignifiedly , lifting his chin high above his stock , " I have myself seen the little girl , then in her third year , pulling her brother 's hair on the nursery floor . She was dark-eyed ,  - -  a very lovely child . As to the burning , I now recollect that when the house in Brooklyn took fire , the child was in danger , but was rescued by her nurse , who herself received very severe injuries . " Mr. Dyke heaved a long , deliberate sigh , and allowed his eyes to wander slowly round the room , before replying . " You are not a family man , Mr. MacGentle , sir ! Do n't blame you , sir ! Your memory , perhaps -- But no matter ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same who rescued her from the fire ? " Mr. Dyke perhaps intended to give a delicately ironical emphasis to this question , but his irony was apt to be a rather unwieldy and unmistakable affair . The truth was , he was a little staggered by the President 's circumstantial statement ; whence his deliberation , and his not entirely pertinent rejoinder about " a family man . " " And why not the same , sir ? I ask you , why not the same ? " demanded Mr. MacGentle , with slender imperiousness . But , by this time , Mr. Dyke had thought of a new argument . " The little girl , I understood you to say , was dark ? Since she was the twin-sister of one of Mr. Balder Helwyse 's complexion , that is odd , Mr. MacGentle ,  - -  odd , sir . " And the solid family man fixed his sharp brown eyes full upon the unsubstantial bachelor . The latter 's delicate nostrils expanded , and a pink flush rose to his faded cheeks . He was now as haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business subjects with my subordinates , Mr. Dyke ; not other subjects , if you please ! This dispute was not begun by me . Let it be carried no further , sir ! Twins are not necessarily , nor invariably , of the same complexion . Let nothing more be said , Mr. Dyke . I trust the little girl may yet be found and restored to her family -- to -- to her brother ! I trust she may yet be found , sir ! " And he glared at Mr. Dyke aggressively . " I trust you may live to see it , Mr. MacGentle , sir ! " said the confidential clerk , shifting his ground in a truly masterly manner ; and before the President could recover , he had bowed and gone out . Ten minutes afterwards MacGentle opened the door , and lo ! Dyke himself on the threshold . " Mr. Dyke ! " " Mr. MacGentle ! " in the same breath . " I -- Mr . Dyke , let me apologize for my asperity , for my rudeness , " says MacGentle , stepping forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised than ever , the corners of his mouth more depressed . " I am sincerely sorry that -- that --  " " O sir ! " cries the square clerk , grasping the thin hand in both his square palms ; " O sir ! O sir ! No , no ! no , no ! I was just coming to beg you -- My fault ,  - -  my fault , Mr. MacGentle , sir ! No , no ! " Thus incoherently ended the quarrel between these two old friends , the dispute being left undecided . But the important point was established that Balder Helwyse was insured a practice in Boston , in case his uncle Glyphic 's fortune failed to enrich him . VIII . A COLLISION IMMINENT . A large , handsome steamer was the " Empire State , " of the line which ran between Newport and New York . She was painted white , had walking-beam engines , and ornamented paddle-boxes , and had been known to run nearly twenty knots in an hour . On the evening of the twenty-seventh of May , in the year of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a full list of passengers . On getting out of the harbor , she steamed into a bank of solid fog , and only got out of it the next morning , just before passing Hellgate , at the head of East River , New York . On the passage down Long Island Sound she met with an accident . She ran into the schooner Resurrection , which was lying becalmed across her course , carrying away most of the schooner 's bowsprit , but doing no serious damage . This , however , was not the worst . On arriving in New York , it was found that one of the passengers was missing ! He had fallen overboard during the night , possibly at the time of the collision . Balder Halwyse was on board . After dining with the cook , and smoking a real Havana cigar ( probably the first real one that he had ever been blessed with ) , he put a package of the same brand in his travelling-bag , bade his entertainer ,  - -  who had solemnly engaged to remain in Boston for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , and took the train to Newport , and from there the " Empire State " for New York . The darkness was the most impenetrable that the young man had ever seen ; Long Island Sound was like a pocket . The passengers -- those who did not go to their state-rooms at once -- sat in the cabin reading , or dozing on the chairs and sofas . A few men stayed out on deck for an hour or two , smoking ; but at last they too went in . The darkness was appalling . The officer on the bridge blew his steam fog-whistle every few minutes , and kept his lanterns hung out ; but they must have been invisible at sixty yards . Helwyse kept the deck alone . Apparently he meant to smoke his whole bundle of cigars before turning in . He paced up and down , Napoleon-like in his high boots , until finally he was brought to a stand by the blind night-wall , which no man can either scale or circumvent . Then he leaned on the railing and looked against the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ! The water below whispered and swirled past , torn to soft fragments by the gigantic paddle-wheel . Helwyse 's beard was wet and his hands sticky with the salt mist . Ever and anon sounded the fog-whistle , hoarsely , as though the fog had got in its throat ; and the pale glare of a lantern , fastened aloft somewhere , lighted up the white issuing steam for a moment . There was no wind ; one was conscious of motion , but all sense of direction and position -- save to the steersman -- was lost . Helwyse could see the red end of his cigar , and very cosey and friendly it looked ; but he could see nothing else . It is said that staid and respectable people , when thoroughly steeped in night , will sometimes break out in wild grimaces and outlandish gesticulations . It is certainly the time when unlawful thoughts and words come to men most readily and naturally . Night brings forth many things that daylight starts from . The real power of darkness lies not in merely baffling the eyesight , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains of light are broken , and we can almost believe our internal night to be as impenetrable to God 's eyes as that external , to our own ! By and by Helwyse thought he would find some snug place and sit down . The cabin of the " Empire State " was built on the main deck , abaft the funnel , like a long , low house . Between the stern end of this house and the taffrail was a small space , thickly grown with camp-stools . Helwyse groped his way thither , got hold of a couple of the camp-stools , and arranged himself comfortably with his back against the cabin wall . The waves bubbled invisibly in the wake beneath . After sitting for a while in the dense blackness , Helwyse began to feel as though his whole physical self were shrivelled into a single atom , careering blindly through infinite space ! After all , and really , was he anything more ? If he chose to think not , what logic could convince him of the contrary ? Visible creation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  was not what it seemed to be . But this darkness was no illusion ! Why , then , was it not the only reality ? and he but an atom , charged with a vital power of so-called senses , that generally deceived him , but sometimes -- as now -- let him glimpse the truth ? The fancy , absurd as it was , had its attraction for the time being . This great living , staring world of men and things is a terrible weight to lug upon one 's back . But if man be an invisible atom , what a vast , wild , boundless freedom is his ! Infinite space is wide enough to cut any caper in , and no one the wiser . One would like to converse with a man who had been born and had lived in solitude and darkness . What original views he would have about himself and life ! Would he think himself an abstract intelligence , out of space and time ? What a riddle his physical sensations would be to him ! Or , suppose him to meet with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mystify each other ! Would they learn to feel shame , love , hate ? or do the passions only grow in sunshine ? Would they ever laugh ? Would they hatch plots against each other , lie , deceive ? Would they have secrets from each other ? But , fancy aside , take a supposable case . Suppose two sinners of our daylight world to meet for the first time , mutually unknown , on a night like this . Invisible , only audible , how might they plunge profound into most naked intimacy ,  - -  read aloud to each other the secrets of their deepest hearts ! Would the confession lighten their souls , or make them twice as heavy as before ? Then , the next morning , they might meet and pass , unrecognizing and unrecognized . But would the knot binding them to each other be any the less real , because neither knew to whom he was tied ? Some day , in the midst of friends , in the brightest glare of the sunshine , the tone of a voice would strike them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did Helwyse commune with himself . He liked to follow the whim of the moment , whither it would lead him . He was romantic ; it was one of his agreeablest traits , because spontaneous ; and he indulged it the more , as being confident that he had too much solid ballast in the hold to be in danger of upsetting . To-night , at this point of his mental ramble , he found that his cigar had gone out . Had he been thinking aloud ? He believed not , and yet there was no telling ; he often did so , unconsciously . Were it so , and were any one listening , that person had him decidedly at advantage ! What put it into his head that some one might be listening ? It may have come by pure accident , if there be such a thing . The idea returned , stealing over his mind like a chilling breath . What if some one had all along been close beside him , with eyes fixed upon him ! Helwyse found himself sitting perfectly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguising it ,  - -  he felt uneasy . He wished his cigar had not gone out . On second thoughts , he wished there had not been any cigar at all , because , if any one were near , the cigar must have pointed out the smoker 's precise position . The uneasiness did not lessen , but grew more defined . It was like the sensation felt when pointed at by a human finger , or stared at persistently . Was there indeed any one near ? No sound or movement gave answer , but the odd sensation continued . Helwyse fancied he could now tell whence it came ;  - -  from the left , and not far away . He peered earnestly thitherward , but his eyes only swallowed blackness . Was not this carrying a whim to a foolish length ? If he thought he had a companion , why not speak , and end the doubt ? But the dense silence , darkness , uncertainty , made common-sense seem out of place . The whole black fog , the sea , the earth itself , seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weaker he grew . A slight shifting of his position caused him all at once to encounter the eyes of the unseen presence with his own ! The stout-nerved young fellow was startled to the very heart . Was the unseen presence startled also ? At all events , the shock found Balder Helwyse his tongue , seldom before tied up without his consent . " I hope I 'm not disturbing your solitude . You are not a noisy neighbor , sir . " So flat fell the words on the blank darkness , it seemed as if there could never be a reply . Nevertheless , a reply came . " You must come much nearer me than you are , to disturb my solitude . It does not consist in being without a companion . " The quality of this voice of darkness was peculiar . It sounded old , yet of an age that had not outlived the devil of youth . Probably the invisibility of the speaker enhanced its effect . With most of the elements of pleasing , it was nevertheless repulsive . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not far off , hard held by a slender leash ; an underlying suggestion of harsh discordance . The utterance , though somewhat rapid , was carefully distinct . Helwyse had the gift of familiarity , of that rare kind of familiarity which does not degenerate into contempt . But there was an incongruity about this person , hard to assimilate . In a couple of not very original sentences , he had wrought upon his listener an effect of depraved intellectual power , strangely combined with artless simplicity , an unspeakably distasteful conjunction ! Imagination , freed from the check of the senses , easily becomes grotesque ; and Helwyse , unable to see his companion , had no difficulty in picturing him as a grisly monster , having a satanic head set upon the ingenuous shoulders of a child . And what was Helwyse himself ? No longer , surely , the gravely humorous moralizer ? The laws of harmony forbid ! He is a monster likewise ; say -- since grotesqueness is in vogue -- the heart of Lucifer burning beneath the cool brain of a Grecian sage . The symbolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride and ambition as abstract as boundless , had , at the same time , a logical , fearless brain , and keen delight in beauty . " I was just thinking , " remarked the latter monster , " that this was a good place for confidential conversation . " " You believe , then , that talking relieves the mind ? " rejoined the former , softly . " I believe a thief or a murderer would be glad of an hour -- such as now passes -- to impart the story of what is dragging him to Hell . And even the best houses are better for an airing ! " " A pregnant idea ! There are certainly some topics one would like to discuss , free from the restraint that responsibility imposes . Have you ever reflected on the subject of omnipotence ? " Somewhat confounded at this bold question , Helwyse hesitated a moment . " I ca n't see you , remember , any more than you can see me , " insinuated the voice , demurely . " I believe I have sometimes asked myself whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " admitted Helwyse , cautiously ; for he began to feel that even darkness might be too transparent for the utterance of some thoughts . " But you never got a satisfactory answer , and are not therefore omnipotent ? Well , the reason probably is , that you started wrongly . Did it ever occur to you to try the method of sin ? " " To obtain omnipotence ? No ! " " It would n't be right ,  - -  eh ? " chuckled the voice . " But then one must lay aside prejudice if one wants to be all-powerful ! Now , sin denotes separation ; the very etymology of the word should have attracted the attention of an ambitious man , such as you seem to be . It is a path separate from all other paths , and therefore worth exploring . " " It leads to weakness , not to power ! " " If followed in the wrong spirit , very true . But the wise man sins and is strong ! See how frank I am !  - -  But do n't let me monopolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your argument , if you have one . You are a prophet of new things . " " Sin is an old force , though it may be applied in new ways . Well , you will admit that the true sinner is the only true reformer and philosopher among men ? No ? I will explain , then . The world is full of discordances , for which man is not to blame . His endeavor to meet and harmonize this discordance is called sin . His indignation at disorder , rebellion against it , attempts to right it , are crimes ! That is the vulgar argument which wise men smile at . " " I may be very dull ; but I think your explanations need explaining . " " We 'll take some examples . What is the liar , but one who sees the false relations of things , and seeks to put them in the true ? The mission of the thief , again , is to equalize the notoriously unjust distribution of wealth . A fundamental defect in the principles of human association gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is an immortal protest against the absurd laws which interfere between the sexes . Are not these men , and others of similar stamp , the bulwarks of true society , our leaders towards justice and freedom ? " Whether this were satire , madness , or earnest , Helwyse could not determine . The night-fog had got into his brain . He made shift , however , to say that the criminal class were not , as a mere matter of fact , the most powerful . " Again you misapprehend me , " rejoined the voice , with perfect suavity . " No doubt there are many weak and foolish persons who commit crimes , nay , I will admit that the vast majority of criminals are weak and foolish ; but that does not affect the dignity of the true sinner ,  - -  he who sins from exalted motives . Ignorance is the only real crime , polluting deeds that , wisely done , are sublime . Sin is culture ! " " Were I , then , from motives of self-culture , to kill you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your estimation ? " put in Helwyse . " Admirable ! " softly exclaimed the voice , in a tone as of an approving pat on the back . " Certainly , I should be the last to deny it ! But would it not be more for the general good , were I , who have long been a student of these things , to kill a seeming novice like you ? It would assure me of having had one sincere disciple . " " I wonder whether he 's really mad ? " mused Balder Helwyse , shuddering a little in the dampness . " But , badinage aside , " resumed this loquacious voice , " although there is so much talk and dispute about evil , very few people know what evil essentially is . Now , there are some things , the mere doing of which by the most involuntary agent would at once stamp his soul with the conviction of ineffable sin . He would have touched the essence of evil . And if a wise man has done that , he has had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily had , then . A man need but take his Leviticus and Deuteronomy , and run through the catalogue of crimes . He would be sure of finding the key hidden beneath some of them . " " No ; you do Moses scant justice . He -- shrewd soul !  - -  was too cunning to fall into such an error as that . He forbade a few insignificant and harmless acts , which every one is liable to commit . His policy was no less simple than sagacious . By amusing mankind with such trumpery , he lured them off the scent of true sin . Believe me , the artifice was no idle one . Should mankind learn the secret , a generation would not pass before the world would be turned upside down , and its present Ruler buried in the ruins ! " At this point , surely , Helwyse got up and went to his state-room without listening to another word ?  - -  Not so . The Lucifer in him was getting the better of the sage . He wanted to hear all that the voice of darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something instructive in it . He might hear a word that would unbar the door he had striven so long to open . He aimed at knowledge and power beyond recognized human reach . He had taken thought with himself keenly and deeply , but was still uncertain and unsatisfied . Here opened a new avenue , so untried as to transcend common criticism . The temptation to omnipotence is a grand thing , and may have shaken greater men than Helwyse ; and he had trained himself to regard it -- not exactly as a temptation . As for good or bad methods ,  - -  at a certain intellectual height such distinctions vanish . Vulgar immorality he would turn from as from anything vulgar ; but refined , philosophic immorality , as a weapon of power ,  - -  there was fascination in it .  - -  Folly and delusion !  --  But Helwyse was only Helwyse , careering through pitchy darkness , on a viewless sea , with a plausible voice at his ear insinuating villanous thoughts with an air of devilish good-fellowship ! The " Empire State " was at this moment four and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to carry away . The steamer was making about ten knots an hour : the schooner was slowly drifting with the tide into the line of the steamer 's course . The catastrophe was therefore about twenty-seven minutes distant . IX . THE VOICE OF DARKNESS . The fog-whistle screeched dismally . Helwyse took his feet off the camp-stool in front of him , and sat upright . " Do you know this secret of sin ? " he asked . " It must , of course , be an object of speculation to a thoughtful man , " answered the voice , modestly parrying the question . " But I assure you that only a man of intellect -- of genius -- has in him the intelligence , the sublime reach of soul , which could attain the full solution of the problem ; they who merely blunder into it would fail to grasp the grand significance of the idea . " " But you affirm that whoever fairly masters the problem of absolute sin would have God and His kingdom at his mercy ? " " I am loath to appear boastful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you suggest , " the voice replied , with a subdued gusto . " It would depend upon our hypothetical person 's discretion , and his views as to the claims of the august Being who has so long controlled the destinies of the human race , how much the existing order of things might have to fear from him . I should imagine that the august Being , if He be as wise as they say He is , would be careful how He treated this hypothetical person ! " " You are a liar , " said Helwyse , unceremoniously . " Why is not Satan , who must possess this all-powerful knowledge , supreme over the universe ? " Instead of taking offence ( as Helwyse , to do him justice , hoped it would ; for his Berserker blood , which boiled only at heaven-and-hell temperature , was beginning to stir in him ) ,  - -  so far from being offended , the voice only uttered its peculiar quiet chuckle . " Your frankness charms me ! it proves you worthy to learn . Satan -- supposing there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereignty of the spiritual world . Were I a cynic , I should say he owned at least half of the physical world into the bargain ! But Satan is only a spirit , and his power over men is but as the power of a dream . Were a Satan to arise in the flesh , so that men could see and touch him , and hear his voice with their fleshy ears ,  - -  there were a Satan ! Already has the Incarnation of goodness appeared to mankind , and , though the world be moved to virtue only slowly and with reluctance , mark how mighty has been his influence ! What think you , then , would be the power of a Christ of evil , showing to men the path they already grope for ? I tell you , the human race would be his only ; Hell , full to bursting with their hurrying souls , would outweigh Heaven in the balance ; the teller of the secret would be king above all ,  - -  forever ! " The sinuous voice twined round the listener 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when before now did a sane human brain let itself be duped by sophistry ? This case were worth marking , if only because it is unparalleled . " And the only punishable sin is ignorance ! " muttered Helwyse . " Well , I have thought so , too . And I have questioned whether a man might have power over himself , to put his hand to evil or to good alike , and to remain impartial and impassive ; and so make evil and good alike minister to his culture and raise him upwards ! " " The question does credit to your wit , " chimed in the voice of darkness . " Whoever has in him the making of a deity must learn the nature of opposites . The soldier will not join battle without studying the tactics of the enemy . Without experimental knowledge of both evil and good , none but a fool would believe that man can become all-powerful . " " From the care with which you avoid speaking the name of God , if from no other cause , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed Helwyse , bluntly . " Well , profanity is vulgar ! As to my being the Devil , it is too dark here for either denial or acknowledgment to be of practical use . But ( to be serious )  - -  about this secret --  " The voice paused interrogatively . Lucifer , speaking through Helwyse 's lips , demanded sullenly ,  --  " Well , what is the secret ? " What , indeed ! Why , there is no such secret ; it is a bugbear ! But the moral perversion of the person who could soberly ask the question that Helwyse asked is not so easily disposed of . It met , indeed , with full recognition . As for the subtile voice , having accomplished its main purpose , it began now to evade the point and to run into digressions ; until the collision came , and ended the conversation forever . " Unfortunately , " said the voice , " the secret is not such as may be told in a word . Like all profound knowledge , it can only be communicated by leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the original discoverer . Let me , as a sort of preliminary , suppose a case . " Hereupon ensued a considerable silence , and Helwyse seemed once more a detached atom , flying through infinite darkness without guide or control . Where was he ?  - -  what was he ? Did the world exist ,  - -  the broad earth , the sunny sky , the beauty , the sound , the order and sweet succession of nature ? Was he a shadow that had dreamed for a moment a strange dream , and would anon be quenched , and know what had seemed Self no more ? Strangely , through the doubt and uncertainty , Helwyse felt the pressure of his shoulders against the cabin wall , and the touch of the dead cigar between his fingers . The voice , resuming , restored him to a reality that seemed less trustworthy than the doubt . The tone was not quite the same as heretofore . The smooth mocking had given place to a hurried excitement , alien to the philosophic temperament . " A man kidnaps the child of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?  - -  no ! he is no short-sighted bungler ; he has refinement , foresight , understanding . She is but an infant ,  - -  open and impressible , warm and sanguine ! He isolates her from sight and reach . He pries into her nature with keenest delicacy , no leaf is unread . Being learnt , he works upon it ; touches each budding trait with gentlest impulse . No violence ! he seems to leave her to her own development ; yet nothing goes against his will . More than half is left to nature , but his scarce perceptible touches bias nature . Ah ! the idealization of education ! " " This sounds more real than hypothetical ! " thought Helwyse . " So cunning was he , he reversed in her mind the universal law . Evil was good ; good , evil . She grew fast and strong , for evil is the sweeter food ; it is rich earth to the plant . She never knew that evil existed , yet evil was all she knew ! For whatever is forced reacts ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to good . " " Did he mean insensibly to initiate her into the knowledge of absolute sin ? " " Such would be his purpose , such would be his purpose . To make her a devil , without the chance of knowing it possible to be anything else ! " " He was a fool , " growled Helwyse . " The plan is folly ,  - -  impracticable in twenty ways . A soul can not be so influenced . Devils are not made by education . The only devil would be the educator ! " But the voice had forgotten his presence . It ceased not to mutter to itself while he was speaking , and now it broke forth again . " Years have passed , she is a woman now . She knows not that the world exists . All is yet latent within her . But the time is at hand when the hidden forces shall flower ! Plunged into life , with nothing to hold by , no truth , no divine help ; her marvellous powers and passions in full strength ,  - -  all trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by new thoughts , limitless opportunities opening before her , she will plunge into such an abyss of sin as has been undreamt of since the Deluge ! " " Well ,  - -  what of it ? what is the upshot ? " questioned Helwyse with sullen impatience . The emotion now apparent in the voice , uncanny though it was , counteracted the spell wrought by its purely intellectual depravity . Helwyse was perhaps beginning to understand that he had ventured his stock of virgin gold for a handful of unclean waste-paper ! " He will come back ,  - -  her father ,  - -  my enemy ! I have waited for him from youth to age . I have seen him in my dreams , and in visions . I am with him continually ,  - -  we talk together . At first , cringingly and softly , I lead him to recall the past , to speak of the dead wife ,  - -  the lost child ,  - -  her baby ways and words . I lure him on till imagination has fired his love and given life and vividness to his memory . Then I whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he shall behold her ! And while his heart beats and he trembles , I bring her forth in her beauty . Take her ! your daughter ! the one devil on earth ; but devils shall spring like grass in the track of her footsteps ! " The voice had worked itself into a frenzy , and , forgetting caution , had crazily exposed itself . Its owner was probably some poor lunatic , subject to fits of madness . But Helwyse was full of scorn and anger , born of that bitterest disappointment which admits not even the poor consolation of having worthily aspired . He had been duped ,  - -  and by the cobwebs of a madman 's brain ! He broke into a short laugh , harsh to the ear , and answering to no mirthful impulse . " So ! you are the hero of your story ? You have brooded all your life over a crazy scheme of stabbing a father through his child , until you have become as blind as you are vicious ! As for the girl , you may have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she should become queen of Hell or anything of that kind --  " He stopped , for his unseen companion was evidently beyond hearing him . The man seemed to be actually struggling in a fit ,  - -  gasping and choking . It was a piteous business , not less piteous than revolting . But Helwyse felt no pity ,  - -  only ugly , hateful , unrelenting anger , needing not much stirring to blaze forth in fearful passion . Where now were his wise saws , his philosophic indifference ? Self-respect is the pith of such supports ; which being gone , the supports fail . " My music ,  - -  my music ! " gasped the voice ; " my music , or I shall die ! " " Die ? Yes , it were well you should die . You cumber the earth ! Shall I do it ? " Helwyse muttered to his heart ,  --  " merely as a means of culture ! " Perhaps it was said only in a mood of sardonic jesting . The next moment , no doubt , Balder Helwyse would have retired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at that moment the hurried flash of a lantern on the captain 's bridge fell full on the young man 's face and shoulders , gleaming in his eyes , and lighting up the masses of yellow hair and mighty beard . He was standing with one hand resting on the taffrail . The dim halo of the fog , folding him about , made him look like a spirit . X. HELWYSE RESISTS THE DEVIL . As the light so fell , hoarse voices shouted , and then a concussion shivered through the steamer , and her headway was slackened . But of this Helwyse knew nothing ; for the voice had burst forth in a cry of fear , amazement , and hate ; and in another breath he found himself clutched tightly in long , wiry arms , and felt panting breath hot against his face . He struggled at first to free himself ,  - -  but he was held in the grip of a madman ! Then did the turbid current of his blood begin to leap and tingle , and strange half-thoughts darted through his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulwark of his will was overthrown ; he could not poise himself long enough to recover his self-sway . He was sliding headlong down a steep , the velocity momently increasing . Was it Balder Helwyse that was struggling thus furiously , his body full of fire , his brain of madness , his heart quick-beating with savage , wicked , thirsty joy ? His soul -- his own no longer -- was bestridden by a frantic demon , who , brimming over with hot glee , drove him whirling blindly on , with an ever-growing purpose that surcharged each smallest artery , and furnished a condensed dart of malice wherewith to stab and stab again the opposing soul . He waxed every instant madder , wickeder , more devilishly exultant ; and now , although panting , breathless , pricking at every pore from the agony of the strain , he could scarce forbear screaming with delight ! for he felt he was gaining , and -- O ecstasy !  - -  knew that his adversary felt it also , and that his heart was as full of black despair and terror as was his conqueror 's of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this wild frenzy in which body and soul were rapt , the essential part of Balder Helwyse seemed to be looking on , with a curious , repellent twist of feature , commenting on what was going forward , and noting , with quiet interest and precision , each varying phase of the struggle ,  - -  noting , as of significance , that the sway of the demon of murder made the idea of other crimes seem beyond words congenial , enticing , delicious ! Steadily through this storm of lawless fury has the predestined victory been drawing near ! The throbbing of his enemy 's heart ,  - -  Helwyse feels it ; did ever lover so rejoice in the palpitations of his mistress ? O the wine of life ! drunk from the cup of murder ! Hear how the wretch 's voice breaks choking from his throat !  - -  he would beg for mercy , but can not , shall not ! Keep your fingers in his throat ; the other hand creeps warily downwards . Now hurl him up ,  - -  over !  --  * * * * * But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! XI . A DEAD WEIGHT . Was it not well done ? Tempted to covet imaginary wickedness , Helwyse was ripe for real crime ,  - -  and who so worthy to suffer as the tempter ? He leaned panting against taffrail . His predominant feeling was that he had been ensnared . His judgment had been drugged , and he had been lured on to evil . An infamous conspiracy ! His breath regained , he stood upright and in a mechanical manner arranged his disordered dress . His haversack was gone , had been torn from his shoulders and carried overboard . An awkward loss ! for it contained , among other things , valuable letters and papers given him by his father ; not to mention a note-book of his own , and Uncle Glyphic 's miniature . His dead enemy had carried off the proofs of his murderer 's identity ! Not till now did Helwyse become aware of an unusual tumult on the steamer . Had they seen the deed ?  - -  He stood with set teeth , one hand on the taffrail . Rather than be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became evident that the nucleus of excitement was elsewhere . The " Empire State " was at a stand-still . Captain and mates were shouting to one another and at the sailors . By the flying light of the lanterns Helwyse caught glimpses of the sails and tall masts of a schooner . He began to comprehend what had happened . " Thank God ! that saves me , " he said with a sense of relaxation . Then he turned and peered fearfully into the black abyss beyond the stern . Nothing there ! nothing save the heavy breathing of remorseless waves . The statistics of things God has been thanked for ,  - -  what piquant instances would such a collection afford ! Any unusual stir of emotion seems to impel a reference to something higher than the world . Only a bloodless calm appears to be secure from God 's interference . It is worthy of remark that this was the first time in Helwyse 's career -- at least since his arrival at years of discretion -- that he had thanked God for anything . This was not owing to his being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of a Supreme Being . God , he believed , was no more than the highest phase of man ; and in any man of sufficient natural endowment , he saw a possible God ; just as every American citizen is a possible President ! What is of moment at present , however , is the fact that the young man 's first inconsistency of word with creed dates at the time his self-control forsook him on board the midnight steamer . In that thanksgiving prayer his passion passed away . After unnaturally distending every sense and faculty , it suddenly ebbed , leaving the consciousness of an irritating vacuum . Something must be done to fill it . One drawback to crime seems to be its insufficiency to itself . It creates a craving which needs must be fed . The demon returns , demanding a fresh task ; and he returns again forever ! Helwyse , therefore , plunged into the midst of the uproar consequent on the collision , and tried to absorb the common excitement , to identify himself with other men ; no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not succeed . It seemed as though he would never feel excitement or warmth in the blood again ! His deed was a dead weight that steadied him spite of his best efforts . His aim has hitherto been , not to forget himself ;  - -  let him forget himself now if he can ! The uproar was over all too soon , and the steamer once more under way . " No serious harm done , sir ! no harm done ! " observed a spruce steward . " No ; no harm . " " By the way , sir ,  - -  thought I heard some one sing out aft just afore we struck . You heard it , sir ? Thought some fellow 'd gone overboard , may be ! " " I saw no one , " answered Helwyse ; nor had he . But he turned away , fearing that the brisk steward might read prevarication in his face . No , he had seen no one ; but he had heard a plunge ! He revolted from the memory of it , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body before it made that dive ? even for a few minutes afterwards ? He would have given much to know ! In theorizing about crime , he had always maintained the motive to be all in all . But now , though unable to controvert the logic of his assertion , he felt it told less than the whole truth . He recognised a divine conservative virtue in straws , and grasped at the smallest ! Through the long torture of self-questioning and indecision , let us not follow him . Uncertainty is a ghastly element in such a matter . He groped his way back to the taffrail . Why , he knew not ; but there he was at last . He might safely soliloquize now ; there was no listener . He might light a cigar and smoke ; no one would see him . Yet , no ; for , on second thoughts , his cigars had gone with the haversack ! He bent over the slender iron railing . Where was -- it now ? Miles away by this time , swinging , swaying down -- down -- down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sinks , its arms now thrown out , now doubled underneath ; the legs sprawling helplessly ; the head wagging loosely on the dead neck . Down -- down , pitching slowly head forwards ; righting , and going down standing , the hair floating straight on end . Down ! O , would it never be done **25;2390;TOOLONG ? Was the sea deep as Hell ? But when it reached the bottom , would it rest there ? No , not even there . It would drift uneasily about for a while on the dark sand , the green gloom of the water above it . Every hour it would grow less and less heavy ; by and by it would begin slowly to rise -- rise ! Horrible it looked now ; not like itself , that had been horrible enough before . Rising ,  - -  rising . O fearful thing ! why come to tell dead men 's tales here ? You are done with the world . What wants mankind with you ? Begone ! sink , and rise no more ! It will not sink ; still it rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light rests shrinkingly on it , revealing the dreadful features . The limbs are no longer pliant , but stiff ,  - -  terribly stiff and unyielding . Still it rises , nearer and nearer to the surface . See where the throat was gripped ! Up it comes at last in the morning sun , among the sparkling , laughing , pure blue waves ,  - -  the swollen , dead thing !  - -  dead in the midst of the world 's life , hideous amidst the world 's beauty . It bobs and floats , and will sink no more ; would rise to heaven if it could ! No need for that . The tide takes it and creeps stealthily with it towards the shore , and casts it , with shudder and recoil , upon the beach . There it lies . Such visions haunted Helwyse as he leaned over the taffrail . He had not suspected , at starting , upon how long a voyage he was bound . How many hours might it be since he and the cook had so merrily dined together ? Was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time ever imposed upon mankind ! For months and years he jogs on with us , a dull and sober-paced pedestrian . Then comes a sudden eternity ! But Time thrusts a clock in our faces , and shows us that the hands have marked a minute only . Shall we put faith in him ? Helwyse suffered from a vivid imagination . He went not to his room that night . He kept the deck , and tried to talk with the men , following them about and asking aimless questions , until they began to give him short answers . Where were his pride and his serene superiority to the friendship or enmity of his race ? where his philosophic self-criticism and fanciful badinage ? his resolute , conquering eyes ? his bearing of graceful , careless authority ? Had all these attributes been packed in his haversack , and cast with that upon the waters ? and would they , no more than he to whose care they had been intrusted , ever return ? With each new hour , morning seemed farther off . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine-room and hung over it , gazing at the bright , swift-sliding machinery , studying the parts , tracing the subtle transmission of force from piece to piece . Here at last was companionship for him ! The engine was a beautiful combination ,  - -  so polished , effective , and logical ; like the minds of some philosophers , moving with superhuman regularity and power , but lifeless ! Helwyse watched it long , till finally its monotony wearied him . It was doing admirable work , but it never swerved from its course at the call of sentiment or emotion . Its travesty of life was repulsive . Machinery is the most admirable invention of man , but is modelled after no heavenly prototype , and will have no part in the millennium . It seems to annul space and time , yet gives us no taste of eternity . Man lives quicker by it , but not more . With another kind of weapon must the true victory over matter be achieved ! XII . MORE VAGARIES . Most benign and beautiful was the morning . The " Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rosy cloud , astern . The chasing waves sparkled and danced for joy . The sun was up , fresh and unstained as yesterday . Night , that had changed so much , had left the sun undimmed . With the same power and brightness as for innumerable past centuries , his glorious glance colored the gray sky blue . Helwyse -- he was at the stern taffrail again -- looked at the marvellous sphere with unwinking eyes , until it blurred and swam before him , and danced in colored rings . It warmed his face , but penetrated no deeper . Looking away , black suns moved everywhere before his eyes , and the earth looked dim and shabby , as though blighted by a curse . Helwyse had not slept , partly from disinclination to the solitude of his berth , partly because the thought of awakening dismayed him . Nevertheless , he could scarcely believe in what had happened , now . He stood upon the very spot ; here was the semicircle of railing , the camp-stools , the white cabin-wall against which he had leaned . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as though the deed done in it must in some manner have vanished likewise . What is fact at one time looks unreal at another . It must be associated with all times and moods before it can be fully comprehended and accepted . Glancing down at the deck , Helwyse saw there the cigar he had been smoking the night before , flattened out by the tread of a foot , and lying close beside it a sparkling ring . He picked it up ; it was a diamond of purest water , curiously caught between the mouths of two little serpents , whose golden and black bodies , twisted round each other , formed the hoop . Realizing , after a moment , from whose finger it must have fallen , he had an impulse to fling it far into the sea ; but his second thought was not to part from it . The idea of its former owner must indeed always be hateful to his murderer ; but the bond between their souls was closer and more indissoluble than that between man and wife ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblem . Unnatural though the union were , to Helwyse it seemed at the time better than total solitude . He felt heavy and inelastic ,  - -  averse to himself , but still more to society . He wished to see men and women , yet not to be seen of them . He had used to be ready in speech , and willing to listen ; now , no subject interested him save one ,  - -  on which his lips must be forever closed . When the sun had made himself thoroughly at home on earth and in heaven , Helwyse went to his state-room , feeling unclean from the soul outwards . While making his toilet , he took care to leave the window-blind up , that he might at any time see the blue sky and water , and the bright shore , with its foliage and occasional houses . He shrank from severing , even for an instant , his communication with the beneficent spirit of nature . And yet Nature could not comfort him ,  - -  in his extremest need he found her most barren . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own senses ; but when he asked her to sympathize with his pain , she laughed at him ,  - -  the magnificent coquette !  - -  and bade him , since she was only the reflection of himself , be content with his own sympathy . Truly , if man and Nature be thus allied , and God be but man developed , then is self-sufficiency the only virtue worth cultivating , and idolatry must begin at home ! His efforts to improve his appearance were not satisfactory ; the loss of his toilet articles embarrassed him not a little ; and he , moreover , lacked zest to enter into the business with his customary care . And what he did was done not merely for his own satisfaction , as heretofore , but with an eye to the criticisms of other people . His naively unconscious independence had got a blow . After doing his best he went out , pale and heavy-eyed , the diamond ring on his finger . The passengers had begun to assemble in the cabin . It seemed to Helwyse , as he entered , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He half expected to see an accuser rise up and point a dreadful finger at him . But in truth the sensation he created was no more than common ; it was his morbid sensitiveness , which for the first time took note of it . He had been accustomed to look at himself as at a third person , in whose faults or successes he was alike interested ; but although his present mental attitude might have moved him to smile , he , in fact , felt no such impulse . The hue of his deed had permeated all possible forms of himself , thus barring him from any standpoint whence to see its humorous aspect . The sun would not shine on it ! As time passed on , however , and no one offered to denounce him , Helwyse began to be more at ease . Seeing the steward with whom he had spoken the night before , he asked him whereabouts he supposed the schooner was . " O , she 'll be in by night , sir , safe enough . Wind 's freshened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to rig a new bowsprit . Beg pardon , sir , did you happen to know the party next door to you ? " " I know no one . What about him ? " " Ca n't find him nowhere , sir . Door locked this morning ; had n't used his bed ; must have come aboard , for there was a violin lying on the bed in a black box , for all the world like a coffin , sir . Queer , ai n't it ? " The steward was called away , but Helwyse 's uneasiness had returned . Did this fellow suspect nothing ? The student of men could not read his face ; the power of insight seemed to have left him . Reason could tell him that it was impossible he should be suspected , but reason no longer satisfied him . He left the cabin and once more sought the deck , harried and anxious . Why could not he be stolid and indifferent , as were many worse criminals than he ? Or was his disquiet a gauge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely gifted than other men , was the stain of sin upon his soul more ineffaceable ? Last night , ignorance was the only evil ; but had he been satisfied with less wisdom , might he not have sinned with more impunity ? Nevertheless , Balder Helwyse would hardly have been willing to purchase greater ease at the price of being less a man . The steamer descended the narrow and swift current of East River , rounded Castle Garden , and reached her pier before eight o'clock . Shoulder to shoulder with the other passengers , Helwyse descended the gangplank . The official who took his ticket eyed him so closely that there was the beginning of an impulse in his weary brain to knock the fellow down . Finding himself not interfered with , however , he passed on to the rattling street , beginning to understand that the attention he excited was not owing to a visible brand of Cain , but to his beard and hair which were at variance with the fashion of that day . He was neither more nor less a cynosure than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , and it now occurred to him that his unique appearance was unsafe as well as irksome . Were a certain body found , in connection with evidence more or less circumstantial , how readily might he be pointed out ! He fancied himself reading the description in a newspaper , and realized how many and how easily noted were his peculiarities . His carelessness of public remark had been folly . The sooner his peculiarities were amended , the better ! At the corner of the street stood a couple of policemen ,  - -  ponderous , powerful men , able between them to carry to jail the most refractory criminal . One path was open to Helwyse , whereby to recover his self-respect , and regain his true footing with the world ; and that led into the hands of those policemen ! With a revulsion of feeling perhaps less strange than it seems , he walked up to them , resolved to surrender himself on a charge of murder . It was the simplest issue to his embarrassments . " Policemen ! " he began , with a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and one said , " How ? " " Direct me to the best hotel near here ! " said Helwyse . They stared , and told him the way to the Astor House . There had been but the briefest hesitation in Helwyse 's mind , but during that pause he had reconsidered his resolve and said No to it . Remembering some episodes of his past history , he can not hastily be accused of vulgar fear of death . In his case , indeed , it may have required more courage to close his mouth than to open it . Be that as it might , the question as to the degree and nature of his guilt was still unsettled in his mind . Moreover , had he been clear on this point , he yet distrusted the competence of human laws to do him justice . He shrank from surrender , less as affecting his person than as superseding his judgment . But , failing himself and mankind , to what other court can he appeal ? Should the fitting tribunal appear , will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Astor House , notwithstanding the trouble he had taken to ask his way thither . He coasted along the more obscure thoroughfares , seeming to find something congenial in them . Here were people , many of whom had also committed crimes , whose eyes he need not shun to meet , who were his brethren . To be sure , they gave him no friendly glances , taking him for some dainty aristocrat , whom idle curiosity had led to their domains . But Helwyse knew the secret of his kinship ; and he perhaps indulged a wild momentary dream of proclaiming himself to them , entering into their life , and vanishing from that world that had known him heretofore . It is a shorter step than is generally supposed , from human height to human degradation . A pale girl with handsome features , careless expression , and somewhat disordered hair , leant out of a low window , her loose dress falling partly open from her bosom as she did so . " Where are you going , my love ? " inquired she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to give me a lock of that sweet yellow hair ?  - -  there 's a duck ! " It so happened that Helwyse had never before been openly accosted by a member of this class of the community . Was this infringement of the rule the result of his own fall , or of the girl 's exceptional effrontery ? He had an indignant glance ready poised , but forbore to hurl it ! The worst crime of the young woman was that she disposed of herself at a rate of remuneration exactly corresponding to the value of the commodity ; whereas he , less economical and orderly , had mortgaged his own soul by disposing of some one else 's body , and was , if anything , out of pocket by the transaction ! Undoubtedly the young woman had the best of it ; very likely , had she been aware of the circumstances , she would not have deigned him so much as a smile . He therefore neither yielded to her solicitations nor rebuked them , but passed on . The adventure rectified his fraternizing impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mire was as yet alien to him . But there was pertinence in the young woman 's question ; where was he going , indeed ? Since the catastrophe on board the steamer , he had forgotten Doctor Glyphic . He felt small inclination to meet his relative now ; but certain considerations of personal interest no longer wore the same color as yesterday . Robbed of his self-respect , he could ill afford to surrender worldly wealth into the bargain . On the other hand , to palm himself off on his uncle for a true man was adding hypocrisy to his other crime . Such an objection , however , could hardly have turned the scale . Great crimes are magnets of smaller ones . It was necessary for Helwyse to alter the whole scheme of his life-voyage ; and since he had failed in beating up against the wind , why not make all sail before it ? Meanwhile , it was easier to call on Doctor Glyphic than to devise a new course of action ; and thus , had matters been allowed to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . But the irony of events turns our sternest resolves to ridicule . On the next street-corner was a hair-dresser 's shop , its genial little proprietor , plump and smug , rubbing his hands and smiling in the doorway . Beholding the commanding figure of the yellow-bearded young aristocrat , afar off , his professional mouth watered over him . What a harvest for shears and razor was here ! Dare he hope that to him would be intrusted the glorious task of reaping it ? As Helwyse gained the corner , his weary eyes took in the smiling hair-dresser , the little room beyond cheerful with sunshine and colored paper-hangings , and the padded chair for customers to recline in . Here might he rest awhile , and rise up a new man ,  - -  a stranger to himself and to all who had known him . It was fitting that the inward change should take effect without ; not to mention that the wearing of so conspicuous a mane was as unsafe as it was unsuitable . He entered the shop , therefore ,  - -  the proprietor backing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the padded chair . Immediately he was enveloped in a light linen robe , a towel was tucked in round his neck by deft caressing fingers , the soothing murmur of a voice was in his ear , and presently sounded the click-click of shears . The descendant of the Vikings closed his eyes and felt comfortable . The peculiar color and luxuriance of Balder 's hair and beard were marked attributes of the Helwyse line . In these days of ponderous genealogies , who would be surprised to learn that the family sprang from that Balder , surnamed the Beautiful , who was the sun-god of Scandinavian mythology ? Certain of his distinctive characteristics , both physical and mental , would appear to have been perpetuated with marvellous distinctness throughout the descent ; above all , the golden locks , the blue eyes , and the sunny disposition . For the rest , so far as sober history can trace them back , they seem to have been a noble and adventurous race of men , loving the sea , but often taking a high part in the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the daughters dark ,  - -  owing , it was said , to the first mother of the line having been a dark-eyed woman . But the advent of a dark-eyed heir had been foretold from the earliest times , not without ominous ( albeit obscure ) hints as to the part he would play in the family history . The precise wording of none of these old prophecies has come down to us ; but they seem in general to have intimated that the dark-eyed Helwyse would bring the race to a ruinous and disgraceful end , saving on the accomplishment of conditions too improbable to deserve recording . The dead must return to life , the living forsake their identity , love unite the blood of the victim to that of the destroyer ,  - -  and other yet stranger things must happen before the danger could be averted . The superstitious reverence paid to enigmatical utterances of this kind has long ago passed away ; and , if any meaning ever attaches to them , it is apt to be sadly commonplace . Nevertheless , when Balder was born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance was doubtless the occasion of much half-serious banter among those to whom the ominous prophecies were familiar . Certainly the young man had already made one grave mistake ; and he could hardly have followed it up by a more disgraceful retreat than this to the hair-dresser 's saloon . The ghosts of his heroic forefathers in Valhalla would disown his shorn head with indignant scorn ; for their golden locks had ever been sacred to them as their honor . When the Roman Empire was invaded by the Goths and Vandals , a Helwyse -- so runs the tale -- was taken prisoner and brought before the Roman General . The latter summoned a barber and a headsman , and informed the captive that he might choose between forfeiting his head , and that which grew upon it . As to the precise words in which the Northern warrior couched his reply , historians vary ; but they are agreed on the important point that his head was chopped off without delay ! Did the memory of these things bring no blush to Balder 's cheeks ? There he sat , as indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . But this may have been the apathy consequent on the abandonment of lofty pretensions and sublime ambitions ; betraying proud sensitiveness rather than base lack of feeling . Balder Helwyse was not the first man of parts to appear in an undignified and unheroic light . The foremost man of all this world once whined like a sick girl for his physic , and preposterously overestimated his swimming powers ; yet his greatness found him out ! In sober earnest , however , what real importance attaches to Helwyse 's doings at this juncture ? Physically and mentally weary , he may have acted from the most ordinary motives . As to his entertaining any superstitious crotchets about having his hair cut ,  - -  the spirit of the age forbid it ! XIII . THROUGH A GLASS . The hair-dresser had the quality -- now rare among his class -- of unlimited and self-enjoying loquacity ; soothing , because its little waves lapsed in objectless prattle on the beach of the apprehension , to be attended to or not at pleasure . The sentences were without regular head or tail , and were connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any logical sequence ; while the recurring pauses at interesting epochs of work wrought a recognition of how caressing had been the easy voice , and accumulated a lazy disposition to hear it continue . After decking Helwyse for the sacrifice , he had murmured confidentially in his ear , " Hair , sir ? or beard , sir ? or both ?  - -  little of both , sir ? Just so . Hair first , please , sir . Love-ly morning ! " And thereupon began to clip and coo and whisk softly about , in the highest state of barberic joy . As he worked , inspired by the curly , flowing glossy locks which , to his eye , called inarticulately for the tools of his trade , his undulating monologue welled forth until Coleridge might have envied him . Helwyse heard the sound , but let the words go by to that unknown limbo whither all sounds , good or bad , have been flying since time began . By and by the hair was done ; there ensued a plying of brushes , a blowing down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you cast your eyes on the mirror now , sir , please ? " " No ,  - -  go on and finish , first , " replied Helwyse ; and forthwith a cushion was insinuated beneath his head , and his feet were elevated upon a rest . He heard the preparation of the warm lather , and anon the knowing strapping of a razor . He put up his hand and stroked his beard for the last time , wondering how he would look without it . " Never saw the like before , sir ; must have annoyed you dreadful ! " remarked the commiserating barber , as he passed the preparatory scissors round his customer 's jaw , mowing the great golden sheaf at one sweep . He spoke of it as though it were a cancer or other painful excrescence , the removal of which would be to the sufferer a boon unspeakable . Helwyse 's face expressed neither anguish nor relief ; he presently lost himself in thoughts of his own , only returning to the perception of outside things when the barber asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the subject being evidently one which had been held forth upon for some time past . " No ? " continued the little man who by long practice had acquired a wonderful power of interpreting silence . " Well , it 's a great thing , sir ; and a right curious thing is experiencing religion , too ! A great blessing I 've found it , sir ; there 's a peace dwells with me , as the minister says , right along all the time now . Does the razor please you , sir ? Ah ! I was a wild and godless being once , although always reckoned a smart hand with the razor ;  - -  Satan never took my cunning hand , as the poet says , away from me . Yes , there was a time when I was how-d ' y ' - do with all the bloods around the place , and a good business I used to do out of them , too , sir ; but religion is a peace there 's no understanding , as the Good Book says ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save twice as much ,  - -  and that 's the good of it , sir . Beau-ti-ful chin is yours , sir , I declare ! " " Do you believe in the orthodox faith ? " demanded Helwyse ; " in miracles , and the Trinity , and so forth ? " " Everything we 're told to believe in I believe , I hope , sir ; and as quick as I hear anything more , why , I 'm ready to believe that also , provided only it comes through orthodox channels , as the saying is . Ah , sir , it 's the unquestioning belief that brings the happiness . I would n't have anything explained to me , not if I could ! and my faith is such , that what goes against it I never would believe , not if you proved it to me black and white , sir ! Love-ly skin you 've got , sir , it 's just like a woman 's . The intellect is a snare , that 's what it is , ah , yes ! You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Helwyse had relapsed into silence . The little hair-dresser was happy , was he ?  - -  happy , and hopeful , and conscious of spiritual progress ?  - -  had no misgivings and feared no danger ,  - -  because he had eliminated reason from his scheme of religion ! Divine reason ,  - -  could man live without it ? A snare ?  - -  Well , had not Balder found it so ? True , that was not reason 's fault , but his who misused reason . True , also , that he who believed on others ' authority believed not ideas but men , and was destitute of self-reliance or dignity . Yet the hair-dresser seemed to find in that very dependence his best happiness , and to have built up a factitious self-respect from the very ruin of true dignity . His position was the antipodes of Balder 's , yet , if results were evidence , it was tenable and more successful . This plump , superficial , smiling little hair-dresser was a person of no importance , yet it happened to him to modify not only Helwyse 's external aspect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation of a new idea ; for strange to say , Helwyse had never chanced to doubt that seraphim were higher than cherubim , or that independence was the only ladder to heaven . To be taught by one avowedly without intellect is humiliating ; but the experience of many will furnish examples of a singular disregard of this kind of proprieties . When the shaving was done to the artist 's satisfaction , he held the mirror before his customer 's face . Helwyse looked narrowly at his reflection , as was natural in making the acquaintance of one who was to be his near and intimate companion . He beheld a set of features strongly yet gracefully built , but shorn of a certain warm , manly attractiveness . The immediate visibility of mouth and chin -- index of so large a part of man 's nature -- startled him . He was dismayed at the ease wherewith the working of emotion might now be traced . Man wholly unveiled to himself is indeed an awful spectacle , be the dissection-room that of the surgeon or of the psychologist . Hardly might angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wise , because consciousness of a weakness may lead us to give it rein . Perfect strength can coexist only with perfect knowledge , but neither is attainable by man . Man should pay to be screened from himself , lest his sword fail ,  - -  lest the Gorgon 's head on his breast change him to stone . The gracious , outflowering veil of Balder Helwyse 's life had vanished , leaving nakedness . Henceforth he must depend on fence , feint and guard , not on the downright sword-stroke . With Adam , the fig-leaf succeeded innocence as a garment ; for Helwyse , artificial address must do duty as a fig-leaf . The day of guiltless sincerity was past ; gone likewise the day of open acknowledgment of guilt . Now dawned the day of counterfeiting , not always the shortest of our mortal year . On the whole , Helwyse 's new face pleased him not . He felt self-estranged and self-distrustful . Standing on the borders of a darker land , the thoughts and deeds of his past life swarmed in review before his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harm to come . The day 's journey once over , we see its issue prophesied in each trumpery raven and cloud that we have met since morning . However , the omens would have read as well another way ; for nature , like man , is twofold , and can be as glibly quoted to Satan 's advantage as to God 's . " Very well done ! " said Helwyse to the barber , passing a hand over the close-cropped head and polished chin . " The only trouble is , it can not be done once for all . " As the little man smilingly remarked , however , the charge was but ten cents . His customer paid it and went out , and was seen by the hair-dresser to walk listlessly up the street . The improvement in his personal appearance had not mended his spirits . Indeed , it can not be disguised that his trouble was more serious than lay within a barber 's skill altogether to set right . Were man potentially omniscient , then might Balder 's late deed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But is knowledge of evil real knowledge ? God is goodness and man is evil . God knows both good and evil . Man knows evil -- knows himself -- only ; knows God only in so far as he ceases to be man and admits God . But this simple truth becomes confused if we fancy a possible God in man . This was Balder 's difficulty . Possessed of a strong , comprehensive mind , he had made a providence of himself ; confounded intelligence with integrity ; used the moral principle not as a law of action but as a means of insight . The temptation so to do is strong in proportion as the mind is greatly gifted . But experience shows no good results from yielding to it . Blind moral instinct , if not safer , is more comfortable ! Not the deed alone , but the revelation it brought , preyed on the young man 's peace . If he were a criminal to-day , then was the whole argument of his past life criminal likewise . Yesterday 's deed was the logical outcome of a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not his present gloom impended also , and warned him beforehand ? Because , while parleying with the Devil , he looks angelic ; but having given our soft-spoken interlocutor house-room , he makes up for lost time by becoming direfully sincere ! On first facing the world in his new guise , Helwyse felt an embarrassment which he fancied everybody must remark . But , in fact ( as he was not long discovering ) , he was no longer remarkable ; the barber had wiped out his individuality . It was what he had wished , and yet his insignificance annoyed him . The stare of the world had put him out of countenance ; yet when it stopped staring he was still unsatisfied . What can be the solution of this paradox ? It perhaps was the occasion of his seeking the upper part of the city , where houses were more scarce and there were fewer people to be unconcerned ! In country solitudes he could still be the chief figure . He entered Broadway at the point where Grace Church stands , and passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The streets hereabouts were but roughly marked out , and were left in many places to the imagination . On the corner of Twenty-third Street was a low whitewashed inn , whose spreading roof overshadowed the girdling balcony . Farmers ' wagons were housed beneath the adjoining shed , and one was drawn up before the door , its driver conversing with a personage in shirt-sleeves and straw hat , answering to the name of Corporal Thompson . Helwyse perhaps stopped at the Corporal 's hospitable little establishment to rest himself and get some breakfast ; but whether or not , his walk did not end here , but continued up Broadway , and after passing a large kitchen-garden ( whose owner , a stout Dutchman , was pacing its central path , smoking a long clay pipe which he took from his lips only to growl guttural orders to the gardeners who were stooping here and there over the beds ) , emerged into open country , where only an occasional Irish shanty broke the solitude . How long the young man walked he never knew ; but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked northwest and saw the gleam of Hudson River . Leaving the road he struck across rocky fields which finally brought him to the river-bank . A stony promontory jutted into the water , and on this ( having clambered to its outer extremity ) Helwyse sat down , his feet overhanging the swirling current . The tide was just past the flood . About two hundred yards up stream , to the northward , stood a small wooden house , on the beach in front of which a shabby old mariner was bailing out his boat . Southwards , some miles away , curved the shadowed edge of the city , a spire mounting here and there , a pencilled mist of smoke from chimneys , a fringe of thready masts around the farthest point . In front slid ceaselessly away the vast sweep of levelled water , and still it came undiminished on . The opposing shore was a mile distant , its rocky front gradually gaining abruptness and height until lost round the northern curve . But directly opposite Helwyse 's promontory , the stony wall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink serried with a thick phalanx of trees . This spot finally monopolized the adventurer 's attention ; had he been in Germany , he would have looked for gray castle-towers rising behind the foliage . The place looked inaccessible and romantic , and was undeniably picturesque . New York was far enough away to be mistaken for -- say -- Alexandria ; while the broad river certainly took its rise in as prehistoric an age as the Nile itself . Perhaps in the early morning of the world some chieftain built his stronghold there , and fought notable battles and gave mighty feasts ; and later married , and begat stalwart sons , or a daughter beautiful as earth and sky ! Where to-day were her youth and beauty , her loving noble heart , her warm melodious voice , her eyes full of dark light ? Why were there no such women now ? not warped , imperfect , only half alive in body and spirit ; but charged from the heart outwards with pure divine vitality ,  - -  natures vivid as fire , yet by strength serene ! " Why did not I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered Helwyse in a dream . " A woman whose infinite variety age could not alter nor custom stale ! A true wife would have kept me from error . What man can comprehend the world , if he puts half the world away ? Now it is too late ; she might have helped me rise to greatness , but not to bear disgrace . Ah , Balder Helwyse , poor fool ! you babble as if she stood before you to take or leave . You rise to greatness ? You never had the germs of greatness in you ! You are so little that not the goddess Freya herself could have made you tall ! Through what delusion did you fancy yourself better than any other worm ? " There was an interval , not more than a rod or two in width , in the tree-hedge which lined the opposite cliff . Through this one might get a narrow glimpse of what lay beyond . A strip of grassy lawn extended in front of what seemed to be the stone corner of a house . The distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not after the modern style . As Helwise gazed , sharpening his eyes to discern more clearly , he saw a figure moving across the lawn directly towards him . Advancing to the brink of the cliff , it there paused and seemed to return his glance . Helwyse could not tell whether it were man or woman . Had the river only been narrower ! The next moment he remembered his telescope , and , taking it from its case , he was at a bound within one hundred yards of the western shore . Man or woman ? he steadied the glass on his knee and looked again . A woman , surely ,  - -  but how strangely dressed ! Such a costume had not been in vogue since Damascus was a new name in men 's mouths . Balder gazed and gazed . Accurately to distinguish the features was impossible ,  - -  tantalizingly so ; for the gazer was convinced that she was both young and beautiful . Her motions , her bearing , the graceful peculiarity of her garb ,  - -  a hundred nameless evidences made it sure . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a delicacy in thus stealing on her without her knowledge or consent . But the misgiving was not strong enough to shut up his telescope ; perhaps it added a zest to the enjoyment . " The very princess you were just now dreaming of ! the most beautiful and complete woman ! Would I were the prince to win thee ! " This aspiration was whispered , as though its object were within conversable distance . Balder could be imaginative enough when the humor took him . Hardly had the whisper passed his lips when he saw the princess majestically turn her lovely head , slowly and heedfully , until her glance seemed directly to meet his own . His cheeks burned ; it was as if she had actually overheard him . Was she gracious or offended ? He saw her stretch towards him her arms , and then , with a gesture of beautiful power , clasp her hands and draw them in to her bosom . Prince Balder 's hand trembled , the telescope slipped ; the quick effort to regain it lent it an impetus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done its work and was gone forever . The beautiful princess was once more a vague speck across a mile of rapid river ; now , even the speck had moved beyond the trees and was out of sight ! The episode had come so unexpected , and so quickly passed , that now it seemed never to have been at all ! But Helwyse had yielded himself unreservedly to the influence of the moment . Following so aptly the fanciful creation of his thought , the apparition had acquired peculiar significance . The abrupt disappearance afflicted him like a positive loss . Did he , then , soberly believe himself and the princess to have exchanged glances ( not to speak of thoughts ) across a river a mile wide ? Perhaps he merely courted a fancy from which the test of reason was deliberately withheld . Spirits not being amenable to material laws , what was the odds ( so far as exchange of spiritual sentiment was concerned ) whether the prince and princess were separated by miles or inches ? But however plausible the fancy , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat over his eyes , folded his hands beneath his head , and appeared to sleep . XIV . THE TOWER OF BABEL . In a perfect state of society , where people will think and act in harmony with only the purest aesthetic laws , a knowledge of stenography and photography will suffice for the creation of perfect works of art . But until that epoch comes , the artist must be content to do the grouping , toning , and proportioning of his picture for himself , under penalty of redundancy and confusion . People nowadays seldom do or think the right thing at the fitting moment ; insomuch that the biographer , if he would be intelligible , must use his own discretion in arranging his materials . Now , in view of the rough shaking which late events had given Balder and his opinions , it is doing no violence to probability to fancy him taking an early opportunity to pass these opinions in review . It would be easy , by a glance at the magic ring , to reproduce his meditations just as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counsel us to recall a dialogue which had taken place about three years before . Balder and his father were then in the North of England ; and the latter ( who never concerned himself with any save the plainest and most practical philosophy ) was not a little startled at an analogy drawn by his son between the cloud-cap on Helvellyn 's head and the Almighty ! Premising that the cloud-cap , though apparently stable , was really created by the continuous passage of warmer air through a cold region around the summit of the mountain , whereby it was for a moment condensed into visibility and then swept on , having postulated this fact , and disregarding the elder 's remark that he believed not a word of it ,  - -  Balder went on to say that God was only a set of attributes ,  - -  in a word , the perfection of all human attributes ,  - -  and not at all an individual ! " And what has that to do with your cloud-making theory ? " demanded Thor , with scorn . " The perfect human attributes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condensation ,  - -  the cold place , you understand . " " Do they ? Well ? " " The constant condensation of the warm current from below corresponds to the taking on of these attributes by a ceaseless succession of human souls . Filling out the Divine character , they lose identity , and so make room for others . " " What are these attributes ? " " They are ineffable ,  - -  they are omniscience ,  - -  the comprehension of the whole creative idea . " " You expect me to believe that ,  - -  eh ? " growled Thor . " If I could believe you understood it , dear old sceptic ! " returned Balder , with affectionate irreverence , throwing his arm across his father 's broad shoulders . " I say that every soul of right capacity , living for culture , and not afraid of itself , will at last reach that highest point . It is the sublime goal of man , and no human life is complete unless in gaining it . Many fail , but not all . I will not ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite aim not worth having ; and that aim , the highest conceivable . " Thor , having stared in silence at his descendant , came out with a stentorian Viking laugh , which Balder sustained with perfect good-humor . " Ho , ho !  - -  the devil is in you , son !  - -  in those black eyes of yours ,  - -  ho , ho ! No other Helwyse ever had such eyes , or such ideas either ! Well , but supposing you passed the condensation point , what then ? " Balder , who was entirely in earnest about the matter , answered gravely ,  --  " I cease to be ; but what was I becomes the pure , life-giving , spiritual substance , and enters into fresh personalities , and so passes up again in endless circulation . " " Hum ! and how with the evil ones , boy ? " " As with all waste matter ; they are cast aside , and , as distinct souls , are gradually annihilated . But they may still manure the soil , and involuntarily help the growth of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all come into use . " " For all I see , then , " quoth Thor , " your devils come to the same end as your gods ! " " There is the same kind of difference , " returned the philosopher , " as between light and earth ,  - -  both of which help the growth of flowers ; but light gives color and beauty , earth only the insipid matter . I would rather be the light . " " Another thing , " proceeded Thor , ignoring this distinction ; " admitting all else , how do you account for your region of condensation ? " " By the necessity of perfection , " answered Balder , after some consideration . " There would be no meaning in existence unless it tended towards perfection . But you have hit on the unanswerable question . " Thor shook his head and huge grizzled beard . " German University humbug ! " growled he . " Get you into a scrape some day . The cloud 's not made in that way , I tell you ! Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take my arm , " said Balder ; and as together they descended the spur of the mountain , he added lovingly , " I 'll bring no clouds across your sky , my dear old man ! " So the hospitable inn received them . The discussion between the two was never renewed ; but Balder held to his creed . He elaborated and fortified what had been mere outline before . No dogma can be conceived which many circumstances will not seem to confirm and justify . But we can not attempt to keep abreast of Balder 's deductions . There are as many theological systems as individual souls ; and no system can be wholly apprehended by any one save its author . Mastery of men and things ,  - -  supreme knowledge to the end of supreme power , such seems to have been his ambition , an ambition too abstract and lofty for much rivalry . Nature and human nature were at once his laboratory and his instruments . His senses were to him outlets of divinity . The good and evil of such a scheme scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but self-respect raised to such a height becomes self-worship ; human vision dazzles at the sublimity of the prospect ; at the moment of greatest weakness the soul arrogates invincible power , and falls ! For , the mightier man is , the more absolutely does he need the support of a mightier Man than he can ever be . No doubt Balder had often been assailed by doubts and weariness ; the path had seemed too long and arduous , and he had secretly pined for some swift issue from perplexity and delay . In such a moment was it that the voice of darkness gained his ear , and , like a will-o ' - the- wisp , lured him to calamity . Verily , it is not easy to be God . Only builders of the Tower of Babel know the awfulness of its overthrow . Balder 's spirit lay prostrate among the ruins , too stunned and bewildered to see the reason or justice of his fall . Such a state is dangerous , for , the better part of the mind being either occupied with its disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to folly or extravagance ,  - -  to deeds and thoughts which a saner moment would scout and ridicule . Well is it , then , if the blind steps are guided to better foothold than they know how to choose . Angels are said to be particularly watchful over those who sleep ; perhaps , also , during the darkness which follows on moral perversion . XV . CHARON 'S FERRY . After lying motionless for half an hour , Balder suddenly sat upright and settled his hat on his head . A new purpose had come to him which , arriving later than it might have done , made him wish to act upon it without delay . The old mariner had by this time bailed out his boat , and , having shipped a mast in the forward thwart , was dropping down stream . As he neared the promontory Balder hailed him :  --  " Hullo ! skipper , take me across ? " The skipper , without replying , steered shorewards , the other clambering down the rock to meet him . After a brief parley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from head to foot , a bargain was struck , and they put forth , tacking diagonally across stream . For Balder , having charged his imagination with castles , warlike chieftains , and beautiful princesses , had finally arrived at the conclusion that the stone house was an enchanter 's castle ; the figure he had seen , an imprisoned lady ; himself , a knight-errant bound to rescue her and give the wicked enchanter his deserts . This idea possessed his brain for the moment more vividly than do realities most men . The plumed helmet was on his head , he glittered with shining arms and sword , his heart warmed and throbbed with visions of conflict and bold emprise . The commonplace assumed an aspect of grandeur and magnificence in harmony with his chivalric mania . The leaky craft in which he sat became a majestic barge ; the skipper , some wrinkled Charon who doubtless had ferried many a brave knight to his death beneath yonder castle 's walls . That seeming birch-stump on the farther shore was the castle champion , armed cap-a-pie in silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all comers . Trim the sail , ferryman , and steer thy skilfullest ! The kind of insanity which sees in outward manifestation the fantasies of the mind is an affection incident at times to every one . An artist sees beauties in a landscape , an artisan in pulleys and levers , and either may be so far insane in the eyes of the other . Nature discovers grandeur , beauty , or truth according as the quality abides in the seer . In this view Balder or Don Quixote was no more insane than other people . Their eyes bore true witness to what was in their minds , and the sanest eyes can do no more . Their minds were , perhaps , out of focus ; but who can cast the first stone ? The skipper , when not masquerading as Charon , was a lean , brown , and wrinkled old salt , neither complete nor clean of garb , and bulging as to one lank cheek with a quid of tobacco . At first he sat silent , dividing his attention between the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , Captain ? " he asked when they were fairly under way . " Wherever there is a path upwards . Who is the owner of the castle ? " " The castle ? Well , there ai n't many rightly knows just what his name is , " answered Charon , cocking his gray eye rather quizzically . " Some says one thing , some another . I have heard tell he was Davy Jones himself ! " " Have you ever seen him ? " " Well , I do n't know ; I 've seen something that might have been him ; but there 's no telling ! he can fix himself up to look like pretty much anything , they say . There ai n't many calls up to the castle , anyway . " " Why not ? " " Well , there 's a big wall all around the place , for one thing , and never a gate in it ; so without yer dives under ground and up again , there do n't seem no easy way of getting in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , he can get out , I expect , when he wants to , " replied the wrinkled humorist , with a weather-beaten grin . " They do say he whips off on a broomstick about once a month and steers for Bos-ton ! " His fashion of utterance was a leisurely sing-song , like the roll of a vessel anchored in a ground-swell . " Why does he go there ? " demanded Prince Balder , with the air of finding nothing extravagant or improbable in the sailor 's yarn . The latter ( a little doubting whether his interlocutor were a simpleton or a " deep one " ) answered , after a moment 's pause , to replenish his imagination perhaps ,  --  " Well , in course , I knows nothing what he does ; but they do say he coasts around to all the ho-tels and overhauls the log . He 's been laying for some one this twenty year . My idea , it 's about time he hailed him ! " " What does he want with him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chap had played some game or other off on Davy ; so Davy he puts a rod in pickle and vows he 'd be even with the chap , yet . " Yer see ,  - -  I 'll tell yer , " continued Charon , leaning forward on his knee and speaking confidentially ; " just as this chap was putting off , with some of Davy 's belongings , likely ,  - -  Davy up and cuts a slice of flesh and blood off him . Well , he takes this slice and fixes it up one way or another , and makes a witch out of it ,  - -  handsome as she can be ,  - -  enough to draw a chap 's heart right out through his jacket . Now , being as she 's his own flesh and blood , d ' yer see , this chap I 'm telling yer on 's bound to come back after her afore he dies . Well , soon as Davy gets hold on him , he ups with him to the place yonder and outs with the witch . ' Here yer are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be ) , ' here 's yer own flesh and blood a-waiting for yer ! ' Well , the chap grabs for her , and once he touches her there ai n't no letting go no more . Off she starts on her broomstick , he along behind , till they gets over Hell gate --  " Charon checked himself , made an ominous downward gesture with his right forefinger , and emphasized it by spitting solemnly to leeward . " Did you ever meet him ,  - -  this man ? " asked Helwyse , rousing himself from a brown study and looking Charon in the eyes . " Well , now , I could n't tell for certain as I ever met him , " replied the other , returning the look with an odd wrinkling of the features . " But it 's nigh on twenty year that I fetched a man across this very spot , and back again in the evening , that might have been him . Leastways , he was the last caller ever I took over to that house . " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ; and , Captain , no offence to you ,  - -  but allowing for a lot of hair he had , he was like enough to you to be yer twin brother ! " " Or even myself ! So Davy Jones goes by the name of Doctor Glyphic in these parts , does he ? " said Balder , with a sudden , incisive smile , which almost cut through the old ferryman 's self-possession . The boat at the same moment glided into a little cove , and the passenger jumped ashore . Charon stood deferentially touching his weather-stained hat , too much mystified to speak . But the fare which Helwyse handed him restored his voice . " Thank yer , Captain ,  - -  thank yer kindly !  - -  hope no offence , Captain ,  - -  a chap picks up a deal of gossip in twenty year , and --  " " No offence in the world ! " cried Helwyse ; " I take you for a powerful enchanter , who seems to steer one way , when he is in fact taking his passenger in another . Where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit to see if the schooner ai n't around yet . She 'd ought to be in by now , if nothing ai n't runned into her in the fog . " Helwyse paused a moment , eying Charon sharply . " The schooner ' Resurrection , ' " he began , and , seeing he had hit the mark , continued , " was run into last night on Long Island Sound , and had her bowsprit carried away . But no serious damage was done , and she 'll be in by night , if the wind holds . " With this he bade the awe-stricken old yarn-spinner farewell , and , with secret laughter at his bewilderment , turned to the narrow zigzag path that climbed the bank , passing the birch-stump champion without a glance of recognition . A few vigorous minutes brought him to the summit , whence , facing round , he saw the broad river crawl beneath him ; the little boat , with Charon in the stern , drift downwards ; and beyond , the whole rough length of Manhattan Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( some four years after his wife 's death ) he had left a certain little boy and girl in charge of the nurse ,  - -  a woman in whose faithfulness he placed the utmost confidence ,  - -  and had crossed from Brooklyn to New Jersey , to say good by to Brother Hiero . Returning at night he found one of the children -- his son Balder -- locked up in the nursery ; the nurse and the little girl had disappeared , nor did Thor again set eyes on either of them . Balder , as he grew up , often questioned his father concerning various events which had happened beyond the reach of his childish memory ; and among other stories , no doubt this of the farewell visit to Uncle Glyphic had been often told with all the details . By no miracle , therefore , but simply by an acute mental process , associating together time , place , and description , was Balder enabled so to dumfounder old Charon . Embarking on a phantom quest , his brain full of whimsical visions , Balder had thus unexpectedly stepped into the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better reason than that it was such ) inspired him with a superficial cheerfulness . He had landed some distance below his uncle Glyphic 's house ,  - -  for such indeed it was ,  - -  and he now took his way towards it through trees and underbrush . It was so situated , and so thickly surrounded with foliage , as to be visible from no point in the vicinity . Had the site been chosen with a view to concealment , the builder could not have succeeded better . Remembering the eccentricity of his uncle 's character , as portrayed in many an anecdote , Balder would not have been surprised to find him living under ground , or in a pyramid . On arriving at the wall whereof the ferryman had told him , he found it a truly formidable affair , some twelve feet high and built of brick . To scale it without a ladder was impossible ; but Balder , never doubting that there was a gate somewhere , set out in search of it . It was tiresome walking over the uneven ground and through obstructing bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as interminable as unbroken . How many houses , thought Balder , might have been built from the material thus wasted ! If ever he came into possession of the place , he resolved to present the brick to his friend Charon , that he might replace his wooden shanty with something more durable and convenient , and perhaps build a dock for the schooner " Resurrection " to lie in . It must have taken a fortune to put up such a wall ; were the enclosure proportionally valuable , it was worth while crossing the ocean to see it . Still more wall ! fully a mile of it already , and yet further it rambled on through leafy thickets . But no signs of a gate ! " I believe the Devil really does live here ! " exclaimed Balder , in impatient heat ; " and the only way in or out is on a broomstick , or by diving under ground , as Charon said ! " Stumbling onwards awhile farther , he suddenly came again upon the river-bank , having skirted the whole length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The castle was impregnable . Helwyse sat down at the foot of a birch-tree which grew a few yards from the wall . " How does my uncle manage about his butcher and baker , I wonder ! He might at least have provided a derrick for victualling his stronghold . Perhaps he hauls up provisions by ropes over the face of the cliff . No doubt , Charon knew about it . Shall I go down and look ? " It was provoking -- having come so far to call on a relative -- to be put off with a mile or two of brick wall . The gate must have been walled up since his father 's time , for Thor had never mentioned any deficiency in that respect . But Balder 's determination was piqued , not to mention his curiosity . Had the path from Mr. MacGentle 's office to Doctor Glyphic 's door been straight and unobstructed , the young man might have wandered aside and never reached the end . As it was , he was goaded into the resolution to see his uncle at all hazards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had seen -- or dreamt he saw -- from the farther bank . Was she indeed but an apparition ? or the single reality amidst the throng of fantasies evoked by his overwrought mind ?  - -  beaconing him through misty errors to a fate better than he knew ! In all seriousness , who could she be ? Had Doctor Glyphic crowned his eccentricities by marrying , and begetting a daughter ? These speculations were interrupted by the clear , joyous note of a bird , just above Balder 's head . It was such a note as might have been uttered by a paradisical cuckoo with the breath of a brighter world in his throat . Looking up , he saw a beautiful little fowl perched on the topmost twig of the birch-tree . It had a slender bill , and on its head a crest of splendid feathers , which it set up at Balder in a most coquettish manner . The next moment it flew over the wall , and from the farther side warbled an invitation to follow . Although he could not fly , Balder reflected that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show him more than he could see now . The birch looked tolerably climbable and was amply high ; as to toughness , he thought not about it . Beneath what frivolous disguises does destiny mask her approach ! Discretion is a virtue ; yet , had Balder been discreet enough to examine the tree before getting into it , the ultimate consequences are incalculable ! As it was ( and marvelling why he had not thought of doing it before ) he set stoutly to work , and , despite his jack-boots , was soon among the upper branches . The birch trembled and groaned unheeded . The bird ( an Egyptian bird ,  - -  a hoopoe ,  - -  descendant of a pair brought by Doctor Glyphic from the Nile a quarter of a century ago ) ,  - -  the hoopoe was fluttering and warbling and setting its brilliant cap at the young man more captivatingly than ever . A glance over the enclosure showed a beautifully fertile and luxurious expanse , damasked with soft green grass and studded with flowers and trees . A few hundred yards away billowed the white tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen through boughs and leaves , rose an anomalous structure of brick , glass , and stone , which could only be the famous house on whose design and decoration old Hiero Glyphic had spent years and fortunes . The tract was like an oasis in a forbidding land . The soil had none of the sandy and clayey consistency peculiar to New Jersey , but was deep and rich as an English valley . The sunshine rested more warmly and mellowly here than elsewhere . The southern breeze acquired a tropical flavor in loitering across it . The hoopoe had seemed out of place on the hither side the wall , but now looked as much at home as though the Hudson had been the Nile indeed . " My uncle , " said Balder to himself , as he swayed among the branches of his birch-tree , " has really succeeded very well in transporting a piece of Egypt to America . Were I on the other side of the wall , no doubt I might appreciate it also ! " The hoopoe responded encouragingly , the tree cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath him . There was no time to climb down again . With a dismal croak , the faithless birch leaned slowly through the air . There was nothing to be done but to go with it ; and Balder , even as he descended , was able to imagine how absurd he must appear . The tree fell , but was intercepted at half its height by the top of the wall . The upper half of the stem , with its human fruit still attached to it , bent bow-like towards the earth , the trunk not being quite separated from the root . Helwyse had thus far managed to keep his presence of mind , and now , glancing downwards , he saw the ground not eight feet below . He loosed his hold , and the next instant stood in the soft grass . The birch had been his broomstick . Meanwhile the hoopoe , with a triumphant note , flew off towards the house to tell the news . XVI . LEGEND AND CHRONICLE . Hiero Glyphic 's house came not into the world complete at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , progressing through many years . Originally a single-gabled edifice , its only peculiarity had been that it was brick instead of wooden . Here , red and unornamented as the house itself , the future Egyptologist was born . The parallel between him and his dwelling was maintained more or less closely to the end . He was the first pledge of affection between his mother and father , and the last also ; for shortly after his advent the latter parent , a retired undertaker by profession , failed from this world . The widow was much younger than her husband , and handsome to boot . Nevertheless , several years passed before she married again . Her second lord was likewise elderly , but differed from the first in being enormously wealthy . The issue of this union was a daughter , the Helen of our story , a pretty , dark-eyed little thing , petted and indulged by all the family , and reigning undisputed over all . Meanwhile the old brick house had been deserted , Mrs. Glyphic having accompanied her second husband to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiero ( or , as he was then called , Henry ) took it into his head to return to the original family mansion and live there . No objection was made ; in truth , Henry 's oddities , awkwardnesses , and propensity to dabble in queer branches of research and experiment may have allayed the parting pangs . Back he blundered , therefore , to the banks of the Hudson , and established himself in his birthplace . What he did there during the next few years will never be known . Grisly stories about the man in the brick house were current among the country people . A devil was said to be his familiar friend ; nay , it was whispered that he himself was the arch-fiend ! But nothing positively supernatural , or even unholy , was ever proved to have taken place . The recluse had the command of as much money as he could spend , and no doubt he wrought with it miracles beyond the vulgar comprehension . His mind had no more real depth than a looking-glass with a crack in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many such men , but few possess unlimited means of carrying their crack-brained fancies into fact . During this -- which may be called the second -- period of Glyphic 's career , he made several anomalous additions to the brick house , all after designs of his own . He moreover furnished it anew throughout , in a manner that made the upholsterers stare . Each room -- so reads the legend -- was fitted up in the style of a different country , according to Glyphic 's notion of it ! He was said to live in one apartment or another according as it was his whim to be Spaniard , Turk , Russian , Hindoo , or Chinaman . He also applied himself to gardening , and enclosed seven hundred acres of ground adjoining the house with a picket-fence , forerunner of the famous brick wall . The whole tract was dug out and manured to the depth of many feet , till it was by far the most fertile spot in the State . The larger trees were not disturbed , but the lesser were forced to give place to new and rare importations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like banks of sunset clouds ; the lawns showed the finest turf out of England ; there was a kitchen-garden rich and big enough to feed an army of epicures all their lives . In short , the place was a concentrated extract of the world at large , where one might at the same moment be a recluse and a cosmopolitan . Here might one live independent of the world , yet sipping the cream thereof ; and might persuade himself that all beyond these seven hundred enchanted acres was but a diffused reflection of the concrete existence between the cliff and the fence . But to this second period succeeded finally the third ,  - -  that which witnessed the birth and growth of the Egyptian mania . Its natal moment has not been precisely determined ; perhaps it was a gradual accretion . Mr. Glyphic 's relatives in Brooklyn were one day electrified by the news that the quondam Henry -- now Hiero -- purposed instant departure for Europe and Egypt . Before starting , however , he built the brick wall round his estate , shutting it out forever from human eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen no more . His return was heralded by the arrival at the port of New York of a mountain of freight , described in the invoice as the property of Doctor Hiero Glyphic of New Jersey . The boxes , as they stood piled together on the wharf , might have furnished timber sufficient to build a town . They contained the fruits of Doctor Glyphic 's antiquarian researches . The Doctor himself -- where he picked up his learned title is unknown -- was accompanied by a slender , swarthy young factotum who answered to the name of Manetho . He was introduced to the Brooklyn relatives as the pupil , assistant , and adopted son of Hiero Glyphic . The latter , physically broadened , browned , and thickened by his travels , was intellectually the same good-natured , fussy , flighty original as ever ; shallow , enthusiastic , incoherent , energetic . He and his adopted son shut themselves up behind the brick wall ; but it soon transpired that extensive additions were making to the old house . Beyond this elementary fact conjecture had the field to itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn to secrecy , while the high wall and the hedge of trees baffled prying eyes . Quantities of red granite and many blocks of precious marbles were understood to be using in the work . The opinion gained that such an Oriental palace was building as never had been seen outside an Arabian fairy-tale . By and by the work was done , the workmen disappeared . But whoever hoped that now the mystery would be revealed , and the Oriental palace be made the scene of a gorgeous house-warming , was disappointed . The dwellers behind the wall emerged not from their seclusion , nor were others invited to relieve it . In due course of time Doctor Glyphic 's worthy step-father died . The widow and her daughter continued to live in Brooklyn until the former 's death , which took place a few years afterwards . Then Helen came to her brother , and the Brooklyn house was put under lock and key , and so remained till Helen 's marriage , when it was set in order for the bridal pair . But Thor 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sold it four years later and left America forever . After his departure less was known , than before of how things went on behind the brick wall . The gateway was filled in with masonry . No one was ever seen entering the enclosure or leaving it ; though it was supposed that , somehow or other , communication was occasionally had with the outside world . As knowledge dwindled , legend grew , and wild were the tales told of the invisible Doctor and his foster-son . In his youth , the former had been suspected of simple witchcraft , but he was not let off so easily now . Manetho was first dubbed a genie whom the Doctor had brought out of Egypt . Afterwards it was hinted that these two worthies were in fact one and the same demon , who by some infernal jugglery was able to appear twain during the daytime , but resumed his proper shape at night , and cut up all manner of unholy capers . By another version , Doctor Glyphic died in Egypt , not before bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in charge of a condemned soul under the guise of Manetho . During the day , affirmed these theorists , the body was inspired by the soul with phantom life ; but became a mummy at night , when the condemned soul suffered torments till morning . With sunrise the ghastly drama began anew . This state of things must continue until the sun shone all night long within the brick wall enclosure . A third , more moderate account is that to which we have already listened from Charon 's lips . And he perhaps built on a broader basis of truth than did the other yarn-spinners . But under whatever form the legend appeared , there was always mingled with it a vaguely mysterious whisper relating to the alleged presence in the Doctor 's Den ( so the enclosure was nicknamed ) of an apparition in female form . What or whence she was no one pretended soberly to conjecture . Even her personal aspect was the subject of vehement dispute ; some maintaining her to be of more than human beauty , while others swore by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! These damned her for a malignant witch ; those upheld her as a heavenly angel , urged by love divine to expiate , through voluntary suffering , the nameless crimes of the demoniac Doctor . But unless the redemption were effected within a certain time , she must be swallowed up with him in common destruction . Were the how and wherefore of these alternatives called in question , the answer was a wise shake of the head ! The gentle reader will believe no one of the fantastic legends here recorded ; possibly they were not believed by their very fabricators . They are useful only as tending to show the moral atmosphere of the house and its occupants . There is sometimes a subtile symbolic element inwoven with such tales , which -- though not the truth -- helps us to apprehend the truth when we come to know it . Moreover , the fanciful parts of history are to the facts as clouds to a landscape ; a picture is incomplete without them ; they aid in bringing out the distances , and cast lights and shadows over tracts else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient mariner , Balder Helwyse knew nothing of these fearful fables . This perhaps accounted for the boldness wherewith he pursued his way towards the mysterious house , following in the airy wake of the clear-throated little hoopoe . XVII . FACE TO FACE . The ground-plan of the house was like a capital H placed endwise towards the river . The northern side consisted of the original brick building and the additions of the second period ; the southern was that stone edifice which so few persons had been lucky enough to see . The centre or cross-piece comprised the grand entrance-hall and staircase , heavily panelled with dark oak , and the floor flagged with squares of black and white marbles . This entrance-hall opened eastward into a generous conservatory , filling the whole square court between the wings at that end . The corresponding western court was devoted to the roomy portico . Two or three broad steps mounted to a balcony twenty feet deep and nearly twice as wide , protected by a lofty roof supported on slender Moorish columns . Crossing this , one came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considered room by room and part by part , the house was good and often beautiful ; taken as a whole , it was the craziest amalgamation of incongruities ever conceived by human brain . Balder , approaching from the north , trod enjoyingly the silken grass . No misgiving had he ; his uncle would hardly be from home , nor would he be apt to discredit his nephew 's identity . His face had already been evidence to more than one former knower of his father , and why not also to his uncle ? The house was more than half a mile in a direct line from the birch-tree , and presented an imposing appearance ; but on drawing near , the odd architectural discrepancies became noticeable . Side by side with the prosy Americanism of the northern wing , sprang gracefully the Moorish columns of the portico ; beyond , uprose in massive granite , quaintly inscribed and carved , and strengthened by heavy pilasters , the ponderous Egyptian features of the southern portion . The latter was neither storied nor windowed , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lighted from within . Meanwhile there were no signs of an inhabitant , either in the house or out of it . It wore in parts an air of emptiness and neglect , not exactly as though gone to seed , but as if little human love and care had been expended there . The deep-set windows of the brick wing , like the sunken eyes of an old woman , peered at the visitor with dusky forlornness . Lonely and stern on the other side stood the Egyptian pilasters , as though unused to the eye of man ; the hieroglyphics along the cornice intensified the impression of desertion . As the young man set foot beneath the portico , he laid a hand on one of the slender pillars , to assure himself that it was real , and not a vision . Cool , solid marble met his grasp ; the building did not vanish in a peal of thunder , with an echo of demoniac laughter . Yes , all was real ! But the stillness was impressive , and Balder struck the pillar sharply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . There was no answering sound , so , after a moment 's hesitation , he walked to the door ,  - -  which stood ajar ,  - -  purposing to call in the aid of bell and knocker . Neither of these civilized appliances was to be found . While debating whether to use his voice or to enter and use his eyes , the note of the hoopoe fell on his ear . An instant after came an answering note , deeper , sweeter , and stronger , it thrilled to Balder 's heart , bringing to his mind , by some subtile process , the goddess of the cliff . He crossed the oak-panelled hall ( where the essence of mediaeval England lingered ) and came to the threshold of the conservatory . It was a scene confusedly beautiful . The air , as it touched his face , was tropically warm and indolent with voluptuous fragrance of flowers and plants . Luxuriant shrubs , with broad-drooping leaves , stood motionless in the heat . Two palm-trees uplifted their heavy plumes forty feet aloft , on slender stalks , brushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool slumbered between rocky margins , overgrown with a profusion of reeds , grasses , and water-plants . There floated the giant leaves and blossoms of the tropic water-lily ; and on a fragment of rock rising above the surface dozed a small crocodile , not more than four feet long , but looking as old , dried up , and coldly cruel as sin itself ! The place looked like an Indian jungle , and Balder half expected to see the glancing spits of a tiger crouching beneath the overarching leaves ; or a naked savage with bow and arrows . But amid all this vegetable luxuriance appeared no human being , no animal save the evil crocodile . Whence , then , that melodious voice ,  - -  clear essence of nature 's sweetest utterances ? At the left of the conservatory was a door , the entrance to the Egyptian temple . It was square and heavy-browed , flanked by short thick columns rising from a base of sculptured papyrus-leaves , and flowering in lotus capitals . Three marble steps led to the threshold , while on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a delicate flowering vine , which had been trained to cling round their necks . On the deep panels of the door were mystic emblems carved in relief . A line of hieroglyphics inscribed the lintel in deep blue , red , and black , to what purport Balder could not divine . At the opposite side of the conservatory was a corresponding door , veiled by an ample fold of silken tapestry , cunningly hand-worked in representation of a moon half veiled in clouds , shining athwart a stormy sea . By her light a laboring ship was warned off the rocks to leeward . The room ( one of the later additions ) by its external promise might have been the bower of some fashionable beauty thousands of years ago . Balder looked from one of these doors to the other , doubting at which to apply . The tapestry curtain was swept aside at the base , leaving a small passage clear to the room beyond . In this opening now appeared the bright-crested head and eyes of the hoopoe , peeping mischievously at the intruder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to the little bird a friendly finger . The bird eyed him critically , then launched itself on the air , and , alighting on a spray above his head , warbled out a brilliant call . Hereupon was heard within a quick rustling movement ; the curtain was thrust aside , and a youthful woman issued forth amongst the warm plants . She was within a few feet of Balder Helwyse before seeming to realize his presence . She caught herself motionless in an instant . The sparkle of laughter in her eyes sank in a black depth of wonder . Her eyes filled themselves with Balder as a lake is filled with sunshine ; and he , the man of the Wilie and philosopher , could only return her gaze in voiceless admiration . Were a face and form of primal perfection to appear among men , might not its divine originality repel an ordinary observer , used to consider beautiful such abortions of the Creator 's design as sin and degeneration have produced ? Not easily can one imagine what a real man or woman would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn , if at all , from living , electric flesh and blood . This young woman was tall and erect with youthful majesty . She stood like the rejoicing upgush of a living fountain . Her contour was subtile with womanly power ,  - -  suggesting the spring of the panther , the glide of the serpent . Warm she seemed from the bosom of nature . One felt from her the influence of trees , the calm of meadows , the high freedom of the blue air , the happiness of hills . She might have been the sister of the sun . The moulding finger of God seemed freshly to have touched her face . It was simple and harmonious as a chord of music , yet inexhaustible in its variety . It recalled no other face , yet might be seen in it the germs of a mighty nation , that should begin from her and among a myriad resemblances evolve no perfect duplicate . No angel 's countenance , but warmest human clay , which must undergo some change before reaching heaven . The sphinx , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  before men vexed themselves to unravel God 's webs from without instead of from within , might have looked thus ; or such perhaps was Isis in the first flush of her divinity ,  - -  fresh from Him who made her immortally young and fair . Her black hair was crowned with a low , compact turban ,  - -  a purple and white twist of some fine cottony substance , striped with gold . Round her wide , low brow fitted a band of jewelled gold , three fingers ' breadth , from which at each temple depended a broad , flat chain of woven coral , following the margin of the cheeks and falling loose on the shoulders . A golden serpent coiled round her smooth throat and drooped its head low down in her bosom . Her elastic feet , arched like a dolphin 's back , were sandalled ; the bright-colored straps , crossing one another half-way to the knee , set dazzlingly off the clear , dusky whiteness of the skin . From her shoulders fell a long full robe of purple byssus , over an underdress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the waist by a hundred-fold girdle , embroidered with rainbow flowers and fastened in a broad knot below the bosom , the low-hanging ends heavy with fringe . The outer robe , with its long drooping sleeves falling open at the elbow , was ample enough wholly to envelop the figure , but was now girded up and one fold brought round and thrust beneath the girdle in front , to give freedom of motion . A rare perfume emanated from her like the evening breath of orange-blossoms . Balder was no unworthy balance to this picture , though his else stately features showed too much the stimulus of modern thought . He was eminent by culture ; she by nature only . But Balder 's culture had not greatened him . Greatness is not of the brain , save as allied to the deep , pure chords which thrill at the base of the human symphony . He might have stood for our age ; she , for that more primitive but profounder era which is at once man 's beginning and his goal . Balder 's eyes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity . All he had ever done amiss arose and put him to the blush . Nevertheless , he would not admit his inferiority ; instead of dropping his eyes he closed the soul behind them , and sharpened them with a shallow , out-striking light . Without understanding the change , she felt it and was troubled . Loftily majestic as were her form and features , she was feminine to the core ,  - -  tender and finely perceptive . The incisive masculine gaze abashed her . She raised one hand deprecatingly , and her lips moved , though without sound . He relented at this , and straightway her expression again shifted , and she smiled so radiantly that Balder almost looked to see whence came the light ! The wondrous lines of her face curved and softened ; all that was grave vanished . A tree standing in the sober beauty of shadow , when suddenly lit by the sun , changes as she changed ; for sunshine is the laughter of the world . The smile refreshed her courage , for she came nearer and made a sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would pass through the stalwart young man as readily as through the air . On encountering solid substance , she drew startled back , half in alarm and wholly in surprise . Balder had felt her touch , first as a benediction ; then it chilled him , through remembrance of a deed forever debarring him from aught so pure and innocent as she . The subtleties of his philosophy might have cajoled him anywhere save in her presence . There , he felt unmistakably guilty ; yet from irrational dread that she , whose intuitions seemed so swift and deep , might grasp the cause of his discomposure , he strove to hide it . Last of all the world should she know his crime ! Scarce two minutes since their meeting , yet perhaps a large proportion of their lives had meanwhile been charmed away . No word had been spoken ,  - -  eyes had superseded tongues . Nay , was ordinary conversation possible with a young goddess such as this ? So perfect seemed her mastery over those profounder elements of intercourse underlying speech , which are higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perhaps the latter method was unknown to her . Nevertheless , one must say something . But what ? with what sentence of supreme significance should he begin ? Moreover , what language should he use ? for she , whose look and bearing were so alien to the land and age , might likewise be a stranger to modern dialects . But Aryan or Semitic was not precisely at the tip of Balder 's tongue ! In the midst of his embarrassment , the startling note of the hoopoe pierced his ear , and precipitated him into asking that great elemental question which all created things are forever putting to one another ,  --  " What is your name ? " XVIII . THE HOOPOE AND THE CROCODILE . " Gnulemah ! " she answered , laying a finger on the head of her golden serpent , and uttering the name as though it were of the only woman in the world . But the next moment she found time to realize that something unprecedented had occurred , and her wonder trembled on the brink of dismay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath ; " but is not Hiero . " Until Balder 's arrival , then , Hiero would seem to have been the only talking animal she had known . The singularity of this did not at first strike the young man . Gnulemah was the arch-wonder ; yet she so fully justified herself as to seem very nature ; and by dint of her magic reality , what else had been wonderful seemed natural . Balder was in fairy-land . He fell easily into the fairy-land humor . " I am a being like yourself , " said he , with a smile ; " and not dumb like your plants and animals . " " Understood !  - -  answered ! " exclaimed Gnulemah again , in a tremor . As morning spreads up the sky , did the sweet blood flow outward to warm her face and neck . As the blush deepened , her eyelids fell , and she shielded her beautiful embarrassment with her raised hands . A pathos in the simple grace of this action drew tears unawares to Balder 's eyes . What was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in this enchanted spot , companionless ( for poor old Hiero could scarcely serve her turn ) and ignorant perhaps that the world held other beings endowed like herself with human gifts ? Had she vainly sought throughout nature for some kinship more intimate than nature could yield her , and thus at length fancied herself a unique , independently created soul , imperial over all things ? Since her whole world was comprised between the wall and the river , no doubt she believed the reality of things extended no further . In Balder she had found a creature like , yet pleasingly unlike herself , palpable to feeling as to sight , and gifted with that articulate utterance which till now she had accounted her almost peculiar faculty . Delightful might be the discovery , but awesome too , frightening her back by its very tendency to draw her forward . Whether or not this were the solution of Gnulemah 's mystery , Balder recognized quiet to be his cue towards her . Probably he could not do better than to get the ear of Doctor Hiero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present one . His next step accordingly was to ask after him by name . She peeped at the questioner between her fingers , but ventured not quite to emerge from behind them , as she answered ,  - -  her primary attempt at description ,  --  " Hiero is -- Hiero ! " " And how long have you been here ? " inquired Balder with a smile . Gnulemah forgot her embarrassment in wondering how so remarkable a creature happened to ask questions whose answers her whole world knew ! " We are always here ! " she exclaimed ; and added , after a moment 's doubtful scrutiny , " Are you a spirit ? " " An embodied spirit , yes ! " answered he , smiling again . " One of those I see beyond , " she pointed towards the cliff ,  --  " that move and seem to live , but are only shadows in the great picture ? No ! for I can not touch them nor speak with them ; they never answer me ; they are shadows . " She paused and seemed to struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Helwyse to himself . Though no Hermetic philosopher , he was aware of a symbolic truth in the fanciful dogma . Outside his immediate circle , the world is a shadow to every man ; his fellow-beings are no more than apparitions , till he grasps them by the hand . So to Gnulemah the cliff and the garden wall were her limits of real existence . The great picture outside could be true for her only after she had gone forth and felt as well as seen it . Fancy aside , however , was not hers a condition morally and mentally deplorable ? Exquisitely developed in body , must not her mind have grown rank with weeds ,  - -  beautiful perhaps , but poisonous ? Herein Balder fancied he could trace the one-sided influence of his crack-brained uncle.  - -  Whether his daughter or not , Gnulemah was evidently a victim of his experimental mania . What particular crotchet could he have been humoring in this case ? Was it an attempt to get back to the early sense of the human race ? The materials for such an evolution were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent natural capacity , Gnulemah might claim equality with the noblest daughter of the Pharaohs . The grand primary problem of how to isolate her from all contact with the outside world was , under the existing circumstances , easy of solution . Beyond this there needed little positive treatment . Her creed must arise from her own instinctive and intuitive impressions . Of all beyond the reach of her hands , she trust to her eyes alone for information ; no marvel , therefore , if her conclusions concerning the great intangible phenomena of the universe were fantastic as the veriest heathen myths . The self-evolved feelings and impulses of a black-eyed nymph like Gnulemah were not likely to be orthodox . She was probably no better than a worshipper of vain delusions and idols of the imagination . Her attire -- a style of costume such as might have been the fashion in the days of Cheops or Tuthmosis -- showed a carrying out of the Doctor 's whim ,  - -  a matching of the external to the internal conditions of the age he aimed to reproduce . The project seemed , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was seldom that Uncle Hiero achieved so harmonious a piece of work ; but the idea showed greater moral obliquity than Balder would have looked for in the old gentleman . But there was no deep sincerity in the young man 's strictures . There before him stood the woman Gnulemah ,  - -  purple , white , and gold ; a vivid , breathing , warm-hued life ; a soul and body rich with Oriental splendor . There she stood , her hair flowing dark and silky from beneath her twisted turban , her eyes ,  - -  black melted loadstones ; the broad Egyptian pendants gleaming and glowing from temple to shoulder . The golden serpent seemed to writhe on her bosom , informed from its wearer with a subtile vitality . Through all dominated a grand repose , like the calm of nature , which storms may prove but not disthrone ! There she stood ,  - -  enchanted princess , witch , goddess ,  - -  woman at all events , palpable and undeniable . She must be accepted for what she was , civilized or uncivilized , heathen or Christian . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been made better . Who says that an evening cloud , gorgeous in purple and heavenly gold , were more usefully employed fertilizing a garden-patch ? Balder Helwyse , moreover , was not a simple utilitarian ; he was almost ready to make a religion of beauty . If he blamed his uncle for shutting up this superb creature within herself , he failed not to admire the result of the imprisonment . He knew he was beholding as rare a spectacle as ever man 's eyes were blessed withal ; nor was he slow to perceive the psychological interest of the situation . To a student of mankind , if to no one else , Gnulemah was beyond estimation precious . But had Balder forgotten what fruit his tree of philosophy had already yielded him ? At all events , he forbore to press his question as to the whereabouts of Uncle Hiero , who would turn up sooner or later . It was enough for the present to know that he still existed . Meanwhile he would sound the depths of this fresh nature , undisturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the acquaintance thus far ) forsook his perch above Balder 's head , and after hovering for a moment in mid-air , as if to select the best spot , he alighted on the mossy cushion at the foot of the twin palm-trees . Such a couch might Adam and Eve have rejoiced to find in Paradise . Balder took the hint , and without more ado threw himself down there , while Gnulemah half knelt , half sat beside him , propped on her arm , her warm fingers buried in the cool moss . The little master-of-ceremonies remained , with a fine sense of propriety , between the two , preening and fluttering his brilliant feathers and casting diamond glances sidelong . " You remember nothing before coming to this place , Gnulemah ? " " Only dream-memories , that grow dimmer . Before this , I was a spirit in the great picture , and when my lamp goes out I shall return thither . " " Your lamp , Gnulemah ?  - -  what lamp ? " " How can you understand me and yet not know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; it burns always in the temple yonder ; when it goes out my life will become a darkness , for I am Gnulemah , the daughter of fire ! " " I knew not that my uncle was a poet , " muttered Balder to himself . " A daughter of fire , yes , there is lightning in her eyes ! " Aloud he said , secretly alluding to the manner of his descent into the garden ,  --  " I dropped from the sky into your world , Gnulemah . Though we can talk together , whatever we tell each other will be new . " She caught the idea of a lifetime spent instructing this delightful being , and receiving in return instruction from him . She entered at once the charming vista . " Tell me , " she began , bending towards him in her earnestness , " are there others like you ?  - -  are they bright and beautiful as you are ? or do they look like Hiero ? " Balder laughed , and flushed , and his heart warmed pleasurably . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And albeit the lovely flatterer 's experience of men was avowedly most limited , yet her taste was unvitiated as her sincerity , and her judgment may therefore have been more valuable than that of the most practised belle of fashion . But he answered modestly ,  --  " Hiero and I are both men , and there are as many men as stars in heaven , and as many women as men , myriads of men and women , Gnulemah ! " She lifted her face and hand in eloquent astonishment . " O , what a world ! " she exclaimed in her low-toned way . " But are the women all like me ? " " There is not one like you , " answered Balder , with the quiet emphasis of conviction . How refreshing was it thus to set aside conventionalism ! Her ingenuousness brought forth the like from him . " Have you never wished to go beyond the wall ? " he asked her . " Yes , often ! " she said , fingering the golden serpent thoughtfully . " But that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get tired of this world , it has changed since I first came to it . " " Is it less beautiful ? " " It is smaller than it used to be , " said Gnulemah , pensively . " Once the house was so high , it seemed to touch heaven ;  - -  see how it has dwindled since then ! And so with other things that are on earth . The stars and the sun and clouds , they have not changed ! " " That is a consolation , is it not ? " observed Balder , between a smile and a sigh . Gnulemah was not the first to charge upon the world the alterations in the individual ; nor the first , either , to find comfort in the constancy of Heaven . She went on , won to further confidence by her listener 's sympathy ,  --  " I used to hope the wall would one day become so low that I might pass over it . But it has ceased to change , and is still too high . Shall I ever see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down if need be . But you might go far before finding a world so fair as this . Perhaps it would be better to stand on the cliff , and only look forth across the river . " " I can not stay always here , " returned Gnulemah , shaking her turbaned head , with its gleaming bandeau and rattling pendants . " But no wall is between me and the sky ; the flame of my lamp goes upward , and why should not Gnulemah ? " " A friend is the only world one does not tire of , " he replied after a pause . " You have lacked companions . " Gnulemah glanced down at the hoopoe , who forthwith warbled aloud and fluttered up to her shoulder . The bird was her companion , and so , likewise , were the plants and flowers . Gnulemah could converse with them in their own language . Nature was her friend and confidant , and intimately communed with her . All this was conveyed to Balder 's apprehension , not by words , but by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiceless utterances in a manner pregnant and felicitous almost beyond belief . " I meet also a beautiful maiden in the looking-glass , " she added ; " her face and motion are always the same as my own . But though she seems to speak , her voice never reaches me ; and she smiles , but only when I smile ; and mourns only when I mourn . We can never reach each other ; but there is more in her than in my birds and flowers . " " She is the shadow of yourself ; no reality , Gnulemah . " " Are we shadows of each other , then ? is she weary of her world , as I of mine ? shall we both escape to some other , or only pass each into the other 's , and be separated as before ? " Balder , like wise men before him , was at some loss how to bring his wisdom to bear here . He could not in one sentence explain the complicated phenomena in question . Fortunately , however , Gnulemah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to another 's judgment ) seemed hardly to expect a solution to problems upon which she had expended much private thought . " I have come to look on her as though she were myself , and she tells me secrets which no one else can know . Some things she tells me that I do not care to hear , but they are always true . I can see changes in ; her face that I feel in my own heart . " " Does she teach you that you grow every day more beautiful ? " He was willing to prove whether Gnulemah could thus be disconcerted . Many a woman had he known , surprisingly innocent until a chance word or glance betrayed profoundest depths . " Our beauty is like the garden , which is beautiful every day , though no day is just like another . But the changes I mean are in the spirit that looks back at me from her eyes , when I enter deeply into them . " What connection could , after all , subsist between beauty and vanity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Doubtless she enjoyed her beauty ,  - -  the more , as her taste was pure of conventional falsities . How much of worldly experience would it take to vitiate that integrity in her ? Would it not be better to leave her to end her life , restricted to the same innocent and lovely companionship which had been hers thus far ? Here the hoopoe , startled at some movement that Balder made , abandoned his perch on his mistress 's shoulder , and flew to the top of the palm-tree . Had the day when such friends would suffice her needs gone by ? Yes , it was now too late . No one who has beheld the sun can thenceforth dispense with it . Balder had shone across the beautiful recluse 's path , and linked her to outside realities by a chain which , whether he went or stayed , would never break . Flowers , birds , shadows in the mirror ,  - -  less than nothing would these things be to her from this hour on . Heretofore the intercourse between the two had been tentative and incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed delightful , but might mask unknown dangers . No solid basis of mutual acquaintanceship had been even approached . Balder , accustomed though he was to woman 's society , knew not how to apply his experience here ; while Gnulemah had not yet perhaps decided whether her visitor were natural or supernatural . The man was probably the less at ease of the two , finding himself in a pass through which tradition nor culture could pilot him . Gnulemah , being used to daily communion with things mysterious to her understanding , would scarcely have altered her demeanor had Balder turned out to be a genie ! But the first step towards fixing the relations between them was already taken . The young man 's abrupt movement of his hand to his face ( probably with purpose to stroke the beard no longer growing there ) had not only scared away the hoopoe , but had flashed on Gnulemah a ray from the diamond ring . She rose to her feet suddenly , yet easily as a startled serpent rears erect its body . Vivid emotion lightened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look she gleamed at him . " What are you ? " she asked , her voice sunk to almost a whisper . " Hiero ?  - -  are you Hiero ? " Balder stared confounded ,  - -  partly inclined to smile ! " Come back ,  - -  transfigured ! " she went on , her eyes deepening with awe . What did it mean ? Somewhat disturbed , Balder got also on his feet . As he did so , Gnulemah crouched before him , holding out her hands like a suppliant . An on-looker might have fancied that the would-be God had found his worshipper at last ! " My name is Balder , " his Deityship managed to say . As he spoke , the sun rounded the corner of the house , and the light fell brightly on him , Gnulemah kneeling in shadow . The glory of his splendid youth seemed to have shone out from within him in sudden effulgence . " Balder ! " she slowly repeated , still gazing up at him . " There is a relationship between us , " said he , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy , " You are the daughter of fire , and I the descendant of the sun ! " He spoke the unpremeditated notion which the sunburst had created in his brain ,  - -  spoke not seriously nor yet lightly . He had as much right to his genealogy as she to hers . But what a strange effect his words wrought on her ! She clasped her hands together quickly in a kind of ecstasy . " The sun ,  - -  Balder ! I have prayed to him ,  - -  he as come to me ,  - -  Balder , my God ! " With how divine an accent did her full low voice give him the name to which he had dared aspire ! He was God -- and her God ! He perhaps divined one part of the process through which her mind must have gone ; but he could not find a word to answer , whether of acceptance or disclaimer . He turned pale , his heart sick . Had the recognition of his Godhood been too tardy ? Gnulemah fancied he repulsed her , and her passion kindled ,  - -  only religious passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold to me , Balder ! " his name as she uttered it moved him as a blasphemy . " In my lonely kneelings I have felt you ! my eyes close , my hands grow together , my breath flutters , every breath is joy and fear ! I think ' He is with me ,  - -  the Being I adore ! ' but when I opened my eyes , He was gone ,  - -  Balder ! " Still motionless and seeming-deaf stood the Divinity , bathed in mocking sunlight . He was powerless to stop her from unveiling to him , as to a visible God the sacred places of her maiden heart . That sublime office whose reversion he had boldly courted , in the possession shrivelled his soul to nothing and left him dead . It was not easy to be God ,  - -  even over one human being ! But Gnulemah , in her mighty earnestness , knelt nearer , so that the edge of Balder 's sunlight smote the golden ornaments that clung round her outstretched arms . She almost touched him , but though his spirit recoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not to be always so , " she continued , an appealing vehemence quivering through her tones . " Some day I was to see Him and know Him more clearly . Shine on me , Balder ! am not I your priestess ? in the morning do not I worship you , and at noon , and in the evening ? At night do not I kneel at your altar and pray you to care for me while I sleep ? Hear me , Balder ! I see you in all things ,  - -  they are your thoughts and meet again in you ! The sun himself is but your shadow ! Do not I know you , my Balder ? Be not clouded from your servant ! Leave me not ,  - -  take me with you where you go ! " It was at this moment that the young man 's mind , stumbling stupidly hither and thither , chanced to encounter that picture of the courtesan , leaning from the open window in the city street , beckoning him to come . She took Gnulemah 's place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gestures . Could a devil take the consecrated place of angels ? or was the angel a worse devil in disguise ? In the same day , to him the same man , could two such voices speak , such faces look ? And could the germ of Godhead abide in a soul liable to the irony of such vicarious solicitation ? Speech or motion was still denied him . His priestess , strengthened by religious passion , was bold to touch with hers his divine hand , on the finger of which demoniacally glittered the murder-token . The hand was so cold and lax that even the smooth warmth of her soft fingers failed to put life in it . " You have taken Hiero to yourself ,  - -  take me also ! be my God as well as his , for I shall be alone now he is gone . This ring which he always wore --  " Balder roughly snatched back his hand . " Hiero 's ring ? " " Why do you look so ?  - -  is it not a sign to me from him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Hiero 's ring ?  - -  Stop - -  stand up ! No -- call me Satan !  - -  Hiero 's ring ! " " Where is Hiero , then ? " demanded Gnulemah , rising and dilating . " You wear his ring ,  - -  what have you done with him ?  - -  Is there no God ? " The words came riding on the waves of deep-drawn breaths , for her soul was in a tumult . Her life had thus far been like a quiet sequestered pool , reflecting only the sky , and the ferns and flowers that bent above its margin ; ignorant , moreover , of its own depth and nature . Now , invaded by storm , God and nature seemed swept away and lost , and a terror of loneliness darkened over it . " Is there no Balder ? " reiterated Gnulemah . But all at once the fierceness in her eyes melted , as lightning is followed by summer rain . She came so near ,  - -  he standing dulled with horror of his discovery , came so near that her breath touched him , and he could hear the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft tinkle of the broad pendants that glowed against her black hair ; and could see how profoundly real her beauty was . Mighty and beneficent must be the force or the law which could combine the rude elements into such a form of life as this ! " Let me live for you and serve you ! Though the world has no Balder , may not I have mine ? You shall be everything to me ! Without you I can not be ; but I want no other God if I have my Balder ! " This was another matter ! Nevertheless ,  - -  so subtle is the boundary between love human and divine ,  - -  Gnulemah in these first passionate moments may easily have deemed the one no less sublime than the other . But there was no danger of Balder 's falling into such an error . The distinction was clear to him . Yet with remorse and abasement strove the defiant impulse to pluck and eat -- forgetful of this world and the next the royal fruit so fairly held to his lips ! For herein fails the divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's depravity as to his exaltation ; which could not happen were she one with God . Nay , man had need be strong with Divine inspiration , before communing unharmed with nature 's dangerous loveliness . His hand in Gnulemah 's was now neither cold nor lax . She raised it in impetuous homage to her forehead . The diamond left a mark there ; first white , then red . For a breath or two , their eyes saw depths in each other beyond words ' fathoming .... A door was closed above ; and the echo stole down stairs and crept with a hollow whisper into the conservatory . The little lord chamberlain fluttered down from his lofty perch and hovered between the two faces , his penetrating note sounding like a warning , Gnulemah drew back , and a swift blush let fall its rosy veil from the golden gleam of her jewelled forehead-band to below the head of the serpent which twisted round her neck . One parting look she gave Balder , pregnant of new wonder , fear , and joy . Then she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had first appeared , and was eclipsed by the curtain . The inner door shut ; she was gone . Dull , dull and colorless was the conservatory . The hoopoe had flown out through the hall to the open air . Only the crocodile continued to keep Balder company . After standing a few moments , he once more threw himself down on the moss couch beneath the palm-trees . There he reclined as before , supported on his elbow , and turned the diamond ring this way and that on his finger in moody preoccupation . Was the crocodile asleep , or stealthily watching him ? XIX . BEFORE SUNDOWN . If Balder Helwyse had been in a vein for self-criticism at this juncture , the review might probably have dissatisfied him . He possessed qualities which make men great . He could have discharged august offices , for he saw things in large relations and yet minutely . His mind and courage could rise to any enterprise , and carry it with ease and cheerfully . His nature was even more receptive than active . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the old story of the star-gazer walking into the well , who might have studied the stars in the well , but could not be warned of the well by the stars . He had whistled grand chances down the wind , reaching after what was superhuman . His hunger had been vast , but the food wherewith he had filled himself nourished him not , and suddenly he had collapsed . His first actual step towards realizing his lofty aspirations had landed him low amongst earth 's common criminals ,  - -  nor had the harm stopped there . That defiant impulse to which he had just now been on the point of yielding had not dared so much as to have shown its face before his unvitiated will . He was disorganized and at the mercy of events , because without law sufficient to keep and guide himself . Though fallen , there was in him somewhat giant-like , perhaps easier to see now than before , as the ruin seems vaster than the perfect building . The travail of a soul like Balder 's must issue greatly , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inchoate , but the elements would combine to make something either darker or fairer than had been before . Meanwhile , in the uncrystallized solution the curious analyst might detect traits bright or sinister , ordinarily invisible . Here were softness , impetuosity , romantic imagination , and tender fire , enough to set up half a dozen poets . Again , there was a fund of malignity , coldness , and subtlety adequate to the making an Iago . Here , too , were the clear sceptical intellect , the fertility and versatile power of brain , which only the loftier minds of the world have shown . Such seemingly incongruous qualities are , in the human crucible , so mingled , proportioned , and refined , as to form a seeming simple and transparent whole . We may feel the presence of a spirit weighty , strong , deep , without understanding the how and why of impression . Only at critical moments , such as this in Balder 's life , can we point out the joining lines . Balder 's present attitude , viewed from whatever side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with diabolic ingenuity dovetailed into another . It was bad enough to have killed a man ; but the victim was his own uncle , and the father -- at least the foster-father -- of Gnulemah . And she , forsooth , must idolize the murderer ; and , finally , his heart must leap forth in passionate response to hers at the moment -- partly perhaps for the reason -- that every honest motive forbade it . That look and touch , at the molten point of various emotions , had welded their spirits together at once and lastingly . What next ? For Gnulemah and for himself what course was least disastrous ?  - -  the heroic line , to leave her without a word ? or , concealing what he was , should he stay and be happy in her arms ? Was there a third alternative ? " To part would be yet worse for her than for me . She would think I had deceived her . And , love apart , how can I leave her whose only protector I have killed ? That deed puts me in his place ; so love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  her God , she calls me . She is my universe ; the depth and limit of my knowledge and power are gauged by her . Such is the issue of my aspirations ! " He breathed out a half-laugh , ending in a sigh . " But loving her is sweeter than to inform creation ! " he added , aloud . The crocodile made no reply . Balder went on , fingering the telltale ring and talking with himself ; the earth , meanwhile , slowly turning her warm shoulder to the western sun . A still half-light filled the conservatory as with a clear mellow liquor , and the rich leaves , and blossoms stood breathless with delight . The painfully rigid contraction of Balder 's features was softening away ; he was coming into harmony with the sensuous beauty of the scene , or its refined voluptuousness -- serene , unambitious , content with time and careless of eternity -- interpreted his altered temper . Be happy in the sunlight , O men and women ! Love and kiss ,  - -  bow down and worship each the other ! Who can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for only the flavor of death can give it perfection ! Save for the foreshadow of midnight , noonday were not beautiful . But when night comes , sink ye in one another 's arms , and sleep ! Heaven on earth is a richer , stronger draught than Heaven ; but pray that in vouchsafing death , it cheat ye not of annihilation ! He had forgotten that there was anything ugly in the world , or that the blindest can not always escape the Gorgon . He recked not the risk of bringing a being such as Gnulemah face to face with modern life , nor bethought him that the secret in his heart would still be nearer it than love could come . Neither , during this fortunate moment , did fear of discovery harass him . Oddly , too , it was not to domestic comforts ,  - -  the love of wife , children , and friends ,  - -  nor yet to the absorbing duties of a profession , that Balder looked for a shield against inward trouble . Hope held him no more than fear ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of the Gnulemah of to-day ,  - -  unique , beautiful , untamed , divinely ignorant ; but whose heart walked before , leading the giddy mind by paths the wisest dared not tempt . The sounds of her voice , the shiftings of her expression , her look , her touch ,  - -  he recalled them all . He centred time and space in her . Change , new conditions , succession of events , these came not near her . Their life should know neither past nor future , but abide a constant Now ,  - -  until the end ! His lips followed his thought with soundless movement . Handsome lips they were ,  - -  the under , full , but sharply defined from the bulwark-chin ; the upper , slender , boldly curved , firm , yet sensitive ;  - -  the mouth was a compendium of the man 's physical nature . His eyes , large and almost as dark as Gnulemah 's , albeit far different in effect ,  - -  were now in-looking ; the pupils , always extraordinarily large and brilliant , almost filled the space between the eyelids . His hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense eyebrows arched at ease . With velvet doublet and well-moulded limbs , in the enchanted evening-glow , he looked the ideal fairy prince ,  - -  noble , wise , and valiant ; conquering fate for love 's sake . They were brave princes ,  - -  they of old time . But one wonders whether the giants and enchanters , nowadays , are not stronger and subtler than they used to be ! XX . BETWEEN WAKING AND SLEEPING . There was an old woman in the house who went by the name of Nurse ; her duties being to cook the meals and preserve a sort of order in such of the rooms as were occupied by the family . Since the greater part of the house was uninhabited , and there were only two mouths to feed beside her own , Nurse was not without leisure moments . How were they employed ? Not in gossiping , for she had no cronies . Not in millinery and dressmaking , for there were no admiring eyes to reward such labors . Not in gadding , for she might not pass the imprisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much of a proficient in that art . The truth is that -- to the outward eye at least -- she was uniformly idle . For years past she had spent many hours of each night in the corner of the kitchen fireplace , which was as large , roomy , and smoke-seasoned as any in story-books or mediaeval halls . Here sat she , winter and summer , her body bent forward over her knees , her disfigured face supported on one hand , while the other lay across her breast . This was her common position , and she seldom moved to change it . She hummed tunes to herself sometimes , not hymn tunes ,  - -  but never was heard to utter an articulate word . Often you might have thought her asleep ,  - -  but no ! when you least expected it a shining black eye was fixed oh you ; an eye which , two hundred years ago , would have convicted its owner of witchcraft . It was the only bright thing about the poor woman . Whenever the master of the house came to the kitchen , Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no expression , seemed to escape it . A curious observer might sometimes have remarked in her , during the few moments after the man 's entrance , a muffled agitation , an irregularity of the breath , an obscure anxiety and suspense . This , however , would soon subside , and rarely recur during his stay . The phenomenon had been observable daily for nearly a score of years , yet nothing had meantime happened to explain or justify it . Had an original dread -- groundless or not -- prolonged its phantom existence precisely because it had never met with justification ? Often for weeks at a time , complete silence would obtain between master and Nurse . He would enter and ramble hither and thither the ample kitchen ; eat what had been prepared for him , and be off again without a word or glance of acknowledgment . Or , again , pacing irregularly to and fro before the fireplace , he would pour forth long disjointed rhapsodies , wild speculations , hopes , and misgivings ; his mood changing from solemn to gay , and round through gusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words to Nurse so much as to himself or to some imaginary interlocutor ; and she for her part never answered him a syllable , but sat in silence through it all . Yet was she ever alert to listen , and sometimes the subdued trembling would come on and the obstruction of breath . But when the talker , in mid-excitement of speech , snatched his violin and drew from it melodies weirdly exquisite , soothing his diseased thoughts and harmonizing them , Nurse would become once more composed ; the phantom danger was again put off , and the violinist would presently fall into silence ,  - -  sometimes into sleep . But still , while he slept , the witch-eye watched him ; though with an expression of yearning , uncouth intensity which seldom ventured forth while he was awake . With Gnulemah , Nurse 's intercourse became yearly more and more infrequent . As the child arose to womanhood , she grew apart from the voiceless creature who had cared for her infancy . It was not Gnulemah 's fault , whose heart was never barren of loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning she had never been taught ; and had Nurse comprehended the unconscious thirst and hunger of the girl 's soul ,  - -  unconscious , but not therefore harmless , she might have tried , by dint of affectionate observances and companionship , to represent the motherly office which she had filled in the beginning . But this was not to be . Some hidden agency had forced the two ever farther asunder . Moreover , Gnulemah developed rapidly , while Nurse underwent a process of gradual congealment ,  - -  her wits and emotions became torpid . Besides this , she was the victim of disfigurement , physical as well as spiritual ; while Gnulemah , both naturally and by training , was sensitive to beauty and ugliness . Other surface causes no doubt there were , in addition to the hidden one , which was perhaps the most potent of all . A considerable time had passed since Gnulemah 's departure , when Balder became aware that he was not alone in the conservatory . His thoughts were all of Gnulemah , and he looked quickly round in expectation of seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . A female figure stood before him , wrapped in sad-colored garments of anomalous description , her head tied up in dark turban-like folds of cloth . A lock of rusty black hair escaped from beneath this head-dress and hung down beside her face . She might once have been tall and erect , but her form now sagged to the left , losing both height and dignity . Her visage , seamed and furrowed by the scar of some terrible calamity , had lost its natural contour . The left eye was extinguished , but the right remained ,  - -  the only feature in its original state . It was dark and bright , and possessed , by very virtue of its disfigured environment , a repulsive kind of beauty . Its influence was peculiar . In itself , it postulated an owner in the prime of life , handsome and graceful . But , one 's attention wandering , the woman 's actual ugliness impressed itself with an intensity enhanced by the imaginary contrast . A grotesque analogy was thus brought to light . The woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inert , and soulless -- was dragged about a dead weight . It was an unnatural emphasizing of the spiritual-material composition of mankind . Observable , moreover , was her strange method of disguising emotion . There was no muscular constraint ; she simply turned her blank left side to the spectator , with an effect like the interposition of a dead wall ! Such , on Balder 's perhaps abnormally excited apprehension , was the impression the nurse produced . She , on her part , was perhaps more disconcerted than he . Her single eye settled upon him in a panic of surprise . The dressing of the scene gave Balder a grisly reminder of the first moments of Gnulemah 's eloquent astonishment . There was as great an apparent difference between the superb Egyptian and this poor creature , as between good and evil ; but there was also the disagreeable suggestion of a similar kind of relationship . Gnulemah , withered , stifled , and degraded by some unmentionable curse , might have become a thing not unlike this woman . " Have we met before , madam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took for a bewildered recognition in her eye . She moved her lips , but made no audible answer . " I am Balder Helwyse , " he added ; for he had made up his mind that all concealments ( save one ) were unnecessary . A grotesque quake of emotion travelled through the woman 's body , and she gave utterance to a harsh inarticulate sound . She came confusedly forwards , groping with hands outstretched . Balder , though not wont to fail in courtesy to the sorriest hag , could scarce forbear recoiling ; especially because he fancied that an expression of affectionate interest was struggling to get through the scarred incrustation of the woman 's nature . Perhaps she marked his inward shrinking , for she checked herself , and , slowly turning her lifeless screen , hid behind it . It was impotent deprecation translated into flesh ,  - -  at once ludicrous and painful . The young man found so much difficulty in restraining the manifestation of his distaste , that he blushed in the twilight at his own rudeness . He would do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uncle , " said he , moving to get on Nurse 's right side , and speaking in his pleasantest tone . " Is he at home ? I have come a long way to see him . " Preoccupied by his amiable purpose to reassure the woman , Helwyse had got to the end of this speech before realizing the ghastly mockery involved in it . Nevertheless , it was well . Even thus falsely and boldly must he henceforth speak and act . By a happy accident he had opened the path , and must see to it that his further steps did not retrograde . Still Nurse answered not a word , which was the less surprising , inasmuch as she had been dumb for a quarter of a century past . But Balder , supposing her silence to proceed from stupidity or deafness , repeated more loudly and peremptorily ,  --  " Doctor Glyphic ,  - -  is he here ? is he alive ? " He felt a morbid curiosity to hear what reply would be made to the question whose answer only he could know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw Nurse into a state of agitation as great as though she had herself been the perpetrator of Balder 's crime ! She stood quaking and irresolute , now peeping for a moment from behind her screen , then dodging back with an increase of panic . This display -- rendered more uncouth by its voicelessness -- revolted the aesthetic sensibilities of Helwyse . Besides , what was the meaning of it ? Had it actually been Davy Jones with whom he had striven on the midnight sea ? and had his adversary , instead of drowning , spread his bat-wings for home , and left his supposititious murderer to disquiet himself in vain ? Verily , a practical joke worthy its author ! This conceit revealed others , as a lightning-flash the midnight landscape . Balder was encircled by witchcraft , had been ferried by a real Charon to no imaginary Hades . The quaint secluded beauty of circumstance was an illusion , soon to be dispelled . Gnulemah herself -- miserable thought !  - -  was perhaps a thing of evil ; what if this very hag were she in another form ? Glancing round in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tropic shrubs assumed demoniac forms , bending and crowding about him . The old witch yonder was muttering some infernal spell ; already he felt numbness in his limbs , dizziness in his brain . The devils are gathering nearer . A heavy , heated atmosphere quivers before his eyes , or else the witch and her unholy crew are uniting in a reeling dance . In vain does Balder try to shut his eyes and escape the giddy spectacle ; they stare widely open and see things supernatural . Nor can he ward off these with his hands , which are rigid before him , and defy his will . The devilish jig becomes wilder , and careers through the air , Balder sweeping with it . In mid-whirl , he sees the crocodile ,  - -  cold , motionless , waiting with long , dry jaws -- for what ? A cry breaks from him . With a wrench that strains his heart he bursts loose from the devil 's bonds that confine his limbs . The witch has vanished , and Helwyse seems to himself to fall headlong from a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gnulemah ! " Gasping out that name , he becomes insensible . Beneath an outside of respectable composure have turmoiled the tides of such remorse and pain as only a man at once largely and finely made can feel . Added to the mental excitement carried through many phases to the point of distraction , have been bodily exertion and want of food and sleep . The apparition of unnatural ugliness , of behavior strange as her looks , coming upon him in this untoward condition , needed not the heat of the conservatory and stupefying perfume of the flowers to bring on the brief delirium and final unconsciousness . As he lies there let us remember that his last word threw back the unworthy , dark misgiving , that beauty and deformity , good and bad , could by any jugglery become convertible . As a mere matter of fact , Nurse was no witch , nor had she , of her own will and knowledge , done Balder any harm . On the contrary , she was already at work , with trembling hands and painfully thumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched and agitated to a singular degree . It was not the first time in the patient 's life that she had tended him . The reader has guessed her secret ,  - -  that she had known Balder before he knew himself , and cared for him when his only cares had been to eat and sleep . She knew her baby through his manly stature and mature features , less from his likeness to his father than from certain uneffaced traces of infantine form and expression . She was of gypsy blood , and had looked on few human faces since last seeing his . He did not recognize her until some time afterwards . All things considered , it was hardly possible he should do so . It was curious to observe how awkwardly she now managed emotions that had once flowed but too readily . She was moved by impulses which she had long forgotten how to interpret . Her only outlet for tenderness was her solitary eye , which might well have given way under the strain thus put upon it . But by and by the inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hardening for so many years . Glimpses there were of the handy , affectionate , sympathizing woman , emerging from fossilization . Her withered heart once more hungered and thirsted , and the strange duality tended to melt back again into unity . Balder 's attack at length yielded , and a drowsy consciousness returned , memory and reason being still partly in abeyance . His heavy , half-closed eyes rested on darkness . A crooning sound was in his ear ,  - -  a nursery lullaby , wordless but soothing . Where was he ? Had he been ill ? Was he in his cradle at home ? Was Salome sitting by to watch him and give him his medicine ? Yes , very ill he was , but would be better in the morning ; and meanwhile he would be a good boy , and not cry and make a fuss and trouble Salome . " Nurse ,  - -  Sal !  - -  I say , Sal ! " Salome bent over him as of old . " Had such a funny dream , Sal ! dreamt I was grown up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal ? it was n't true , you know ! And I 'm going to be a good boy and go to sleep . Good night ! give a kiss from me -- to -- my -- little --  " So sinks he into slumber , profound as ever wooed his childhood ; his head pillowed in Salome 's lap , his funny dream forgotten . XXI . WE PICK UP ANOTHER THREAD . Darkness and silence reigned in the conservatory ; the group of the sleeping man and attendant woman was lost in the warm gloom , and scarcely a motion -- the low drawing of a breath -- told of their presence . A great gray owl , which had passed the daylight in some obscure corner , launched darkling forth on the air and winged hither and thither ,  - -  once or twice fanning the sleeper 's face with silent pinions . The crocodile lazily edged off the stone , plumped quietly into the water , and clambered up the hither margin of the pool , there coming to another long pause . A snail , making a night-journey across the floor , found in its path a diamond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended a cool cautious tentacle ,  - -  recoiled it fastidiously and shaped a new course . A broad petal from a tall flowering-shrub dropped wavering down , and seemed about to light on Balder 's forehead ; but , swerving at the last moment , came to rest on the scaly head of the crocodile . The night waited and listened , as though for something to happen ,  - -  for some one to appear ! Salome , too , was waiting for some one ;  - -  was it for the dead ? Meantime , pictures from the past glimmered through her memory . When , in our magic mirror , we saw her struck down by the hand of her lover , she was far from being the repulsive object she is now . Indeed , but for that chance word let fall yesterday , about her having been badly burnt , we might be at a loss to justify our recognition of her . After Manetho 's rude dismissal of her , she fled -- not knowing whither better -- to Thor Helwyse , who was living widowed in his Brooklyn house , with his infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant , she besought Helen 's husband to give her a home . She was in sore trouble , but said no more than this ; and Thor , suspecting nothing of her connection with Manetho , gladly received her as nurse to his children . But past sins and imprudences would find out Salome no less than others . At the critical moment for herself and her fortunes , the house took fire . She risked her life to save Thor 's daughter , was herself burned past recognition , and ( one misfortune treading on another 's heels ) balanced on death 's verge for a month or two . She got well , in part ; but the faculty of speech had left her , and beauty of face and figure was forever gone . In her manifold wretchedness , and after such devotion shown , it was not in Thor 's warm heart to part with her ; so , losing much , she gained something . She remained with her benefactor , whose manly courtesy ever forbore to probe the secret of her woman 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veil . The world saw Salome no more . She sat in the nursery , watching year by year the dark-eyed little maiden playing with the fair-haired boy . Broad-shouldered Thor would come in , with his grand , kindly face and royal beard ; would kiss the little girl and tussle with the boy , mightily laughing the while at the former 's solicitude for her playmate ; would throw himself on the groaning sofa , and exclaim in his deep voice ,  --  " God bless their dear little souls ! Why , Nurse ! when did a brother and sister ever love each other like that ,  - -  eh ? " Salome probably was not unhappy then ; indeed ,  - -  whether she knew it or not , she was at her happiest . But new events were at hand ; Thor , growing yearly more restless , at length resolved to sell his house and go to Europe , taking with him Salome and both the children . Everything was ready , down to the packing of Salome 's box . A day or two before the sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his eccentric brother-in-law . It was a warm summer day , and the children played from morning till night in the front yard , while Nurse sat in the window and kept her eye on them . Her thoughts , perhaps , travelled elsewhere . Since her misfortune she had , no doubt , had more opportunity than most women for reflection : silence breeds thought . What she thought about , no one knew ; but she could hardly have forgotten Manetho . On this last evening , when at the point of leaving America forever , it would have been strange had no memory of him passed through her mind . She had not heard his name in the last four years , and she knew that he suspected nothing of her whereabouts . Had he ever wished to see her ? she wondered and thought , " He would not know me if he did see me ! " With that came a tumultuous longing once more to look upon him . Too late ! Why had she not thought of this before ? Now must her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sudden rage , he turned upon her and struck her on the bosom . There was the scar yet ; the fire had spared it ! It was a keepsake which , as time passed , Salome strangely learned to love ! It was growing dusk ,  - -  time for the children to come in . They were sitting deep in the abundant grass , weaving necklaces out of dandelion-stems . Nurse leaned out of window and beckoned to attract their attention . But either they were too much absorbed to notice her , or they were wilfully blind ; so Nurse rose to go out and fetch them . Before reaching the open front door , she stopped short and her heart seemed to turn over . A tall dark man was leaning over the fence , talking with the little girl . Nurse shrank within the shadow of the door , and thence peeped and listened ,  - -  as well as her beating pulses would let her . " I know where fairy-land is , " says the man , in the soft , engaging tone that the listener so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visit it ? " " He come too ? " asks the little maiden , nodding towards the boy , who is portentously busy over his dandelions . " He may if he likes , " the man answers with a smile . " But we must make haste , or fairy-land will be shut up ! " It flashes into Salome 's head what this portends . She had heard this man vow revenge on Thor long ago , and she now sees how he means to keep his oath . He has shrewdly improved the opportunity of Thor 's absence , and has come intending to carry off either his son or his daughter . Fortune , it seems , had chosen for him the dark-eyed little girl . See ! he stoops and lifts her gently over the wall , and they are off for fairy-land ! Rush out , Salome ! alarm the neighborhood and force the kidnapper to give up his booty ! After Thor 's kindness to you , will you be false to him ? Besides , what motive have you for unfaithfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save to his revengeful passion , could result from thwarting him ? Salome acted oddly on this occasion , it would seem , irrationally . But that which appears to the spectator but a trivial modification may have vital weight with the actor . Had Manetho taken Balder , for example , Salome might have pursued another and more intelligible course than the one she actually took . She hurried out of the door and caught Manetho by the arm before he was twenty paces on his way . He turned , savage but frightened , setting down the little girl but not letting go her hand . She was in her happiest humor , and informed Nurse that she was to be queen of fairy-land ! Nurse lifted the veil from her face and looked steadfastly at Manetho with her one eye . It was enough ,  - -  he saw in her but a hideous object ,  - -  would never know her for the bright girl he had once professed to love . Salome gave one sob , containing more of womanly emotion than could be written down in many words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to escape , but stood on his guard ; half prepared , however ,  - -  from something in the woman 's manner , to find her a confederate . " S'e come too ? " chirped the unconscious little maiden . But Manetho 's attention was turned to some words that Salome was writing in a little blank-book which she always carried in her pocket She offered to help him carry off the child , on condition of being herself one of the party ! He looked narrowly at the woman , but could make nothing by his scrutiny . Was it love for the child that prompted her behavior ? No ; for she could easily have raised the neighborhood against him . She completely puzzled him , and she would give no explanations . What if he should accept her offer ? She would be an advantage as well as an inconvenience . The child would have the care to which it had been accustomed , and Manetho would thus be spared much embarrassment . When the woman 's help became superfluous , it would not be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection . An agreement was made ,  - -  on Salome 's part , with a secret sense of intense triumph , not unmixed with fear and pain . She caught up Master Balder and his dandelions , kissed and hugged him violently , and locked him into the nursery ; where he was found some hours afterwards by his father , in a state of great hunger and indignation . But the little dark-haired maiden was no more . She was gone to her kingdom of fairy-land , and Nurse with her . Long mourned Balder for his vanished playmate ! Salome has kept her secret well . And now , there she sits , her long-lost baby 's head in her lap , thinking of old times ; and the longer she thinks , the more she softens and expands . Has she done a great wrong in her life ? Surely she has suffered greatly , and in a manner that might well wither her to the core . But there must still have been a germ of life in the shrivelled seed , which this night -- memorable in her existence -- has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , with a struggle at first , then more easily . Kind darkness lets us think of Salome bright and comely as in the old days , with the added grace of inward beauty wrought by sad experience . But , in truth , she is marred past earthly recovery . Nothing removes a soul so far from human sympathy as self-repression ,  - -  especially for any merely human end ! The night creeps reluctantly westward ; the gray owl wings back to his shady corner ; the adventurous snail , half-way up the palm-tree , glues himself to the bark and turns in for a nap . The crocodile has resumed his old position on the rock in the pool , and the flower petal floats on the water . Here comes the brilliant hoopoe with his smart crest and clear chirrup , impatient to bid Gnulemah good morning ! All is as before , save that the group beneath the palm-trees has disappeared ! Balder slept late , yet , on awakening , he thought he must be dreaming still . He could not distinguish imagination from reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its authority . Where was he ? Was it years or hours since he had entered Boston harbor ? Suddenly rose before him the vision of the deadly struggle on the midnight sea . Round this central point the rest crystallized in order . His heart sank , and he sighed most heavily . But presently he rose to his elbow and stared about in bewilderment . Had he ever seen this room before ? How came he here ? He was lying on a carved bedstead , furnished with sheets of fine linen and a counterpane of blue embroidered satin ; but all bearing an appearance of great age . The room was oval , like a bird's-egg halved lengthwise ; the smoothly vaulted ceiling being frescoed with a crowd of figures . The rich and costly furniture harmonized with the bedstead , and bore the same marks of age . The chairs and lounge were satin-covered ; the sumptuous toilet-table was fitted with a mirror of true crystal ; the arched window was curtained with azure satin and lace . It was a chamber fit for a princess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode in it . Balder now examined the frescos which covered wall and ceiling . The subject seemed at the first glance to be a Last Judgment , or something of that nature . A mingled rush of forms mounted on one side to the bright zenith , and thence lapsed confusedly down the opposite descent . The dark end of the room presented a cloud of gloomily fantastic shapes , swerved from the main stream , and becoming darker and more formless the farther they receded , till at the last they were lost in a murky shadow . Not entirely lost , however ; for as Balder gazed awfully thitherward , the shadow seemed to resolve itself into a mass of intertwined and struggling beings , neither animal nor human , but combining the more unholy traits of both . But from the centre of the upward stream shone forms and faces of angelic beauty ; yet , on looking more narrowly , Balder discerned in each one some ghastly peculiarity , revealing itself just when enjoyment of the beauty was on the point of becoming complete . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mocking demons , and where the light seemed brightest there was the spiritual darkness most profound . In the zenith was a white lustre which obliterated distinction of form as much as did the cloudy obscurity at the end of the room . Now the design seemed about to unfold itself ; then again it eluded the gazer 's grasp . Suddenly at length it stood revealed . A gigantic face , with wide-floating hair and beard , looked down into Balder 's own . Its expression was of infinite malignity and despair . The impersonation of all that is wicked and miserable , its place was at the top of Heaven ; it was moulded of those aspiring forms of light , and was the goal which the brightest attained . Moreover , either by some ugly coincidence or how otherwise he could not conceive , this countenance of supreme evil was the very reflex of Balder 's ,  - -  a portrait minutely true , and , despite its satanic expression , growing every moment more unmistakable . Was this accident , or the contrivance of an unknown and unfathomable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of Hell ! A grim satire on his religious speculations ! But what satirist had been bitter enough so to forestall the years ? for the painting must have been designed while Balder was still an infant . He threw himself off the bed and stepped to the window , and saw the blue sky and the river rhyming it . The breath of the orchard visited him , and he was greeted by the green grass and trees , He sighed with relief . There had been three mornings since his return to America . For the first he had blessed his own senses ; the second had looked him out of countenance but the third came with a benediction , serene and mighty , such as Balder 's soul had not hitherto been open to . " This is more than a plaster heaven , " said he , looking up ; " but I fear , Balder Helwyse , your only heaven , thus far , has been of plaster . You have seen this morning how the God of such a heaven looks . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Presently he turned away from the window ; but he had quaffed so deeply of the morning glory , that the sinister frescos no longer depressed him . They were ridiculously unimportant ,  - -  nothing more than stains on the wall , in fact . Balder could not tell why he felt light-hearted . It was solemn light-heartedness , not the gayety of sensuous spirits , such as he had experienced heretofore . It had little to do with physical well-being , for the young man was still faint and dizzy , and weak from hunger . Behold , then , at the foot of the bed , a carved table covered with a damask cloth and crowned with an abundant breakfast ; not an ordinary breakfast of coffee , rolls , omelette , and beefsteak , but a pastoral breakfast ,  - -  fresh milk , bread and honey and fruit and mellow cheese , such food as Adam might have begun the day with . In face of the yet unsolved mystery of his own presence in the room , this new surprise caused Balder no special wonder . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the previous evening 's experience . Could she have transported him hither ? Well , he would not let himself be disturbed by apparent miracles . " No doubt the explanation is simple , " thought he ; and with that he began his toilet . The dressing-table displayed a variety of dainty articles such as a lady might be supposed to use ,  - -  pearl- handled brushes , enamelled powder-boxes , slender vases of Meissen porcelain , a fanciful ring-stand ; from the half-open drawer a rich glimpse of an Indian fan ; a pair of delicate kid gloves , which only a woman 's hands could have worn , were thrown carelessly on the table . There were still the little wrinkles in the fingers , but time had changed the pristine white to dingy yellow . " Whose hands could have worn them ? whose chamber was this ? " mused Balder . " Not Gnulemah 's ; she knows nothing of kid gloves and powder ! and these things were in use before she was born . Whose face was reflected in this glass , when those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Were children born in it ? " His seizure of the night before must have dulled the edge of his wit , else he had scarce asked questions which chance now answered for him . A scratch on one corner of the polished mirror-surface showed , on closer inspection , a name and a date written with a diamond . Shading off the light with his hand , Balder read , " Helen , 1831 . " " My mother 's name ; the year I was born . My mother ! " he repeated softly , taking up the old yellow gloves . " And this room was my birthplace ,  - -  and my little sister 's ! My mother 's things , as she left them ; for father once told me that he never entered her room after she was buried . She died here ; and here my little sister and I began to live . And here I am , again ,  - -  really the same little helpless innocent baby who cried on that bed so long ago . Only not innocent now ! Perhaps , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ! prattled about being born again . Can not I be born again ,  - -  to- day ,  - -  in this room ? Here I first began , and have come round the world to my starting-point . I will begin afresh this morning . " And heavily as he was weighted in the new race , he would not be disheartened . Unuttered resolves brightened his eyes and made his courage high . Before beginning breakfast , he returned to the window and drank again of the divine blue and green . From the branch of a near tree the hoopoe startled him and made him color . Was the bird an emissary from Gnulemah ? Balder 's mouth drew back , and his chin and eyes strengthened , as though some part of his unuttered resolves were recalled by the thought of her . When he was ready to go , he turned at the door , and threw a parting glance round the dainty old-fashioned chamber , trying to gather into one all the thoughts , memories , and resolves connected with it . He had nearly forgotten the frescos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beautiful , to a meaningless agglomeration of wandering lines and faded colors . As for his own portrait , it was no longer distinguishable . XXII . HEART AND HEAD . Balder easily found his way to the conservatory , but it was empty ,  - -  Gnulemah , at least , was not there ! The tapestry curtain in her doorway was pushed aside , the door itself open . Where should he seek her ? As he stood in doubt , he saw lying at his feet a violet . Picking it up , he saw another some distance beyond it , and still another on the threshold which he had just crossed . They were Gnulemah 's footsteps ,  - -  the scent of this sweet quarry , teaching him how to follow her . So he followed , nor let one fragrant trace escape him ; and presently he had a nosegay of them . She was out of doors , then . Truly , on such a day as this , where else should she be ? What walls could presume to hold her ? Her loveliness was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the solitary nymph , her mighty playmate had been all-sufficient ; for she saw not the earth and sky as they appear nowadays to mankind , but the divine meaning which they clothe . Thus she could converse with animals , and could read plants and stones more profoundly than botanist or geologist . She followed inward to her own fresh and beautiful soul the sympathies which allied her to outward things , and found there their true prototypes . But when the strong magnetism of a new human spirit began to act upon her , these fine communings with nature suffered disturbance . In such thunderstorms as the meeting of the electric forces must engender , there was need of a trustworthier safeguard than simple perception of a divine purpose underlying creation . Only the personal God is strong enough to govern the relations of soul with soul . Barren of Eve , Adam would not have fallen ; but with her he will one day not only retrieve his fall , but climb to a sublimer height than any to which he could have aspired alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an avenue of great trees , overshadowing the narrow footpath that stole beneath them . To the right , round the northern corner of the house , he could see far off the white tops of the blossoming apple-trees ; and beyond , the river . The orchard perfume came riding on the untamed breeze , and whispered a fragrant secret in the young man 's ear . Orchardward he pursued his search . As he went on , Gnulemah grew every moment nearer . At length he caught the flutter of her mantle amidst the foliage , and presently saw her on the brink of the precipice , looking out across the broad blue river . Thus had he , through his glass , darkly , seen her stand the day before . Were the crossing a river and the flight of a day all that divided his past life from what he thought awaited him now ! While yet at a distance , he called to her , not from impatience , but because he stood in awe of the meeting , and wanted the first moments over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her towards him . Her face , which had not learned to be the mask of emotion , but was instead the full and immediate index thereof , brightened with joy ; and as he came near , the joy increased . Yet a seriousness deep down in her eyes , marked the shadow of a night and the dawn of another day . A spiritual chemistry had been working in her . She did not move forward to meet him but stood delighting in the sense of his ever-growing nearness . When at length he stood close before her , she drew a long , pleasant breath and said ,  --  " A beautiful morning ! " This was no commonplace greeting , for it was not made in a commonplace manner . It said that his coming had consummated the else imperfect beauty of nature , and won its expression from Gnulemah 's lips . The commonplace wondered to find itself transmuted into a compliment of fine gold ! Gnulemah 's attire to-day was more Diana-like than yesterday 's , and looked as appropriate to her as leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , was not so much a conventional appendage as a living , sensitive part of her , which might be supposed to change its color and style in sympathy with her shifting moods and surroundings , yet never losing certain distinctive traits which had their foundation in her individual nature . " A beautiful morning ! " returned Balder , taking her hand . " Were you expecting me ? " " I feared you might not show yourself to me again , " she answered , with sudden tears twinkling on her eyelashes . She seemed more tenderly human and approachable to-day than heretofore . Had she found her mountain-height of unmated solitude untenable ?  - -  found in herself a yielding woman , and in Balder the strength that is a man ? This descent , which was a sweet ascent , made her endlessly more lovable . " I come here always when I feel lonely , " continued she . " If it had not been for this place , with its great outlook , I should often have been too lonely to stay in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , world , Gnulemah . " " Besides , you came to me from the other side ! " said she glancing in his face . " Did you see me there ? " Balder was on the point of asking ; but he was wise enough to refrain . If he could believe it true , let him not tempt his happiness ; if faith were weak , why build a barrier against it ? So he kept silence . " You found my violets ! " whispered Gnulemah , with a shy smile . " You understand all I do and am ; it is happiness to be with you . " They sat down by mutual consent beneath a crooked old apple-tree , which yet blossomed as pure and fresh as did the youngest in the orchard . From beneath this white and perfumed tent was a view of the distant city . Gnulemah could not be called talkative , yet in giving her thoughts expression she outdid vocabularies . Many fine muscles there were around her eyes , at the corners of her mouth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractions spoke volumes of question , appeal , observation . Her form by its endless shiftings uttered delicate phrases of pleasure , surprise , or love ; her hands and fingers were orators , and eloquent were the curlings and tappings of her Arab feet . This kind of language would be blank to one used rather to hear words than to feel them ; but Balder , in , his present exalted mood , delighted in it . Was there any enjoyment more refined than to see his thought , before he had given it breath , lighten in the eyes of this daughter of fire ? and with his own eyes to catch the first pure glimmer of her yet unborn fancies ? A language genial of intimacy , for the talkers must feel in order to utterance , must meet each other , from the heart outward , at every point . The human form is made of meanings . It is the full thought of its Creator , comprising all other thoughts . Is it blind chance or lifeless expediency that moulds the curves of woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sets his head on his shoulders ? Is beauty beautiful , or are we cozened by congenial ugliness ? But Balder 's philosophic scepticism should never have braved a test like Gnulemah ! Except music , painting , sculpture ,  - -  all the arts and inspiration of them ,  - -  waited on the nib of the pen , such talk as passed between these two could not be written . Some things -- and those not the least profound and admirable of life -- transcend the cunning of man to interpret them , unless to an apprehension as fine as they ! We are fain to content ourselves with the husks . " It must be happy there ! " said Gnulemah , looking cityward . " So many Balders and Gnulemahs ! " " Why happy ? " asked the man of the world , with a faint smile . " We are only two , and have known each other to-day and yesterday . But they , you said , are as many as the stars , and have been together many yesterdays . " Such was the woman 's unclinched argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forestall her enlightenment from the grim page of his own experience . But do not many pure and loving souls pass through the world without once noticing how bad most of the roads are , and how vexed the climates ? So might not the earthly heaven of Gnulemah 's imagination tenderly blind her to the unheavenly earth of Balder 's knowledge ? Through his abstraction Balder felt on his hand a touch soft as the flowing of a breath , yet pregnant of indefinite apprehension . When two clouds meet , there is a hush and calm ; but the first seeming-trifling lightning-flash brings on the storm whereby earth 's face is altered . So Balder , full-charged as the thunder-cloud , awaited fearfully the first vivid word which should light the way for those he had resolved to speak . " I see you with my open eyes , Balder , and touch you and hear you . Is this the end I thought would come ? Balder , are you greatest ? " With full trust she appealed to him to testify concerning himself . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you content it should be so ? " She plucked a blade of grass and tied it in a knot , and began , drawing a trembling breath between each few words ,  --  " O Balder , if I must kneel to you as to the last and greatest of all , if there is nothing too holy to be seen and touched , if there is no Presence too sublime for me to comprehend --  " " What then ? " asked he , meeting her troubled look with a strong , cheerful glance . " Then the world is less beautiful than I thought it ; the sun is less bright , and I am no more pleasing to myself . " Tears began to flow down her noble cheeks ; but Balder 's eyes grew brighter , seeing which , Gnulemah was encouraged to continue . " How could I be happy ? for either must I draw myself apart from you -- O Balder ! or else live as your equal , and so degrade you ; for I am not a goddess ! " " Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need not shrink from me for that . " The beautiful woman smiled through her sparkling eyelashes . She could love and reverence the man who , as a deity , bewildered and disappointed her . But was the intuition therefore false which had revealed to her the grand conception of a supreme , eternal God ? They sat silent for a while , and neither looked in the other 's face . They had struck a sacred chord , and the sweet , powerful sound thrilled Balder no less than Gnulemah . But presently he looked up ; his cheeks warmed , and his heart swelled out . He was about to put in jeopardy his most immediate jewel , and the very greatness of the risk gave him courage . Not to the world , that could not judge him righteously , would he confess his crime ,  - -  but to the woman he loved and who loved him . Her verdict could not fail to be just and true . Could a woman 's judgment of her lover be impartial ? Yes , if her instincts be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . Her discrimination between right and wrong would be at once accurate and involuntary , like the test of poison . Love for the criminal would but sharpen her intuition . The sentence would not be spoken , but would be readable in eyes untainted alike by prejudice or sophistry . Gnulemah was thus made the touchstone of Balder 's morality . He stood ready to abide by her decision . Her understanding of the case should first be made full ; then , if condemned by her look , he would publish his crime to the world , and suffer its penalty . But should her eyes absolve him , then was crime an illusion , evil but undeveloped good , the stain of blood a prejudice , and Cain no outcast , but the venerable forefather of true freedom . Unsearchable is the heart of man . Balder had looked forward to condemnation with a wholesome solemnity which cheered while it chastened him . But the thought of acquittal , and at Gnulemah 's hands , appalled him . The implicit consequences to humanity seemed more formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much had he lately changed his point of view , that only the fear of seeing his former creed confirmed could have now availed to stifle his confession . But that fear did not much disquiet him ; he trusted too deeply in his judge to believe that she would justify it . In short , Gnulemah was in his opinion right-minded , exactly in proportion as she should convict him of being in the wrong . Balder resigned the helm of his vessel , laden as she was with the fruits of years of thought and speculation , at the critical moment of her voyage ,  - -  resigned her to the guidance of a woman 's unreasoning intuition . He might almost as well have averred that the highest reach of intellect is to a perception of the better worth and wisdom of an unlearned heart . XXIII . BALDER TELLS AN UNTRUTH . By way of enheartening himself for what he was to do , Balder kissed the posy of Gnulemah 's fragrant footsteps . He kept his eyes down , lest she should see something in them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artfully to work ,  - -  gain her assent to the abstract principles before marshalling them against himself . Meanwhile Gnulemah had picked up a gold beetle , and was examining it with a certain grave interest . " I never told you how I came by this ring of Hiero 's . It was the night before I first saw you , Gnulemah . " " The ring guided you to me ! " said she , glancing at his downcast visage . " Perhaps it did ! " he muttered , struck by the ingenious superstition ; and he eyed the keen diamond half suspiciously . How fiercely the little serpents were struggling for it ! " But Hiero -- he has lost it , and you will see him no more ! " " You are with me ! " returns she , shining out at him from beneath her level brows . What should she know of death and parting ? Balder still forbore to raise his face . Gnulemah was in a frolicsome humor , the reaction of her foregoing solemnity . But Balder , who deemed this hour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseasonable gayety . Casting about for means to sober her , an ungracious thing for a lover to do !  - -  he hit upon the gold beetle . " Dead ; the poor little beetle ! Do you know what death is , Gnulemah ? " " It is what makes life . The sun dies every night , to get life for the morning . And trees die when cold comes , so as to smile out in green leaves again ,  - -  greener than if there had been no death . So it is with all things . " " Not with everything , " said Balder , taking her light-heartedness very gravely . " That gold beetle in your hand is dead , and will never live or move again . " But at that Gnulemah smiled ; and bringing her hand , with the beetle in it , near her perfect lips , she lent it a full warm breath ,  - -  enough to have enlivened an Egyptian scarabaeus ,  - -  and behold ! the beetle spread its wings and whizzed away . Before Balder could recover from this unexpected refutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You thought , perhaps , that Hiero was as dead as the little beetle ; but he lives more beautifully in you ! " He looked startled up , his large eyes glittering blackly in the paleness of his face . Gnulemah , with the serenity of a victorious disputant willing to make allowances , continued ,  --  " It may be different in the outside world from which you come ; but here death ends nothing , but makes life new and strong . " After a silence of some duration , poor Balder renewed his attack from another quarter . " What would you think of one who put to death a creature you loved ? " She smiled , and shook her glowing pendants . " Only God puts to death ; and no one would hurt a thing I love ! " " What should you think of one who put to death a man ? " Gnulemah looked for a moment perplexed and indignant . Then , to Balder 's great discomfiture , she laughed like a bird-chorus . " Why do you imagine what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The gray owl kills little mice , but that is to eat them . Would you eat Hiero --  " " Do n't laugh , Gnulemah ! " besought he . " I should kill him , not as animals kill one another , but from rage and hatred . " " Hatred ! " repeated Gnulemah , dislikingly ; " hatred ,  - -  what is it ? " " A passion of men 's hearts ,  - -  the wish that evil may befall others . When the hatred is bitter enough , and the opportunity fair , they kill ! " Gnulemah shuddered slightly and looked sad . Then she leaned towards Balder and touched his shoulder persuasively . " Never think of such things , or talk of them ! Could you hate anyone , Balder ? or kill him if you did ? " With that glorious presence so near him ,  - -  her voice so close to his ear ,  - -  how could he answer her ? His heart awoke , and beat and drove the tingling blood tumultuously forth to the remotest veins . She saw the flush , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , she drew back , saying in haste ,  --  " You have not told me yet about the ring ! " That was not wisely said ! Balder checked himself with a sudden , strong hand , and held still , his brows lowered down and his lips settled together ,  - -  until his pulses were quiet and his cheeks once more pale . " I will tell you , " he said ; " but to understand , you must first hear some other things . " He hesitated , face to face with an analysis of murder . The position was at once stimulating and appalling . To dissect and reduce to its elements that grisly murder-devil which had once possessed his own soul , and whose writhings beneath the scalpel he would therefore feel as his own -- here loomed a prospect large and terrible ! Nevertheless , Balder took up the knife . The white petal of an apple-blossom , part from its calyx , came floating earthwards ; but a breeze caught it and wafted it aloft . It sank again , and was again arrested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The weight that made it fall is of the earth , " said Balder ( both he and Gnulemah had been watching the petal 's course ) . " The breeze that buoyed it up was from heaven , and so it is with man . Were there no heavenly support , he would fall at once , but whether or not , he always tends to fall . " Gnulemah objected , " It loves the air better than the earth ! " " When man begins to fall , he becomes mad , and thinks he is not falling , but that earth is heaven , to which he is rising . But since earth is not like heaven , infinite , he does not wish others to enjoy it , lest his own pleasure be marred . " " How can that be ? " said the unwilling Gnulemah . " What can make men so happy on earth as other men ? " " Each wants all power for himself , " rejoined Balder , his voice growing stern as he pursued his theme . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even to annihilation . Every moment this hatred is let grow in the heart 's garden , it spreads and strengthens , till it gains dominion and makes men slaves , and madder than before . Each will be above his rival , his enemy ! he will be absolute master over him . And from that resolve is born murder ! " " Why do you tell Gnulemah this ? " she asked , lifting her head like a majestic serpent . But she could not stop him now . His voice , measured at first , was now driven by emotion . " Murder comes next ; and many a man , had fear or impotence not withheld him , would have done murder a thousand times . But sometimes the demon leaps up and masters impotence and fear . The man is drunk with immeasurable selfishness ,  - -  greater than the universe can satisfy ; which would fain make one victim after another , till all the human race should be destroyed ; and then would it turn against Heaven and God . Save for man 's mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anon be swept away by some giant murderer . " Wickedness grows faster , the wickeder it is ; he who has been wicked once will easily be so again ,  - -  the more easily as his crime was great . Even though through all his mortal life he sin no more , yet his drift is thitherward ! Only the air of Heaven breathing through his soul after death can make him pure . " Balder was speaking out all the gloom and terror which had been silently gathering within him since his fatal night . As he spoke , his mind expanded , and perceived things before unknown . As the reasons for condemnation multiplied , he did but push on the harder , striking at each tender spot in his own armor . And as the day turned fatally against him , his face looked great and heroic , and his voice sounded almost triumphant . Thus far , he had only generalized ; now , he was come to his own plight . On several points he had been painfully in doubt : whether he had done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; whether it had not been a blind , mad accident , since swollen by fevered imagination into the likeness of wilful crime . But against such doubts arrayed itself the ineffaceable memory of that wild joy which had filled his soul , when he had felt his enemy in his power ! Had the man survived , Balder might still have doubted ; being dead , doubts were but cowardly sophistry . But during the brief pause he made , came a backward recoil of that impulse which had swept him on . All at once he was cold , and wavered . Gnulemah was sitting with her elbow on her knee , her strange eyes fixed upon him . Had he duly considered what effect all this might have on her ? In aiming at his own life , might not the sword pass also through hers ? Abruptly to behold sin , to find in the first man she had learnt to know , the sinner , to be left this burden on her untried soul , might this not ruin more than her earthly happiness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in misery ; should she hate him who of all men was bound to protect her defencelessness ,  - -  that were misery indeed ! This misgiving , arresting his hand at the instant of delivering the final blow , almost discouraged the much-tried man . He glanced sullenly toward the edge of the cliff , only a few yards off . A new thought jarred through his nerves ! He got up and walked to the brink . Full sixty feet to the bottom . Gnulemah also rose slowly , and stretched herself like a tired child , sending a lazy tension through every noble limb and polished muscle . She sighed with a deep breathing in and out , and pressed her hands against her temples . " I was not made to understand such things . Tell me of what you have done or seen -- I shall understand that . The things my love does not enter only trouble me and make me sad . " As she spoke , she turned away towards the house . She saw , or thought she saw , a man 's figure stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her listlessness fell from , her like a mantle , and she watched , motionless ! Her last words had goaded Balder past bearing . As she turned away , his face looked grim and forlorn . He balanced with half-raised arms on the cliff 's brink . The river slumbered bluely on below , peace was aloft in the sky , and joy in the trees and grass . But in the man were darkness and despair and loathing of his God-given life ! The thing he meditated was not to be , however . Close in shore a little boat glided into view , beating up against stream . In the stern , the sheet in one hand and the tiller in the other , sat Balder 's old friend Charon . He nodded up at the young man with a recognizing grin . Then he laid his tiller-hand aside his brown cheek and sang out ,  --  " Look out there , Capt'n ! Davy Jones 's got back ,  - -  run foul of you ! " The next moment he put down the helm and ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his dangerous position ; and the peril was past . But the paltering irresolution which he had at all points displayed urged him to redeem himself ,  - -  else was he lower than a criminal . He went towards Gnulemah ,  - -  knelt down ,  - -  caught her dress ,  - -  he knew not what he did ! In a blind dance of sentences he told her that he was a murderer , that all he had said pointed at himself , that with his own hands he had killed Hiero , whose body now lay at the bottom of the sea ; many frantic words he spoke . Thus , without art or rhetoric , roughly dragged forth by head and ears , came his momentous confession into the world . Gnulemah had more than once striven to check it , but in vain . When he had come to an end , and stood tense and quivering as a bowstring whose arrow has just flown , these words reached him :  --  " Hiero is not dead ; he is there behind the trees . " Stiffly he turned and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes in fragments , like images in troubled water . She put out her arm and tenderly supported him . " Where ? " said he at length . " Near the house ,  - -  there ! " she pointed . Balder began to walk forward doubtfully . But , suddenly realizing what lay before him , clearness and vigor ebbed back . He saw a figure turn the corner of the house . Then he leapt out and ran like a stag-hound ! XXIV . UNCLE HIERO AT LAST . In a couple of minutes Balder was at the house , breathless : the figure was nowhere to be seen . He sprang across the broad portico , and hurried with sounding feet through the oaken hall . Should he go up stairs , or on to the conservatory ? The sound of a softly shutting door from the latter direction decided him . The place looked as when he left it a half-hour before . Gnulemah 's curtain had not been moved . The other door was closed ; he ran up the steps between the granite sphinxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel with impatient force , the hinges broke from their rotten fastenings , and the door gave inwards . Balder stepped past it , and found himself in the sombre lamp-lit interior of the temple . He could discern but little ; the place seemed vast ; the corners were veiled in profound shadow . At the farther end a huge lamp was suspended , by a chain from the roof , over a triangular altar of black marble . The architecture of the room was strange and massive as of Egyptian temples . Strong , dark colors met the eye on all sides ; in the panels of the walls and distant ceiling fantastic devices showed obscurely forth . Nine mighty columns , of design like those in the doorway , were ranged along the walls , their capitals buried in the upward gloom . Becoming used to the dusk , Balder now marked an array of colossal upright forms , alternating between the pillars . Their rough resemblance to human figures drew him towards one of them : it was an Egyptian sarcophagus covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These silent relics of a prehistoric past seemed to be the only company present . In view of his uncle 's well-known tastes , the nephew was not unprepared to meet these gentry . But he was come to seek the living , not the dead . The figure that he had seen outside must be within these four walls , there being no other visible outlet besides the door through which Balder had entered . Was old Hiero Glyphic lurking in one of these darksome corners , or behind some thick-set column ? The young man looked about him as sharply as he could , but nothing moved except the shadows thrown by the lamp , which was vibrating pendulum-like on its long chain . He approached this lamp , his steps echoing on the floor of polished granite . What had set the thing swinging ? It had a leisurely elliptical motion , as from a moderate push sideways . The lamp was wrought in bronze , antique of fashion and ornament . It had capacity for gallons of oil , and would burn for weeks without refilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highly polished , resting upon a round base of alabaster . A handful of ashes crowned its top . Between the altar and the wall intervened a space of about seven feet . The glare of the lamp had blinded Balder to what was beyond it ; but , on stepping round it , he was confronted by an old-fashioned upright clock , such as were in vogue upon staircase-landings and in entrance-halls a hundred years ago . With its broad , white , dial-plate , high shoulders , and dark mahogany case , it looked not unlike a tall , flat-featured man , holding himself stiffly erect . But whether man or clock , it was lifeless ; the hands were motionless ,  - -  there was no sound of human or mechanical heart-beat within though Balder held his yet panting breath to listen . Was it Time 's coffin , wherein his corpse had lain still many a silent year ,  - -  only that years must stand still without Time to drive them on ! But this still had had no part in the moving world ,  - -  knew naught of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moveless present ,  - -  a present at once past and to come , yet never here ! No wonder the mummies felt at home ! though even they could only partially appreciate the situation . The clock was fastened against the wall . The longer Balder gazed at it , the more human-like did it appear . Its face was ornamented with colored pictures of astronomical processes , sufficiently resembling a set of shadowy features , of a depressed and insignificant type . The mahogany case served for a close-fitting brown surtout , buttoned to the chin . The slow vibration of the lamp produced on the countenance the similitude of a periodically recurring grimace . Not only did the clock look human , but -- or so Balder fancied -- it bore a grotesque and extravagant likeness to a certain elderly relative of his , whose portrait he had carried in an inner pocket of his haversack , now in Long Island Sound . It reminded him , in a word , of poor old Uncle Hiero , whom he had -- no , no !  - -  who was alive and well , and was perhaps even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it ! The young man glanced uneasily over his shoulder , but all beyond the lamp was a gloomy blank , The same moment he trod upon some tough , thick substance , which yielded beneath his foot ! Thoroughly startled , he jumped back . It lay near the foot of the clock . He stooped , picked it up , and held in his hands the well-known haversack , from which he had parted on board the " Empire State . " How his heart beat as he examined it ! It was stained and whitened with salt water , and the strap was broken in two . Opening it , there were his toilet articles and all his other treasures ,  - -  even the cherished miniature , not much the worse for their wetting . So there could no longer be any doubt that his uncle had come back . Where was he ? That queer fancy about the clock stuck in Balder 's head ! Somehow or other it must be connected with Doctor Glyphic . The haversack , dropped at its foot , was direct evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrational ! Its manifest absurdity only excuse for thinking it . With no declared object in view , Balder grasped the clock by its high shoulders and shook it , but with no result . He next struck the smartly with clenched fist : the blow sounded , not hollow , but close and muffled ! The case either solid , or filled with something that deadened the echo . Filled with what ? who would think of putting anything in a clock ? It was big enough to be sure , to hold a man , if he could find a way to get in ! The sequence of thoughts is often obscure , but Balder 's next idea , wild as it was , could hardly be called incoherent . A man might be conceived to be in the clock ; perhaps a man was in it ; but if so , the man could be none other than Doctor Hiero Glyphic ! This conclusion once imagined , suspense was unendurable . The logician tried to open the front of the case , but it was riveted fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sound like a rusty screech , it came off in his hands . The lamp so flickered that Balder feared it was going out , and even at this epoch had to look round to reassure himself . Meanwhile , a pungent , but not unpleasant odor saluted his nostrils : he turned back to the clock ,  - -  a clock no longer !  - -  and beheld the unmistakable lineaments of his worthy uncle peeping forth with half-shut eyes from the place where the dial-plate had been . The nephew dropped the dial-plate , and it was shattered on the granite floor . He was badly frightened . There was no delusion about the face , it was a sufficiently peculiar one ; and the miniature portrait , though doing the Doctor 's beauty at least justice , was accurate enough to identify him by . This was no unsubstantial apparition , no brain phantom , to waver and vanish , leaving only an uncomfortable doubt whether it had been at all . Stolid , undeniable matter was , peering phlegmatically between its wrinkled eyelids . But admitting that now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic Doctor Glyphic , why should the sight of him so oddly affect Balder Helwyse , whose avowed object in pulling off the dial-plate had been to justify a suspicion that Uncle Hiero was behind it ? Why , moreover , did the young man not address his relative , congratulating himself upon their meeting , and rallying the old gentleman on his attempt to escape his nephew 's affectionate solicitude ? There had , indeed , been a misunderstanding at their last encounter , and Balder had so far forgotten himself as to throw Hiero into the sea ; but it was the part of good-breeding , as well as of Christianity , to forget such errors , and heal the bruise with an extra application of balsamic verbiage . Why so speechless , Balder ? Do you wait for your host to speak first ? Nay , never stand on ceremony . He is an eccentric recluse , unused to the ways of society , while a man of the world like you has at his tongue 's tip a score of phrases just suited to the occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell the Doctor how glad you are to find him in such wonderful preservation ! Put him at his ease by feigning that his position appears to you the most natural in the world ,  - -  just what befits a gentleman of his years and honors ! Flatter him , if only from self-interest , for he has a deep pocket , and may be induced to let you put a hand in it . Not a word in response to all this eloquence , Balder ? Positively your behavior appears rather curmudgeonly than heroic ! You stand gazing at your relative with almost as much fixedness as he returns your stare withal . There is something odd about this . What is that pungent odor ? Is the Doctor a dandy , that he should use perfumes ? And where did he get so peculiar a scent as this ? It is commonly in vogue only at that particular toilet which no man ever performed for himself , but which never needs to be done twice ,  - -  a kind of toilet , by the way , especially prevalent amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so ardent an Egyptologist , perhaps we have hit upon the secret of his remarkable odoriferousness . But to shut one 's self up in a box that looks so uncommonly like a coffin ,  - -  is not that carrying the antiquarian whim a trifle too far ? This face of his , one fancies there is a curiously dry look about it ! The unnaturally yellow skin resembles a piece of good-for-nothing wrinkled parchment . The lips partake of the prevailing sallow tint , and the mouth hangs a little awry . From the cloth in which the head is so elaborately bandaged up strays forth , here and there , an arid lock of hair . The lack of united expression in his features produces an effect seldom observable in a living face . The eyes are lustreless , and densely black ; or possibly ( the suspicion is a startling one ) we are looking into empty eye-sockets ! No eyes , no expression , parchment skin , swathed head , odor of myrrh and cassia , and , dominating all , this ghastly immobility ! Has Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sentiment over some worn-out disguise of his ? Nay , if he be not here , we need not seek him further . Having forsaken this , he can attain no other earthly hiding-place . We must pause here , and believe either that this dry time-husk is the very last of poor Hiero , or that a living being which once bore his name has vanished inward from our reach , and now treads a more real earth than any that time and space are sovereign over . Balder ( whose perceptions were unlimited by artistic requirements ) probably needed no second glance to assure him that his uncle was a mummy of many years ' standing . But no effort of mental gymnastics could explain him the fact . Were this real , then was his steamboat adventure a dream , the revelation of the ring a delusion , and his water-stained haversack a phantom . He wandered clewless in a maze of mystery . Nor was this the first paradox he had encountered since overleaping the brick wall . He began to question whether supernaturalism had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the actors in the play of life plod from one to another scene , nor once rise to a height whence a glance might survey past and future . Memory and prophecy are twin sisters , nay , they are essentially one muse , whom mankind worships on this side and slights on that . This is well , for had she but one aspect , the world would be either too confident or too helpless . But in reviewing a life , one is apt to make less than due allowance for the helplessness . Thus it is no prejudice to Balder 's intellectual acumen that he failed for a moment to penetrate the thin disguises of events , and to perceive relations obvious to the comprehensive view of history . We will take advantage of his bewildered pause to draw attention to some matters heretofore neglected . XXV . THE HAPPINESS OF MAN . When Manetho ,  - -  who shall no longer perplex us with his theft of a worthier man 's name ,  - -  when Manetho felt himself worsted in the brief strenuous struggle , he tried to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized only the leathern strap of the haversack . Balder -- his Berserker fury at white heat -- flung the man with such terrible strength as drove him headlong over the taffrail like a billet of wood , the stout strap snapping like thread ! Manetho struck the water in sorry plight , breathless , bruised , half strangled . He sank to a chilly depth , but carried his wits down with him , and these brought him up again alive , however exhausted . Too weak to swim , he yet had strength left to keep afloat . But for the collision , he had drowned , after all ! The cool salt bath presently helped him to a little energy , and by the time the steamer was under way , he could think of striking out . It was with no small relief that he heard near voices sounding through the black fog . Partly by dint of feeble struggles , partly shouldered on by waves ,  - -  ready to save as to drown him ,  - -  he managed to accomplish the short distance to the schooner . With all his might he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing , and astonishment , was at length hauled aboard , the haversack in his grasp . The skipper and his crew were kind to him ; for men still have compassion upon one another , and give succor according to the need of the moment , not to the balance of good and evil in the sufferer . The wind freshened , an impromptu , bowsprit was rigged , and the " Resurrection " limped towards New York . Manetho 's partial stupor was relieved by hot grog and the cook 's stove . He gave no further account of himself than that he had fallen overboard at the moment of collision ; adding a request to be landed in New York , since he had left some valuable luggage on the steamer . The skipper gave the stranger his own bunk , the off-watch turned in , and Manetho was left to himself . He lay for a long while thinking over what had happened . Bewitched by the spell of night , he had spoken to Helwyse things never before distinctly stated even to his own mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his unknown hearer had scarcely been so unreserved to Manetho 's private ear ; and the devilish utterances had stirred up the latter not much less than the former . Both men had been wrought , according to their diverse natures , to the pitch of frenzy . But similar crazy seizures had been incident to the Egyptian from boyhood . He had anxiously watched against them , and contrived various means to their mitigation ,  - -  the most successful being the music of his violin , which he seldom let beyond his reach . Yet , again and again would the fit steal a march on him . Hence , in part , his retired way of life , varied only by the brief journeys demanded by the twofold craving -- for gambling and for news of Thor , who figured in his morbid imagination as the enemy of his soul ! The news never came , but all the more brooded Manetho over his hatred and his fancied wrongs . His mind had never been entirely sound , and years tinged it more and more deeply with insanity . His philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmer when read by this . He would creep through miles of subterranean passages to achieve an end which one glance above ground would have argued vain ! Lying on the bunk in the close cabin , lighted by a dirty lantern pendent from the roof , the Reverend Manetho began to fear that not his worst misfortune was the having been thrown overboard . At the moment when madness was smouldering to a blaze within him , the lantern flash had revealed to him the face which , for twenty years , he had seen in visions . Often had he rehearsed this meeting , varying his imaginary behavior to suit all conceivable moods and attitudes of his enemy , but never thinking to provide for perversity in himself ! So far from veiling his designs with the soft-voiced cunning of his Oriental nature , he had been a wild beast ! A misgiving haunted him , moreover , that he had babbled something in the false security of darkness , which might give Helwyse a clew to his secret . But here Manetho asked himself a question that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thor Helwyse , whose face he had seen ? or only some likeness of him ? Thor must be threescore years old by this ,  - -  the senior by ten years of Manetho himself ; while his late antagonist had the strength and aspect of half that age . Yet how could he be mistaken in the face which had haunted him during more than the third part of his lifetime ? He had recognized it on the instant ! " I will ask the haversack ! " said he . He sat up , and , bracing himself against the roll of the vessel , he opened the bag and carefully examined its contents . In an inner pocket he found an old letter of Doctor Glyphic 's to Thor ; another from Thor to his son , dated three years back ; and finally a diary kept by Balder Helwyse , which gave Manetho all the information he wanted . He had so arranged matters that at Glyphic 's death he had got the control of the money into his own hands , and had made such diligent use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his prosecution as a thief and forger . In fact , had Balder delayed his return another year , he would have found the enchanted castle in possession of the auctioneer ; and as to the fate of its inhabitants , one does not like to speculate ! Having read the papers , Manetho replaced them , and next pulled out the miniature of Doctor Glyphic . He studied this for a long time . It was the portrait of a man to whom -- so long as their earthly relations had continued -- the Egyptian renegade had been faithful . Perhaps there was some secret germ of excellence in poor Hiero , unsuspected by the rest of the world , but revealed to Manetho , from whom in turn it had drawn the best virtues that his life had to show . Doctor Glyphic had never been a comfortable companion ; but Manetho was always patient and honest with him . This integrity and forbearance were the more remarkable , since the Doctor seldom acknowledged a kindness , and knew so little of business that he might have been robbed of his fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for some worthier reason , the Egyptian cried over this miniature , as an affectionate girl might have cried over the portrait of her dead lover . For a time he was all tears and softness . His emotion had not the convulsiveness which , with men of his age , is apt to accompany the exhibition of much feeling . He wept with feminine fluency , nor did his tearfulness seem out of character . There was a great deal of the woman in him . Having wept his fill , he tenderly wiped his eyes , and returned the picture to its receptacle ; and first assuring himself that nothing else was concealed in the haversack , he shut it up and resumed his meditations . It was the son , then , whom he had met ,  - -  and Thor was dead . Dead !  - -  that was a hard fact for Manetho to swallow . His enemy had escaped him ,  - -  was dead ! Through all the years of waiting , Manetho had not anticipated this . How should Thor die before revenge had been wreaked upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mind began to adjust itself to the situation . The son , at all events , was left him . He cuddled the thought , whispering to himself and slyly smiling . Did not the father live again in the son ? he would lose nothing , therefore , not lose , but gain ! The seeming loss was a blessing in disguise . The son , young , handsome , hot of blood ! Already new schemes began to take shape in the Egyptian 's brain . His dear revenge ! it should not starve , but feed on the fat of the land , yea , be drunk with strong wine . He lay hugging himself , his long narrow eyes gleaming , his full lips working together . He was revolving a devilish project ,  - -  the flintiest criminal might have shuddered at it . But there was nothing flinty nor unfeeling about Manetho . His emotions were alert and moist , his smile came and went , his heart beat full ; he was now the girl listening to her lover 's first passionate declaration ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was in search of his uncle , and had been on his way to the house at the time of their encounter . There was a chance that this unlucky episode might frighten him away . He no doubt supposed himself guilty of manslaughter at least ; how gladly would the clergyman have reassured him ! And indeed there was no resentment in Manetho 's heart because of his rough usage at Balder 's hands . His purposes lay too deep to influence shallower moods . He presented a curious mixture of easy forgiveness and unmitigable malice . The only other anxiety besetting him arose from the loss of the ring . He looked upon it as a talisman of excellent virtue , and moreover perceived that in case Balder should pick it up , it might become the means of identifying its owner and obstructing his plans . But these were mere contingencies . The probability was that young Helwyse would ultimately appear at his uncle 's house , and would there be ensnared in the seductive meshes of Manetho 's web . The ring was most likely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle feminine smile , the Egyptian fell asleep , to dream of the cordial welcome he would give his expected guest . Towards midnight of the same day he approaches the house by way of the winding avenue , his violin-case safe in hand . He steps out joyfully beneath the wide-spread minuet of twinkling stars . On his way he comes to a moss-grown bench at the foot of a mighty elm ,  - -  the bench on which he sat with Helen during the stirring moments of their last interview . Manetho 's soul overflows to-night with flattering hopes , and he has spare emotion for any demand . He drops on his knees beside this decayed old bench , and kisses it twice or thrice with tender vehemence ; stretches out his arms to embrace the air , and ripples forth a half-dozen sentences ,  - -  pleading , insinuating , passionate . He can love her again as much as ever , now that the wrong done him is on the eve of requital . But his mood is no less fickle than melting . Already he is up and away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes glistening black in the starlight , no longer with a lover 's luxurious sorrow , but with the happy anticipation of an artless child , promised a holiday and playthings . So lightsome and expansive is Manetho 's heart , the hollow hemisphere of heaven seems none too roomy for it ! Evil as well as good knows its moments of bliss ,  - -  its hours ! Hell is the heaven of devils , and they want no better . Often do the wages of sin come laden with a seeming blessing that those of virtue lack . The sinner looks upon Satan 's face , and it is to him as the face of God ! But from the womb of this grim truth is born a noble consolation . Were hell mere torment , and joy in heaven only , where were the good man 's merit ? Only when the choice lies between two heavens -- the selfish and the unselfish -- is the battle worthy the fighting ! No human soul dies from earth that attains not heaven ,  - -  that heaven which the heart chiefly sought while in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings its self-inflicted penalties there as here ; but hell is still the happiness of man , heaven of God ! Reaching the house , Manetho passed through the open door , crossed the hall with his customary noiselessness , and entered the conservatory . Despite the darkness , he was at once aware of the motionless group beneath the palm-trees . A stranger in the house was something so unprecedented that he could not repress a throb of alarm . Nurse looked up and beckoned him . Drawing near , he heard the long , deep breathing of the sleeper . With a sudden fore-glimpse of the truth , he knelt down , and bent over the upturned countenance . Though the beard was close-shaven and the hair cropped short , there could be no doubt about the face . His guest had come before him , and was lying defenceless at his feet ; but Manetho harbored no thought of violence . He pressed his slender hands together with an impulse of sympathy . " Poor fellow ! " he whispered , " how he has suffered ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble Helwyse hair ,  - -  all gone ! Too dear a price to pay for the mere sacrifice of a human life ! And pain and all might have been spared him ,  - -  poor fellow ! poor fellow ! " Manetho lacked but little of shedding true tears over the evidence of his dearest foe 's useless dread and anguish . Did he wish Balder to bring undulled nerves to his own torture-chamber ? His lament over , Manetho turned to Nurse for such information regarding the guest 's arrival and behavior as she might have to communicate . Of his own affair with Balder he made no mention . The conversation was carried on by signs , according to a code long since grown up between the two . When the tale was told , Nurse was despatched to make ready Helen 's room for the new-comer , and thither did the two laboriously bear him , and laid him , still sleeping , on his mother 's bed . XXVI . MUSIC AND MADNESS . Before leaving Balder to his repose , Manetho paused to regain his breath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place he seldom visited . He had seen Helen 's dead body lie on that bed , and the sight had bred in him an animosity against the chamber and everything it contained . After Doctor Glyphic 's death he had gratified this feeling in a characteristic manner . Possessing a genius for drawing second only to that for music , he had exercised it on the walls of the room , originally modelled and tinted to represent a robin 's egg . He mixed his colors with the bitter distillations of his heart , and created the beautiful but ill-omened vision which long afterwards so disquieted Balder.  --  From the chamber he now repaired to the kitchen , which was in some respects the most attractive place in the house . The smoky ceiling ; the cavernous cupboards opening into the walls ; the stanch dressers , polished by use and mottled with many an ancient stain ; the great black range , which would have cooked a meal for a troop of men-at-arms ,  - -  all spoke of homely comfort . Nurse had Manetho 's meal ready for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she retired to her position in the chimney-corner . The Egyptian 's spare body was ordinarily nourished with little more than goes to the support of an Arab , and Nurse 's monotonous life must have been unfavorable to large appetite . As for Gnulemah ,  - -  although young women are said to thrive and grow beautiful on a diet of morning dew , noonday sunshine , and evening mist , it seems quite likely that she ate no less than the health and activity of a Diana might naturally require . Manetho made a gleeful repast , and Nurse looked on from her corner , externally as unattractive-looking a woman as one would wish to see . Nevertheless , had she been made as some clocks are , with a plate of glass over her inner movements , she would have monopolized the clergyman 's attention and impaired his appetite . He did not sit down to the table , but took up one viand after another , and ate as he walked to and fro the floor . Supper over , he crowned it with an unheard-of excess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought from a cupboard a dusty bottle of priceless wine , which had once enriched the cellar of a king of Spain . Drawing the cork , he poured some of the golden liquor into a slender glass , while the spiritual aroma flowed invisible along the air , visiting every darksome nook , and even saluting Nurse , who had long been a stranger to any such delicate attention . Manetho filled two glasses , and then beckoned Nurse to come from her corner , and drink with him . Forth she hobbled accordingly , looking more than usually ugly by reason of her surprise and embarrassment at the unexpected summons . Manetho , on the other hand , seemed to have cast aside his years , and to be once more the graceful , sinuous , courteous youth , whose long black eyes had , long ago , seen Salome 's heart . With an elegant gesture he handed her the brimming wineglass , accompanying it with a smile which well-nigh shook it from between her fingers . He took up his own glass , and said ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless a lady , joins me ! Once I drank with her whose chamber our guest now occupies ; and once with another --  " Manetho paused . " I never speak her name , Nurse ; but we loved each other . I did not treat her well ! " He murmured with a sigh , tears in his eyes . " Were she here to-night , at her feet would I sue for pardon ,  - -  the renewal of our love . By my soul ! " he cried , suddenly , " I had thought to drink a far different toast ; but let this glass be drained to the memory of the sweet moments she and I have known together ! Drink ! " He tossed off the wine . But poor Nurse , strangely agitated , dropped hers on the floor ; the precious liquor was spilled , and the glass shivered . She gazed beseechingly at Manetho . Could he not penetrate that mask to the face behind it ? Is flesh so miserably opaque that no spark of the inwardly burning soul can make itself felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its wasted contents ! " You are as clumsy as you are ugly ! " said he , " Go back to your corner . I must converse with my violin . " She returned heavily to her place , feeling the darker and colder because that wine had been spilled before she could raise it to her lips . One taste , she fancied , might have begun a transformation in her life ! But we know not the weight of the chains we lay upon our limbs . The Egyptian 's buoyant humor had dismissed the whole matter in another moment . He opened his violin-case , lovingly caressing the instrument as he took it out . Then he tucked it fondly under his chin , and resumed his walking . The delicately potent wine warbled through his nerves , and tinted memory with imagination . The bow , traversing the strings , drew forth from them a sweet and plaintive note , like the tender remonstrance of a neglected friend . No language says so much in so short space as music , nor will , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure vowel speech of infants and angels . " Ay , long have we been apart , my beloved one , and much have I needed thee ! " murmured Manetho . " I yearned for thy soothing and refreshing voice ; yea , death walked near me , because thou , my preserver , wast not by to guard me . But , rejoice ! all is again well with us ,  - -  the hour of our triumph is near ! " The fine instrument responded , carolling forth an exquisite paean , an ascending scale , mounting to a breathless ecstasy , and falling in slower melody along gliding waves of fortunate sound . The player drank each perfect note , till his pulses beat in unison with the rhythm . His violin and he were wedded lovers since his youth , nor had discord ever come between them . " Two little children weaving flower-chains for each other in the grass . I said , ' The one that first comes to me shall be mine ! ' And the little maiden arose , leaving her brother among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . But , behold ! the brother has come to play with his sister once more ! " Again the music -- a divine philosopher 's stone -- touched the theme into fine-spun golden harmony . The dusky kitchen , with its one dull lamp glimmering on the table , broadened with marble floors , and sprang aloft in airy arches ! Twinkling stars hung between the columns , burning with a fragrance like flowers . It was a summer morning , just before sunrise . The clear faces of children peeped from violet-strewn recesses where they had passed the night ; and , as their sweet eyes met , they shouted for joy , and ran to embrace one another . " Oh ! my beloved , " softly burst forth the Egyptian , " how blessed are we to-night ! " He touched the strings to a measured tune , following with a minuet-step up and down the floor . A fantastic spectacle ! for as he passed and repassed the lamp , an elastic shadow crept noiselessly behind him , dodged beneath his feet , and anon outstretched itself like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreary years that lie behind . How have I outlasted them ! What had I fallen on the very threshold of requital ?  - -  all I had hoped and labored for , a failure ! " Here paused the tune and the dance , and arose a weird dirge of compassion over what might have been ! So moving was it , the player himself was melted . His dark nature showed its fairest side ,  - -  sensitive refinement , grace of expression , flowing ease of manner . Quick was he in fancy , emotional , soft and strong , gentle and fiery . In this hour he bloomed , like some night-flowering plant , of perfume sweet but poisonous . This was Manetho 's apogee ! Again his humor changed , and he became playful and frivolous . Had old Nurse in the corner been little more personable , he might have caught her round the waist , and forced her to tread a wild measure with him . But this unfolding of his faculties in the shower of good fortune had refined his aesthetic susceptibility . The withered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following , with the intentness of her single eye , his every motion , her head swaying in unconscious sympathy . Although her body sat so stiff and awkward in the chimney-seat , her spirit , inspired with the grace of love , was dancing with Manetho 's . But the body kept its place , knowing that erelong he too must come to rest . In the light of a vivid recollection , the long tract between fades and foreshortens , till only the Then and the Now are notable . However , the light will pale , the dusty miles outstretch their length once more , and the pilgrim find himself wearier than ever . But meanwhile the clergyman floats hither and thither like a wreath of black smoke blown about by a draught of air . One might have expected to see him all at once vanish up the wide-mouthed chimney . The music seems to emanate less from the instrument than from the player ; it interprets and colors every motion and expression . His chanting and his playing answer and supplement each other , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rejoice , that thy sympathy may increase my joy ! " A beautiful woman , young , a fountain of fresh life , an ivory vase filled with earthly flowers . The eye that gazes on her form is taken captive ; yea , her face intoxicates the senses . But she is poisonous , a queen of death , and her feet walk towards destruction ! " Supple and strong is she as the serpent , quick and graceful as the panther . Food has she for nourishment , for the warming of the blood ; exercises for the body , to keep her healthful and fair . Her triumph is in the flesh , she finds it perfect . The flesh she deems divine ,  - -  the earth , a heaven ! " Books , the world of men , she knows not : sees in herself Creation 's cause and centre ; in God , but the myriad reflex of her beauty . Self is her God , whom she worships in thunder and lightning , in sun and stars , in fire and water . Dreaming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divide truth from falsehood . " Whom should she thank for health , for life and birth ? She is born of the fire that burns in her own bosom . To her is nothing lawful nor unlawful . No tie binds her soul to salvation . A fair ship is she , but rudderless , and the wind blows on the rocks . Let God save her if He will -- and can ! " The inspiration of the Arab improvisatore would have seemed tame beside Manetho 's nervous exaltation . Save for the tingling satire of the violin-strings , his rhapsody might easily have lapsed to madness . From this point , however , his rapture somewhat abated , and he began to descend towards prose , his music clothing him downwards . " As for me , I have bowed down before her , pampering her insolent majesty , preserving her poison to rancor first in her father 's heart . Of him , death robbed me ; but the son ,  - -  the brother is left . Even death spared brother and sister to each other ! " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairer couple sprang from one stem . They love each other ,  - -  and shall love !  - -  more than ever brother and sister loved before . But they shall be bound by a tie so close that the mere tie of blood hangs loose beside it ! Then shall night come down on them ,  - -  a night no rising sun shall ever chase away . In that ; darkness will I speak --  " This devilish monologue ended abruptly here . The faithful instrument , whose responsive sympathy had failed him , jarringly snapped a string ! A sting of anguish pricked through Manetho 's every nerve . His fictitious buoyancy evaporated like steam ,  - -  he barely made shift to totter to a chair . Laying the violin with tremling hands on the table , his head dropped on his arms beside it ; and there was a long , feverish silence . At length he raised his haggard face , and , supporting it upon his hands , he gazed at the figure in the chimney-corner ; and began , in a tone sullen and devoid of animation as November rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for Gnulemah 's sake , I think . Not for money , you had none . Not for love of me either , I fancy ,  - -  grisly harpy ! " Once I suspected you of being a spy . You walked among pitfalls then ! But what spy would sit for eighteen years without speech or movement ? You have been useful too . No one could have filled your place , with your one eye and dumb mouth ! " Did you hate Thor ? were you my secret ally against him ? But how could you fathom my purposes enough even to help me ? And what wrong has he done you terrible enough for such revenge as mine ? What human being , except Manetho , could hold an unwavering purpose so many years ? Have you never pitied or relented ? Sometimes I have almost wavered myself ! " What name and history have you buried , and never shown me ? Why have you spent your dumb life in this seclusion ? You are a mystery ,  - -  yet a mystery of my own making ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurks the music . A mass of wood and strings ,  - -  the music is from me ! " Have you a thought of preventing the scheme I spoke of to-night ? " The Egyptian leaned far across the table , the better to scrutinize the unanswering woman 's face . Her eye met his with a steady intelligence that disconcerted him . " Are you a woman ? " he muttered , drawing back , " and have you no pity on the children whom you nursed in their infancy ? not any pity ! as implacable -- almost more implacable than I ? But think of her beauty and innocence , for is she not innocent as yet ? Would you see her forever ruined ,  - -  and stretch forth no saving hand ? " Nurse moved her head up and down , as in slow , deliberate assent . Manetho , beholding the reflection in her of his own moral deformity , was filled with abhorrence ! " More hideous within than without , you demon ! come to haunt me and make me wicked as yourself . It was you snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had till then saved me from your spells ! My evil genius ! I know you now , though never until this moment . " This madman was not the first sinner who , happening to catch an outside glimpse of his interior grime , has tried to cheat his scared conscience by an outcry of " Devil !  - -  devil ! " Is there not a touch of pathos in the vanity of the situation ? For the cry is in part sincere ; no man can be so wholly evil , while in this world , as quite to divorce the better angel from his soul . But alas ! for the poor righteous indignation . XXVII . PEACE AND GOOD-WILL . Balder Helwyse , dumfounded before the revelation of the clock , might have stared himself into imbecility , had not he heard his name spoken in sweet human music , and , turning , beheld Gnulemah peeping through the doorway down the hall . There was no great distance between them , yet she seemed immeasurable spaces away . Against the bright background of the conservatory her form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapery . But the dull red lamplight lit duskily up the folds of her robe , her golden ornaments , and the black tarns , her eyes . She appeared to waver between the light of heaven and the lurid gloom of heaven 's opposite . Balder came hastily towards her , waving her back . He was superstitiously anxious that she should return unshadowed to the clear outer sunshine , instead of joining him in this tomb of dead bones and darkness . Darkness might indeed befriend his own imperfections ; but should Gnulemah be dimmed to soothe his vanity ? Such emblematic fancies are common to lovers , whose ideal passion tends always to symbolism . But to those who have never loved , it will be enough to say that the young man felt an instinctive desire to spare Gnulemah the ugly spectacle in the clock , and was perhaps not unwilling to escape from it himself ! She awaited him , in the bright doorway , like an angel come to lead him to a better world . " Do not leave me any more ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did not do the thing you thought . Let us be together , and dream no more such sadness ! " " Is her innocence strong enough to protect her against that sinful deluge of confession I poured out upon her ? " thought Helwyse , glancing at her face . " Has it fallen from her harmless , like water from a bird 's breast ? And am I after all no murderer ? " Doubt nor accusation was in her eyes , but soft feminine faith . Her eyes ,  - -  rather than have lost the deep intelligence of their dark light , Balder would have consented to blotting from heaven its host of stars ! Through them shone on him , not justice , but the divine injustice of woman 's love . That wondrous bond , more subtile than light , and more enduring than adamant , had leagued her to him . Consecrated by the blessing of her trust , he must not dare distrust himself . If the past were blindly wrong , she was the God-given clew to guide him right . An unspeakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her for what she gave . The rich bud of their love bloomed at once in full , fragrant stateliness . Their hearts , left unprotected by their out-opened arms , demanded shelter , and found it in nestling on each other . Heaven touched earth in the tremulous , fiery calm of their meeting lips ,  - -  magnets whose currents flowed from the mysterious poles of humanity . At such moments -- the happiest life counts but few -- angels draw near , but veil their happy eyes . Spirits of evil grind their teeth and frown ; and , for one awful instant , perceive their own deformity ! Before yet that dear embrace had lasted an eternity , the man felt the woman shiver in his arms . The celestial heights and spaces dwindled , the angelic music fainted . Heaven rolled back and left them alone on earth . Manetho stood on the threshold between the sphinxes , wearing such a smile as God has never doomed us to see on a child 's face ! To few men comes the opportunity of facing in this life those whom they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palpable assurance of the victim 's survival would electrify the fancied murderer . But to Balder 's mind , his personal responsibility could not be thus lightened ; and any emotion of selfish relief was therefore denied him . On the other hand , such inferences as he had been able to draw from things seen and heard were not to Manetho 's advantage . While he could not but rejoice to have been spared actually hurrying a soul from the life of free will to an unchangeable eternity , yet his dominant instinct was to man himself for the hostile issues still to arise . He looked at the being through whom his own life had received so dark a stain with stern , keen eyes . Gnulemah remained within the circle of her lover 's arm . She seemed but little interested in Manetho 's appearance , save in so far as he invaded the sanctity of her new immortal privilege . She had never known anxiety on his account ; he had never appealed to her feeling for himself . If she loved him , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Balder 's embrace at the moment of the Egyptian 's presence , but before having set eyes on him . Had the nearness of his discordant spirit -- his familiar face unseen -- made her conscious of an evil emanation from him , else unperceived ? Manetho , to do him justice , assumed anything but a hostile attitude . His pleasure at seeing the pair so well affected towards each other was plainly manifested . He clasped his hands together , then extended them with a gesture of benediction and greeting , and came forward . His swarthy face , narrowing from brow to chin , if it could not be frank and hearty , at least expressed a friendliness which it had been ungracious to mistrust . " Yes , son of Thor , I live ! God has been merciful to both of us . Let one who knew your father take your hand . Believe that whatever I have felt for him , I now feel for you ,  - -  and more ! " The speaker had cast aside the fashionable clothes which he was in the habit of wearing during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against being conspicuous , and was clad in antique priestly costume . A curiously figured and embroidered robe fell to his feet , and was confined at the waist by a long girdle , which also passed round his shoulders , after the manner of a Jewish ephod . It invested him with a dignity of presence such as ordinary garments would not have suggested . This , combined with the unexpectedly pacific tone of his address ( its somewhat fantastic formality suiting well with that of his appearance ) , was not without effect on Balder . He gave his hand with some cordiality . " Yours , also ? " continued the other , addressing Gnulemah with an involuntary deference that surprised her lover . She complied , as a princess to her subject . This incident seemed to indicate their position relatively to each other . Had the wily Egyptian played the slave so well , as finally in good earnest to have become one ? The three stood for a moment joined in a circle , through which what incongruous passions were circulating ! But Gnulemah soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek the one clasped by Balder . The priest turned cold , and stepped back ; and , after an appearance of mental struggle , said huskily ,  --  " Hiero is forgotten ; you are all for the stranger ! " " You never told me who lived beyond the wall , " returned Gnulemah , with simple dignity ; and added , " You are no less to me than before , but Balder is -- my love ! " The last words came shyly from her lips , and she swayed gently , like a noble tree , towards him she named . Manetho 's lips worked against each other , and his body twitched . He was learning the difference between theory and practice ,  - -  dream and fact . His subtle schemes had been dramas enacted by variations of himself . No allowance had been made for the working of spirit on spirit ; even his special part had been designed too narrowly , with but a single governing emotion , whereas he already found himself assailed by an anarchic host of them . " Gnulemah ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ,  - -  my purpose ,  - -  body of my hopes and prayers ! " He knelt and bowed himself at her feet , in the Oriental posture of worship , and went on with rising passion :  --  " My secrets have bloomed in thy beauty ,  - -  been music in thy voice ,  - -  darkened in thine eyes ! O my flower -- fascinating , terrible !  - -  the time is ripe for the gathering , for the smelling of the perfume , for the kissing of the petals ! I must yield thee up , O my idol ! but in thy hand are my life and my reason , yea , Gnulemah , thou art all I am ! " The tears , gestures , voice , with which Manetho thus delivered himself , shocked the Northern taste of Helwyse . Through the semi-scriptural , symbolic language , he fancied he could discern a basis of materialism so revolting that the man of the world -- the lover now !  - -  listened with shame and anger . Here was a professed worshipper of Gnulemah , who ascribed to her no nobler worth than to be the incarnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-idolatry , thought Balder , masquerading as a lofty form of idealization . The priest 's mind was in a more complex condition than Balder imagined . His absorption in Gnulemah , if only as she was the instrument of his dominant purpose , must have been complete ; the success ( as he deemed it ) of his life was staked on her . But , in addition to this , the unhappy man had , unwittingly , and with the vehemence of his ill-ordered nature , grown to love the poison-draught brewed for his enemy ! When the enemy 's lips touched the cup , did Manetho first become aware that it brimmed with the brewer 's own life-blood ! Yet it might have been foreseen . He loved her , not because she was identified with his aims , nor even because she was beautiful , but ( and not inconsistently with his theoretical belief in her devilishness ) because she was pure and true . Under the persuasion that he was influencing her nature in a manner only possible , if at all , to a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stronger and loftier spirit . The transcendent cunning on which he had prided himself , as regarded his plan of educating Gnulemah , had amounted to little more than imbecile inaction . As Manetho prostrated himself , and even touched the hem of Gnulemah 's robe to his forehead , Balder looked to see her recoil ; but she maintained a composure which argued her not unused to such homage . So much evil ( albeit unintentionally ) had the Egyptian done her , that she could suffer , while she slighted , his worship . Yet , in the height of her proud superiority to him , she turned with sweet submission to her lover , and , obedient to his whisper , gathered up her purple mantle and passed through the green conservatory to her own door , through which , with a backward parting glance at her master , she superbly vanished . Balder had disliked the scene throughout , yet his love was greater than before . An awe of the woman whose innate force could command a nature like this priest 's seemed to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men were now left alone to come to what understanding they might . Manetho rose to his feet , obliquely eying Helwyse , and spoke with the manner and tone of true humility ,  --  " You have seen me in my weakness . I am but a broken man , Balder Helwyse . " " We had better speak the plain truth to each other , " said Balder , after a pause . " You can have no cause to be friendly to me . I can not extenuate what I did . I think I meant to kill you . " " You were not to blame ! " exclaimed the other , vehemently , holding up his hands . " You had to deal with a madman ! " " It is a strange train of chances has brought us together again ; it ought to be for some good end . I came here unawares , and , but for this ring , should not have known that we had met before . " " I lie under your suspicion on more accounts than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " I have assumed your uncle 's name , and the disposal of his property ; and I have concealed his death ; but you shall be satisfied on all points . The child , too , Gnulemah !  - -  I have kept her from sight and knowledge of the world , but not without reason and purpose , as you shall hear . Ah ! I am but a poor broken man , liable , as you have seen , to fits of madness and extravagance . You shall hear everything . And listen , as a witness that I shall speak truth , I will say my say before the face of Hiero Glyphic yonder , and upon the steps of his altar ! See , I desire neither to palliate nor falsify . Shall we go in ? " With some repugnance Helwyse followed the priestly figure through the low-browed door , He had seen too much of men to allow any instinctive aversion to influence him , in the absence of logical evidence . And this man 's words sounded fair ; his frank admission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from any question of personal danger , Balder felt ill at ease , like animals before a thunder-storm . As he sat down beside his companion on the steps of the black altar , and glanced up at the yellow visage that presided over it , he tried to quiet his mind in vain ; even the thought of Gnulemah yielded a vague anxiety ! XXVIII . BETROTHAL . The ring , which Balder had taken off with the intention of returning it to its owner , still remained between his thumb and finger ; and as he sat under the gloom of the altar , its excellent brilliancy caught his eye . He had never examined it minutely . It was pure as virtue , and possessed similar power to charm the dusky air into seven-hued beauty . A fountain of lustre continually welled up from its interior , like an exhaustless spring of wisdom . From amidst the strife of the little serpents it shone serenely forth , with , divine assurance of good ,  - -  eternal before the battle began , and immortal after it should cease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensuing interview he ever and anon renewed the draught . But the Egyptian seemed to address a silent invocation to the mummy . The anti-spiritual kind of immortality belonging to mummies may have been congenial to Manetho 's soul . Awful is that loneliness which even the prospect of death has deserted , and which must prolong itself throughout a lifeless and hopeless Forever ! If Manetho could imagine any bond of relationship between this perennial death's-head and himself , no marvel that he cherished it jealously . " You shall hear first about myself , " said the priest ; " yet , truly , I know not how to begin ! No mind can know another , nor even its own essential secrets . My time has been full of visions and unrealities . I am the victim of a thing which , for lack of a better name , I call myself ! " " Not a rare sickness , " remarked Balder . " A ghost no spell can lay ! It grasps the rudder , and steers towards gulfs the will abhors . A crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrecognizable . Not Manetho talked in the blackness of that night ; but a devil , to whom I listened shuddering , unable to control him ! " " The Reverend Manetho Glyphie , my cousin by adoption ,  - -  and sometimes a devil ! " muttered Balder , musingly . " I had forgotten him . " People are more prone to err in fancying themselves righteous , than the reverse ; nevertheless , the course and limits of self-deception are indefinite . It is within possibility for a man to believe himself wicked , while his actual conduct is ridiculously blameless , even praiseworthy ! Although intending to mislead Balder , Manetho 's utterances were true to a degree unsuspected by himself . He was more true than had he tried to be so , because truth lay too profound for his recognition ! " A shallower man , " he resumed , " would bear a grudge against the hand that clutched his throat ; but I own no relationship to the madman you chastised . And there are deep reasons why I must set your father 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father seldom spoke of you , and never as of an especial friend , " interposed the ingenuous Balder . " He knew not my feeling towards him , nor would he have comprehended it . It is a thing I myself can scarce understand . To the outward eye there is juster cause for hatred than for love . " I will speak openly to you what has hitherto lain between my heart and God . Before Thor saw your mother , I had loved her . My life 's hope was to marry her . Thor came ,  - -  and my hope lingered and died . For it , was no resurrection . " Here Manetho broke all at once into sobs , covering his face with his hands ; and when he continued , his voice was softened with tears . " Thor called her to him , and she gladly went . He stormed and carried with ease the fortress which , at best , I could hope only slowly to undermine . She loved him as women love a conqueror ; she might have yielded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept silence : to whom could I speak ? I had felt great ambitions , to become honored and famous , to preach the gospel as it had not yet been preached ,  - -  all ambitions that a lover may feel . But the tree died for lack of nourishment . See what is left ! " He opened out his arms with a gesture wanting neither in pathos nor dignity . Balder could not but sympathize with what he felt to be a genuine emotion . " Amidst the ruins of my Memphis , I kept silence . I hated -- myself ! for my powerlessness to keep her . In my hours of madness I hated her too , and him ; but that was madness indeed ! Deeper down was a sanity that loved him . Since he had made my love his , I must love him . So only might I still love her . The only beauty left my ruins was that ! " She died ; and with her would have died all sanity ,  - -  all love , but that her children kept me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to bind me to the good . Now Thor is dead , but still his son -- her son -- survives . Hence is it that you are more to me than other men . " " Did Doctor Glyphic know nothing of this ? " " I never told him of either my hope or my despair . My beloved master ! he lived and died without suspicion that I had striven to be a brother as well as son to him . " " When did he die ? " " Eighteen years ago , " said Manetho , solemnly . " You are the first to whom his death has been revealed . Beloved master ! have I not obeyed thy will ? " And he looked up to his master 's parchment visage . " I discovered his death for myself , you know , " observed Helwyse . " But it could not have been more than eighteen years since my father , then on the point of departure for Europe , saw Hiero Glyphic alive ! " " Yes , yes ! Did he ever tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly . " Little more than a farewell , I think . There was some talk about the estate . At my uncle 's death , the house was to come to you , the property to my father or his heirs . But neither expected at that time that it was to be their last meeting . " " Was no one mentioned beside Thor 's children and myself ? " asked the priest , looking askant at Balder as he spoke . " No my uncle neither had nor expected children , as far as I know ! " " Thor did not see her ,  - -  Gnulemah ? " " Gnulemah ?  - -  how should he have seen her ? " exclaimed Balder , in surprise . " Then her mystery remains ! " said Manetho , looking up . He had perhaps doubted whether any suspicion of who Gnulemah really was had found its way to the young man 's mind . The latter 's reception of his question reassured him . There could be no risk in catering to his aroused curiosity . The account Manetho now gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That day Thor came , I left the house early in the morning . It was night when I returned ; and Thor was gone . The house was dark , and at first there was no sound . But presently I heard the voice of a child , murmuring and babbling baby words . I passed through the outer hall and the conservatory , and came to where we now are . The lamp was burning as it has burned ever since . " I saw him lying on the altar steps ,  - -  lying so ! " Marrying act to word , the Egyptian slid down and lay prostrate at the altar 's foot . " He was dead and cold ! " he added ; and gave way to a shuddering outburst of grief . Balder 's nerves were a little staggered at this tale with its heightening of dramatic action and morbid circumstance ; and he was silent until the actor ( if such he were ) was in some degree repossessed of himself . Then he asked ,  --  " What of the child ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead body , bright and careless as the flame of the lamp . Whence she came she could not tell , nor had I seen her before that day . It seemed that , at the moment my master 's life burned out , hers flamed up ; and since that day it has lighted and warmed my solitude . " " And Doctor Glyphic --  " " I embalmed him ! " cried Manetho , clasping his hands in grotesque enthusiasm . " It was my privilege and my consolation to render his body immortal . In my grief I rejoiced at the opportunity of manifesting my devotion . Not the proudest of the Pharaohs was more sumptuously preserved than he ! In that labor of love there was no cunning secret of the art that I did not employ . Night and day I worked alone ; and while he lay in the long nitre bath , I watched or slept beside him . Then I enwound him thousand-fold in finest linen smeared with fragrant gum , and hid his beloved form in the coffin he had chosen long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burial ? " " He lived in hopes of it ! It was his wish that his body might be disposed as became his name , and the passion that had ruled his life . Me only did he deem worthy of the task , and equal to it . Had I died before him , his fairest hope would have been blighted , his life a failure ! " " A dead failure , truly ! " muttered Balder , impelled by the very grewsomeness of the subject to jest about it . " Was his loftiest aspiration to mummy and be mummied ?  - -  But yours was a dangerous office to fulfil , Cousin Manetho . Had the death got abroad , you might have been suspected of foul play ! " " The cause was worth the risk , " replied the other , sententiously . Helwyse shot a keen look at his companion , but could discern in him none of the common symptoms of guilt . The priest , however , was a mine of sunless riddles , one lode connecting with another ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man recurred to that vein which was of most immediate interest to himself . " Have you no knowledge concerns Gnulemah 's origin ? " he inquired . Manetho laid his long brown hand on Balder 's arm . " If she be not Gnulemah , daughter of fire , it must rest with you to give her another name , " said he . " I care not who was her father or her mother , " rejoined the lover , after a short silence ; " Gnulemah is herself ! " The lithe fingers on his arm clutched it hard for a moment , and Manetho averted his face . When he turned again , his features seemed to express exultation , mingled with a sinister flavor of some darker emotion . " Son of Thor , you have your father 's frankness . Do you love her ? " " You saw that I loved her , " returned Balder , his black eyes kindling somewhat intolerantly . " If I can hasten by one hour the consummation of that love , my life will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken ! " exclaimed Helwyse , heartily ; and , opening his strong white hand , he took the narrow brown one into its grasp . He had not been prepared for so friendly a profession . " When I have seen your soul tied to hers in a knot that even death may not loosen ,  - -  and if it be permitted me to tie the knot , I shall have drained the cup of earthly happiness ! " He spoke with a deliberate intensity not altogether pleasant to the ear . He would not relinquish Balder 's hand , as he continued in his high-strung vein ,  --  " I know at last for whom my flower has bloomed . Through the world , across seas , by strange accidents has Providence brought you safe to this spot ; and has made you what you are , and her incomparable among women.  - -  You love her with heart and soul , Balder Helwyse ? " " So that the world seems frail ; and I -- except for my love -- insignificant ! " In the sudden emphasis of his question , Manetho had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before giving his reply . As he spoke the words strongly forth , his swarthy companion seemed to catch them in the air , and breathe them in . Slowly an expression of joy , that could hardly be called a smile , welled forth from his long eyes , and forced its way , with dark persistency of glee , through all his face . " By you only in the world would I have her loved ! " he said ; and repeated it more than once . He remained a full minute leaning with one arm on the altar , his eyes abstracted . Then he said abruptly ,  --  " Why not be married soon ? " The lover looked up questioningly , a deep throb in his heart . " Soon -- soon ! " reiterated Manetho . " Love is a thing of moments more than of years . I know it ! Do you stand idle while Gnulemah awaits you ? We may die to-morrow ! " " I have no right to hurry her , " said Helwyse in a low voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to-morrow --  " " To-morrow ! why not to-day ? Why wait ? that she may learn the falsehoods of society ,  - -  to flirt , dress , gossip , crave flattery ? Why do you hesitate ? Speak out , son of Thor ! " " I have spoken . Do you doubt me ? Were it possible , she should be my wife this hour ! " " Oh ! " murmured Manetho , the incisiveness of his manner melting away as suddenly as it came ; " now have you proved your love . You shall be made one , one !  - -  to- day . Four-and-twenty years ago this day , I married your parents on this very spot . The anniversary shall become a double one ! " The black eye-sockets of the mummy stared Balder in the face . But at a touch from Manetho , he turned , and saw Gnulemah , bright with beautiful enchantment , in the doorway . " Yes , to-day ! " he said impetuously . " You shall wed her with that ring ! " whispered the victorious tempter in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is ! I will call you soon . " The lover went , and the woman , coming forward , sweetly met him half-way . But glancing back again before passing out , Balder saw that the priest had vanished ; and the lamp , flickering above the mummy 's dry features , wrought them into a shadowy semblance of emotion . XXIX . A CHAMBER OF THE HEART . Manetho neither sank through the granite floor , nor ascended in the smoke of the lamp . He unlocked a door ( to the panels of which the clock was affixed , and which it concealed ) and let himself into his private study , a room scarce seven feet wide , though corresponding in length and height with the dimensions of the outer temple . Books and papers were kept here , and such other things of a private or valuable nature as Manetho wished should be inaccessible to outsiders . Against the wall opposite the door stood a heavy mahogany table ; beside it , a deep-bottomed chair , in which the priest now sat down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The walls were full twenty feet high ; and at a distance of some sixteen feet from the floor , a series of low horizontal apertures pierced the masonry , allowing the light of heaven to penetrate in an embarrassed manner , and hesitatingly to reveal the interior . Viewed from without , these narrow slits would be mistaken for mere architectural indentations . To the inhabitant they were of more importance , contracted though they were ; and albeit one could not look out of them , they served as ventilators , and to distinguish between fine and cloudy weather . In his earlier and more active days , Manetho had lived and worked throughout the whole extent of this study , and it had been kept clean and orderly to its remotest corner . But as years passed , and the range of his sympathies and activities narrowed , the ends of the room had gradually fallen into dusty neglect , till at length only the small space about the chair and table was left clear and available . The rest was impeded by books , instruments of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their ever-broadening estates from father to child , through innumerable Araneidaean generations . A gray uniformity had thus come to overspread everything ; and with the exceptions of a cracked celestial globe , and the end of a worm-eaten old ladder , there was nothing to catch the attention . Here might the Egyptian indulge himself in whatever extravagances of word or act he chose , secure from sight or hearing ; and here had he spent many an hour in such solitary exercises as no sane mind can conceive . To him the room was thick with associations . Here had he pursued his studies , or helped the Doctor in his erratic experiments and research ; here , with Helen in his thoughts , he had shaped out a career , not all of Christian humility and charity , perhaps , but at least unstained by positive sin , and not unmindful of domestic happiness . Here , again , had Salome visited him , bringing discord and delight in equal parts ; for at times , with the strong heat of youth , he had vowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodless counsels of worldly power and welfare banished her with a curse for having crossed his path . Head and heart were always at war in Manetho . The talismanic diamond flashed or waned , and fiercely wriggled the little fighting serpents . At length Thor Helwyse 's gauntlet was thrown into the ring ; and peace -- if still present to outward seeming -- abode not in the feverish soul of the Egyptian . But it was his nature to dissemble . In this room he had often outwatched the night , chewing the cud of his wrongs , invoking vengeance upon the thwarter of his hopes , and swearing through his teeth to even the balance between them . The black serpent held the golden one helpless in his coils . The obtuse Doctor , blundering in at morning , would find his adopted son with pallid cheeks and glittering eyes , but ever ready with a smile and pleasant greeting , obedience and help . Hiero Glyphic , however wayward and cross-grained , never had cause to censure this creature of his , to remind him that he might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaw . Even Helen , whose fancy had played with him at first , but who in time had indolently yielded to the fascination exerted over her , and even gone so far as to permit his adulation , and accept in the ring the mystic pledge thereof ( during all the countless ages of its experience it had never touched woman 's hand before ) ,  - -  even she , when her lazy heart and overbearing spirit were at length aroused and quelled by the voice rather of a master than suitor , was deceived by forsaken Manetho 's unruffled face , gentle voice , and downcast eyes . She told herself that his love had never dared be warmer than a kind of worship , like that of a pagan for his idol , apart from human passion ; such , at all events , had been her understanding of his attentions . As to the ring , it had been tendered as an offering at the shrine of abstract womanhood ; to return it too soon would imply a supposition of more personal sentiment . Neither must Thor see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate her fine-drawn distinction . So she concealed it in her bosom , and Manetho 's serpents were ever between Thor and his wife 's heart . She was false both to husband and lover . Great Thor , meanwhile , pitied the slender Egyptian , and in a kindly way despised him , with his supple manners , quiet words , and religious studies . To the young priest 's timid yet earnest request for permission to pronounce the marriage-service of him and his bride , Thor assented with gruff heartiness . " Marry us ? Of course ! marry us as fast as you can , if it gives you any pleasure , my friend of the crocodile . A good beginning for your ministerial career ,  - -  marrying a couple who love each other as much as Nell and I do . Eh , Nellie ? " The ceremony over , Manetho had retired to his study , and there passed the night ,  - -  their marriage-night ! What words and tones , what twistings of face and body , did those passionless walls see and hear ? How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work his will for one day ! And as the cool , still morning sheared the lustre from his lamp-flame , how desolate he felt , with his hatred and despair and blaspheming rage ! Evil passions are but poor company , in the early morning . But was not Salome left him ? The only sincerely tender words he had ever spoken to woman had been said to her : his humblest and happiest thoughts had been born of their early acquaintance ,  - -  before he had raised his eyes to the proud and languid mistress . Yet on her only did the evil passions of Manetho wreak themselves in harm and wrong ; her only , on a later day , did he dastardly strike down . Poor Salome had given him her heart . These walls had seen their meetings . Years afterwards , Manetho had here embalmed his foster-father : through long hours had he labored at his hateful task , with curious zest and conscientiousness . As regarded the strange place of sepulture , the Egyptian had perhaps imagined a symbolic fitness in enclosing his human immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hiero Glyphic 's death and burial , however , must ever brood a cloud of mystery . Undoubtedly Manetho loved the man ,  - -  but death was not always the worst of ills in Manetho 's philosophy . The clock had been affixed to the study door both as an additional concealment , and possibly as a congenial sentry over the interior associations . Since then the place had become the clergyman 's almost daily resort . Pacing the contracted floor , sitting moodily in the chair , many a brooding hour had gone over his barrenly busy head , and written its darkening record in his book of life . Here had been schemed that plan of revenge , whose insanity the insane schemer could not perceive . Nor could he understand that mightier powers than he could master worked against him , and even used his efforts to bring forth contrary results . But not all hours had passed so . Spaces there had been wherein evil counsels had retired to a cloudy background , athwart which had brightened a rainbow , intangible , whose source was hidden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and aerial beauty of sunshine lightened through the rain ,  - -  the pleasing loveliness of essential life was projected on the gloom of evil imaginations . For Manetho 's actual deeds were apt to be prompted by far gentler influences than governed his theories . The man was better than his mind : and goodness , perhaps , bears an absolute blessing ; insomuch that the sinner , doing ignorant good , yet feels the benefit thereof ; just as the rain , however dismal , can not prevent the sun from making rainbows out of it . On this particular morning Manetho sank into his deep-seated chair , and was quite still . A great part of what had hitherto made his daily life ended here . The activity of existence was over for him . Thought , feeling , hope , could live hereafter only as phantoms of memory . But to look back on evil done is not so pleasant as to plan it ; the dead body of a foe moves us in another way than his living hostile person . When , therefore , Manetho should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have little to look forward to . That one moment of triumph must repay , both for what had been and was to come . To-day of all his days , then , must each sense and faculty be in exquisite condition . Unseasonably enough , however , he found himself in a perversely dull and callous state . Could Providence so cajole him as to mar the only joyful hour of his life ! Then better off than he were savages , who could destroy their recusant idols . But nothing short of spiritual suicide would have destroyed the idol of Manetho ! He was wearing to-day the same priestly robe which he had put on when , for the first and last time , he performed a ministerial duty . In this robe had he married Helen to Thor . Itself a precious relic of antiquity , it had once dignified the shoulders of a contemporary of Manetho 's remotest ancestors . Old Hiero Glyphic had counted it amongst his chiefest treasures ; and on his sister 's wedding-day had produced it from its repository , insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume . Since then it had lain untouched till to-day . Manetho brooded over the dim magnificence of its folds , sitting amidst the cobwebbed rubbish , a narrow glint of sunshine creeping slope-downwards from the crevice above his head . He smoothed the fabric abstractedly with his hand , recalling the thoughts and scenes of four-and-twenty years ago . " I joined them in the holy bonds of matrimony ,  - -  read over them that service , those sacred words heavy with solemn benediction . Rich , smooth , softly modulated was my voice , missing not one just emphasis or melodious intonation . Ah ! had they seen my soul . But my eyes were half closed like the crocodile 's , yet never losing sight of the two I was uniting in sight of God and man . The Devil too was there . He turned the blessings my lips uttered into blighting curses , that fell on the happy couple like pestilential rain ! " Laughable ! Covered head to foot with curses , and felt them not ! All was smiles , blushes , happiness , forward-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; I uplifted my hands and invoked the last blessing ,  - -  the final curse ! My heart burned , and the smoke of its fire enveloped bride and groom , fouling his yellow beard , and smirching her silvery veil ; shutting out heaven from their prayers , and blackening their path before them . They neither felt nor knew . They kissed ,  - -  I saw their lips meet , as Balder and Gnulemah to-day . Then I covered my face and seemed to be in prayer ! " Gnulemah ,  - -  I hate her ! yes , but hatred sometimes touches the heart like love . I love her ! to marry her ? Woe to him who becomes her husband ! As a daughter ?  - -  no daughter is she of mine !  - -  I hate her , then . " Why am I childless ?  - -  how would I have loved a child ! I would have left all else to love my child ! I would have been the one father in the world ! My life should have been full of love as it has been of hate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter ? " Men 's ears have grown deaf to any save the most commonplace oracles . But there is ever a warning voice for who will listen . One may object that its language is unknown , or its whisper inaudible ; but to the question , " Whence your ignorance and deafness ? " what shall be the answer ? In Manetho 's case it appears to have been the venerable robe that took on itself the task of remonstrance . " You are unreasonable , friend , " it interposed with a gentle rustle . " Gnulemah , if not your daughter , might , however , have stood you in place of one ; and she would have done you just as much good , in the way of softening and elevating your nature , as though she had been the issue of your own loins . You have turned the milk and honey of your life into gall and wormwood ; and I wish I could feel sure that only you would get the benefit of it ! " The reproof had as well been spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a word of it . His reverie rambled on . " Keen ,  - -  that Balder ! he half suspects me . Had I not so hurried him to a conclusion , he would have questioned me too closely . He shall know all presently , even as I promised him ! shall hear a sounder guess at Gnulemah 's genealogy than was made to-day . " Do I love her ?  - -  only as the means to my end ! The end once gained , I shall hate her as I do him . But not yet ,  - -  and therefore must I love him as well as her . They shall be , to-day , my beloved children ! To-morrow ,  - -  how shall I endure till to-morrow ,  - -  all the night through ? O Gnulemah !  --  " They love each other well ,  - -  seem made to make each other happy ; yet have they come together from the ends of the earth to be each other 's curse ! Only if I keep silence might it be otherwise , for love might tame the devil that I have bred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  Am I mad ? " He straightened himself in his chair , and glanced up towards the crevice whence slanted the dusty sunshine . The old robe took the opportunity to deliver its final warning . " Not yet mad beyond remedy , Manetho ; but you look up too seldom at the sunshine , and brood too often over your own dusty depths . You have had no consciously unselfish thought during the last quarter of a century . You eat , drink , and breathe only Manetho ! This room is yours , because it is fullest of rubbish , and least looks out upon the glorious universe . Break down your walls ! take broom in hand without delay ! Proclaim at once the crime you meditate . Go ! there is still sunshine in this dust-hole of yours , and more of heaven in every man than he himself dreams of . The sun is passing to the other side . Go while it shines ! " But Manetho 's dull ears heard not ; and the aged garment of truth spoke no more . XXX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all imagination at our service , we should have to confine our excursions within so narrow a domain as this of Hiero Glyphic 's . One tires of the best society , uncondimented with an occasional foreign relish , even of doubtful digestibility . Barring this , it only remains to relieve somewhat the monotony of our food , by variety in the modes of dishing it up . Balder had been no whit disconcerted at the priest 's abrupt evanishment . The divine sphere of Gnulemah had touched him with its sweet magnetism , and he was sensible of little beyond it . Their hands greeted like life-long friends . Drawing hers within his arm , he still kept hold of it , and her rounded shoulder softly pressed his , as they loitered out between the impenetrable sphinxes . The conservatory , however beautiful in itself and by association , was too small to hold their hearts at this moment . They passed on , and through the columns of the Moorish portico , into the fervent noon sunshine . Grasshoppers chirped ; fine buzzing flies darted swift circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swinging among swaying boughs . Battalions of vast green trees stood grand in shadow-lakes of cooler green , their myriad leaves twinkling light and dark . Tender gleams of river topped the enamelled bank ,  - -  the further shore a slumbering El Dorado . The trees in the distant orchard wore bridal veils , and even Gnulemah 's breath was not much sweeter than theirs ! Emerging arm in arm on the enchanted lawn the lovers turned southwards up the winding avenue . The fragrance , the light and warmth , the bird and insect voices , imperfectly expressed their own heart-happiness . The living turf softly pressed up their feet . This was the fortunate hour that comes not twice . Happy those to whom it comes at all ! To live was such full bliss , every new movement overflowed the cup . Joy was it to look on earth and sky ; but to behold each other was heaven ! More life in a moment such as this , than in twenty years of scheming more successful than Manetho 's . They followed the same path Helen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old bench . Shadow and sunshine wrestled playfully over it , while the green blood of the leaves overhead glowed vividly against the blue . Around the bench the grass grew taller , as on a grave ; and crisp lichens , gray and brown , overspread its surface . Man had neglected it so long that Nature , overcoming her diffidence towards his handiwork , had at length claimed it for her own . The glade was full of great golden dandelions , whose soft yellow crowns were almost too heavy for the slender necks . The prince and princess of the fairy-tale paused here , recognizing the spot as the most beautiful on earth ,  - -  albeit only since their love 's arrival . They seated themselves not on the bench , but on the yet more primitive grass beside it . They had not spoken as yet . Balder plucked some dandelions , and proceeded to twist them into a chain ; and Gnulemah , after watching him for a while followed his example . " You and I have sat on the grass and woven such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When was it ? " " I have n't done such a thing since I was a child not much taller than a dandelion , " returned Balder . He was not ethereal enough to follow Gnulemah in her apparently fanciful flight , else might he have lighted on a discovery to which all the good sense and logic in the world would not have brought him . " Yes ; we have made these chains before ! " reiterated Gnulemah , looking at her companion in a preoccupied manner . " They were to have chained us together forever . " " We should have made them of stronger stuff then . But which of us broke the chain ? " " They took us away from each other , and it was never finished . Do you remember nothing ? " " The present is enough for me , " said her lover ; and he finished his necklace with a handsome clasp of blossoms , and threw it over her neck . She gave a low sigh of satisfaction . " I have been waiting for it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus adorned by each other 's hands , their love seemed greater than before , and they laughed from pure delight . Their bonds looked fragile ; yet it would need a stronger wrench to part them than had they been cables of iron or gold , unsustained by the subtile might of love . " Let us link them together , " proposed Balder ; and , loosening a link of his chain , he reunited it inside Gnulemah 's . " We must keep together , " he continued with a smile , " or the marriage-bonds will break . " " Is this marriage , Balder ? to be tied together with flowers ? " " One part of marriage . It shows the world that we belong only to each other . " " How could they help knowing that , for to whom else could we belong ? besides , why should they know ? " " Because , " answered Balder after some consideration , " the world is made in such a way , that unless we record all we do by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No no , " protested Gnulemah , earnestly . " Only God should know how we love . Must the world know our words and thoughts , and how we have sat beneath these trees ?  - -  Then let us not be married ! " They were leaning side to side against the bench , along whose edge Balder had stretched an arm to cushion Gnulemah 's head . As he turned to look at her , a dash of sunlight was quivering on her clear smooth cheek , and another ventured to nestle warmly below the head of the guardian serpent on her bosom , for Gnulemah and the sun had been lovers long before Balder 's appearance . Where breathed such another woman ? From the low turban that pressed her hair to the bright sandals on her fine bronze feet , there was no fault , save her very uniqueness . She belonged not to this era , but to the Golden Age , past or to come . Could she ever be conformed to the world of to-day ? Dared her lover assume the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little pleasures , and low aims of this imperfect age ? Could he change the world to suit her needs ? or endure to see her change to suit the world ? Moreover , changing so much , might she not change towards him ? The Balder she loved was a grander man than any Balder knew . Might she not learn to abhor the hand which should unveil to her the Gorgon features of fallen humanity ?  - -  Much has man lost in losing Paradise ! Contemplating Gnulemah 's entrance into the outer world , Manetho had anticipated her ruin from the flowering of the evil seed which he believed himself to have planted in her . Might not the same result issue from a precisely opposite cause ? The Arcadian fashion in which the lovers ' passion had ripened must soon change forever . It was perilous to advance , but to retreat was impossible . Balder was at bay ; had he loved Gnulemah less , he would have regretted Charon 's ferry-boat . But his love was greater for the danger and difficulty wherewith it was fraught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might improve himself . " If I could but shut her glorious eyes to all the shabby littleness they will have to see , we might hazard the rest , " he sighed to himself . " If the pure visions of her maiden years might veil from her those gross realities of every-day life ! With what face shall I meet her glance after it has suffered the first shock ? " Meanwhile her last objection remained unanswered , and Balder , distrustful of his capacity , was inspired to seek inspiration from her he would instruct . " Tell me how you love me , Gnulemah , " said he . She roused herself , and bending her face to his , breathlessly kissed his lips . Then she drooped her warm cheek on his shoulder , and whispered the rest :  --  " My love is to be near you , and to breathe when breathe ; it is love to become you , as water becomes wave . And love would make me sweet to you , as honey and music and flowers . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink and sleep ; and my love will be loved , as God loves the world . " To the lover these sentences were tender and sublime poetry . The tears came to his eyes , hearing her speak out her loving soul so simply . He had travelled through the world , while she had lived her life between a wall and a precipice . But not the noisy , gaudy , gloomy crust which is fresh to-day , and to-morrow hardens , and the next day crumbles , is the world ; but the fire-globe within : and Gnulemah was nearer that fire than Balder . There was puissance in her simplicity ,  - -  in her ignorance of that crust which he had so widely studied . Her knowledge was more profound than his , for she had never learned to stultify it with reasons . " It is true ,  - -  God only can know our love , " said Balder , and , having said it , he felt his mind clear and strengthen . For it is the acknowledgment of God that lends the deepest seeing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Balder , at this moment of mingled love , humility , and fear , made and confessed that supreme discovery.  --  " Only He knows what our love is , but the marriage-rite informs the world that He knows it . " " But why must the world know ? " persisted Gnulemah , still seeming to shrink at the idea . " Because it is wholesome for all men to know that we have made God party to our union . That our love may be pure and immortal , we must look through each other to Him ; the acknowledgment will keep others as well as ourselves from misusing love 's happiness . " " Then , after we have knelt together before Him , we shall be no longer two , but one ! " Gnulemah spoke , after some pause , in a full tone of joy ; yet her voice shrank at the last , from the feeling that she had penetrated all at once to a holy place . A delicious fear seized her , and she clung to her lover so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said . Their confidence was in each other ; with Balder at her side , Gnulemah was fearful of the world no longer . But her visions were all spiritual ; even the kisses on her lips were to her a sacred miracle ! Love makes children of men and women ,  - -  shows them the wisdom of unreason and the value of soap-bubbles . These lovers must meet the world , but the light and freshness of the Golden Age should accompany them . The man held the maiden 's hand , and so faced the future with a smile . Few as were the hours since they first had seen each other , it seemed as though they could hardly know each other better ; then why put off the consummation a single hour ? Manetho had been right , and Balder marvelled at having required the spur . He knew of no material hindrances ; unlimited resources would be his , and these would render easier Gnulemah 's introduction to society . Perhaps ( for doubtless Manetho would desire it ) they might begin housekeeping in this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to life 's realities ,  - -  vulgarly so called ! At this moment , Balder 's respect for wealth was many fold greater than ever it had been before . It should be the sword and shield wherewith he would protect the woman of his heart . Gnulemah was not of the kind who need the discipline of poverty ; her beauty and goodness would be best nurtured beneath an affluent sun . Wants and inconveniences would rather pain and mystify than educate her . How good was that God who had vouchsafed not only the blessing , but the means of enjoying it ! God gave Balder Helwyse opportunity to prove the soundness of his faith . Labor and poverty awaited him ; what else and worse let time show . In anguish , fear , and humiliation had his love been born , but the birth-pangs had been as brief as they were intense . A brave soul 's metal is more severely tried by crawling years of monotonous effort , discord of must with wish , and secret self-suppression and misgiving . Happily life is so ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor is any sunshine worth having that shines only from without . Balder 's eyes were softer than their wont , and there was a tender and sweet expression about his mouth . Never had life been so inestimable a blessing ,  - -  never had nature looked so divinely alive . He could imagine nothing gloomy or forbidding ; in darkness 's self he would have found germs of light . His love was a panoply against ill of mind or body . He thought he perceived , once for all , the insanity of selfishness and sin . Suddenly he was conscious through Gnulemah of the same shiver that had visited her in the conservatory that morning . Looking round , he was startled to see , beyond the near benison of her sumptuous face , the tall form of the Egyptian priest . He was not a dozen yards away , advancing slowly towards them . Balder sprang up . " Our chain , you have broken it ! " exclaimed Gnulemah . It was only a flower chain , but flowers are the bloom and luxury of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children ! " said he . " This chain would soon have faded and fallen apart of itself , but the chain I will forge you is stronger than time and weightier than dandelions . Come ! " Gnulemah picked up the broken links , and they followed him to the house . XXXI . MARRIED . The significant part of most life histories is the record of a few detached hours , the rest being consequence and preparation . Helwyse had lived in constant mental and physical activity from childhood up ; but though he had speculated much , and ever sought to prove the truth by practice , yet he had failed to create adequate emergencies , and was like an untried sword , polished and keen , but lacking still the one stern proof of use . Thus , although a man of the world , in a deeper sense he was untouched by it . He had been the sentimental spectator of a drama wherein some shadow of himself seemed to act . The mimic scenes had sometimes moved him to laughter or to tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreality under all . The best end had been -- in a large sense -- beauty . Beauty of love , of goodness , of strength , of wisdom ,  - -  beauty of every kind and degree , but nothing better ! Beauty was the end rather than the trait of all desirable things . To have power was beautiful , and beautiful was the death that opened the way to freer and wider power . Most beautiful was Almightiness ; yet , lapsing thence , it was beautiful to begin the round again in fresh , new forms . This kind of spider-webs can not outlast the suns and snows . Personal passion disgusts one with brain-spun systems of the universe , and may even lead to a mistrust of mathematics ! One feels the overwhelming power of other than intellectual interests ; and discovers in himself a hitherto unsuspected universe , profound as the mystery of God , where the cockle-shell of mental attainments is lost like an asteroid in the abyss of space . What is the mind ?  - -  A little window , through which to gaze out upon the vast heart-world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean and enlarge day by day ; but , too often , the deep view beyond is mistaken for a picture painted on the glass and limited by its sash ! Let the window by all means expand till the darksome house be transformed to a crystal palace ! but shall homage be paid the crystal ? Of what value were its transparency , had God not built the heavens and the earth ?  --  Though Helwyse had failed to touch the core of life , and to recognize the awful truth of its mysteries , he had not been conscious of failure . On the contrary he had become disposed to the belief that he was a being apart from the mass of men and above them : one who could see round and through human plans and passions ; could even be separate from himself , and yield to folly with one hand , while the other jotted down the moral of the spectacle . He was calm in the conviction that he could measure and calculate the universe , and draw its plan in his commonplace book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but attainable condition . He matched finity against the Infinite , and thereby cast away man 's dearest hope ,  - -  that of eternal progress towards the image of Divine perfection . Once , however , the bow had smitten his heart-strings with a new result of sound , awakening fresh ideas of harmony . When Thor was swept to death by that Baltic wave , Balder leapt after him , hopeless to save , but without demur ! The sea hurled him back alone . For many a month thereafter , strange lights and shadows flashed or gloomed across his sky , and sounds from unknown abysses disquieted him . But all was not quite enough ; perhaps he was hewn from too stanch materials lightly to change . Yet the sudden shock of his loss left its mark : the props of self-confidence were a little unsettled ; and the events whose course we have traced were therefore able to shake them down . For Destiny rained her sharpest blows on Balder Helwyse all at once , and the attack marks the turning-point of his life . She chose her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarser and shallower nature would have slighted . He sustained the onslaught for the most part with outward composure ,  - -  but bleeding inwardly . His had been a vast egoism , rooted in his nature and trained by his philosophy . It must die , if at all , violently , painfully , and -- in silence . The truer and more constant the soul , the more complete the destruction of its idol . Character is not always the slow growth of years : often do the elements mingle long in formless solution ; some sudden jar causes them to spring at once to the definite crystal . There had , hitherto , been a kind of impersonality about Balder , having its ultimate ground in his blindness to the immutable unity of God . But so soon as his eye became single , he stood pronounced in his individuality , less broadly indifferent than of yore , but organized and firm . In this inert world the body pursues but imperfectly the processes of the soul . These three days had made small change in Helwyse 's face . His expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as more joyful . The humorous indifference had given place to a kindlier humanity . Gone was the glance half satiric , half sympathetic ; but in its stead was something warmer and more earnest . For the charity of scepticism was substituted a sentiment less broad , but deeper and truer . It would need an insight supernaturally keen to detect thus early these alterations in the page of Balder 's countenance ; but their germs are there , to develop afterwards . During this pause in our narrative , Helwyse was sitting at his chamber window , awaiting the summons to the ceremony . The afternoon was far advanced , and the landscape lay breathless beneath the golden burden of the lavish sun . The bridegroom rose to his feet ; surely the bride must be ready ! Was that strange old Nurse delaying her ? Did she herself procrastinate ? Balder was waxing impatient ! The clear outcry of the hoopoe startled the calm air , and that good little messenger came fluttering in haste to the window . Bound its neck was twined a golden dandelion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bright little eye , the bird submitted to being robbed of its decoration ; then warbled a keen good-by , and flew away . The lover behaved as foolishly towards the dandelion as a lover should . At last he drew the stem through the button-hole of his velveteen jacket , and was ready to answer in person the shy invitation it conveyed . The bride waited ! His hand was on the latch , when some one knocked . He threw open the door ,  - -  and had to look twice before recognizing Nurse . Her dingy anomalous drapery had been exchanged for another sort of costume . Her scars strove to be hidden beneath the yellow lace and crumpled feathers of an antique head-dress . She wore a satin gown of an old fashion , whose pristine whiteness was much impaired by time . An aged fan , ragged , but of tasteful pattern , dangled at her wrist . She resembled some forgotten Ginevra , reappearing after an age 's seclusion in the oaken chest . Her aspect was painfully repellent , the more for this pathetic attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fitness to the blasted features ; but so soon as she forsook that uncanny harmony and tried to be like other women , she became undesirably conspicuous . " The bridesmaid ! " came to Balder 's lips ,  - -  but did not pass them . He would not hurt the poor creature 's feelings by the betrayal of surprise or amusement . She was a woman ,  - -  and Gnulemah was no more . According to his love for his wife , must he be tender and gentle towards her sex . When , therefore , Nurse gave him to understand that she was to marshal him to the altar , Balder , never more heroic than at that moment , offered her his arm , which she accepted with an air of scarecrow gentility . Either the change of costume had struck in , or it was the symbol of inward change . She seemed struggling against her torpor , her dimness and deadness . She tried , perhaps , to recall the day when that dress was first put on ,  - -  the day of Helen 's marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  when she hoped before many weeks to stand at an altar on her own account.  - -  Not yet , Salome , nor in this world . Perchance not in another ; for they who maim their earthly lives may not enjoy in heaven the happiness whose seed was not planted here . The injury is justly irreparable ; else had angels been immediately created . But Salome was practising deception on herself . Airs and graces which might have suited a coquettish lady's-maid , but were in her a ghastly absurdity , did she revive and perpetrate . Struggling to repress the ugly truth , she was in continual dread of exposure . Fain would she dream for an hour of youth and beauty , knowing , yet veiling the knowledge , that it was a dream . Divining her desire , Balder helped out the masquerade as best he might . She was thankfully aware of his kindness , yet shunned acknowledgment , as a too bare betrayal of the cause of thanks . As they passed a cracked cheval-glass in an intervening room , the bridesmaid stole a glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisk to the train of her gown . Helwyse , whom , three days before , this behavior would simply have amused , felt only pitying sympathy to-day . Gnulemah was always before him , and charmed his eyes and thoughts even to the hag on his arm . He brought himself to address courteous and pleasant remarks to his companion , and to meet unwincingly her one-eyed glance ; and was as gallant as though her pretence had been truth . On entering the conservatory , Nurse seemed as much agitated as though she , instead of Gnulemah , were to be chief actress in the coming ceremony . At the Sphinx door she relinquished Balder 's arm , and , hurrying across the conservatory , vanished behind Gnulemah 's curtain . As she passed out of sight she threw a parting glance over her shoulder . The action recalled Gnulemah 's backward look of the day previous , when she had fled at the sound of the closing door . What ugly fatality suggested so fantastic a parallel between this creature and Balder 's future wife ! He entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem . Many-colored lamps were hung on wires passing round the hall from pillar to massive pillar . Their glare defined the strange character of the Egyptian architecture and ornament ; nevertheless , the place looked less real and substantial than in the morning . It seemed the impalpable creation of an enchanter , which his wand would anon dissolve into air once more ! On each side the door sat a statue of polished red granite , with calm regular face and hands on knees . Helwyse , who had not observed them before , fancied them summoned as witnesses to the compact then to be solemnized . Doubtless they had witnessed ceremonies not less solemn or imposing . On the black marble altar at the further end of the hall was burning some rich incense , whose perfumed smoke , clambering heavily upwards , mingled with that of the lamps beneath the ceiling . On the polished floor , in front , lay a rug of dark blue cloth , heavily bordered with gold ; upon it were represented in conscientious profile a number of lank-limbed Egyptians performing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priest Manetho , apparently engaged in prayer . Balder spoke to him . " This is more like a tomb than a wedding hall . Would not the conservatory have been more fitting ? " " Better make a tomb the starting-point of marriage than its goal ! " smiled the holy man . " And is it not well that your posterity should begin from the spot which saw the union that gave you being ? and beneath the eyes of him but for whom neither this hall nor we who here assemble would to-day have existed ! " He pointed to the mummy of old Hiero Glyphic , the aspect of which might have left a bad taste in the mouth of Joy herself . Balder shrugged his shoulders . " It matters little , perhaps , where the seed is sown , so that the flower reach the sunshine at last . But your mummy is an ill-favored wedding-guest , whatever honor we may owe the man who once lived in it . I would , not have Gnulemah --  " " Behold her ! " interrupted Manetho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in his throat . Yes , there she came , the old Nurse following her like a misshapen shadow . Daughter of sun and moon ,  - -  a modern Pandora endowed with the strength of a loftier nature ! She was robed in creamy white ; her pendants were woven pearls . Fine lines of virgin gold gleamed in her turban , and through her long veil , and along the folds of her girdle . But the serpent necklace had been replaced by the dandelion chain that Balder had made her . Her lips and cheeks were daintily aflame , and a tender fire flickered in her eyes , which saw only Balder . She was a bridal song such as had not been sung since Solomon . As the two reached the altar , Salome stepped to one side , and Manetho 's eye fell upon her ; for a moment his gaze fixed , while a slight movement undulated through his body , as the wave travels along the cord . The old white dress , unseen for five-and-twenty years ; some intangible trick of motion or attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such near similarity , these and perhaps other trifles combined to recall long-vanished Salome . She had stood at that other wedding , just where Nurse was now ,  - -  bright , shapely , sparkling-eyed , full of love for him . What a grisly contrast was this !  - -  Why had he thrown away that ardent , loving heart ? How sweet and comfortable might life have been to-day , with Salome his wife , and sons and daughters at her side ,  - -  daughters beautiful as Gnulemah , sons tall as Balder ! But Hatred had been his chosen mistress , and dismal was the progeny begotten on her ! The pregnant existence that might have been his , and the scars and barrenness which had actually redounded to him , were symbolized in the remembered Salome and her of to-day . The brief reminiscence passed , leaving Manetho face to face with his sacred duty . With the warning of the past in his ears and that of the future before his eyes , did he step unrelenting across the threshold of his crime ? At all events he neither hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and his tones and manner were heavy and mechanical ; as though the Devil ( having brought him thus far with his own consent and knowledge ) had now to compel a frozen soul in a senseless body ! The service began , none the less hallowed for the lovers , because for Manetho it was the solemn perversion of a sacred ceremony . His voice labored through the perfumed air , and recoiled in broken echoes from gloomy corners and deep-tinted walls . The encircling lamps glowed in serried lines of various light ; the fantastic incense-flame rustled softly on the altar . The four figures seemed a group of phantoms ,  - -  a momentary rich illusion of the eye . And save for their viewless souls , what were they more ? Earth is a phantom ; but what we can not grasp is real and remains !  --  The rite was over , the diamond gleamed from Gnulemah 's finger , and the priest with uplifted hands had bade man not part whom God had united . Husband and wife gazed at each other with freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some change , and anew delighted at finding more of themselves than ever ! Male and female pervades the universe , and marriage is the end and fulfilment of creation . God has builded the world of love and wisdom , woman and man ; truly to live they must unite , she yielding herself to his form , he moulding himself of her substance . As love unquickened by wisdom is barren , and knowledge impotent unkindled by affection , so are the unmarried lifeless . Ill and bitter was it , therefore , for Manetho and Salome , after the married ones had departed , taking their happiness with them . The priest 's , eyes were dry and dull , as he leaned wearily against the smoking altar . " You did not speak ! " he said to the woman ; " you saw her betrayed to ruin and pollution , and spoke not to save her !  - -  Dumb ? the dead might have moved their tongues in such need as this ! She will abhor and curse me forever ! may you share her curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowered and trembled in her satin dress , beneath the burden of that heavy anathema . She had risen that day determined to reveal the secret of her life before night . She had been awaiting a favorable moment , but opportunity or decision still had failed her . Nevertheless , another morning should not find her the same nameless , forsaken creature that she was now.  - -  Manetho had bowed his face upon the altar , and so remained without movement . With one hand fumbling at the bosom of her dress --  ( the scar of her lover 's blow should be the talisman to recall his allegiance ) ,  - -  Salome made bold to approach him and timidly touch his arm . " Unhand me ! whatever you are ,  - -  devil ! my time is not yet come ! " He raised a threatening arm , with a gleam of mad ferocity beneath his brows . But the woman did not shrink ; the man was her god , and she preferred death at his hands to life without him . Ignorant of the cause of her firmness , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly unlocked the secret door , and let himself into the study . His haste had left the key in the lock outside . The door slammed together , the spring-bolt caught , and the swathed head of old Hiero Glyphic shook as though the cold of twenty winters had come on him at once . XXXII . SHUT IN . Left alone , Salome was taken with a panic ; she fancied herself deserted in a giant tomb , with dead men gathering about her . She herself was in truth the grisliest spectre there , in her white satin gown and feathers , and the horror of her hideous face . But she took to flight , and the key remained unnoticed in the lock . We , however , must spend an hour with Manetho in his narrow and prison-like retreat . There is less day and more night between these high-shouldered walls than elsewhere ; for though the sun is scarce below the horizon , cobwebs seem to pervade the air , making the evening gray before its time . Yonder seated figure is the nucleus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for him ! Does he mean to spend the night here ? He sits at ease , as one who , having labored the day long hard and honestly , finds repose at sundown grateful . Such calm of mind and body argues inward peace -- or paralysis ! But Manetho has food for meditation , for his work is still incomplete . Ah , it has been but a sour and anxious work after all ! when it is finished , let death come , since Death-in-life will be the sole alternative . Yet will death bring rest to your weariness , think you ? Would not Death 's eyes look kindlier on you , if you had used more worthily Death 's brother ,  - -  Life ? What would you give , Manetho , to see all that you have done undone ? if to undo it were possible ! One picture is ever before you , you see it wherever you look , and whether your eyes be shut or open ,  - -  two loving souls , standing hand in hand before you to be married . How happy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what clear freedom their eyes sound one another 's depths ! Neither cares to have a thought or feeling unshared by the other.  - -  What have you done , Manetho ? shall the deed stand ? O dark and distorted soul ! the minutes are slipping fast away , and you are slipping with them to a black eternity . Will you stir hand nor foot to save yourself , to break your fall ? not raise your voice , for once to speak the truth ? Even yet the truth may save !  --  The night of your life will this be , Manetho . Will you dream of those whose few hours of bliss will stamp Forever on the seal of your damnation ? Think ,  - -  through what interminable aeons the weight of their just curse will pile itself higher and heavier on your miserable soul ! Fain would you doubt the truth of immortality : but the power of unbelief is gone ; devil-like , you believe and tremble . And where is the reward which should recompense you for this large outlay ? Does the honey of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him whose morning dreams of vengeance become realities in the evening !  --  How stands it between you and Gnulemah , Manetho ? She has never loved you ardently , perhaps ; but how will you face her hatred ? It is late to be asking such questions ,  - -  but has not her temperate affection been your most precious possession ? have you not yearned and labored for it ? have you not loved her with more than a father 's tenderness ? Under mask of planning her ruin , have not all the softer and better impulses of your nature found exercise and sustenance ? Conceiving a devil , have you brought forth an angel , and unawares tasted angelic joy ?  - -  If this be true , Manetho , your guilty purpose towards her is not excused , but how much more awful becomes the contemplation of her fate ! Rouse up ! sluggard , rush forth ! you may save her yet . Up ! would you risk the salvation of three souls to glut a meaningless spite ? You have been fighting shadows with a shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  get stiffly to your feet ,  - -  put hand to forehead ,  - -  stare around . The twilight has deepened apace ; only by glancing upwards can you distinguish a definite light . You are uncertain and lethargic in your movements , as though the dawning in you of a worthy resolution had impaired the evil principle of your vitality . You are as a man nourished on poison , who suddenly tastes an antidote ,  - -  and finds it fatal ! You halt towards the door and put forth a hand to open it . You will save Gnulemah ; her innocence will save her from the knowledge of her loss . As for Balder , his suffering will satisfy a reasonable enemy . No wife , no fortune , the cup dashed from his lips just as the aroma was ravishing his nostrils !  - -  O , enough ! Open the door , therefore , and go forth . In your magnanimity you feel for the key , but it is not in its accustomed place . Try your pockets ; still in vain ! Startled , you turn to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You raise the heavy chair like a feather , and shake it bottom downwards . Nothing falls . You are down on your knees groping affrighted amongst the dust and rubbish of the floor . The key is lost ! You spring up ,  - -  briskly enough now ,  - -  and stand with your long fingers working against one another , trying to think . That key ,  - -  where had you it last ?  --  A blank whirl is your memory ,  - -  nothing stands clearly out . How came you here ? With whom did you speak just now ? What was said ?  - -  Two persons there seemed to be , oddly combined in one ,  - -  most unfamiliar in their familiarity . Or was it your evil genius , Manetho ? who by devilish artifice has at this last hour shut the door against your first good impulse ; locked the door against soul and body ; shut you in and carried off the key of your salvation . Do not give way yet ; review your situation carefully.  - -  Your voice would be inaudible through these massive walls , were the listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unmitigable minutes are dying fast and forever.  - -  Were it known that you were here , could you be got out ? No , for the secret of the door is known only to yourself . Those who once shared the knowledge with you are dead , or many years gone ! Your evil genius no doubt knows it , and all your secrets ; but dream not that she will liberate you . She has been awaiting this opportunity . You shall remain here to-night and many nights . Your bones shall lie gaunt on this cobwebbed floor . Only the daily sunbeam shall know of your tomb . And Gnulemah ? ... Your knees falter beneath you , and you sink in wretched tears to the floor ,  - -  tears that bring no drop of comfort . To be shut up alone with a soul like yours , at the moment when the sin so long tampered with has escaped your control , and is pitilessly doing its devilish work on the other side your prison-walls , near , yet inaccessible ,  - -  who can measure the horror of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of right and wrong , and read your life by no higher light than your own . You read it otherwise to-night , lying here helpless and alone . That lost key has unlocked the fair front of your complacency and revealed the wizened deformity behind it . You have been insane ; but the anguish that would craze a sane man clears the mist from your reason . You behold the truth at last ; but as the drowning man sees the ship pass on and leave him . But we care not to watch too curiously the writhings of your imprisoned soul , Manetho ; the less , because we doubt whether the agony will be of benefit to you . Forgiveness of enemies is perhaps beyond your scope ; even your rage to save Gnulemah was kindled chiefly by your impotence to do so . God forbid we do you less than justice ! but hope seems dim for such as you ; nor will a death-bed repentance , however sincere , avail to wipe away the sins of a lifetime . Jealousy of Balder , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the thought of their spending life in happy ignorance of their true relationship inflames -- does not allay -- your agony ! Your womanish outburst of despairing tears over , a hot fever of restlessness besets you . The space is narrow for disquiet such as yours , you hunt up and down the strip of floor like a caged beast . No way out , no way out !  - -  Face to face with lingering death , why not hasten it ? No moral scruple withholds you . Yet will you not die by your own hand . Through all your suffering you will cling to life and worship it . Never will you open your arms to death ,  - -  which seems to you no grave , compassionate angel , but a malignant fiend lying in ambush for your soul . And such a fiend will your death be ; for to all men death is the reflection of their life in the mind 's mirror.  - -  Still to and fro you fare , a moving shadow through a narrow gloom , walled in with stone . Awful is this unnatural sanity of intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre , where the waves run higher though the air is deadly still , and the surly mariner wishes the mad wind back again.  - -  To and fro you flit , goaded on and strengthened by untiring anguish . You are but the body of a man ; your thought and emotion are abroad , haunting the unconscious , happy lovers !  --  Suddenly you stop short in your blind walk , throw up your arms , and break into an irrepressible chuckle . Has your brain given way at last ?  - -  No , your laugh is the outcome of a genuine revulsion of feeling , intense but legitimate . What is the cause of it ?  - -  You plunge into the rubbish-heap at one end of the room , and grasp and draw forth the rickety old ladder which has been lying there these twenty years . You have seen it almost daily , poking out amidst the cobwebs , and probably for that very reason have so long failed to perceive that it was susceptible of a better use than to be food for worms . You set it upright against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal aperture . Enough , if you tread with care . Narrow , steep , and rickety is the path to deliverance ; but up ! for your time is short . Upward , with cautious eagerness ! The ladder is warped and rests unevenly , and once or twice a round cracks beneath the down-pressing foot ; the thing is all unsound and might fall to pieces at any moment . However , the top is gained , and your nervous hands are on the sill at last . Easing yourself a little higher , you look forth on the world once more . Not so late after all ! Red still lingers along the western horizon , but against it is mounting and expanding a black cloud , glancing ever and anon with dangerous lightning . In a clear sky-lake above the cloud , steadily burns a planet . The gentle twilight rests lovingly on earth 's warm bosom --  Hark ! look ! what moves yonder beneath the trees ?  --  Your parched , eager face strained forwards , your hungry eyes eating through the gloom ,  - -  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side ! How forgetful of the world they seem ! Little think they of you , of the rack on which you have been outstretched . But their hour has come . This moment shall be their last of peace ,  - -  their last of happy love . * * * * *  - -  What sound was that ?  - -  Was it a yell of triumph ,  - -  a shout for help ,  - -  a scream of terror ?  - -  It does not come again ; but the silence is more terrible than the cry . XXXIII . THE BLACK CLOUD . " Hiero , it was his voice ! " said Gnulemah . She looked in her lover 's face , trusting to his wisdom and strength . She rested her courage on his , but her eyes stirred him like a trumpet-call . The burden of that cry had been calamity . Love is protean , makes but a step from dalliance to grandeur . Balder , no longer a sentimental bridegroom , stood forth ready , brief , energetic ,  - -  but more a lover than before ! The voice had at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muffled . As Helwyse swiftly skirted the granite wall of the temple , his mind was busy with conjecture ; but he failed to hit upon any reasonable explanation . The cry had come from the direction of the temple , and had he known of the existence of the apertures through the masonry , he might partly have solved the mystery . As it was , he thought only of getting inside , feeling sure that , explainably or not , Manetho must be there . In the oaken hall he met Nurse , who had also heard the cry , but knew not whence it proceeded . " In the temple , I think , " said Helwyse , answering her agitated gesture . The clew was sufficient ; she sped along towards the door whence she had so lately fled panic-stricken , Helwyse following . Beneath the solemn excitement and perplexity , lay warm and secure in his heart the thought of Gnulemah , his wife . Blessed thought ! which the whips and scorns of time should make but more tenderly dear and precious . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face grew stern . At each step he thought to see death in some ghastly form . In the joy of this his marriage night he had wished all the world might have rejoiced with him ; but already was calamity abroad . Birth and death , love and hate , happiness and woe , are borne on every human breath , and mingled with daily meat and drink . So be it !  - -  They were parodies of humanity who should live on a purer diet or inhale a rarer atmosphere . All the lights in the great hall , except the altar lamp , were burnt out , and the place was very dusky . Nurse went straight towards the secret door , looking neither to the right nor left ; while Helwyse , who did not suspect its existence , was prying into each dark nook and corner . An inarticulate exclamation from the woman arrested him . She was standing behind the altar , close to the clock . As he approached she pointed to the wall . She had found the key in the lock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might be within . She appealed to the strength of the man , yet with a morbid jealousy of his precedence . Helywse saw the key , and , turning it , the seeming-solid wall disclosed a door , opening outwards , a single slab of massive granite . Within all was dark , and there was no sound . Was anything there ? He looked round to address Nurse , but her appearance checked him . She was staring into the darkness ; he could feel her one-eyed glance pass him , fastening on something beyond . He moved to let the lamplight enter the doorway ; and then in the illuminated square that fell on the floor he saw Manetho 's upturned face . The fallen priest lay with one arm doubled under him , the other thrown across his breast . Nurse stared at her broken idol , motionless , with stertorous breathing . But was Manetho dead ? Helwyse , the physician , stepped across the threshold , and stooped to examine the body . The dumb creature followed and lay down , animal-like , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ,  --  " There 's life in him , but he 's hurt internally . We must find a way to move him from here . " " Life ! "  - -  the woman heard , nor cared for more . Her dry fixedness gave way with a gasp , and she broke into hysteric tears , rocking herself backwards and forwards , crooning over the insensible body , or stooping to kiss it . She had no sense nor heed for the lover of her youth . " Could such a creature have been his wife ? even his mistress ? " questioned Helwyse of himself . But he spoke out sharply :  --  " You must stop this . He must be revived at once . Go and make ready a bed , and I will carry him to it . " As he spoke , a silent shadow fell across the body , and Gnulemah stood in the doorway . Balder 's first impulse was to motion her away from a spectacle so unsuited to her eyes . But though the shadow made her face inscrutable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidity or effeminate consternation . Womanly she was ,  - -  instinct with that tender , sensitive power , the marvellous gift of God to woman only , which almost moves the sick man to bless his sickness . A holy gift ,  - -  surely the immediate influx of Christ 's spirit . Man knows it not , albeit when he and woman have become more closely united than now , he may attain to share the Divine prerogative . Study nor skill can counterfeit it ; but in the true woman it is perfect at the first appeal as at the last . " He shall have my bed , " said this young goddess Isis ; " it is ready , and my lamp is burning . " Balder stooped to uplift his insensible burden . " O , not so !  - -  more tenderly than that , " she interposed , softly . A moment 's hesitation , and then she unfastened the golden shoulder-clasp , and shook off her ample mantle . This was Manetho 's litter . " I will help you carry him.  - -  Why do you-weep , Nurse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never , since Diana stooped to earth to love Endymion , was seen a nobler sight than Gnulemah in her simple , clinging tunic , whose heavy golden hem kissed her polished knee , while her round and clear-cut arms were left bare . After the first glance , her lover lowered his eyes , lest he should forget all else in gazing at her . But the blood mounted silently to his cheeks and burned there . As for her , she trusted Balder more freely than herself . Manetho was laid gently on the broad robe , and so upraised and borne forwards ; Balder at the head , Gnulemah at the foot . Heavy , heavy is a lifeless body ; but the man had cause to wonder at the woman 's fresh and easy strength . What a contrast was she to the disfigured creature who hobbled moaning beside the litter , the relaxed hand clutched in both hers , kissing it again and again with grotesque passion ! Yet both were women , and loved as women love . The granite statues sitting serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deserves the name of supernatural . These passed , the flowery heat of the dim conservatory brought them to Gnulemah 's room . The curtain was looped up and the passage clear . Thus first did the wedded pair enter what should have been their bridal chamber , and laid the lifeless body on the nuptial bed . A fair , pure room ; the clear walls frescoed with graceful wreaths of floating figures . In the eastern window , through which the earliest sunbeams loved to fall , stood an alabaster altar ; on it a chain of faded dandelions . The bed was a lovely nest , the lines flowing in long curves ,  - -  a barge of Venus for lovers to voyage to heaven in . On a table near at hand lay some embroidered work at which Gnulemah 's magic needle had been busy of late . Balder glanced at these things with a reverence almost timid ; and , turning back to what lay so inert and doltish on the sacred bed , he could not but sigh . Every means was employed to rally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injury , but there could be no doubt that he had sustained a terrible shock , and possibly concussion of the brain ; the amount of the internal damages could not yet be estimated.  - -  Meanwhile the black cloud from the west was muttering drowsily overhead , and an occasional lightning-flash dulled the mild radiance of the lamp . As consciousness ebbed back to the patient , the storm increased , and the trembling roll of heavy thunder drowned the first gasps of returning life . Had that vast cloud come to shut out his soul from heaven , and was its mighty voice uttering the sentence of his condemnation ? The air was thick with the inconsolable weeping of the rain , and gusty sighs of wind drove its cold tear-drops against the window . How was it with Manetho ?  - -  During the instant after the ladder had given way and he was rushing through the air and clutching vainly at the dark void , every faculty had violently expanded , so that he seemed to see and think at every pore . The next instant his rudely battered body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge sank into bottomless darkness ! By and by -- for aught he knew it might have been an eternity -- a brief gleam divided the night ; then another , and others ; he seemed to be moving through air , upborne on a cloud . He strove to open his eyes , and caught a glimpse of reeling walls , of a figure ,  - -  figures . A deep rumbling sound was in his ears , as of the rolling together of chaotic rocks , gradually subsiding into stillness . He felt no pain , only dreamy ease . He was resting softly on a bank of flowers , in the heart of a summer 's day . He was filled with peace and love , and peace and love were around him . Some one was nestling beside him ; was it not the woman ,  - -  the bright-eyed , smiling gypsy with whom he had plighted troth ?  - -  surely it was she . " Salome ,  - -  Salome , are you here ? Touch me ,  - -  lay your cheek by mine . So ,  - -  give me your hand . I love you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow sentences ended . Nurse had laid her unsightly head beside his on the pillow , and the two were happy in each other . O piteous , revolting , solemn sight ! Those faces , grief-smitten , old ; long ago , in passionate and lawless youth , they had perchance lain thus and murmured loving words . And now for a moment they met and loved again ,  - -  while death knocked at their chamber door ! But Balder had perceived a startling significance in Manetho 's words . He took Gnulemah by the hand and led her to the eastern window . A flash greeted them , creating a momentary world , which started from the womb of night , and vanished again before one could say " It is there ! " Then followed a long-drawn , intermittent rumble , as if the fragments of the spectre world were tumbling avalanche-wise into chaos . " I remember now about the dandelions , " Balder said . " Was not Nurse with us then ? " " Yes , " answered Gnulemah ; " and it was she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he call her Salome ? and who is Manetho ? " Balder did not reply . He leant against the window-frame and gazed out into the black storm . Knowing what he now did , it required no great stretch of ingenuity to unravel Manetho 's secret.  - -  He turned to Gnulemah , and , taking her in his arms , kissed her with a defiant kind of ardor . " What is it ? " she whispered , clinging to him with a reflex of his own unspoken emotion . " We are safe !  - -  But that man shall not die without hearing the truth , " he added , sternly . Again there was a dazzling lightning-flash , and the thunder seemed to break at their very ears . By a quick , sinuous movement , Gnulemah freed herself from his arm and looked at him with her grand eyes ,  - -  night- black , lit each with a sparkling star . Her feminine intuition perceived a change in him , though she could not fathom its cause . It jarred the fineness of their mutual harmony . " Our happiness should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into her eyes with a gaze so ardent that their lids drooped ; and the tone of his answer , though lover-like , had more of masculine authority in it than she had yet heard from him . " My darling , you do not know what wrong he has done you -- and others . It is only justice that he should learn how God punishes such as he ! " " Will not God teach him ? " said Gnulemah , trembling to oppose the man she loved , yet by love compelled to do so . Balder paused , and looked towards the bed . There was a flickering smile on Manetho 's face ; he seemed to be reviving . His injuries were perhaps not fatal after all . Should he recover , he must sooner or later receive his so-called punishment ; meanwhile , Balder was inclined to regard himself as the chosen minister of Divine justice . Why not speak now ? This was the second occasion that he had held Manetho in his power , at a time when the Egyptian had been attempting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Would the bitter issue of that self-indulgence not make him wary now ? Here was again the murderous lust of power , albeit disguised as love of justice . Had Balder 's penitent suffering failed to teach him the truth of human brotherhood , and equality before God ? Love , typified by Gnulemah , would fain dissuade him from his purpose : but love ( as often happens when it stands in the way of harsh and ignoble impulses ) appeared foolishly merciful . Once again his glance met Gnulemah 's ,  - -  lingered a moment ,  - -  and then turned away . It was for the last time . At that moment he was less noble than ever before . But the expression of her eyes he never forgot ; the love , the entreaty , the grandeur ,  - -  the sorrow !  --  He turned away and approached the bedside , while Gnulemah went to kneel at her maiden altar . Manetho 's eyes were closed ; his features wore a singularly childlike expression . In truth , he was but half himself ; the shock he had sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evil-plotting Egyptian was dormant ; his brain interpreted nothing save the messages of the heart ; only the affectionate , emotional Manetho was awake . The evil he had done and the misery of it were forgotten.  - -  All this Balder divined ; yet his assumption of godlike censorship would not permit him to relent . It is when man deems himself most secure that he falls , in a worse way than ever . " Do you know me , Manetho ? " demanded the young man . The priest opened his eyes dreamily , and smiled , but made no further answer . " I am Balder Helwyse ,  - -  the son of Thor , " continued the other , speaking with incisive deliberation , better to touch the stunned man 's apprehension , " I once had a twin sister . You believe that Gnulemah is she . " The priest 's features were getting a bewildered , plaintive expression . Either he was beginning to comprehend the purport of Balder 's words , or else the sternness of the latter 's tone and glance agitated him . Bader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences , vowing to himself that his fallen enemy should understand ! Did he think of Gnulemah then ? or of Salome -- partly for whose ; sake , he feigned , he had assumed the scourge ? " My sister died ,  - -  was burned to death before she was a year old . In trying to save her , the nurse almost lost her own life . On that same night , this nurse gave birth to a daughter ,  - -  whose name you have called Gnulemah . Salome is her mother . Who her father is , Manetho , you best know ! " The words were spoken ,  - -  but had the culprit heard them ? Salome ( who from the first had shrunk back to the head of the bed , beyond the possible range Manetho 's vision ) burst into confused hysteric cries . Gnulemah had risen from her altar and was looking at Balder : he felt her glance ,  - -  but though he told himself that he had done but justice , he dared not meet it !  - -  He kept his eyes fastened on the pallid countenance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the anxious expression was gone , and there was again the flickering smile . All at once there was an odd , solemn change.  --  The man was dying . Balder saw it ,  - -  saw that his enemy was escaping him unpunished ! There yet remained one stimulant that might rouse him , and in the passion of the moment this self-appointed lieutenant of the Almighty applied it . " Come forward here , Salome ! " cried he ; " let him look on the face that his sins have given you . As there is a God in Heaven , your wrongs shall be set right ! " Salome moved to obey ; but Gnulemah glided swiftly up and held her back . Balder stepped imperiously forward to enforce his will . Had he but answered his wife 's eyes even then !  - -  He came forward one step . Then burst a thunder-clap like the crashing together of heaven and earth ! At the same instant a blinding , hot glare shut out all sight . Balder was hurled back against the wall , a shock like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , all unstrung , his teeth chattering . He saw , not the lamp , flickering in the draught from the broken window , not Manetho , lying motionless with the smile frozen on his lips , not Salome , prostrate across the body of him she had worshipped . He saw Gnulemah -- his wife whom he loved -- rise from the altar 's step against which she had been thrown ; stand with outstretched arms and blank , wide-open eyes ; grope forwards with outstretched arms and uncertain feet ; grope blindly this way and that , moaning ,  --  " Balder ,  - -  Balder ,  - -  where are you ? " Shivering and desperate , not yet daring for his life to understand ,  - -  he came and stood before her , almost within reach of those groping hands . " I am here ,  - -  look at me , Gnulemah !  - -  I am here -- your husband ! " There was a pause . The storm , having spent itself in that last burst , was rolling heavily away . There was silence in the nuptial chamber , infringed only by the breathing of the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gnulemah at length , tremulously , while her blank eyes rested on his face , " but I can not see you . My lamp must have gone out . Will not you light it for me ? "  --  Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord : I will repay ! * * * * * The storm-cloud moved eastward and was dispersed . Black though had been its shadow , it endured but for a moment ; the echo of its fury passed away , and its deadly thunderbolt left behind a purer atmosphere . So sweeps and rages over men 's heads the storm of calamity ; and so dissolves , though seeming for the time indissoluble . But the distant planet comes forth serene from its brief eclipse , and as night deepens , bears its steady fire yet more aloft . Like God 's love , its radiance embraces the world , yet forgets not the smallest flower nor grain of sand . From its high station it beholds the infinite day surround the night , and knows the good before and beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hidden from its quiet eternal eye . No journal of a life has been our tale ; rather a glimpse of a beginning ! We have traversed an alpine pass between the illimitable lands of Past and Future . We have felt the rock rugged beneath our feet ; have seen the avalanche and mused beside the precipice , and have taken what relief we might in the scanty greensward , the few flowers , and the brief sunshine . Now , standing on the farewell promontory , let us question the magic mirror concerning the further road , as , before , of that from the backward horizon hitherwards . Mr. MacGentle 's quiet little office : himself -- more venerable by a year than when we saw him last -- in his chair : opposite him , Dr. Balder Helwyse . The latter wears a thick yellow beard about six inches in length , is subdued in dress and manner , and his smile , though genial , has something of the sadness of autumn sunshine . The two have been conversing earnestly , and now there is a short silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mr. MacGentle at last , in a more than usually plaintive murmur . " It is hard ,  - -  very hard , dear Balder . " " Now that I know there is no hope , I can acknowledge the good even while I feel the hardship . Her dreams have been of a world such as no real existence could show ; to have been awakened would permanently have saddened her , if no worse . But she is great enough to believe without seeing ; and in the deepest sense , her belief is true . She still remains in that ideal fairy-land in which I found her ; and no doubt , as time goes on , her visions grow more beautiful ! " Thus Balder Helwyse , in tones agreeably vigorous , though grave and low . " Yes -- yes ; and perhaps , dear Balder , the denial of this one great boon may save her from much indefinite disquiet ; and certainly , as you say , from the great danger of disappointment and its consequences . Yes ,  - -  and you may still keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  But how is it with you , dear boy ? " " Let none who love me pray for my temporal prosperity , " returns Helwyse , turning his strong , dark gaze on the other 's aged eyes . " I have met with many worshippers of false gods , but none the germs of whose sin I found not in myself . The I to whom was confided this excellent instrument of faculties and senses is a poor , weak , selfish creature , who fancied his gifts argued the possession of the very merits whose lack they prove . God , in His infinite mercy , deals sternly with me ; and I know how to thank Him ! "  --  Mr. MacGentle does not reply in words ; but a grave smile glimmers in his faded eyes , and , smiling , he slowly shakes his venerable head . One more brief glimpse , and then we are done.  --  A pleasant parlor of southern aspect , looking through a deep bay-window over a spacious garden . Here sits a stalwart gentleman of middle age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who play bo-peep with his wide-spreading yellow beard . How they all laugh ! and what a pleasant laugh has the stalwart , dark-eyed gentleman ,  - -  so deep-toned and yet so boyish ! But presently all three pause to take breath . " Thor , " then says the gentleman , " whose portrait did I tell you that was ? " And he points to an oil-painting hanging over the piano . " Grandpapa MacGentle , papa ! " " What did he do for all of us ? " As Master Thor hesitates a moment , the little golden-haired lady breaks in ,  --  " I know , papa ! He made uth rich , and gave uth our houthe , and he thaw me when I wath a wee , wee baby , and then he -- he --  " " He went to Heaven , papa ! " says Thor , recovering himself . Hereupon there was a silence , because the two children , glancing up in their father 's face , saw that it was grave and thoughtful . But suddenly the little girl pricks up her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for the door at full speed , without a word . Thor is close behind , but just too late to be first in opening the door . " Mamma ! mamma ! " And Balder Helwyse springs up , and as she enters with the rejoicing children at each hand , he meets her with the thrilling smile which , in this world , she will never see !
