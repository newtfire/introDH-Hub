NOT of our valuable time these days is spent going around advising people to see the Gorki show , " At the Bottom , " which gave us our best evening in the theatre circa 1930 . Leo Bulgakov directed the play while himself acting in " Street Scene , " which sounds like the neatest trick of the week , and which perhaps is the way shows should be directed . Anyway , it is a distinguished piece of business , and we go about shouting down people who have n't seen it . Unless it makes more money than it 's making , Mr. Bulgakov wo n't be able to put on other shows this spring . If this item is interpreted to mean that we arc trying to help Mr. Bulgakov , it is interpreted exactly right . We certainly are . We have a suggestion for estab- - lashing parity between the United States Navy and the British Navy . We suggest that the two fleets be equal not only in tons but in pounds . Thus , if it were discovered that a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleships , a United States sailor should he sent ashore to buy a sixteen-pound pair of dumb-hells for his ship . This would turn the tables and give the United States a four-pound advantage and would necessitate sending a British sailor ashore for a dumb-bell . He would return with an eight-pound dumb-bell . Still there would be no parity . If this were kept up long enough the ships would become so full of dumb-bells that they would sink , solving the question of peace  --  a question often neglected at arms conferences . NAVAL parity is basically a silly goal , anyway . Presumably we maintain fleets so that we will have them in the event of war . But in the event 01 war , parity is a terrible menace . It prolongs everything , by making battles even . A better plan would be to allow either Great Britain or the United States to have a vast armada , like the Spanish Armada , which could destroy any other nation 's fleet in a couple of hours . Then the war would he over , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street is for once in just the condition which we approve of . With the Waldorf out of the way a good deal of light and sun gets through to the sidewalk and to the people , making the district rather pleasant , It would please us very Much if the person in charge of that corner would let well enough alone  --  let the vacant lot stay just as it is , with possibly the addition of a few potted plants and the cleaning up of a bit of debris . Or it could be made into a sidewalk cafe , called Cafe de la Paix . The latter project would be much cheaper and easier than putting up a skyscraper , which is essentially a dull program . Skyscrapers attract dull people , clutter the streets , and shut out light . At times like this a spirit of negation is preferable to a spirit of enterprise . UR theory about the outrageous N. -- 1 hubbub that goes on in this city is that labor in New York has undergone a strange perversion . Men have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the noise they can make at it . We have a panacea , though . We advocate the construction of a Gargantuan siren  --  a Paul Bunyan of sirens  --  on top of the Chrysler Building , which seems to be about the centre of things this month . The noise produced by this mechanism will he an atrocity , a vast demoniac bellowing over the housetops . One by one it will beat down the other noises of the city , showing up their perpetrators and breaking their spirits . The siren will go on until riveters crawl clown from their buildings , policemen pocket their whistles , " L " trains jolt to a standstill ? until the futility , of rivalry has been established . We arc going to see about this at once . Speaking of Scridiwomen AMONG our confreres in journal-1 1 ism we have heard much talk of happenings in the i'Vor/d offices , where there seems to have been one of those periodic reorganizations which send shudders through the profession . A hundred or more employees , including a number of old dependables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the place , were suddenly let go . Naturally there were several ironic angles to it . One concerned an old-timer who sat apart from the bustle of the rest of the staff  --  in a small office up in the dome , we hear ? and read all the daily papers of the town and submitted a summary each day on how their reports of various news events compared with that of the World . For years and years he had been doing this On the recent day he was given the sad news that his job was done , he turned in his report as usual signed with his name , as usual . Beneath his signature he wrote " 1880-19311 " Then he put on his hat and departed , having completed his half-century of work . Another touch of irony was that the morning after the notices were served on the old men Mr. Walter Lippmann 's editorial page ( Mr. Lippmann being apparently not privy to what was going on in his own office ) came out with an editorial about the discharging of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty flat-footed and forthright in its denunciation of this . By the foregoing we are reminded of something we heard two or three years ago about Mr. Martin Littleton . Anyhow , as we recall it , it was Martin Littleton . Mr. Littleton was discussing the lack of aggressiveness and fervor in the press of today and recalling the old days . He said that every morning he had the World set beside his breakfast plate . Each morning he reverently picked it up and reverently unfolded it . He then turned to the editorial page and read the declaration of purpose and policy written by the original Joseph Pulitzer and still printed in a box under the masthead each day . " An institution that should always fight for progress ... never tolerate injustice . . . always fight demagogues . . . always oppose the privileged classes . . . always remain devoted to the public welfare , never he satisfied with merely printing news . . . " etc. , etc . Mr. Littleton read this through thoughtfully every morning . Having finished it , he then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breakfast table . That , he said , constituted his newspaper reading for the day . Tenor in Talkie AFELLOW who loafs around in the presence of talking-picture people has a lovely story about John McCormack , the tenor . Mr. McCormack , possessing the artistic temperamentthat is the prerogative of tenors , has always had pretty much his own way about things . Unfortunately , in the talkies , - nobody can have his own way ; so when McCormack made a picture recently for Fox , there were moments when master minds clashed and when the tenor went pretty much to pieces . When the job was finally done , there arose the question of a title . Dozens of suggestions poured in from all sides , but it remained for one person who had heard about all the goings-on to submit a really brilliant title . It was ( and it will never be used ) : " The Unstrung Harp . " Pipernaker THE only place left in town that we know of where they make hand-carved meerschaum pipes is Carl Stehr 's shop in Broome Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenient fur Mr. Stehr 's remaining clients to get to , especially since most of them live uptown , but it is where Mr. Stehr 's father opened the business in 1867 , and Mr. Stehr himself was born a Few doors away fifty-five years ago , and he just wo n't move . You will recognize the place by the large pipe lying in the window . His father made it , not to be smoked especially  --  it is almost two feet long  --  but just to show what he could do . It won a prize at the Philadelphia Exposition in 1876 ; since then , Mr. Stehr has refused offers of as high as a thousand dollars for it . Not only the father , but for that matter the grandfather , too , was a pipe-carver , in Vienna . The grandfather 's chef d'reuvre was a pipe a yard long , showing the imperial coach , drawn by six horses , racing at a gallop . It cost five thousand dollars and was made to the order of the Emperor of Austria himself . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pay huge prices for them . Animals were popular , lions crouching , tigers springing . George F. Scanal , an old-time New York politician , paid five hundred dollars for art Indian-head pipe , elaborately cut . Robert Edeson , the actor , had a Mephistopheles which he prized . Once upon a time you could often tell a man 's business by his pipe . Butchers went in for bulls ' heads , doctors wanted skulls . The only recent case in this line is that of a plumber who went into the shop a Few months ago and ordered a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey wrench . People just do n't care for symbolism in their pipes any more . For that matter , the meerschaum pipe itself is on the wane . The name , as everyone knows , means " sea foam , " but the true meerschaum is really a kind of clay , found only in Turkey , whence it is shipped to Vienna and there made into pipes . During the war , of course , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation meerschaums developed . Most of them were so cheap that the prestige of the real stuff suffered . Besides the war , Mr. Stehr blames women , cigarettes , modern art , and the knockout pace of present-day life for the decline of the meerschaum . Mr. Stehr himself still sticks to them , however . He has a set of seven , all beautifully colored , which he smokes in rotation , one for each day of the week . Most of them are designed after flowers . A little while ago , he thought he saw a whole new field opening up fur him . A Vassar girl came into the shop with the idea that women would go wild over miniature meerschaums , delicately carved . Mr. Stehr hastily made up a dozen or so , but they failed to catch on . Thinking it over , Mr. Stehr was just as glad . He does n't think women ought to smoke , anyway . Two-and-a-Half-Cent Fare SAILORS from the German boats in port naturally have a lot of tenpfennig pieces with them . These coins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are of the same weight and size as a nickel , and can be used in the subway turnstiles and in telephone booths . One of the sailors told us that a five-pfennig piece will fit into a but conductor 's coin machine  --  if you have the courage to try it . The sailor gave us a ten-pfennig piece and , flatly against the advice of our lawyer , we dropped it into a slot at the Forty-second Street " L " station . The turnstile clicked and we passed through . The coin , of course , loomed up gigantically through the thick magnifying glass . This was bad , because the German coin is yellow , as against our nickel 's gray . Nobody noticed , but the train did n't come along for many minutes and the delay threw us into a panic . We went back and put a nickel in the slot , thus becoming the first person to pay a seven-cent fare  --  or seven-anda-half . The sailors do n't do this . They do n't care . W f or M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who goes back so far that he uses a roll-top desk , asked his secretary to call a mutt . She did n't know what he meant , and he explained . The word had slipped out . " Mutt " is an old term for Western Union messengers . It originated during the days when the company was the Mutual Union Telegraph , or M. U. T. for short . The messengers disliked the nickname so much that many of them quit their jobs . It was largely because of this , it is said , that the name Western Union was adopted . You could n't say " wutts " and it would have no unlovely connotation if you did . We learn also that the tipping of messenger boys has gone almost completely out of vogue . A boy tells us that such tips as he does receive are gleaned around Third Avenue , and in other of the poorer districts where a telegram is still an event , not in Park Avenue or Sutton Place or business offices , where they are common . Grie AWEEK or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical type , was selecting a birthday card at his neighborhood stationer 's when a salesman entered heartily and tried to sell the proprietor fountain pens . The latter was melancholy . " Brother , " he said , " I carried a line of fountain pens once and they gave me nothing but grief . " " Grief ? " exclaimed the salesman , apparently facing an unusual argument . " Grief , " echoed the proprietor grimly . The customer selected his greeting card about this time and left . A few days later he dropped in for some magazines . As he was paying for them the stationer produced a tray of fountain pens , thrust it before him , and declared , " I just put in a new line of fountain pens . Would you be interested in one  --  very fine ? " Ordinarily this gentleman buys anything thus thrust upon him , having practically no sales resistance , but on this occasion he unexpectedly had an inspiration . " I had a fountain pen once , " he said , " and it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stationer . " Grief , " said the fellow boldly . A shadow passed over the proprietor 's face . He sadly returned the pens to their place . Toil and Trouble DO N'T envy anyone who has a prewar cellar ; from all we hear they just fret you . Take , for Case No. 1 , that of a manufacturer who bought out two small liquor dealers just before prohibition and stored the purchases in the basement of his Long Island home . It was robbed so many times  --  by butlers , chauffeurs , hijackers , and policemen  --  that he nervously decided to remove the precious remainder to a Manhattan safe-deposit vault . It took him three months to arrange this by correspondence . Investigators had to go out several times to authenticate the stock , and so on . A permit finally received , the gentleman became suspicious of the two government agents delegated to accompany the shipment to New York . He arranged with the chief of police of the nearest Long Island town to lend him a motorcycle escort to come along too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up proceedings until he had hired two private detectives to go along and watch the cops who were watching the prohibition agents . Even then he was uneasy  --  thought he saw signs of collusion among all these men  --  and telegraphed his son to come down from New Haven and watch the whole crowd . The cavalcade got through but , with all the precautions , two dozen bottles were lost . With the liquor in a vault , the owner discovered that every time he wanted to take a case to his home he had to get another permit . This took weeks . In the end he abandoned the cellar and now buys direct from a bootlegger , although his original purpose in laying in his cellar was to drink without violating the law . CASE No. 2 is that of another owner of a prewar supply we know who went down to Prohibition Administrator Campbell to get information . He wanted to learn if he could legally make a Christmas gift of any of his stock . Major Campbell said no , unless the recipient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept . The owner found out he could will his stock to anyone . He found that one has a much easier time with liquor obtained upon prescription . The prescription includes the right to transport . The man asked if a patient who must take a spoonful of whiskey before each meal could carry a bottle with him to a restaurant . Major Campbell said the question was frivolous . He said a lot of other questions were frivolous . " I do n't think you 're trying to do prohibition any good , " he said . We have heard about one liquor bequest . An insurance man left his fine cellar to his widow when he died and it lay untouched for years . Recently she decided to sell it , and sent for the wine dealer from whom her late husband had always made his purchases . The dealer has turned bootlegger , but the widow did n't know that . He bought the lot from the innocent lady at forty dollars a case . Out in Ohio a cellar was seized by government agents and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , and finally after several months the court ordered the liquor returned . Two weeks later , the stock not having arrived , the gentleman went after the agents . They had been horrified to discover , they said sadly , that the warehouse had been burglarized and all the liquor stolen ? all but two cases . He could have those . ? TO show you where the drugstore has got to : A Liggett 's in Sixth Avenue has a sign in the window which reads : " Come In and Browse Around . " Exotic Harlem AMINISTER whose interest takes him much into Harlem says that anyone who has the idea that the inhabitants of the negro city live only on fried chicken and corn pone is wrong . The West Indian negro , for instance , will scarcely look at a chicken . What he likes are yams , yucas , papayas , and things like that . The yams come from Cuba and Jamaica , and are something like sweet potatoes , only much bigger and sweeter . Yucas look like tulip bulbs ; papayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , can be eaten raw , fried , or boiled . They are all imported specially for the Harlem trade . Market men go down every morning early to an East River pier , where the vegetables are unloaded and sold at auction . Sabadillas or " sugar apples " are the prime delicacy from Jamaica  --  gray-green in color with a kind of marshmallow inside , very nice . Trinidad negroes like the manisipod or " star apple . " It looks something like three small potatoes grown together in a cluster and tastes like a fig . It is the rarest and most exotic delicacy of all ; few stores carry it and only one or two restaurants serve it . As a matter of fact , the restaurants seem to be going in more and more for straight American cooking .

Mr. Eames was born in Newark , and his elders recall that at the age of ten he asked his mother to bring him to Manhattan so that he could buy a volume of Herodotus . He became so interested in this and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . At that age he got a job as printer 's devil . Most of the hours he was n't at work he spent in reading . Subsequently he was a clerk in a bookshop , a salesman of theological tracts at camp meetings , and a postman . He kept reading steadily all the while , getting well into several foreign languages . He became the expert of the Brooklyn Post Office in deciphering strange scrawls . Now he is at home in twenty or more languages , including such tongues as Samoan and Kaffir , most of which he speaks . Of late he has gone in for deciphering cuneiform tablets , which he says are easier than some of the addresses he used to puzzle over when he was a postman . Indulgence of this hobby was made simple by the purchase , cheap , of a quantity of tablets a Florida real-estate man had picked up in Bagdad before he went broke . Mr. Eames is also an authority on American printing , Ptolemaic geography , and Babylonian social life , and for forty-five years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books which relate to America .
