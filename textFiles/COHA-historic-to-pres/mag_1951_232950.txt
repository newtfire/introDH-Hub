Though most of them begin " Dear Doctor , " or " Dear Professor , " the man to whom they are addressed never even finished eighth grade . He is just plain Henry Dunn , 60 , caretaker of the University of Texas ' Main Building . <P> For four years Henry Dunn has been sending books to needy libraries abroad . He began it after hearing a Chinese coed describe the plight of her country 's universities . Dunn straightway started collecting 7,000 volumes for Lingnan University in Canton , whose library had been burned by the Japanese . <P> Then he heard about other foreign colleges and schools that needed help . " Never had much of a chance to read books myself , " he would say , " and I appreciate how much they mean to people who are in the same fix . " In his spare time , he begged books wherever he could-duplicates from libraries , old books from professors ; he bought discarded textbooks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community chest sent him $850 ; an Austin dowager , $750 ; a businessman , $800 more . He used these funds for freight-to Japan , Brazil , India , Germany , Liberia , the Philippines . He sent all kinds of books : dictionaries , biographies , encyclopedias , novels . In four years he shipped out 325,000 volumes . <P> Now , he scarcely has time even to read the letters he gets , or smile at the way they are addressed . Last week he was collecting 14,000 volumes for Austin 's Samuel Huston College ( for Negroes ) , which , he heard , was about to lose its accredited standing for lack of a big enough library . And when that job is done Henry Dunn plans to do something about Korea . " You know , " says he , " in this country there are enough books to educate the whole world . "
