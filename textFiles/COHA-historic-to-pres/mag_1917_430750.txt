FROM whatever angle one views the Empire of Turkey , he beholds a land of unusual fascination . To the historian , the archeologist , or the geographer it is a storehouse of wealth , worth a lifetime of exploration and study . To the romancer it gives again its thousand and one tales of the Arabian Nights . Mythology and legend not only come from its past , but are found today on the lips and in the lives of its common people . Poetry and proverb are in the daily speech , while monasteries and mosques proclaim from every mountain top and market-place that religion is a part of the very life of the land . If one could only turn aside from the horrors of the present , with its black current of misrule , its injustice , its deportations , massacres , and famines , and out of a wonderful past could construct a vision of a more glorious future ! For , in spite of four centuries and more of retrogression under the rule of the Turk , there is promise of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROM THE PAST The land of Turkey looks out on the present from a historic past that is the study of all ages . The epics of Homer are concerned with events on the plains of Troy , at the mouth of the Dardanelles . Along the shores of Asia Minor sailed Perseus , and the Argonauts sought the Golden Fleece on the southern coast of the Black Sea . Croesus obtained his fabulous wealth by sifting the river sands that brought down grains of gold from the mountains back of Smyrna . Alexander the Great defeated the Persians in northern Syria , and Babylon , on the Euphrates , was the capital that proved his undoing . Chaldea and Babylonia , richest and most powerful nations of antiquity , were the lower Mesopotamia of today . Their wealth did not consist primarily in tributes levied on subject nations and in plundered temples , but in the riches of the soil of the Tigris and Euphrates Valley . The land of the Nile has always been famed for its marvelous productivity , but its soil is no more fertile and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonderful systems of irrigation once watered the plains and made Babylon and its territories the granary and the garden of all the eastern world . When the distinguished engineer , Sir William Wilcox , was called upon to survey this region for present irrigation development , his final report contemplated little more than a rehabilitation of the ancient systems of the Babylonian days . The power of the city of Antioch reached north and south and east . It was , perhaps , the most beautiful city of Hellenic times and certainly the most luxurious . After the Scipios broke its power in Asia Minor and Rome ruled the world , Antioch became the vice-regent for Rome , ruling over all the eastern world . It was known as " The Gate of the East , " through which flowed the Roman conquering legions and from which eastern luxury undermined the foundations of western power . " The waters of the Orontes contaminated the Tiber , " as one ancient sage observed . THE INFLUENCE OE CONSTANTINOPLE ON WORLD EVENTS On the banks of the Bosphorus Constantine founded his world capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish city has figured in all great world  | movements . It has been the center of intrigues and treaties , of councils and conspiracies , around which have circled the policies of Europe for the last sixteen hundred years . Within the bounds of Turkey also lay Phoenicia , the synonym for commerce and trade . From the shores of Syria the merchants of Tyre and Sidon sent their fleets of ships , trafficking with all the world . Located in the pathway between Egypt and Babylon , it was the ideal position for trade ; while the western world , along the Mediterranean shores , was an ever-growing market for the wares of the east . With the instinct of merchants , the people of Syria made the most of their wonderful geographic position to become the first great shop-keeping nation . And this land still remains the connecting link between the three continents , and across it should still lie the highways of trade between the east and the west , the north and the south . Where Turkey joins to Egypt is Palestine . No spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and such a variety of peoples as the rugged mountain slopes , narrow valleys , and half desert wastes of Judea and Galilee . Beersheba , Hebron , Bethlehem , Nazareth , Jerusalem ? the mere mention of these names tells the story of Abraham and Moses and David , of the prophets of Israel and of the Son of Man . THE PRICE OP NEGLECT AND INJUSTICE Kings and priests and people come from the north and the south , from the east and the west , and " bring the glory of the nations " to do homage to the memories that cluster about these sacred shrines . What a land , then , is that comprised  | within the limits of the Turkish Empire ! Out of its past speaks military power and material wealth , literature and art , philosophy and religion . And that land which today lies desolate , with its marvelous natural resources neglected , and its people , who were the glory of the past , repressed by injustice , cruelty , and tyranny ? that land possesses today the same elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a modern civilization . The same broad plains that once fed and clothed a population of 40,000,000 human beings are waiting today for the plow , the seed , and the reaper . The mountains still hold riches of coal and iron and copper . The quarries still have abundance of choice marbles . The rivers are potent with power to turn the wheels of industry . The natural harbors invite the fleets- of merchantmen and the river valleys and mountain passes offer natural lines of communication and transportation , as in the days when great caravans passed along these natural highways , bringing the merchandise of the east to the markets of the west . The whole land has been lying fallow for centuries ? a land that modern exploration reveals as one of the richest in natural resources and as unsurpassed by its geographic location for being the trade center of the world . THE LAND AND ITS PEOPLE Exclusive of Arabia , which has never been more than nominally tinder the Ottoman dominion , the Turkish Empire , as at present constituted , embraces about 540,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this are in Europe . The Turkish Empire is equivalent to the combined areas of the British Isles , France , and Germany . It is larger than all of the area east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers . The territory included in our Southern Confederacy is hardly equal to the  | present Ottoman Empire , not including Arabia . The boundaries are the Black Sea and Caucasus on the north , Egypt on the south , the Egean and Mediterranean seas on the west , and the Syrian Desert and Persia on the east . Turkey in Europe is almost a negligible area , as the Balkan war stripped the Turks of all their European possessions except Constantinople and a narrow territory along the Bosphorus and Dardanelles , some 40 miles in width ; so that when the Turkish Empire is now referred to Asiatic Turkey is all that the term embraces except the city of Constantinople and a small amount of adjacent territory . Roughly speaking , Turkey is divided into five great provinces , or districts ? Anatolia , Armenia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is from a Turkish word meaning " the dawn " ) lies between the Black and Mediterranean seas . This district is the home of the greater part of the Turkish population , perhaps 7,000 , - 000 in all . Here is a case where the people can be distinguished from the government . Even the so-called subject races have suffered but little more at the hands of the governing officials than the common Turkish people . ALL GOVERNMENT IN THE HANDS OF 300 MEN When one remembers that all government of the Empire lies solely in the hands of a group of not more than 300 men , and that they impose their selfish will on Turk and Christian alike , one readily understands how a distinction can be made between people and government . In spite of a constitution having been proclaimed and a parliament summoned , the people , whether of Turkish or other race , have absolutely no voice in the affairs of the nation . Armenia , east of Anatolia , extending to the region of the Caucasus and the Persian border , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population is not wholly Armenian ? in fact , even before the war the majority of the people were Turks and Kurds ? but here the bulk of the Armenian race was found . It is a rugged land , a succession of mountains and valleys , where the people have had to contend with nature for the establishment and maintenance of their homes ; but , like all highland countries . it has been the means of producing a religious , freedom-loving people . They were the first nation to embrace Christianity when , in the latter half of the third century , their king , Tiradates , accepted the new faith , and most of the nation followed him . Throughout all the succeeding centuries they have remained steadfast against wave after wave of persecution , until this last storm of hate and fanaticism has swept the greater part from their homes and has destroyed at least a million ? two-thirds of the entire people . THE LAND OF SALADIN , THE KURD Kurdistan , a hill country north of the Tigris River , is the home of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clans known as the Kurds . They are the descendants of the Cardushi , who gave Xenophon and his ten thousand so much difficulty on their march across these same hills on their way to the sea . Nominally they are Moslem in religion , but they have retained many elements of heathen worship . Some of their tribes are " Yesdi , " or devil worshipers . They are home-loving , frugal , and capable of enduring great hardships . They practice strict monogamy and their women occupy an equal place with their men in the family life . The Kurds have furnished at least one great man to history , for Saladin , the chivalrous leader of the Saracen hosts , the compeer of Richard Coeur de Lion , was from this people . Mesopotamia , Upper and Lower , vies with Egypt in claiming the honor of being the home of ancient civilization . It comprises the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers . Here flourished the Chaldean , Babylonian , and Assyrian empires . The city of Bagdad , with all its glamour of mystery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RICHEST LAND IN THE WORLD This was the richest land in the world , the granary of the ancients ; yet , in spite of all that it has been , it today lies largely  | waste , the desert sands have encroached upon the fertile fields , while the clogged canals have turned other portions into swamps and marshes . What population there is ? not more than one million ? is of Arab origin and the Arabic language is spoken throughout . There is , in fact , a very distinct dividing line between the Arabic and the Turkish-speaking portions of the Ottoman Empire . This boundary corresponds with the line of the Bagdad Railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf . It is for the exploitation of this rich land of Mesopotamia that the famous Bagdad line was built . Syria , the region extending from the Taurus Mountains to Egypt and from the  | desert to " the Great Sea , " needs no identification . It is the land of the patriarchs and prophets and apostles ? " the Holy Land . " Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semitic origin , speaking the Arabic language , and yet with so many races intermingled through the centuries of the various conquests and occupations that the people can not claim any one race as their own . Greek . Roman , and European Crusader have all blended with the ancient Semitic stock to produce the Syrians of today , whom Lord Cromer , in his Memoirs , termed " the cream of the East . " In Syria was the one green spot of Turkey ? the Lebanon : fountains . In 186o , because of massacres , the European Powers insisted that these mountains be made autonomous . And since that date this little district has been a living demonstration of what good government will produce and of what the people of the land are capable of becoming . The steep mountain sides have been terraced to a height of 4.000 feet and planted to olives , figs , and vines . Taxes have been low , safety to person and property secured , good roads built and kept in repair . The people have constructed more comfortable homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the achievements of the Lebanon and its sons during these sixty years of autonomy would be a thrilling narrative in itself . Now that autonomy has been taken away , the Lebanon is prostrate in famine . NATURAL FEATURES Practically the whole Turkish Empire is of the same surface configuration ? high mountain ranges along the sea-coast , with elevated plain and plateau in the interior . These inner plains are generally fertile , being constantly renewed by soil washed from the surrounding mountains . Where rain is sufficient , or where water can be obtained for irrigation , they produce fine crops of grain . In ancient times the mountains were everywhere covered with forests . The cedars of Lebanon not only furnished timber for the building of Solomon 's Temple in Jerusalem , but the kings of Egypt annually floated large rafts of logs from the Syrian coast to supply the demands of the cities of the Nile . This constant demand from foreign lands , together with the lack of any system of reforestation , has practically denuded the mountains of the whole land . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar and oak would be a simple task if carried on systematically . The chief enemy today of reforestation by nature is the herds of goats , which every spring roam over the whole country and devour every green thing . The little seedling trees suffer especially . POPULATION OF THE , OTTOMAN EMPIRE The population of the Ottoman Empire , not including Arabia , is about 18 , - 000,000 , or was before the war . In giving statistics on any subject regarding Turkey one speaks in approximate terms , for only estimates can be given , as no thorough census is taken or other statistics systematically gathered . Among the various races this total was distributed as follows : Turks , 7,000,000 ; Syrians and Arabs , 4,500,000 ; Kurds , 2,000,000 ; Armenians , 2,000,000 ; Greeks , 1,500,000 ; Jews , 500,000 ; other races , 500,000 . All of these peoples can trace their history back to the period when fable and legend blend with the beginnings of historic facts . And all , except the Turks , have inhabited , from time immemorial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races represent the three great monotheistic religions , which have also originated within the boundaries of the Turkish Empire . About two-thirds of the entire population are Mohammedan , but of different sects . The Christians , also , are divided into many sects , representing nearly all the great divisions of the church . The Christian races are the most progressive part of the population ; they have been most response ; e to education and have made some progress in establishing schools of their own . The Turks are the most backward of all ; yet under proper encouragement and facilities they are capable of good progress . In competition with Greeks , Armenians , and Syrians , however , they invariably fall behind . It should be noted that of 48 Grand Viziers who have risen to prominence  | within the past four centuries , those whose names would be in history 's " Who 's Who , " only 12 have been Turks ; all the others were either of Greek or Armenian origin . Taking the country as a whole , the percentage of illiteracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very comprehensive , but exists largely on paper . The Turk is able to dream great dreams , but amazingly unable to bring those visions to reality .  | THE VARIED RESOURCES All of the varied resources that contributed to make the nations of antiquity materially great are still available for the future enrichment of the people dwelling in those same lands . IIerodotus , writing of Lower Mesopotamia in the noontide of its prosperity , declared : " It is far the best corn land of all the countries I know . It is so superb that the average yield is two hundred fold , and three hundred fold in the best years . But I will not state the dimensions ( of the plants ) I have ascertained , because I know that for any one who has not visited Babylonia and witnessed these facts about the crops for himself they would be altogether beyond belief . " In the days of the early Caliphate an inventory showed some 12,500,000 acres of land under cultivation ; and Sir William Wilcox in his report , " The Irrigation of Mesopotamia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tigris-Euphrates delta is an arid region of some 12,500,000 acres , but capable of easy leveling and reclamation . The Arabic name for this region is Sawid , which means the black land . And northern Mesopotamia is equally rich in possibilities . In ancient days this was a district " so populous and full of riches that Rome and the rulers of Iran fought seven centuries for its possession , till the Arabs conquered it from both , " writes A. J. Toynbee . The same author points out that " in the ninth century A. D. northern esopotamia paid IIarun-al-Rashid as great a revenue as Egypt , and its cotton commanded the market of the world . " It is well known that our word muslin is derived from the name of the city Mosul , in Upper Mesopotamia . SPLENDID POSSIBILITIES ; NEGLECTED RESOURCES And why should this land not be producing as well as ten centuries ago ? The soil and the climate have not changed . The rainfall and the water for irrigation are just as abundant as in the days of old . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equally industrious and thrifty . Why have the past four centuries laid a blight over the fairest corn land of the east ? But it is not Mesopotamia alone that offers agricultural returns in the Empire of Turkey . There are the fertile seacoast plains of ancient Philistia , the uplands of Moab and Ammon , the wheat fields of the Hauran south of Damascus , and the great valley between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon , in Syria ; the whole elevated plateau of central Asia Minor , with Konia ( ancient Iconium ) as its center . There are the fertile river valleys and hillsides of Armenia and Kurdistan , together with the famous Cilician plain and the regions about Smyrna and Broussa . Not only grain of every kind rewards the industry of the peasant , but also fruits of every variety , semi-tropical and temperate , are easily produced . Who has not eaten of the figs of Smyrna and the dates of Bossrah or heard of the grapes of Eschol ? PRIMITIVE METHODS OF AGRICULTURE The first interest of the Turkish Empire is agricultural . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid opportunities to the farmer . And these lands in great part lie uncultivated . Reservoirs for the storage of water and other irrigation works that might change desert acres to producing fields are not constructed . The most primitive modes of cultivation are still in use ? the ox-drawn plow of Bible days , the cutting of great fields of grain with the sickle , the threshingfloor , where wheat is trodden out by the hoofs of animals ; the slow and painful hand labor , with clumsy instruments , that yields but a minimum of return for the effort expended . It is all a tale of splendid possibilities , but of neglected and undeveloped resources . Yet it is a promise to the future generation of boundless productivity and of untold wealth in store for progressive industry and a benevolent government . The marvelous resources of this Empire are not comprised in its agricultural possibilities alone . The story of Crcesus gathering gold from the river sands is not an idle tale . Just this year an American missionary writes : " Grains of gold are frequently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , no complete and thorough survey has ever been made of the mineral wealth of Turkey . But German maps ( and who has studied Asia Minor more thoroughly than the Germans ? ) mark deposits of coal , copper , iron , silver , gold , and lead , with many of the lesser minerals , such as chrome , emery , manganese , mercury , rock-salt , and sulphur . These are not noted on the map in scarce and isolated localities , but the various deposits occur with such frequency as easily to explain the German zeal for cultivating friendship with Turkey . The American missionaries resident in the country give unanimous testimony to the mineral deposits . An American professor in one of the colleges writes : " The copper deposits at Arghuni Maaden are wonderfully rich and extensive . The mine now being worked contains 70 per cent of copper , of which about one-half is recovered by the crude method of smelting in use . Ore containing 30 to 50 per cent is thrown away as useless and mountains of such waste surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mineral resources of Konia are certainly very great . There are silver mines , lead , and some gold ; there are mercury mines a few hours from Konia , while chrome , cinnabar , lead , emery , manganese , and rock-salt are found in the province . " THE MOUNTAINS STILT , FULL , OF VALUABLE ORE The president of one of the American colleges in Asia Minor reports : " In this region there are known to be deposits of silver , coal , and copper . I once asked an old Greek up among the mountains about his mining experiences , as we were picking our way together among the slag of some abandoned silver mines . He told me he had spent years under ground .  | asked him whether the mines had closed because the mineral was worked out . Whew , ' he replied , with an expressive gesture , the mountains are full of it . ' He did not speak with scientific information , but he had had the experience of a practical miner . " These are a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in the regions of which they write . And all that they tell and more is abundantly substantiated by the reports of the German engineers who have been making extensive surveys for their government . The question arises , How has it been possible for these riches to have remained undeveloped at the very door of Europe ? It does seem impossible , but the true answer is given in this sentence from one of the missionary reports : " There are hopeful indications of various other minerals at other places also ; but the Turks have always discouraged attempts at developments . " PETROLEUM DEPOSITS It is well known that the extensive petroleum deposits along the Persian frontier were a principal cause of England 's desire to participate in Persian politics not many years ago , and the possession of these oil fields has been one of the chief objects of military contention between the Turkish and British in their Mesopotamian campaigns . There are other rich prospects for oil in widely separated parts of the Empire . After careful examination one expert reports : " German engineers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great anticipation for developing large oil fields throughout Mesopotamia . There have been found favorable indications for the development of petroleum areas in several parts of Asia Minor , especially in Syria and Mesopotamia . The indications in Syria are perhaps as promising of rich oil deposits as any in the world . " But here again one comes against that stone wall that has blocked all progress of development , for the report quoted above concludes : " The complete determination of the petroleum supply of Asia Minor must await the return of a stable government , upon whose permanency and good faith capital can rely and which will be capable of establishing law and order throughout the territory in question . " WATER POWER The Abana , one of the rivers of Damascus , in beautiful cascades , falls from the Anti-Lebanon Mountains to the plain below . A few years ago these waters were gathered into conduits up among the highlands and passed over waterwheels . Now they are not only irrigating the groves of apricots which surround the city , but , doing double duty , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving electric cars through the oldest city in the world . What has been done with this mountain stream can be repeated over and over again throughout the land . Turkey possesses an unmeasured power that could be developed from the rivers that rush from the highlands to the sea . Often these streams are great rivers ? the Tigris , Euphrates , or Kizl Irmak ? flowing through narrow gorges , surging along with mighty force , fed by the eternal snows of Ararat , Taurus , or Lebanon . Turkey has never been a manufacturing country , but has shipped abroad her raw materials ? silk and wool and hides ? and has received them back in cloth and shoes . With this water-power harnessed in its mountain valleys the future generation might see their land not only a source of agricultural and mineral products , but also a transformer of these into forms all ready for the markets of the world . COMMERCIAL , ADVANTAGES But perhaps the greatest resource , after all , of this country arises from its geographic position . Three arms stretch out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , " one to " the continent of the present , " and a third to " the continent of the future . " Can there be found anywhere else in the world a position so naturally suited for commanding the world 's trade ? And in the development of the people who have been nurtured in this land this characteristic of trading ability has been bred . The Phoenicians sailed to the farthest  | seas and made Sidon and Tyre the world centers for commerce . The Greeks , putting out from their islands near by the Asia Minor shore and from Ephesus and other cities of the mainland , were the great carriers and traders of ancient times . We read that King Solomon , taking advantage of his location beween Egypt and Assyria , carried on a great business of mercantile exchange between these empires and became a merchant prince , whose renown spread to the corners of the earth . Following in the footsteps of their ancestors , the people of those lands , the Syrians and Greeks and Armenians , have established a reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce between the north and the south and the east and the west should pass across this country . In years gone by all the nations of Europe maintained commercial representatives and warehouses in the city of Aleppo . This center was the mart of exchange between Europe and the eastern lands . That position could easily be recovered and surpassed , for the city lies at the natural point of meeting of the great world trade routes . SPLENDID NATURAL , HARBORS There are natural harbors which with little engineering could become suitable terminals for the land routes . In constructing the Bagdad Railway Germany had obtained a concession to construct a harbor and stores at the city of Alexandretta , near to the place where Alexander defeated Darius , King of Persia . Germany was also to have the privilege of policing this port with her own subjects . The importance of Beirut , Tripoli , and Smyrna as ports has already been recognized and they are destined to increase . Constantinople is perhaps the finest harbor in the world , and at this point must pass most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been and still should be not the bankrupt nation , but the banker nation of three continents . With each of the topics here presented there has always been an " if " or an " ought to be " or " might become . " Turning the pages of history , one reads what this country has been . Reading the daily papers , one knows what the country is . Letting imagination dwell upon the resources provided by nature and the capabilities of the people , one can form a vision of the country 's future if only one great change can be brought about . In 1453 Mohammed the Conqueror surrounded the city of Constantinople and finally caused the downfall of that city , which had stood for eight centuries as the eastern outpost of Christendom . In 1517 the city of Jerusalem and the land of Egypt also fell . The succeeding 400 years have witnessed the gradual degradation of the land . The cotton and corn fields of Mesopotamia are now deserts and swamps . The mines once worked have been abandoned . The cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today but bazaars for petty bargains and deceit . The people , with the history of a great past and with capacities second to none , are by injustice and persecution driven from their homes to foreign lands or subjected to a determined plan of extermination by deportation , massacre , and famine . The one change that must precede all others , therefore , in order to take the first steps toward realizing the possibilities of which this land and these people are capable is to rid the country of its present rulers . It is not merely to " drive the Turk out of Europe , " for that has practically been done already , but to deprive him of every vestige of authority . Not only have the Christian races suffered at his hand , but the common Turkish people themselves have suffered almost equal wrongs . Before all bars of judgment , because of his incapacity , his inefficiency , and his atrocities , he has forfeited every right to rule . THE PARABLE Or THE UNPROFITABLE SERVANT The parable tells of the servant who , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this judgment passed upon him : " From him that bath not shall be taken away even that which he bath . And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness . " And there is no longer one judgment for individuals and another for governments .  | This one change having been made and the forfeited talent having been given to a government that has proved its ability , then the dream for these long-oppressed lands can become a reality . But this change should not mean the handing of Turkey over to be divided up into " spheres of influence " to satisfy colonial ambitions , no matter how long cherished , nor the breaking up of the country into a series of petty States , thus repeating the Balkan menace ; but it should mean giving this land a good reorganizing government backed by the much-hoped-for League of Nations . With this good government the country , which has long been an unsanitary plague spot , a constant health menace to Europe , will be cleaned up ; adequate schools will be provided ; courts of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be constructed ; industries will spring up and the resources of mountain and plain will contribute their share to the support of the world . " Then shall the wilderness blossom as the rose " and " every man shall sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree and none shall make them afraid . "  |
