&gt; After months of resisting the demands of students and faculty , Frank L. Hereford Jr. , president of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , yielded last week . He resigned his membership in the nearby Farmington Country Club , an institution that denies admission to blacks . Hereford stated that he had hoped to change the club 's restrictive practices by retaining his membership and working from within . Even when Farmington members voted overwhelmingly to uphold the club 's racial rules ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) , Hereford hung on , hoping that the Farmington board of directors would reject the vote . But after the board failed to do so , Hereford said he could no longer accept the club 's " segregationist policy " and quit . Eighteen other club members joined Hereford in handing in their resignations , including Jill Rinehart , a Charlottesville councilwoman and wife of the president of Farmington . <P> &gt; At Bennington College in Vermont , Joseph S. Iseman , 59 , a New York lawyer and member of the school 's board of trustees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 . Parker and her husband Thomas , 33 , vice president of the college , had resigned after heavy pressure from the faculty . Only three years earlier , the couple had been welcomed to the campus as a young , innovative team . Since last fall , however , many faculty members had refused to work with President Parker , charging that she was uncommunicative and aloof . They were particularly aroused by a Parker report on the future of the college that , among other recommendations , called for an end to the tenure system at Bennington . Still bitter about the dispute , Gail Parker says : " I quit because it was n't worth it . I 'm not willing to be abused unless I 'm damned sure there will be some real gain . " Iseman 's tenure will also be short . He plans to leave in June , and the search is already on for a new president .
