The Brae Burn course , where the National Amateur Golf Championship was decided last week , lies in the shape of a green diminutive South America among the neat suburban back yards of West Newton , Mass . It is a hard course , harder than it was nine years ago for the National Open . In the qualifying rounds , no one broke 70 and 157 was good enough to get into the playoffs . George Voigt. playing in a green sweater and bright green stockings , slouched around the course last week with a cheerful , sarcastic expression and won the medal with 143 . <P> In the first day of match-play , five former champions-Von Elm , Marston , Sweetser , Ouimet , and Chick Evans-were put out of the tournament . Voigt , after beating Sweetser , played through the quarter finals to meet Phil Perkins , the British Walker Cup Captain , in the semifinals . Bobby Jones , playing better every day , after going to an extra-hole to eliminate Gorton , the homeclub entrant , beat John Beck 14 and 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning round 9 up ; after lunch , while Voigt and Perkins started out , he stood on the practice tee driving ball after ball through exactly the same trajectory far down the fairway to where two caddies waited to pick them up . After every perfect drive , Jones ' face grew darker . Then he went out on the course and played six more holes with Phil Finlay , a shaky , hard-hitting Harvard boy ; by this time he had won his match , 13 up and 12 to play . <P> Voigt and Perkins were fighting it out a little harder .

He kept on losing holes after that and the match was over on the 14th after they both played in from the rough around the green to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had started his afternoon round , threw away his cigaret without lighting another . They walked back to the club house in a drizzle ; Perkins carried an umbrella with a bamboo handle while his caddy walked in the rain , eating an apple . <P> The first hole at Brae Burn is 337 yards with a brook at the depth of the fairway , just below the green . Smart golfer ' , use an iron from the tee for a long pitch to the green rather than take a chance on driving into the brook . When Jones and Perkins went out to play their match , Perkins took an iron out , Jones took a wooden club-and a six for the hole to Perkins ' four . Perkins was one up until the fourth ; then Jones evened the match . At the end of the morning round , Jones was 6 up ; at the end of the match , on the ninth green that afternoon , he was 10 up . Perkins threw away his cigaret again and walked over to shake hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played , Mr. Jones . " Bobby Jones , winning his fourth national amateur tournament in five years , smiled for a moment and then he looked strained and tired as he had looked hitting practice drives before the second round in his semifinal . <P> ...
