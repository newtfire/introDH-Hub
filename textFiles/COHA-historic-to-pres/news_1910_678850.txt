Not Pejoravistic . In Tuesday 's TimEs , over the signature ni Samuel P. Brigham of Grand Island . Neb. , I find among other thoughts this introductory passage : " I desire publicly to protest against the pejorative allusion of your correspondent . ? W. J. L. , ' in your issue of the 15th inst .. in which he uses the sentence : ' No Mills hotels . either . ' " The gentleman from the Cornfield Slate is looking through a glass darkly . and I hope there is nothing else in the glass . I was not pejoravistic , in my allusion , to any Mills hotel in this town . What I was talking about was a great hotel in New York for middle class people at popular prices  --  not popular . perhaps . in Manhattan , but everywhere else in this broad and beauteous land . Such a hotel as I had in mind was primarily for the accommodation of merchants coming to New York to . buy goods . Not always , but often . these merchants . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring their wives , and naturally they would want to stop at the same hotel ? at least the wives would want their husbands at the same hotel with them . Now , Mr. Brigham knows well enough that If a man and his wife sought accommodations at a Mills hotel they would n't get in . This being the case , what would the poor woman do ? Let us sincerely hope that Mr. B. did n't bring his wife along when he came to town and stopped at the Mills . P. S. ? Incidentally , T should love to know if 1 ii pejorative " is n't rather sesquipedalian for a colloquialism use in Nebraska .
