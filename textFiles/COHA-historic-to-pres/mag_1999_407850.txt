These trends will shape the future of nutrition , restructure how we think about food and change what we eat in the 21st century - and beyond . Photograph Photograph Red Pepper Pesto Chicken Breasts // remember when everyone thought eating would be over by the 21st century because we 'd all be popping meals in pill form ? Well , the new millennium 's just around the corner , and food is hardly a dead issue . In fact , with all the buzz about antioxidants and phytochemicals , nutrition is on everyone 's front burner . " We 're entering the second golden age of nutrition , " says Mark Messina , Ph.D. , associate professor of nutrition at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda , Calif . Like the discovery of the first vitamin at the turn of the century , newly discovered compounds will revolutionize the way we view nutrition . Until now , science tended to define it in terms of preventing deficiencies and diseases . In the future , we 'll delve deeper , exploring how specific nutrients affect us on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function and age . As for pill popping , it 's now clear that we need to down a few supplements a day to fill nutritional gaps . But that 's only a small part of the package . To eat better , stay healthy and control weight you need to include what we 've identified as the Big 6 : the six most important nutrition trends of the next millennium - foods you must eat for maximum health and nutrition . These trends will shape the future of nutrition , restructure how we think about food and change what we eat in the 21st century and beyond . To show you how easy it is to incorporate them into your daily diet , we 've developed a Big 6 Five-Day Meal Plan that 's packed with deliciously creative dishes and recipes - you wo n't have to wait another minute ( much less for the 21st century to roll in ) to try them ! But first , let 's take a closer look at how each of these trends will help you get your new millennium off to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutrition Universe 1 phytochemicals Forget fortified this or that . If you really want to be healthy , get back to the basics with whole foods , virtual gold mines of phytochemicals . These potent compounds , found in more than 12,000 different forms in foods like fruits , vegetables , garlic , soybeans , walnuts , wheat erm , red wine and green tea , have turned the four food groups upside down in the past five years . Take garlic and onions . With virtually no vitamins or minerals , for years they languished in the dungeon of the food pyramid . Ditto for green tea . But when scientists discovered all three were loaded with phytochemicals , they attained celebrity status faster than Matt Damon . The phytos in garlic and onions may lower breast-cancer risk ; those in green tea may fight heart disease . Some found in strawberries ( ellagic acid , ferrulic acid , caffeic acid , p-courmaric , chlorogenic acid and lycopene ) may protect against age-accelerated nerve damage while folic acid , a phyto in whole grains , may enhance fiber 's protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . Experts say they 've barely scratched the surface when it comes to the health  --  enhancing and disease-fighting abilities of the mighty phytos . Phytoestrogens , another type of phytochemical , may boost immunity , help keep blood vessels flexible and block estrogen from entering cells . While most abundant in soy ( see Trend No. 2 ) , they 're also found in more than 300 other types of plants , including all members of the bean family , clover and alfalfa sprouts and whole grains . Since they 're concentrated in the grain 's bran and germ , refining removes most of the phytos - another reason to skip refined white bread and egg noodles and go for the whole food . " Phytochemicals have completely changed the way we view foods , " says Messina . " It 's no longer appropriate to evaluate a food solely on its vitamin , mineral and fiber content . " Not that anyone 's dismissing vitamins and minerals ; experts still consider them the most important substances on earth . But they also suspect that vitamins and minerals pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news : You 're already consuming thousands of them every day in your favorite foods without even trying . How much you need : It may be decades before scientists establish optimal doses or understand exactly how phytochemicals and nutrients interact , says Winston Craig , Ph.D. , R.D. , chairman/professor of nutrition at Andrews University in Berrien Springs , Mich . But we do know that the more phytochemical-rich fruits , vegetables , and whole grains you eat , the more protection you get . The Best Bean on Earth soy 2 Soy is such a phytochemical Wunderkind we 've made it a separate trend . It 's loaded with saponins , which may block cholesterol absorption ; as little as 25 grams a day of soy protein may lower cholesterol levels by 10 percent . Soy also contains high levels of phytosterols , which may lower the risk of colon cancer by hindering abnormal cell growth . In addition , soy is high in protease inhibitors , which may slow tumor growth by suppressing enzyme activity in cancer cells . Finally , soy is packed with phytoestrogens , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block estrogen from entering cells . They also may reduce the risk for hormone-related cancers like ovarian , prostate and breast cancers and even help curb symptoms of menopause . In the 21st century , scientists will be delving into promising new evidence that phytoestrogens boost brain function , treat alcoholism and hypertension and prevent middle-age weight gain and cataracts . Not bad for a lowly bean . How much you need : For best results , have two to three servings daily . ( One serving is 1/2 cup tofu or 1 cup soy milk . ) New Millenium Age Defiers 3 anitoxidants You already know that antioxidants , found largely in fruits and vegetables ( see Trend No. 6 ) , lower the risk of heart disease , cancer , cataracts and arthritis . But new research shows that antioxidants like vitamins E and C and selenium may do more than halt the progression of age-related diseases . Jeffrey Blumberg , Ph.D. , professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University in Boston , says they could actually slow the aging process . Two recent studies , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more antioxidants could lessen age-related damage to the central nervous system and slow age-related memory loss . Scientists also believe that antioxidants may help reduce the risk of cervical cancer , prevent preeclampsia in pregnancy and slow the progression of Alzheimer 's disease . How much you need : Eight to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day , at least four servings of whole grains ( for selenium ) and one serving of nuts . The Magic Bullet vitamin e 4 This is one pill you definitely need to take daily , especially since new studies show we need far greater amounts of this antioxidant than we could possibly get from our diets . Vitamin E lowers the risk of heart disease , prevents or slows the progression of atherosclerosis . helps tirevent fatal heart attacks , improves recovery and prognosis from open-heart surgery and may help regress atherosclerotic plaque ( artery-clogging fat that causes heart disease and stroke ) . Vitamin E also inhibits cancer growth , protects the eyes from age-related vision loss and boosts the immune system , thus revving the body 's natural defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're likely to see even more benefits , including anti-aging and memory  --  boosting effects . How much you need : Two studies published last year in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that natural vitamin E supplements ( d-alpha-tocopherol or the new term RRR-alpha ) are twice as effective as the synthetic versions ( dl-alpha-tocopherol or all-rac-alpha ) because natural E is absorbed better by the body and increases blood levels of the vitamin . The only downside of the natural version is that it costs more . To make sure you 're getting enough , take 100 IU of natural E a day or 200 IU of the synthetic version . A Fish Tale for the New Millennium 5 omega-3 fatty acids It 's common knowledge that the " good " fats in fish , called omega-3 fatty acids , lower the risk of heart disease and may be useful in treating lupus , arthritis and allergies . But preliminary research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda . Md. , shows that increasing intakes of omega-3s also could boost serotonin activity and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until recently , preventing osteoporosis focused on calcium . But that 's likely to change as scientists delve into the results of research at Indiana 's Purdue University showing that omega-3s trigger bone cells to deposit calcium . How much you need : No optimal dose has been set for omega-3s . Recommendations range from 2-10 grams daily , or what you 'd get from three to seven 3-ounce servings of fatty fish ( salmon , tuna , herring , sardines ) weekly . To play it safe , eat at least two servings a week and avoid supplements ; excessive omega-3s may thin the blood . Platelets , essential in blood clotting , become less sticky in the presence of omega3s . Also , research shows that the Inuit , whose diet is high in fatty fish , have low risk for heart attack but a slightly higher risk of stroke , although scientists are n't sure why . The New Fountain of Youth 6 fruits &; vegetables We know , you know , probably even your dog knows ( from zillions of studies spanning decades ) that diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce your risk for heart disease , cancer , diabetes , hypertension , cataracts and possibly arthritis . Eight to 10 servings a day can cut your cancer risk in half . But that 's just the tip of what appears to be an iceberg of health benefits stemming from produce . New research shows eating more produce could help keep us healthier and younger longer . In 1998 , researchers from the University of Naples in Italy studied people between the ages of 70 and 100-plus years and found that those who lived the longest were also the healthiest . Their secret ? They ate a lot more fruits and vegetables than their younger , less-healthy friends . While the risk of disease seems to drop in direct proportion to the amount of produce you consume , studies show fruits and veggies that come in rich , vibrant colors , such as oranges , grapefruit , blueberries , romaine lettuce , spinach and broccoli , are more potent than pastel-colored produce like iceberg lettuce , bananas , celery , corn and potatoes . How much you need : Pile your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrots , dark-green leafy vegetables , broccoli , kiwi , blueberries , strawberries , oranges or kale each day and you , too , could live to celebrate your 120th birthday .
