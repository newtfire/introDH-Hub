The withered soul of postwar Japan By Henry Scott Stokes Here m this city we have a huge drifting vessel . Let us call it the SS Labyrinth . Somewhere there must be a bridge , an engine room . But where ? No one knows . What remains ? Certainty that our myths are lost ? the good , full earth , the secure home ? gone . ? Kohn Abe hen I first arrived in Japan some twenty-one years ago , I was pretty confident that I knew the territory , At the ripe old age of twenty-six I was a correspondent for the Financial Times of London , and l had prepared myself for my new post with more than a little care . I had studied the economic statistics , which were extraordinary : all the basic indicators pointed straight up , with no ceiling in sight . I had struggled through Edwin 0 . Reischauer 's history of postwar Japan , an infinitely dull book foisted on all newcomers . All I had left to do , I figured , was explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Noh theater , meet a geisha or two and I could return to England a full-fledged " Japan hand , " ready to interpret the meaning of the New Asia to a breathless West . At the end of two years in Tokyo , I returned to England hollow-eyed and exhausted . For all my well-meaning efforts , I had been completely unable to make contact with the reality of Japanese life . My problem went much deeper than the language barrier ; I had never experienced anything remotely like the total bafflement I encountered in Japan . I could n't make Japanese friends . I lived in a hotel , unwilling even to go to the trouble of finding an apartment for myself . For the first time in my career as a journalist , 1 was in over my head . After a year 's rest in England I returned to Japan , newly employed by the Times of London and freshly resolved not to give up this time around . I was going to meet the leading Japanese ; I was going to learn to speak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the Japanese enigma at last . It was then , full of enthusiasm and good intentions , that I first met the novelist Yukio Mishima . Literature has fallen into disrepute in Japan of late . Instead of dreaming of writing novels , today 's young Japanese dream of writing software programs . But the Japanese once venerated their great novelists as mural spokesmen . The leading novelists of the 1960s ? Kobo Abe , Kenzaburo 0e , Shusaku Endo ? were the uncrowned kings of the Japanese intellectual world . Without a doubt , Yukio Mishima was the most singular member Henry Scott Stokes is a contributing editor of Harper 's . From 1978 to 1983 he was Tokyo bureau chief of the New York Times . He is the author of The Life and Death of Yukio Mishima and is currently at work on a book about business in Japan . of this talented company . A popular and prolific writer , Mishima was also a self-avowed homosexual with a wife and two children , a trenchant critic , a tough-guy movie actor , a muscular sportsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spare time , commanded a private army . When the New York Times Magazine featured him on its cover in 1970 , it described him as " the Renaissance man of Japan . " And Yasunari Kawabata , who in 1968 won the Nobel Prize Yukio had coveted so passionately , went so far as to say : " Only once in every 300 years or so do we find a writer of the quality of Mishima . " Thanks to Yukio Mishima , all the frustrations of my previous tour of duty in Japan quickly melted away . Unlike almost every other Japanese I have ever met , Yukio was devastatingly frank . One rarely gets a straight answer in Japan , the land where " yes " more often than not means " no " ; from Yukio , 1 got no other kind . Though he was an odd and bizarre character , part gentleman and part gangster , I loved him all the same . And it was from Yukio 's death ? his sensational public suicide by disembowelment on November 25 , 1970 ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . harles de Gaulle once dismissed the Japanese as " transistor salesmen . " Many Americans seem to view them as virtuous , productive residents of the fifty-first state . The endless stream of scholarly tomes with titles like Asia 's New Giant or Japan as Number One that pours from the busy presses of American universities attests to the tunnel vision of our top " authorities " on Japan . This passage from George Gilder 's The Spirit of Enterprise is , in its well-meant naivet ? , all too typical of the American view of Japan today : " Something entirely new happened amid the ruins of postwar Japan . In learning from this amazing history , it is well to begin with the lesson we so laboriously taught the Japanese : humility . " Gilder , 1 daresay , has a few lessons to learn about the Japanese . To begin with , they are caustic , perceptive , intuitive , subtle , and fundamentally hostile to foreigners . Like the British , they are an island people with enormous psychic resources when it comes to dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry , " a retired British ambassador once told me , " that the crucial fact of Japanese history is isolation . " ) And the great economic " miracle " of postwar Japan , as Yukio Mishima taught me , means very little to these proud people . japan is still deeply traumatized by its unconditional surrender to the Allies . At the end of World War 11 , the Japanese , heirs to a military tradition that stretches back eight centuries , found themselves under the thumb of a foreign power for the first time in more than 2,000 years of recorded history ; they were forced to abandon an ancient tradition of martial valor and to accept an American-drafted constitution in which " the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or the use of force as a means of settling international disputes . " Viewed against the backdrop of so bitter a loss of face , the postwar prosperity of the Japanese is a mere triviality . They see their vast wealth as minimal compensation for the hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases in every strategic corner of the Japanese archipelago , continues to this day . The Japanese have built one of the richest and most productive nations on earth . But the cost has been high : they have had to set aside their ancient culture and shatter their country 's ecology . There is no restoring the primeval forests and white sand beaches that have been taken over by businessmen 's golf courses and giant concrete tetrapods . To the average American , unsightly highways are ar worst a minor scenic annoyance ; to the Japanese , whose aesthetic tendencies permeate every aspect of day-to. day life , the cost of capitalism has necessarily been agonizing . And prosperity has brought more than barren beaches . The country 's leading artists have been pushed to the edge of an abyss of apathy and paralysis . I am not thinking just of the fact that a country which once produced some of the world 's most important movies has turned to grinding out soft porn , or that no good novels have been written here since the 1960s . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . ) What disturbs me most is that those Japanese artists who have remained active are all frank exponents of decadence . I think of Eiko Ishioka , widely acclaimed as Japan 's outstanding graphic designer , whose work is dominated by explicit images of pedophilia . I think of buto , the dance form whose scatological references ? mimed farting , defecation , and belching ? are a symbolic scream of pain from the bowels of industrialized Japan . And I think especially of artists like Seiji Ozawa and Shusaku Arakawa , who have chosen the ultimate act of cultural repudiation : emigration to the West . ukio Mishima visited my home in Tokyo not long before his death . Another guest , a diplomat from Ghana , was waxing lyrical that evening on the subject of Ghanaian taboos , curses , black magic. ; Yukio sat on the floor cradling a glass of Scotch in his hand , obviously entranced . At length he cut in . " We have curses in Japan , too , you know . " He laughed : a throaty , affected bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse of the green snake . " Those words were to ring in my ears for years after Yukio 's death . What they referred to , I eventually came to realize , was nothing less than the entire pseudo-American way of life that the Japanese have affected in the years since 1945 . Yukio left behind on the day of his death the final pages of The Decay of the Angel , the last novel in The Sea of Fertility , the four-volume romanfleuve that occupied him throughout the last four years of his life . The Decay of the Angel is a brittle , staccato sketch of a Japan dominated by commerce , a place where all human values have collapsed . Toward the end of the book , the aged narrator , Honda , taxis through the countryside near Nara , the formal capital of imperial Japan , once one of the most beautiful parts of the nation ? a great plain of paddies ? but now an automobile dump . The Daigo district was a clutter of all the dreary details of new construction to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , television towers and power lines , Coca-Cola advertisements and drive.in snack bars . Among heaps of rubble below cliffs where wild daisies stabbed at the sky were automobile dumps , blue and yellow and black , the cars piled precariously one on the other . At this sad accumulation . Honda thought of an adventure story he had read as a child , and of the heaps of ivory in the swamp where elephants go to die . Perhaps , sensing the approach of death , automobiles too gather at their own graveyards . For Yukio , Japan was a victim of American imperialism ; he was convinced that the Japanese had abandoned their own values and been culturally colonized by America . Not that he had a solution , a policy . No , all Yukio really wanted was to see the barbarians driven hack into the sea . And he did n't particularly care how the job was to be done . At the end he despised Western culture ; most of all , he rejected Western humanist ideals , which he thought were a poisonous threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yukio wrote : As Isao watched he realized that before one could attack with one 's whole being like Sawa , there were many rivers to be leaped over . And one clouded stream that never ran dry was that choked with the scum of humanism , the poison spewed out by the factory at its headwaters . There it was : its lights burning brilliantly as it worked even through the night ? the factory of Western European ideals . The pollution from that factory degraded the exalted fervor to kill .... . Isao , a thirties terrorist , Mishima 's alter ego , and the hero of the book , is here taking a lesson from Sawa on how to stab a man to death . His target is an aging capitalist ? a symbol of the bourgeois West . It is against this background that the true meaning of Yukio Mishima 's utio Mishima must have known that the prominent right-wing Yl politicians who had so stealthily backed him would instantly disavow him on hearing of his suicide . But he paid them no heed , fully committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his day were not prepared to discuss openly : the cause of reviving the national pride and remilitarizing Japan . And the Japanese are beginning to catch up with him ; I fully expect the fifteenth anniversary of Mishima 's suicide to be the occasion for articles in the Japanese press that will portray him as a hero ? even if the rest of the media still prefer to regard him as taboo . A few Westerners have already noted this trend . ( " I believe that Mishima will prove to be the most famous Japanese of all time , " says Columbia University professor Donald Keene . ) But most have not . As the fortieth anniversary of Hiroshima rolled around , my Western colleagues in Tokyo busied themselves filing optimistic stories on the future of Japan , having long since dismissed Yukio Mishima as a crank . Asked about Mishima not long ago , Alvin Toffler remarked : " The fact that he formed a cult and marched into a military headquarters to kill himself is more of a curiosity than anything else . It saddens one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychotic . " Oddly enough , Toffler , in his book Previews and Premises , also acknowledged the immense significance of Yukio 's death ? that fleeting glimpse into the cauldron of anti-Americanism that seethes at the center of Japanese life . The Mishima incident a decade or so ago ought to remind Washington that there remains in Japan a tiny , yet virulent and potentially dangerous , political group whose goal is remilitarization . Every time Washington twists Japan 's arm to spend more on warplanes or to increase the size of its navy to help patrol the Pacific sea lanes , it inadvertently lends support to this group of extremists ? which , as a matter of fact , is ultra-nationalist and hence anti-American .... The result is a rising resentment that could easily explode if trade and economic pressures worsen . One wonders whether Toffler would modify these remarks if he knew that the " tiny yet virulent group " numbers among its members two Japanese prime ministers . Imagine the following scenario : Norman Mailer , having definitively lost interest in the novel as a viable art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neo-Nazi . He organizes a small group of eccentric right-wing college students into a private army which he proposes to use to help the police quell anti-apartheid protests at various universities . Caspar Weinberger , seeking to further his political ambitions , gives Mailer permission to train his army at Fort Benning . And Ronald Reagan diverts from a slush fund the cash necessary to underwrite Mailer 's activities . In America , such a scenario would be absurd on the face of it ; in Japan , though such things do not happen every day , something very similar did happen to Yukio Mishima . Early in 1968 , around the time I first came to know him , Yukio decided to organize what he called " the world 's smallest and most spiritual army . " Yukio 's private army , known as the TatenokaiJapanese for Shield Society ? consisted of about seventy students . Many of them were drawn from sports clubs at Tokyo universities ; most of them were politically well to the right . They trained at a boot camp on Mount Fuji , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-day exercise in which regular officers from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces were giving the orders . Yukio told Me that the Tatenokai was meant to serve as a " militia " that would join police on the streets of Tokyo in fighting the Zengakuren , the infinitely more violent Japanese equivalent of American student groups of the 1960s like SDS . " Byron had 300 men and he built ships , " Yukio explained with a smile . " Why should n't I do something ? " But Yukio 's real purpose in organizing the Tatenokai was anything but Byronic . He meant to shape his little army into a suicide squad ? and to cap its efforts with his own hara-kiri . For all his candor , Yukio never shared with me the full story of the Tatenokai ; I discovered it on my own after his death . It turned out that he had two very powerful allies in high places : Eisaku Sato , prime minister of Japan from 1964 to 1972 , and Yasuhiro Nakasone , who was defense minister at the time of Mishima 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of the Tatenokai with funds raised by right-wing Japanese businessmen ; Nakasone made it possible for Yukio to train his army on Mount Fuji . ( To date , no Japanese newspaper has printed anything about the Mishima-Nakasone-Sato connection , though its existence is widely known among Japanese journalists . ) The truth about Yukio 's ties to the Japanese right will probably not be known for decades . But I do not doubt that what persuaded the two prime ministers to back him was the fact that he was the only respected intellec-tual of his generation who openly espoused right-wing ideal 's and the old slogans of emperor worship . The leaders of the ruling party believed that it was losing its broad base of public support and needed to increase its follow-ing among the young . At which point appeared the obliging Mishima , shouting his anachronistic slogans and posturing on the battlements . He must immediately have struck Sato and Nakasone as an ally in the battle for public opinion . In such a fashion was the unholy alliance between Yukio and the politicians sealed . n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief for the New York Times . I flew over on a jumbo jet loaded with Japanese businessmen in dark blue suits . They were slim , taut , tense . I had n't seen a group of Japanese men for five years , and I was taken aback by their solemnity , their air of purposefulness . They were trading-company officials and engineers . But they seemed more like troops returning from the front . They could n't relax . All through the night they sat up , jackets on and ties straight . I heard no wisecracking ; I saw only a little drinking . Most of them were composing their reports , tiny calculators in hand . 1. lociked at them and wondered : How on earth can I possibly convey to the readers of the New York Times the rigidity and seriousness of this country ? I would see many more blue-suited businessnien on my arrival in Tokyo . The historian Takeshi Muramatsu , one of Mishima 's closest friends and now perhaps the foremost conservative intellectual in Japan , put it very simply when he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is money , money , money . " Many liberals I know in Japan are just as critical . " Look , " Shuichi Kato , a left-wing cultural historian , said to me , " you remember the Kempeitai ? the military police of prewar Japan , the most feared and despised group of Japanese in this century . Well , the Japanese advertising agencies are the Kempeitai of today . The only difference is that they are a hundred times more powerful and sinister than the Kempeitai . They are everywhere . " One day 1 went to visit an artist whose work I had loved ? Tadanori Yokoo , once one of the finest poster artists in the world . His latest drawnews event in the postwar history of Japan . Accompanied by four members of the Tatenokai , all in full dress uniform , Yukio seized control of the main army compound in downtown Tokyo by taking as hostage the four-star general in command at the base ? who had innocently accepted Mishima 's request for an interview . By threatening the general at knifepoint , Yukio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , only a mile from the prime minister 's office . He then made his last public appearance , haranguing the soldiers from a balcony jutting over the parade ground . Yukio 's speech , made all but inaudible by the prop wash from police helicopters , was short and banal , a desperate rehashing of all the standard right-wing themes : constitutional reform . legalization of the military , nationalist pride . His sole aim was to clarify the reasons for which he was preparing to die . ( Reports at the time that he intended to stage a bona fide coup were wide of the mark . ) Pan he quickly recognized that the common soldiers who had assembled to hear him were , at best , nonplussed by his rhetoric . Mishima , enraged by their passivity , finally lost all patience . " I see that you are nothing bur mercenaries , " he shrieked . " You will do nothing for your country . I have lost my dream for you . You are nothing but a bunch of American mercenaries , I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other means , Mishima spat out what was fur him the ultimate insult . And it went home . On a recording of the speech , you can hear a muffled grumbling from the soldiers as they digest his accusation . Then an isolated cry of " Drag him down ! " Followed by : " Shoot him . Kill him ! " Mishima promptly retired to the general 's office and disemboweled himself . Hissho Morita , a twenty-five-year-old member of the Tatenokai , completed the ritual of seppuku by cutting off Mishima 's head ; another member of the Tatenokai performed the same service for Morita . Before the bodies had cooled , the politicians were on the air . Eisaku Sato , waylaid by reporters while rushing back to his office for a briefing from the army and the police , told them that Mishima had gone kichigai ? mad . Yasuhiro Nakasone ventured the mild comment that perhaps the line that divides genius from madness is thin . Both men denounced Yukio 's actions without reserve ; neither man gave any hint of his close connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Yukio Mishima was closed . Yukio 's suicide , I have come to realize , was not merely an anti-American gesture . It was also a rebuke to the emperor . At a debate he took part in with left-wing students at Tokyo University he grandly declared : You and I are the same . The only difference between us is that I have a card you lack up my sleeve , a joker : the emperor . " Yukio 's attitude toward the emperor , man and institution alike , was central to his political thought . He was highly critical of Hirohito , who , at the behest of General MacArthur , announced in 1946 that he was not in fact a deity in human form . ( In Yukio 's novel Voices of the Heroic Dead , a chorus of dead kamikaze pilots chants : " Why did the Emperor have to become a human being ? " ) For Mishima , this declaration only compounded the humiliation of Japan 's first surrender . Millions of men had died in the name of the emperor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese used seppuku , the prayerful rite of hara-kiri , as a means of remonstrance . A loyal subject could not besmirch the honor of his lord and master by direct spoken criticism ; that would be disloyal . Silent , he must take his own life . " His was a battlefield without glory , " Mishima wrote in his short story " Patriotism " of a young Imperial Army lieutenant who committed hara-kiri , " a battlefield where none could display deeds of valor : it was the front line of the spirit . " So , too , would Mishima commit hara-kiri as a signal to the nation : a spiritual coup d ' ? tat . That is the key to Yukio 's action ? and it explains why , for years after his death , no one here would talk about him . Westerners visiting Japan who made the mistake of asking about Mishima were greeted with the coldest of stares . Yukio had touched on the ultimate Japanese taboo : the emperor . Thus he became taboo as well . No Japanese biography of Mishima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the final volume of The Sea of Fertility . Paul Schrader 's new movie Mishima , filmed in Japan with Japanese actors , very likely will never be seen in Japanese theaters ; indeed , the organizers of a recent film festival in Tokyo , after having announced plans to close the festival with the first showing of Mishima , changed their minds and removed the film from the program . ( One Japanese film executive pronounced the movie " unsuitable for Japanese minds . " ) Some have argued that Yukio 's suicide was intended merely as a culminatory work of art ; Schrader has said in interviews that he considers the suicide to be " ninety percent art , ten percent politics . " Others , standing this argument on its head , have called Yukio 's final gesture a grotesque failure : not only was he unable to stir the troops at lchigaya , but he was unable to conduct a proper seppuku . ( When Morita tried to slice off Yukio 's head , he kept cutting into his shoulders , making a fearful mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd to his countrymen at the time of his death . He told a friend : " 1 come out on stage hoping to make the audience weep , and instead they burst out laughing . " He did not plan that ghastly , botched exit on the floor of Mashita 's office . But it perhaps suited his grand design to die a clown 's death , a samurai burlesque rooted in the ancient Japanese tradition of heroic failure . Ivan Morris , a distinguished scholar of Japanese history and a close friend of Mishima 's , wrote in his book The Nobility of Failure : There is another type of hero in the complex Japanese tradition , a man whose career usually belongs to a period of unrest and warfare and represents the very antithesis of an ethos of accomplishment . He is the man whose single-minded sincerity will not allow him to make the maneuvers and compromises that are so often needed fur mundane success .... The submissive majority , while bearing its discontents in safe silence , can find vicarious satisfaction in identifying itself emotionally with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that all their efforts are crowned with failure lends them a pathos which characterizes the general vanity of human endeavor and makes them the most loved and evocative of heroes . Will Yukio Mishima eventually figure as a hero in this Japanese tradition ? For Ivan Morris , whose book is dedicated to Yukio 's memory , there was no question ; for the Japanese right , the answer today is just as certain . " After Mishima died , " Morris told me shortly before his own death in 1976 , " I was contacted by people in New York , Japanese living there who knew I was a friend of his , and they invited me to a meeting , a private meeting , to commemorate the first anniversary of Mishima 's death . They were mostly trading company people and other business types . And instead of their usual blue suits , some of them wore hakama and formal kimono . It was an extremely solemn occasion held in Manhattan ? to mark the anniversary of a departed hero . " Not long ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo with a friend who works there . About thirty yards from the building there was a sound truck blaring right-wing slogans . The occupants of the truck were shouting abuse at the diplomats inside the ministry for their supposed compliance with the Soviet Union . " Today the Russians , " my friend said , " tomorrow the Americans . " As the Japanese-American trade imbalance continues to grow , we are likely to see more congressional resolutions urging Japan to take some of the burden of its own defense off the shoulders of the United States . But I wonder if the members of Congress on record as supporting the remilitarization of Japan ? for that , after all , is what we are really talking about here ? have reflected on the Japanese traditions that would necessarily guide such a ' militarization . Uninformed Americans , wholly unaware of the ancient military traditions of Japan , have long been urging the citizens of this strange country to put on their samurai bucklers once again . The first to do so was the original cold warrior himself , Jahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , Dulles went to Tokyo to urge General MacArthur to find some way to circumvent Article IX , the section of the American-drafted " peace constitution " that specifically denies Japan the right to have military forces . Though this first attempt was unsuccessful , the Pentagon and the Japanese right have been trying to rearm Japan ever since . Last year Japan became the world 's leading creditor nation . Its net for-eign assets now exceed those of any other country , including the United States , which has slipped so far as to have become a net debtor . The Unit-ed States still pays virtually all of Japan 's defense bill . Japan allots less than one percent of its gross national product to military spending , as opposed to an average of almost 4 percent in most Western nations and more than 6 percent in the United States . " You take one look at those statistics and you know that Japan ca n't remain lightly armed indefinitely , " a businessman told me the other day . And he added with a chuckle : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In light of these developments , it is tempting to speculate on why Sato Defense Minister Koichi Kato recently suggested that the impact of any change in the Japanese defense posture would not be felt for ten or fifteen years . What matters , then , is laying the foundation well . It is significant that in planning its space program , the Japanese government insists on building the rockets ( so , at least , claim industry insiders ) . The satellites can come from the United States , but the rockets must be built by the home team . It is generally assumed by Japanese defense experts that the country could " go nuclear " within a matter of months in the event of a national emergency . With Japanese rocketry and guidance systems provided by the most reliable electronics industry in the world , that timetable becomes ominously pertinent . Not that the Japanese will exercise the nuclear option in the near future . Public opinion , in Japan and around the world , will see to that . Instead , we are likely to witness a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revise the " peace constitution " gather steam . But massive rearmament , public opinion notwithstanding , is almost inevitable . Prime Minister Nakasone is moving to eliminate the ceiling on defense spending , which has been in effect since 1976 ; parliament , which voted the ceiling , now appears ready to reverse its decision . If one extrapolates from current trends , the Japan of twenty years hence could well he one of the most militarily powerful nations in the world . And I find that a deeply unsettling prospect . Why ? Because of the hallowed tradition of self-destruction which is at the heart of Japanese culture and history . One sees it in the ritual of harakiri , which dates back to the thirteenth century ; one sees it in the decision to attack Pearl Harbor , a decision that makes Hitler 's move to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 seem meticulously considered by comparison . And one sees it in the case of Yukio Mishima : a world-famous author in his mid-forties , a man who had just missed receiving the Nobel Prize , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor himself , who chose at the peak of his success to commit suicide in a seemingly futile attempt to galvanize the Japanese will . The impulse to aestheticize every aspect of existence is profoundly Japanese . It is an impulse which Mishima shared : " I want , " he once said , " to make a poem or my life . " So it is not surprising that there is an aesthetic of J destruction in Japan . " Beauty , beautiful things , " Mishima wrote in The Temple of the Golden Pavilion , " those are now my most deadly enemies . " He believed in the higher beauty of Japanese remilitarization ? and of harakiri . And it is hard not to wonder if an atomic Japan , its culture and traditions savaged by economic competition with the West , might in the end choose the evil beauty of mass destruction . " The most appropriate type of daily life for me , " one reads in Yukio 's autobiographical essay Sun and Steel , " was a day-by-day world destruction : peace was the must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No moment is so dazzling as when everyday imagining concerning death and danger and world destruction are transformed into duty . " In the eyes of a Mishima , worldwide nuclear holocaust ? the prospect of which he frankly romanticized in his diaries ? might well be the propet aesthetic response to the death of civility implicit in the idea of a commercialized Japan . Not long ago a friend of mine , the distinguished historian Nobutoshi Hagihara , proposed in his book Experiencing the Twentieth Century that the government should hold a referendum on the 1947 constitution , giving the general public its first real opportunity to affirm that the constitution , with its renunciation of force , is more than just the hated product of foreign devils long since dead . This seems to me an essential step . Today , Japan has no strategic forces at all : no nuclear submarines , no aircraft carriers , no nuclear-tipped ICBMs . I do not know what is to come in Japan . But I am sure of this : the world is in enough trouble as it is without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicidal , nuclear-armed Japan .
