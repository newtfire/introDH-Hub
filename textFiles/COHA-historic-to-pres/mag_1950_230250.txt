Had he been of different temperament , Professor Francis Otto Matthiessen of Harvard University might well have rested content with his fame as a scholar . He was a bookish bachelor of mild manner and quiet voice , whose name had become one of the best known in the faculty . To his students , he was " Matthie , " always ready to receive them in his book-lined study , always prepared to help them if he could . To scholars , he was the brilliant authority on Henry and William James , and the author of a penetrating book on the times of Melville and Hawthorne , American Renaissance . <P> But Professor Matthiessen was also an idealist in his own way , a man of deep concern about matters not touched directly by letters . Though painfully shy , he once accepted the presidency of the Teachers Union at Harvard , championed the rights of teachers whenever he thought them abused . Though never a Communist , he found himself in sympathy with many of the works of the U.S.S.R. and the Communist Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1948 ) : " It knows what it wants , and brutalized as much of its practice may have been , it still points toward a goal that gives the dispossessed their only hope .

He was a sponsor of the Communist-inspired Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace , spoke up for the eleven Communist leaders convicted in Judge Harold Medina 's court . For a while his name made headlines . But recently , on leave from Harvard , he had been silent , busy with a new book on Theodore Dreiser . <P> One afternoon last week , Professor Matthiessen made his way downtown and engaged a room on the twelfth floor of the Manger , a commercial hotel next door to Boston 's North Station . That evening he went out to dinner at the Beacon Hill home of his old friend , Professor Kenneth B. Murdock . Though their talk was mostly of books and poetry , Matthie seemed unusually depressed . About 11:30 he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtown hotel , spread out a note to whom it might concern . " I have taken this room in order to do what I have to do , " it said . " How much the state of the world has to do with my state of mind , I do not know . But as a Christian and a Socialist , believing in international peace , I find myself terribly oppressed by the present tensions . " <P> Then , within a few minutes after entering his room , Francis Otto Matthiessen , 48 , took off his spectacles , stepped to the window , climbed over the sill and dropped to his death .
