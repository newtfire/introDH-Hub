There are many music types that emanate out of this small island ; however reggae is most popular . <p> Jamaica reggae is a particular rhythm style typified by accents on the off-beat and a thick base line . An off-shoot of rock steady music , Jamaican reggae was born and quickly became world famous mainly through the work of the legendary Bob Marley . The first Jamaican recording studio opened its doors in 1951 recording other forms of music as the Jamaica reggae was not in existence as yet . In those days the music played on the radio was America R &B.; <p> Mento was the first type of music to have emerged out of Jamaica , followed by Jamaican Ska , Rock Steady music , Jamaica reggae and now Jamaica dancehall music . Mento is a cross of African and European styles . It is acoustic and folksy using instruments such as banjo , acoustic guitar , flute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ska was the precursor to rock steady which paved the way for Jamaica reggae . Rock steady music is a combination of mento , American jazz and rhythm and blues with an offbeat bass . During the 1960 ? s it permeated the Jamaican airwaves with melodious sounds . Today Jamaica reggae music has a worldwide presence . The influence is so great that not all reggae you hear is authentically Jamaican . This music form enjoys large fan base in Israel , Italy , Scandinavia , Germany , England and Japan and indeed in most countries throughout the world . Presently

The JAAA had attempted to impose a cost for members of the media wishing to get accredited to cover the event and even after that was strongly opposed and abandoned ; I for one was still made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by allowing me to cover the event . <p> I had to wait in a crowded room until someone had pity on me to get me my accreditation the day before the trials and then while at the venue , I remember hearing the announcer repeatedly announce over the PA system reminding us ( media representatives ) that we were not guaranteed a seat . <p> Now fast-forward to more pleasant experiences , as after clearing immigration at the Barcelona El Prat Airport there was a booth set up specifically to welcome persons affiliated to the World Junior Championships . <p> Royal treatment <p> There was a list including my name . I was then escorted to an awaiting van , with the volunteer even offering to carry my bag - an offer I had to respectfully decline , as it was an attractive young lady and a woman carrying my bag is not how grandma raised me . Yes , this little country boy from Resource District in South Manchester was being given the royal treatment . <p> I was then transported to the Montjuic Olympic Stadium to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and it was ready and waiting . <p> We copy plenty things from abroad and if the JAAA is striving to run a first world meet they could start by taking a leaf out of the sport 's governing body 's ( International Association of Athletics Federations - IAAF ) on how media persons

##1355252 <p> I am 21 years old and I am living with my mother , but from the time I was 16 years old I have had a boyfriend . He is now 61 years old and he is everything good to me . When I met him he told me the truth . He told me that he has a wife and four children : two with his wife and two with two different women . He paid for me to go through school and I did not hide anything from my mother . <p> My mother told me that my father left her when she was pregnant with me and she will not condemn me because it is a married man who helped her to support me . I knew the man . He was always coming to the house but I did not know he was married until I was 12 years old . <p> kill myself <p> Pastor , I have never had another boyfriend . I go out with different guys , but I never had sex with them . This man does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now because he told me that he is going into church , so we will have to stop having sex . I told him I prefer to kill myself than to have another man lie down on me . He said that the man does n't have to lie down on me , I could lie down on him . He was joking this thing off , but I am serious about it . I ca n't eat since he told me that we have to break up . <p> This man encouraged me to stay home and he furnished our house and taught me how to save . I have enough money to make a down payment on a house , but he does n't want me to live in that area . <p> He reads your column . I want him to see this letter and to let him know that I am serious about killing myself . I do n't want any man apart from him . If he is going to leave me , I am going to stop taking the pill and get pregnant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not . He has been my man for years and I want it to remain that way . <p> Give me your advice . <p> C.S. <p> Dear C.S. , <p> I understand that you feel obligated to this man . I want to comment first of all on what your mother told you . Evidently , your mother and yourself have had a good relationship over the years . Some mothers are not so open with their children , especially their daughters . They either withhold information from them or they curse and tell their daughter that they should go out and sell themselves to get money . It is because you have a good relationship with your mother why you felt that you could talk to her about the man with whom you established an intimate relationship . <p> receiving benefits <p> Perhaps your mother could have discouraged you from becoming entangled with a married man , considering that she was in a similar position and she realised that it was not a healthy situation even though she received help financially . I supposed she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that you were receiving benefits . Without question , this man has been very good to you . Now he wants to move on , but you are determined to keep him . <p> My dear , I am going to encourage you to release this man . It would be difficult to get over him . It may take many years to adjust to the loss , but for your own good , let him go . He gave you the reason why the relationship between both of you should end . You know that he could have lied to you . And he could have told you that both of you could still play the game , but he wants to be free . You will never forget him , but you know that he has been a gentleman . Perish the thought about killing yourself . That does n't make any sense at all . And please do n't try to get him to impregnate you because that wo n't cause him to change his mind . <p> When you see him again , tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you will be able to get over him . He will understand . Both of you should agree not to contact each other as often as before . And do not become emotionally involved with any man until you have fully got over this relationship . You might even see the need to see a family counsellor . And , when you are feeling depressed do n't call this man . Call your girlfriends and invite them to go to the movies with you . <p> I wish you well and feel free to call me or write to

Call me Cynic , Sage or just plain biased ; ) but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap music going stale , the noisy instant release of a single and fervent international marketing all highly dubious . Talk about jumping on the bandwagon ( great pun eh ) ? just as reggae is getting a 2nd wind in Europe too ( do nt tell me his marketing peeps do nt know that ) but I think he will pull it off . I hope it does eventually lead to true spritual development for him . <p> For me when a person grows and matures changes will come in the way they conduct themselves and many times in their Beliefs . People can change , I 'm hoping this young man is being honest to himself and family . <p> I 've seen many who come through a traumatic experience of their own or someone they Love and being Prayerful make sincere at the time promises to God . Jah . Jehovah . Perhaps this happened to Snoop Lion . Trying to go down a more Righteous path . Elders in the Movement/Faith have endorsed him , who am I to doubt his or their sincerity . <p> Positivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Marley , hopefully Snoop Lion will set a better example in his actions towards Women and Family than Bob did . I 've watch many documentaries and read many books about Bob , the new one Marley reinforced my thoughts over the years as I watched through the laughter and smiles as his Family talked of him and his infidelities and could see how much pain it caused them . <p> But in the End Dennis Brown says it best . Many Will come , but Few are Chosen . <p> Another aside , I know many Black Americans who have gone on a Sojourn to Africa and returned with a more positive awakening attitude towards their history and lives . Many who were effected in a very Positive way . <p> I also felt that same Spiritual vibe after I finally realised how affected I was by Jamaica years ago , and it does make you want to share the Love . <p> Re : Snoop Lion <p> JonTom 8/23/2012 , 1:19 pm <p> wit wrote : <p> ' it 's just a bit much to hear him turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white foreigners speak it no ? lol ' <p> Ha .

##1362152 <h> New release <h> STORM <p> With her witty style and versatility , Storm has managed to gain the attention of a global audience . <p> Born Kelly-Ann Minto to parents Ovril , an executive secretary and Lester Minto , a musician in St. Catherine Jamaica , Storm showed a remarkable love for music from a very tender age . Featured on many episodes of " Ring Ding " , a children 's television show hosted by the late Honorable Louise Bennett Coverly , Storm never rejected an opportunity to sing . Her talent became more profound when she became a member of her church choir . She never ceased to amaze the congregation . Alto being her strong point , Storm 's raspy sound was well accepted when she went on to Holy Childhood High School where she performed at several of their annual barbecues and fetes . Storm was considered to be the Jamaican version of Tracy Chapman by the members of her community , Marine Park , where she was also a crowd pleaser at their annual festivities . <p> Her father , known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , was the owner of the " Touch of Class Band " formerly the " Red Dirt Band " . He was also an officer of the Jamaican Federation of Musicians and this allowed Storm the privilege to interact and become acquainted with the different styles and techniques of veteran artists who were former band mates and very good friends of her father . It was this affiliation that encouraged Storm 's unique style and ' rootsy ' flavor . While visiting her father in St. Ann , Storm frequented President Brown 's studio , Muzic Avenue , with her cousin Ifari , a cultural reggae artist who was then a part of Brown 's team . She was persuaded by the engineer there , " Brave Heart " , and a close friend , " Professor Frisky " , into recording her first song entitled " Can We " . It was a new and exciting venture for Storm as she then discovered her love for writing and was elated by the words of encouragement she received from artists such as Frankie Paul , Courtney Melody , President Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Storm 's dream of becoming a star , however , was delayed as she had to make a very hard decision in January of 2001 . She was accepted to a well-known university in Baltimore , Maryland and chose to migrate to the United States to further her studies as well as to be close to her mother , who was already living there , and other family members . Her love for music never allowed a day to go by without words , notes , and melodies captivating her thoughts . Storm 's friendly personality and outspoken character afforded her to meet and become friends with many in her new found hometown . She was introduced to a recording studio in Baltimore by Canadian reggae artist " Gucci " who encouraged her to keep doing music as he realized that she had a special knack for it and wrote songs so fluently and easily . This talent was what subsequently led to her being given the name " Storm " as it was thought that her lyrical ability and different sound blew the minds of those who listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. entitled " Cellular " which caught the attention of many promoters and producers in Maryland . After recording her second single , " Got Your Back " , Storm became a household name in Baltimore and has shared a stage with an array of artists such as , Junior Reid , Turbulence , Buju Banton , Ken Boothe , Mavado , Baby Cham , Junior Kelly , Yami Bolo , Johnny Osbourne , Junior Cat , Junior Demus , Boom Dandimite , Noppa Toppa , General Pecos , Lady Saw , Sean Paul , Beenie Man , and many more . <p> In March of 2011 , a part of Storm 's world ended when she lost her mother to a case of medical malpractice . This was a great set back as she now seemed alone in an unfair world . Her best friend and motivation was now gone . Bewildered and sullen after a few months of musical withdrawal , Storm put pen to paper . Creativity exploded as she counteracted all those feelings of sadness with the happy memories of time well spent with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into more cultural and motivational songs after she became drawn to the teachings of Rastafari by a very close friend and fellow artist . This insight was the factor that allowed the blooming of a new Storm . She had finally found her comfort zone and strong point in the world of reggae music . Her uplifting and relatable lyrics broadened her fan base and gave her the respect and adoration of many . <p> Social media gave way to a meeting that still seems uncanny to Storm . She became acquainted with Dullord Thompson , C.E.O . of Signature Music Group Inc. in Kingston Jamaica , while browsing through her Blackberry messenger notifications . She had noticed a broadcast he had made about missing his also deceased mother and felt compelled to exchange some words of comfort and motivation . They chatted for a while , never about music , despite the fact that they were both aware of each other 's involvement in the industry . Storm was , however , drawn to another broadcast made by him about a riddim he was releasing called " The Broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of a song she had voiced for Andy 's Muzic Productions entitled " Miss Your Kisses " .

##1366451 <h> Business Consultants <h> Take A Break <p> The days are long and while we have been getting a few showers to keep the place green , the humidity is high and matches the temperature . Many people work very hard and , without scientific data at hand , one could safely guess that probably a majority of Jamaicans believe that we are the hardest working people in the world . In terms of economic results and productivity increases , we can be assured that people in New York , Chicago and other big cities in the United States , Dubai , Bangalore , Hong Kong and Tokyo work much harder than we do . <p> This article is not about helping us decide which people living in which cities work harder than us , but given that many of us do work hard right here in Jamaica -- it is time to take a break . Many people are already on their vacations and over the next couple of weeks through September many others will be taking off and take a break . Those who travel abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including ours over here , and theirs over there , will all be busy , crowded and full of security checks and sometimes clogged due to the sheer number of travelers . <h> TIME APART TO RECHARGE <p> During the mid-eighties in the Eastern United States there used to be an advertisement for the Grape Growers Association of America that featured a funny little man extolling the virtues of eating grapes . The advertisement ended with his eyes looking skyward and with the punch line " whoever created grapes has to be a genius ! " That same genius , so many believe , created the weekend -- and in spite of what union leaders tell their members , He showed by example that after being with the multitudes for an extensive and intense period of engagement , it was necessary to take some time apart , privately , in order to recharge . Generally when a battery is being recharged it remains in the idling condition where the normal reason for its existence is suspended and its vital parts are cleaned or filled in order to get it ready again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings need to also take time apart to relax -- play games , commune with family members -- with whom we generally spend too little time -- and friends and do the kind of nothings that will , in the non-doing , serve to recharge us as human beings . <h> RENEW BODY , INTELLECT AND SPIRIT <p> From the time they could understand , I have always taught my two children ( and adults at seminars and retreats that I have led ) that we as human beings are made up of body , intellect and spirit . In the recharging exercise we tend to think mainly of recharging the body , hardly of recharging the spirit and sometimes of recharging the intellect . If you take a break this summer , consider recharging all three . The body can be recharged by walking , playing tennis , playing football or using the gym for at least an hour each day during your vacation . Mark it as part of your plan . The spirit will be renewed when you commune with your friends , by reading soul-uplifting material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best way to recharge the intellect is to read those magazines that have been piling up and one or two books during the vacation . In the next couple of weeks I certainly intend to catch up on those articles in The Economist , BusinessWeek , and The Wall Street Journal . <h> READ SOME GOOD BOOKS <p> Here are some books I am recommending to my readers and which I will be either completing or seeking to complete during my vacation . The first is " SHIFT -- Inside Nissan 's Historic Revival " by Carlos Ghosn ( his surname rhymes with phone ) who is currently the CEO of both Nissan in Japan and Renault in France . He is also in discussions with General Motors of the United States to form an alliance with the view to Mr. Ghosn taking on the executive role to lead the change that is required at GM . My second recommendation is " American Gospel " by Jon Meacham who is the managing editor of Newsweek magazine . It is a fascinating history of the United States and the important role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- has played in the formation and development of that country . " The Smartest Guys in the Room " by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind tell the story of " the amazing rise and scandalous fall of Enron " . " The Art of Asset Allocation " by David M. Darst is my other selection . Mr. Darst is a former professor at the Harvard Business School and is now the Managing Director and Chief Investment Strategist for the individual investor businesses of Morgan Stanley , with responsibility for asset allocation and investment strategy . He was the founding president of the Morgan Stanley Investment Group . He is a popular speaker around the world and is often seen on business television stations such as MSNBC . My final recommendation is " What 's So Amazing About Grace ? " by Philip Yancey . It is extremely well written and argued and is sure to stimulate your intellect while it recharges your spirit . <h> VISIT FAMILY AND THE ELDERLY <p> Plan a few days in your vacation to visit those family members who you have not visited for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your community before you go back to work . Handled with grace and compassion , this part of your vacation can do a world of good to your spirit but also be a source of encouragement to those who you visit . Our spirits will also be really enhanced if we share some of what we would normally spend on our vacation with less fortunate working people , or people in our social clubs or churches , who simply would not be able to afford a vacation . Make it a family effort ; discuss it with the children and other adults who might be going on vacation and encourage everyone to put a part of their planned vacation spend in a little fund which will be shared with some needy family which can not take a vacation this year . Enjoy the summer break ; recharge -- body , intellect and spirit . <h> About the Author <p> Aubyn Hill is the CEO of Corporate Strategies Limited and

Could you reflect a little on his contributions towards the liberation of S.A. from the chains of apartheid ? <p> MUTABARUKA : It is good that we reflect on Nelson Mandela 's past contribution , but that contribution has been stagnated , based on the present climate in South Africa today , we have been to South Africa and the only thing that has changed for blacks there is their movement . Blacks can go anywhere in South Africa at the moment but the economical structure still lies in the hand of the whites <p> The Ras elijah : Muta I want you to answer my question about the controversy over PSALM 68 being rewritten by KING JAMES .... <p> MUTABARUKA : well is not King James write the Psalms , King James translated it , there is no J in the Hebrew language , it is really Y , so Jah could be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of rejecting Jah is coming from the knowledge that there is no J in the Hebrew language , this was not known to elder Rastafarians and we believe when knowledge comes we have to accept it . <p> RAS elijah : but what about verse 31 ? MUTABARUKA : what about verse 31 <p> john : Muta happen between Luciano and you at Reable Salute Concert MUTABARUKA : he was on the stage and I was off , nothing happened between us , what did you hear ? <p> The RAS Elijah : I think more black people have to be aware that Africa is indeed dying , have you seen a topographical map of Africa lately ? MUTABARUKA : I do n't give credence to Africa dying , because of topographical map of Africa , on the contrary , it would appear to me that African leaders are now coming to grips with the reality that confronts Africa in relationship to its economical , political and social solutions <p> rohan : yo Muta yuh tink seh Jamaica is becoming more conscious ? LoLa : what is the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : very difficult question . I think that the youths are trying to put things into perspective , but they are being hindered by a system that is not conducive to change and new ideas ? more aggressive , the youths are more aggressive . <p> LoLa : what is your reasoning to say that Christ is not the one MUTABARUKA : when did we have an argument about Chris not being the one ? Christ is a concept not an individual ? we make the mistake into believing that Christ is Jesus ' surname ? when in actual fact the concept of Christ existed before the man the Christians call Jesus . <p> melchezidek : What I do n't understand is how dem bun Christ , but yet still Selassie was a Christian . Can you explain that ? MUTABARUKA : we have to understand when a man seh bun Jesus Christ what he defined Jesus as ? if you should close your eyes now and picture an image in your mind of this Jesus that you speak of , I will bet you that the painting of the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering that Genesis 1 declare that God made man in his own image . If God makes man in his own image , why is it that when you close your eyes you do not see , the Jesus Christ as you are ? The Jesus Christ as taught in the Western world is a mythological figure based on Greek and roman mythology , the things that are attributed to Jesus Christ in western Christendom , got their origin from Greek , Roman and Egyptian mythology . <p> foodie : Muta , is there any new CD/album coming out soon . Have see nothing since Melanin ( ? ) man ? MUTABARUKA : yeh , well we have a CD the ultimate collection after the Melanin man , plus we did produce a compilation of some of our roots artistes , including roots , culture , big youth , diamonds , mystic revelation and Rastafari Pablo Moses . The CD is entitled Gathering of the Spirits . <p> nattyb : Greetings Muta glenzil : One day I hope you can travel to Australia to give your reasonings here . MUTABARUKA : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the youth in Jamaica today and twenty yrs . ago ? MUTABARUKA : I have been to Australia already ? in the city of Perth ? we hope one day we will be able to come to Sydney and Melbourne <p> The RAS elijah : they say Africa is Greek for an object or thing Muta ... MUTABARUKA : the original name for Africa is Akebulan <p> jahjah : selassie seh ' im ah de powa ah de trinity but wi know seh dat de trinity is Babylonian doctoring , yu feel seh selassie know de real nature of JAH and how ' im really stay since Constantine an ' dem man introduce nuff tings inna weh man a Ethiopia ah deal wid ? MUTABARUKA : the idea of the trinity comes from Egypt , the difference between the trinity of Christianity , and the trinity of Egypt is that wherein you have in Christianity God the father , God the son and the Holy Ghost ? he Egyptian concept includes the woman , in other words it is father son and mother . The Christians have left out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a symbol of life , and the ankh represents the totality of man and woman <p> rohan : How do you feel about us celebrating our black history one month out of the year like the Americans ? MUTABARUKA : well , if you feel to celebrate black history month one month out of a year , then we have a serious problem . My life is a total celebration of black history ? but the month of February is used to reflect on the contribution that African people have made in history . We must not feel that because it is one month we are stuck in one month . It is up to us to continue our education right through the year ? . and I should add it is not an American thing even though it was Carter Goodson who started it . The experience of black people everywhere in the Americas need to be seen as the totality of all of us experience <p> LoLa : everyday I live is a celebration for blacks yeah yeh MUTABARUKA : I agree with you Lola <p> LoLa : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send for me <p> mitch : we hear yu a fashion designer now , Muta ? <p> MUTABARUKA : Now ! <p> robbie : good afternoon ! MUTABARUKA : good afternoon <p> BULLAHEAD : MUTA I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR SHOW AND REALLY THINK THAT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT ( POPEYES FI GET MORE FIRE ) MUTABARUKA : the problem I have with the advertisement of Popeye , under the sign they have chicken and sea food . From I was a child I was taught the Popeye was a vegetarian , he ate only Spinach , so I think that it is not the real Popeye we are getting , it is Brutus ? baby . <p> vinton : What are your views on same sex couples ? North America curse right ya now because now they want to bring it into the schools as a subject . MUTABARUKA : same sex couple is not a couple ? it is two people , man and woman . I think we shouldnot be caught up in western morality . We see that morality and truth in the western culture is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are now asked to accept the changing faces of truth when it is brought to us by decadents . <p> Kiriki Selassie : what do you think about reggae music and the internet , does it threaten the artists , or will we be able to use the net to our advantage ? MUTABARUKA : we can use the net for anything . it is man what put what is in the Net not the net telling us what to do . <p> jah T : Muta , I am now living in California and I was listening to your radio program a few weeks ago . I heard you play a tape about the birth of Christ are you sure this tape is no a propaganda ? MUTABARUKA : Well you can examine history and decide if the tape is propaganda or not.if you read the new testament coming from a perspective of the word of God you will never question its validity . To understand and to separate myth from history you have to come with an open mind . When you are a Christian you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible . <p> Alizae : I would like to know y is it that u wear no shoes on your feet ? MUTABARUKA : I do n't have any <p> jah T : Greeting Muta from California , I just want to say I really enjoy you radio program . MUTABARUKA : give thanks <p> SweetBooxie : I am an emerging poet located in NJ . I was a part of a Poetry Conference at which I experienced your style of dub poetry for the first time . I have two questions : How do you feel , wordsmiths can change life as we experience it and the world on a global plain with the power of the pen ? MUTABARUKA : the poet must not put himself in the place of a Christ a prophet or a politician . the first thing is to express your feelings and your ideas about a given situation , you should not try to write poems to change things , you should write poems to express your ideas . <p> nattyb : that is how I write Muta MUTABARUKA : the thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear that I am ndeliberately sitting to write to oppose the system but it is my ideas <p> melchezidek : Muta , would you agree that in JA there is apartheid , as only certain shade a people get certain benefits ? MUTABARUKA : apatheid is a very rough word to use knowing that apartheid is a system of Government , but we could draw a comparison of a black man even if he is terrible could not be a part of apartheid system but we can see residues of that system embedded in the minds of our leaders both politically and religiously <p> BULLAHEAD : YU NEVER WORE A PAIR OF SHOES IN YOU LIVE ? MUTABARUKA : yeah I have worn shoes , the last time I actually owned a pair of shoes was when my first child was born , she is now 25 . <p> rasadam : greetings MUTABARUKA : greetings <p> nattyb : Muta I start doing dub p I will be in the island in recording I hope we can link MUTABARUKA : well I hope you can link me.I am easy to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RASTA ROLE MODEL ARE YOU THE ONE ? ? MUTABARUKA : I am living person not a model . don ? t know if I can be the judge of myself <p> Baboo : Muta How do you feel about AIDS and it effects on Africans in general MUTABARUKA : I think AIDS is a weapon used against African people to stagnate the progress of Africa , just as how slavery did <p> pia2 : what do you think is the most positive thing people of Jamaica can to help themselves improve their lives ? MUTABARUKA : educate themselves , not indoctrinating themselves . I think that over the years Jamaican people was never educated they were indoctrinated . In other words they taught us what they want us to know in order to keep their system in power . They say if you want to hide something from black people put it in a book . <p> jah T : Muta , , when yuh deh pon the radio yuh fi give the full phone number fi di radio station . This will give us who deh a foreign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , I was never considering that IRIE FM was on the line but now that we knowwe will do that . <p> LoLa : IF AFRICA IS THE MOTHER LAND WHY ARE N'T MORE AND MOR PEOPLE RETURNING MUTABARUKA : because of the perception that most of us have of Africa being a backward , bang belly , fly in the mouth , jungle looking , suffering warring continent , that it what black history is all about-to change that perception . That is why I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to visit many different African countries . <p> Mush : Muta what 's the best Black related book you ever read ? MUTABARUKA : A book that has had influence on me was a book called Stolen Legacy . There are many more too numerous to mention here . <p> LoLa : HOW SHOULD JAMAICA DEAL WITH THE DEPORTEES TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY WITH CRIME MUTABARUKA : I don ? t think the deportees have taken over the country with crime . I think that the politicians and the preachers have taken over the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definition of religion in your perspective MUTABARUKA : religion was created by insecure men to oppress women . Religion is the basis of all political ideas and it exempts the human being to find the ' I ' in them . First we have to understand that the majority of the people in Jamaica is of African descent , we can not keep shaping a political religious and economical ideas without understanding the history and culture of the people that are supposed to be governed . The Westminster system and Christianity has not offered black people any true solution to their needs . The intellectuals in the Jamaican society should now sit down and study the history and culture of the African people before slavery . There must have been a society in Africa that was keeping Africans in tact for thousands of years before the coming of the white man . The intellectuals have not analyzed or evaluated the culture of the majority of the people , what we see is a mimicking of democracy , communism and socialism , that was given to us by the Greeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people whom those ideologies is supposed to be governing . So we need new thoughts new ideas , centers around an African-centred solution <p> Ashanti : What is your perspective on interracial marriage/relationships and its effect on the upliftment of African peoples MUTABARUKA : I am not agreeing with inter-racial marriage . I see it happening but I feel that it is not something that will advance the struggle of African people . <p> SweetBooxie : I learned that 90% of the slaves brought to Jamaica during the 19th Century were stolen from Ghana MUTABARUKA : you could say that . <p> jah T : Do you think that the Prime Minister should come on here the hear some of our concerns ? MUTABARUKA : he has been hearing it for years - and he still has not heard , so I do n't know what he would hear or is hearing that he has not heard before . <p> jahjah : Muta , JAH name fe glorify among de heathen , no true . iyah ? MUTABARUKA : true , true , but I would prefer to glorify the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter decided to marry someone like a white person MUTABARUKA : I can ? t do nothing about that , when my daughter reaches marrying stage therefore she must be in her personal self . <p> mitch : what if a Zimbabwean marries a Nigerian ? MUTABARUKA : I would n't , Zimbabwe and Nigerian is a barrier that seems to be keeping Africans apart , we must remember that Africa was cut up in a conference called the Berlin conference . Africa is Africa so whether you are a Zimbabwean. , Nigerian , Ghanaian , we are all Africans . <p> glenzil : Bob Marley came from a racial mix , and he certainly advanced the black man . MUTABARUKA : so what does that mean ? <p> BULLAHEAD : I AM NOW 21 YEAR OLD AND ALL THE DAY OF MY LIFE I HEARD A THIS BIG REPARTATION A I NEVER HEAR ABOUT ONE JAMAICAN THAT WHEN BACK TO AFRICA TO LIVE ARE YOU ALL JUST FAKING IT ? MUTABARUKA : first of all from I have been a child I have heard that Jesus Christ was coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not up to date with what is taking place . There is a community of Jamaicans that live in Ethiopia , there are communities of Jamaicans living in Ghana , there are a lot of Jamaicans living and working in Botswana , Zimbabwe , South Africa . And communities of Jamaicans even in Soweto . You only fake orgasms . <p> jah T : Running for public office does this ever cross you mind ? MUTABARUKA : No <p> The RAS Elijah : I believe it 's not good to stay in a white man country too long , you rocked me and my family with that over here in Toronto . MUTABARUKA : well obviously you did not rock enough - you are still there . <p> Mush : What can the government do to restore confidence in Jamaicans who would like to return to the Island to live ? MUTABARUKA : tell the truth and stop rob the people .. <p> Ragga : what is your opinion on the technological progress of the human race ? MUTABARUKA : I think it is great considering what we are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info on Selassie lineage going back to King David ? Cause Rev 5 says the only person worthy to release the 7 seals is the conquering lion of the tribe of Judah , root of David . MUTABARUKA : there are many books published there is an autobiography of Haile Selassie , Vol . I and II , there is the Kebra Negast this book is about the glory of the kings . <p> nattyb : Muta I think religion wascreated by the west to create loop holes for excuses as they do find excuse for almost every thing they lack in self discipline which is the true basis of the way of jah MUTABARUKA : that is a point . <p> cam : Muta what do you think of the ' more fire ' talk by some of the young Rastas MUTABARUKA : you have to understand that whenever a popular DJ rises there is always either a dance or a slang that accompanies this popularity . <p> Ragga : why do all black people need to go back to Africa .. will it make me any more black than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black people need to go back to Africa ? It is about who is desirous of going . For my part I can not give up a continent for an island . <p> The RAS Elijah : Muta , what happened to your mud hut ? MUTABARUKA : I was never living in a mud hut - maybe in my past life , and I don ? t believe I have any past life . <p> Mush : Do you think Beenieman is dissing Rasta by all the things he 's been saying lately or he 's just saying things to sell records ? MUTABARUKA : Well Beenie Man has made money off women , Jesus , Rasta and other things I think he 's a great artiste <p> melchezidek : Would you agree that the Israelites we see today are really Europeans who fled Hitler 's reign , and that they are looking for the Ark , but disguising the search as building houses ? MUTABARUKA : the people today are not Israelites they are Israeli . They have nothing to do with the historical Israelites . What these descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , but it has nothing to do with their genealogical connection with the Israelites of the old testament <p> glenzil : Have you ever traveled to Papua New Guinea ? MUTABARUKA : NO <p> Ragga : Is life a postponement of death .. or a stepping stone to greater heights ? MUTABARUKA : LOL . I think death is the end of life . I do not know about a stepping stone to greater heights , actually I have never had the experience of speaking to anyone dead to get a clearer picture of this greater heights that you speak of . when you die you die ! <p> LoLa : WHAT PARISH ARE YOU FROM MUTA MUTABARUKA : Kingston <p> nancy : greetings sir , Muta do you plan on touring in the U.S. and if so do you plan on coming to California ? MUTABARUKA : well it ? s a long time we haven ? t been to California , but whenever we tour the States California is always a part of the itinerary . <p> Lady K : What do you think of all them young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach MUTABARUKA : actually I don ? t think of them . I have too many things on my mind . <p> LoLa : OR JUST ONE QUEEN WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON THAT ? . YEAH WIFE MUTABARUKA : I am not against polygamy , as a matter of fact , I think polygamy has kept the African society in tact , much more than monogamy has done for the western world and your question of wife - it is illegal in Jamaica to have more than one wife . But I must say to you - man is by nature polygamous . I think the western world has created men who have learned to lie and cheat in the name of monogamy . In Jamaica men will be married and have a ' sweetheart ' this is not because he is really a bad persons but because the society does not allow him to express this part of his nature - so he lies and causes pain to his wife . We need to examine the African society and other societies that are polygamous to bring about a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What about the Ark of the Covenant ? It just disappear from the Old Testament , do you think it exists , and if so where do you think it is ? I 've heard Axum in Ithiopia . What are your thoughts ? MUTABARUKA : we are told that the Ark is in Axum in Ethiopia we are told that it was carried there by the priests who went back to Ethiopia with Melilik the first , who was the son of the queen of Sheba who visited Solomon . <p> Richie:Does that mean a wife would not feel disrespected if polygamy was the normal thing ? MUTABARUKA : I think most women who I have come in contact with , have expressed that they would feel much better if their man had told them about the next women rather than they finding out from their friend . I don ? t think the people in the east who practice polygamy see it as a disrespect , because most polygamous families . The first wife is the one who decides the second wife , so the first wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . What we have in the western world is the first wife trying to investigate about the second woman and not getting any answers start to feel insecure and jealousy is about insecurity nothing else . <p> nancy : what are you thoughts of women who have more than 1 man Jahpostle757 : Jah Live bredren <p> jah T : Muta , it was great talking to you , hopefully I will catch you on the radio . Respek ... Jah T from California . MUTABARUKA : give thanks , Jah T <p> fourthgen : greetings muta ! will you be in attendance at the Joe Higgs memorial on Feb. 20th in Kingston ? MUTABARUKA : No <p> melchezidek : Have you ever been to Rome ? And did your eyes behold any " stolen Legacies " from Africa ? MUTABARUKA : yes actually I have been to Rome and I have seen some of the stolen legacy e.g. the obliques which was stolen from Ethiopia <p> prinja : Muta , why did you use the name " The Cutting Edge " for your show ? MUTABARUKA : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of ideas and thoughts . <p> run boy run : Muta do u like white people , I live in California 25 year u can never thrust the white man u let them in your country and they suck the blood of the people like vampire . MUTABARUKA : LOL , actually I don ? t hate people but I understand what white people have done to other people and are still doing <p> LoLa : MUTA I NEED A NICE AFRICAN NAME FOR MY SON TO BE MUTABARUKA : I don ? t know the nature of your son or the birth but there are so many books that can show you names . <p> Alizae : Muta , infidelity is one of the main cause of spreading AIDS , so y is it that u do not oppose to infidelity ? <p> MUTABARUKA : Why are you saying this ? we were not talking about infidelity - we were talking about wives . Having more than one life is not infidelity - having a wife and cheating is infidelity , if you have wives and they know each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity . <p> Larry1 : Come now bredren , if you found out your women had a sweetheart you would be ready fi lick DAT , they feel the same way . If you are in love with a women then the mere thought of being with another women should hurt you more than her . <p> MUTABARUKA:I don ? t think you understand what we were saying , I was saying that the western world promotes sweetheart life from any angle . In Africa and Asia polygamy is something that has existed for thousands of years and it has kept these societies in tact I am not speaking about cheating which is infidelity we are talking about wives not sweethearts your question has proven my point . <p> nancy : so since you never answered my question I must assume that you must believe that it is ok for a man to havea sweetheart just as long as a woman does n't <p> MUTABARUKA : you are obviously mistaking a man 's two wives - one to be his sweetheart ? sweetheart is not wife ? we are talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melchezidek : Muta , before signing off let me ask , is there any plans for an Afrocentric curriculum in JA schools ? Cause when mi a grow a pure Marco Polo and Napolean dem teach we bout . MUTABARUKA : well I am not responsible for the curriculum in schools , we try our best through the cutting edge programme to educate our listeners , especially on African history , culture and philosophy . <p> jahjah : when Selassie I seh ' im glory inna de Bible ah whe ' im did mean ? MUTABARUKA : that is self explanatory - it means that he loved the message in the Bible . <p> run boy run : I love u man like bob I thing u are in the same class a great Jamaican they will overstand one of these days my brother they will . <p> MUTABARUKA : give thanks for that run boy run <p> jahjah : Muta , I appreciate your time and comments and wish you JAH divine love and guidance bless and keep the I. Respect to all JAH PEOPLE everywhere . <p> Jahpostle757 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MUTABARUKA : I do n't smoke anything , but I have not seen where smoking of herbs has caused any devastating effect on the social order of the Jamaican society , unlike cigarette which is the main cause of death all over the world . <p> MUTABARUKA : we want to say give thanks for this moment in time and we hope that those of you who spent the time with us will stay tuned to The Cutting Edge on IRIE FM every Wednesday from eleven o clock in the night .

##1377752 <h> Search for <h> Obituary <h> In loving memory of David Coore <p> Born in Anchovy , St James , Coore attended the prestigious Jamaica College ( JC ) in St Andrew . In a 2009 interview with The Gleaner , he said his anti-colonial passion was fanned while he was a student at JC . He recalls following the stand-off between workers and management at the Frome sugar plantation in Westmoreland . " From then , I was an ardent believer in Jamaica getting out of colonialism . The strike ( at Frome ) made a mark on me , " he said . Coore returned to Jamaica in the 1950s after attending McGill University in Canada and Oxford University in England . He was a member of Jamaica 's Legislative Council when he was appointed to the committee to draft the country 's Constitution . Many political students associate Coore with the turbulent 1970s when his close friend , Michael Manley , was prime minister . They had met at JC and developed a close bond . Coore was chairman of the People 's National Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , when Manley was elected prime minister , Coore was appointed minister of finance and planning . He was also deputy prime minister . Manley had declared democratic socialism as his administration 's mantra , which not only angered the opposition Jamaica Labour Party , but caused friction between the moderates in the PNP and its hardliners . Coore resigned from the Cabinet in 1978 to take up a job with the Inter-American Development Bank . In recent years , he worked as an adviser to the PNP on Constitutional affairs . Coore , who was married four times , is survived by his widow and three sons from his first marriage - Michael , Ivan and Stephen . The latter is founder and guitarist of progressive-reggae band Third World . He is also survived by younger

##1382252 <h> Riding Bareback in the Ocean . . . <p> When I decided to return to ships for another contract , I made some clear goals for myself . Experiences I wanted to have that I could accomplish during this time at sea . The biggest one was getting my dive certification . Done . I also wanted to go parasailing . Also done . With less than 2 weeks left on the ship , there was one more I had to do : go horseback riding in the ocean . <p> I rode horses as a kid . Took lessons at a farm up the road . Would ride at different friends ' houses . Did a 4-H horse club . Tried to convince my dad to get a horse ( it did n't work ) . I loved riding . But I have n't been on a horse in years . There are various horseback riding tours offered in the different ports . For some reason , riding in the ocean just seems too magical , too dream-like to be real . But you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided I had to do it . The Destiny did n't have ocean horseback riding as an option in any of its ports . It 's possible here on the Liberty . I 'd tried to get passes ever since I got here , but they 're <p> never available . This week is the last port I 'll visit where it 's possible . So , I bought myself a ticket . It 's worth the money to do a life list experience ! <p> We 're in Jamaica and the tour took me to the Chukka farm , the same company I went zip lining with when Mom and Lee were here . I got up bright and early , exhausted , but ready to go . Stepped off the ship , only to discover , it was pouring rain . Really cold rain . The rain put a damper on the day . It was freezing . The normally sparkling blue water was grey and dismal looking . But that aside - today was brilliant ! <p> We were paired up with a horse at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a stubborn thing . Real attitude . Of course , I got the horse with an attitude . She refused to stay in line with the other horses , continually stepping out of line until I 'd convince her to move back in place . The guides kept joking about giving me a speeding ticket . I was concerned something was wrong with her ; she kept stopping and favouring one leg . A guide explained to me she just likes <p> going fast , leading the way , and when she does n't , she gets irritated . Drama queen . <p> We rode for about half an hour , along winding paths , with the Jamaican hills rising up to one side . We eventually reached the ocean and wound along beside it for awhile . Until we eventually reached the beach for the bareback riding . <p> Of our group of 30 , half went first in the water , while the other group watched ( huddling under a pavillion , soaked , but out of the rain ) . Then we switched . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was n't given her name . She was much more relaxed and easy going than Gorgeous though ! For the ocean ride , there are no saddles , just a thin pad between you and the horse 's back . We were led down to the water and then , in we went . <p> The horses go in really deep . The water is up to and even over their backs . You 're waist deep in . And it is difficult to stay on ! You only have the reigns and a small straps on the pad on the horse 's back to hold onto . There are no stirrups and the water really pushes <p> against your legs . You have to really work to stay on the horse . I 'm an active and fairly fit girl , certainly with strong legs , and now , only a few hours later , I 'm aching . I can only imagine what the average cruise passenger must feel like after this tour ! <p> The ride was awesome . Incredible . Amazing . But over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , maybe 15 minutes . The horses all go in a sort-of line and circle around the little bay twice . You 're trying to stay on the horse , being told to smile for the camera . I 'm trying to take pictures with my own camera ( once again , I LOVE my waterproof camera ! ) . It 's still raining , the air is freezing , but thankfully the ocean water is warm . You 've got all the guides and the other guests talking to you and moving around you . And you 're just trying to savour the fact that you 're in Jamaica , riding bareback in the ocean . It was fun . But hectic . And then over . <p> We were led back to the beach and up to the stable . Time to switch groups . The second half of the guests went over to their horses while we showered <p> off the salt water and frantically wrapped ourselves in our towels trying to warm up . I was seated on a bench , huddling and shivering . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored yet . No , just freezing . " Want to go again ? " he asked . I said " Sure ? " , more like a question , not really thinking it was a possibility . But he told me to grab a life belt . I threw my towel aside and rushed right over . <p> Yes , I got to go again ! <p> Another horse again . This time a pretty white &; grey one . And this time was awesome . Cause my body had already figured out how to stay on . I 'd already snapped a ton of photos . I was used to the water . The second time , was just a chance to savour . <p> It is always such an incredible moment , when you 're able to just mentally stop and appreciate the fact that you are in the middle of a life-long memory in the making . You 're checking something off the life list . You are in the middle of it all . And you can just savour the fact that it is happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to the ship . We were late getting back , which meant I was late for work . I was still soaked . And it was freezing . But all of that are just tedious little things that will be forgotten over time . <p> But what will stay with me is that time in the water , riding bareback in the ocean . <p> I make and teach art . The rest of the time , I travel . After Spain , England , Uganda , California and years of tour guiding , it was time for the next big adventure . Working for Carnival Cruise Lines . I signed onto my first ship in December 2006 . Sevent contracts and twelve ships later and I 've been around the Caribbean , Central America , Mexico , Hawaii and Alaska . What have I put my hard-earned cruise money to ? More travel ! Oct - Dec 08 I travelled around South Africa . Sept 2010 I went to Fiji which had been at the top of my travel list for years . Making dreams come true ! Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nearly a century as a British colony .
