##3531150 <p> Your Google search has taken you here . Information that is useful to you , leave a " thank you " note . I am the person who wrote what you are reading here . <h> Thursday , 22 November 2012 <h> Monso Hair Design Tokyo Salon @ Gallery Hotel SG ( Review ) <p> Latest Update 28 Nov : A few days later , I am even more unhappy with the haircut . After 4 months of saving the hair length , Mr Soga @ Monso has ruined it with a bad cut . The back end is really ragged and not nice . The sides are not even . Really unhappy . Bro said it looks like " anyhow snip " . Suggest : Avoid Monso ( or Mr Soga ) . <p> -------------- <p> Thursday 22 Nov , evening <p> Just back from Monso . The most recent review you 'll find online ( for now ) for this salon . <p> The last haircut I had ( by QB ) was on 20 July . That 's ... 4 months ago . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bro called it a " mane " . <p> After all the disappointments from hairstylists , I was considering cutting it myself . But after watching how Jan Di tried to do it in Boys Over Flowers , decided not to . <p> Jan Di was lucky . She had the handsome and capable Ji Hoo ( Kim Hyun Joong ) do it for her ( before she hurt herself ) . <p> I know this hairstyle suits Ji Hoo ( Kim Hyun Joong ) because he has a long and narrow face . And my face is different . But I want this style . Korean boyband look . <p> I know I complained previously , about Celia ( @Reds Taka always creating a boyband look on me , but now , I want it . She has a knack for creating volume and body for my hair . I do n't know if the style turns heads the moment I walk out of the salon because it 's nice , or because it 's not . But right now , I want that boyband style ! ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turns out Singapore does have a few ... Beautyundercover reviewed the best 10 ( Very helpful as it collates reviews from blogs and forums and makes it easy to read in 1 website ) . <p> 3 salons to consider based on budget and reviews : La Coco , Izumi , Monso . <p> La Coco was tempting because I saw a poster of Korean stars that the salon presumably did hair for . Among the stars , was a smiling Lee Min Ho ( Gu Jun Pyo from Boys Over Flowers ) . However , the negative reviews from Beautyundercover were plenty and it was off-putting to read that it was going to be hit-and-miss if I chose to go there . <p> Izumi ... @ Clarke Quay Central was nearer for me . Korean stylist said to have spent time in the US , now in SG . No strongly negative reviews . <p> Monso ... I did n't know where Gallery hotel was , but I could take a cab . Japanese stylists . Sincere English introduction by the director Mr Soga as a stylist in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few negative for perms , including what are called " dead " perms ) . <p> To be honest , I do n't expect Japanese/Korean hairstylists to be very creative or impressive . Their fashion styles ... are not very modern , hip or cool . But who knows if there might be exceptions , although doubtful . <p> As I was going to Meidi-ya supermarket @ Liang Court , I dropped by Izumi to have a look . I had no intention of spending $90 for a short haircut . <p> There was only 1 hairstylist ( presumably Izumi herself ) tending to 1 customer who looked Korean/Japanese . Small shop , no hair-washing ladies . I stood outside for a while , watching from a spot that they could n't see . Then I left . <p> It seemed the stylist was adding the finishing touches to the customer 's hair . But the hairstyle looked like nothing had been done to it . Japanese housewife style . Yeah , maybe the customer likes it that way , but I ca n't imagine the stylist being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Meidi-ya , I felt I was really in the mood for a haircut . Bro got hauled off on government service , leaving me needing some loving . <p> So , called Monso to ask if Mr Soga was available in 1 hr 's time . <p> Was quite excited , smiled to myself at home at the thought of Japanese director cutting my hair . <p> It was going to be $85 , regardless of hair length . ( I had wanted to ask about GST on the phone but did n't because I did n't want to sound broke . ) . <p> What was the review going to be when I came home ? Hmmm .... I hoped to be able to say good things about it , but doubtful , considering the disappointments of other salons before this . <p> Cabbed to Gallery Hotel . Salon is at the back of the hotel . <p> I loved the look at the entrance . Welcoming . <p> Glass doors at a corner slant , through which I saw 2 men attending to a seated lady customer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner , shorter man who was deferring to him regarding some instruction . <p> I was 20 mins early and wondered if the director would have time for me . Popped my head in until they looked up at me with curious , polite smiles . I saw their seated lady customer had pretty , long hair . She was the only customer sitting there . <p> I said I was early but I think they did n't get that , so I said it again , before both of them started walking to me . <p> I stepped in and thinking that maybe they did n't get what I meant by " I 'm early " , I mentioned my name , so Mr Soga would know I was the one who called earlier . <p> Although the Japanese man who answered did n't say he was Mr Soga even when he asked what time I would be there , right away I had thought I was speaking to the man himself ( on the phone ) . His voice and the way he spoke , matched his look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since I was early , I thought I would be put in a waiting chair . But to my surprise , Mr Soga attended to me right away with a firm and friendly voice , asking what I would like him to do for my hair as he led me to the first seat in front of a huge golden-framed mirror leaning from the floor against the wall . <p> On my left , was a side table with 2 magazines and a box of tissues . <p> " Something different , " I said , to which he smiled . " Fresh , young ... " ( I just feel very tired and sleepy with long and floppish hair ) . <p> We discussed a little about what might be done . <p> Different from other stylists , he did n't touch my hair at all , until it was washed . Other stylists would feel my hair first while discussing the style to cut . <p> Unfortunately , he did n't quite know what I meant by Korean boyband sides or style . " Big Bang ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little uncertainly while the thinner , shorter guy ( who was the hairwasher-apprentice ) smiled behind us . <p> Since I had read a little about the SM Town Korean pop groups coming to SG and was looking up on K-pop bands yesterday , I knew Big Bang was one of them . But I do n't know the guys of the group , although an image of a bleach-blonde guy 's head of hair came to mind . Neither did I print out a pic of Ji Hoo . <p> Too bad I assumed a Japanese stylist might know what a Korean boyband style would look like . <p> But , he said he would try ( to create the sides like what I described ) . <p> The hairwash was Ok . A vertical piece of white/beige cloth was placed over my eyes till my mouth . I folded it up above my nose , so it would n't block my breathing . <p> It was nice that the guy asked if the pressure of his fingers was Ok . <p> In one review , someone said there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was concerned I would get him ( A reason why I was considering going to Izumi more ) . But this guy was very gentle . <p> Too gentle , in fact , but Ok . Would be better if he put in a little more strength in a more sensuous massage . <p> Reds @Taka washing ladies are still the best . <p> At the end of the wash , I told him it was nice and thanked him . I did wish it would go on for a little longer as it was quite nice . <p> When I got back to my seat and the white sheet was placed around my neck ( with 2 openings for arms ) , the hair-washing guy presented a list of drinks . I chose hot green tea . <p> The haircut took about 25 mins . Throughout , I was slowly perusing a magazine , while being aware of Mr Soga 's movements . He is tall and rather handsome ( too bad about his own long frizzy hair ) . <p> Dog tags hanging from his necklace clinked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fondness for cool-looking men with clinking things . ) . <p> At one point , while he was sitting , he turned my chair closer towards him to the left until he could properly cut my fringe . I was reading the magazine , and it was n't too near . But I tend to get a little shy when male stylists come closer . <p> But I realized he seemed a rather shy person as well , quickly glancing away whenever I looked up from the magazine to the mirror at him ( to see how he was cutting ) . <p> I like that he handled everything himself , except for the hair wash . He spent all the time on me . <p> There were 2 more stylists there . A young woman and a young man , presumably Chika-san and Ito-san . And 1 or 2 more customers came in soon after me . <p> Towards the end , the lid for the tea dripped a little onto the table and magazine when I handled it , and I wanted to leave it but could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of tissue from the box and dabbed it , but the nice Mr Soga said it 's Ok and " thank you " ( so that I would hurry up and sit back for his finishing touches , I think . ) . <p> The result : I like the service and ambience . Perfect . The green tea was also very solid , loved it , good stuff . <p> But overall , the haircut is not proportionate and is lop-sided . <p> The back end is short , the sides are wispy and long , the front is long and floppish . <p> The front fringe is supposed to look like Choi Young 's ( Lee Min Ho - below pic ) slanted down cut , but that 's not what I got . <p> The top was not cut because according to Mr Soga , not cutting adds volume . But other stylists always cut it shorter to add volume since shorter hair has more bounce and body ( though unfortunately , they always cut it too short ) . <p> The back end , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mirror behind . Seeing my hesitation in giving approval , he looked worried . I had to try to see it as interestingly as possible and grant approval since I did n't know how else I could tell him to improve on it . Almost wanted to say " Omoshiroi " in Japanese for " interesting " but did n't because it was n't really true . ( At the moment , it 's not too bad if it 's swept towards the middle ) . <p> For the back end , I had actually granted him creative freedom , although I had expressed a suggestion to perhaps keep it at the original length . He had insisted it was too long , so I said he could do whatever he felt would be good . <p> The back upper portion , does have some body in the way it is cut . So , that is Ok . <p> At the end , he had asked if I wanted to add color . I said no , and he gave an audible smile . <p> The hairsprays smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no holding power at all . Makes me consider that perhaps this also applies to their perming products which make weak/dead perms . Wonder why . <p> Overall , I do n't hate this haircut since there is n't much drastic damage ( the saving grace , since it would grow quite soon so I can seek out another salon ) . <p> But ... $85 is a lot for the result ( that looks more like $35 ) . And there was n't any first-timers discount for me . <p> He gave me a membership card which he stamped and did n't require my name or signature at all . Also , a " Customer introduce card " to be given to a friend or anyone to receive a first-timer 15% discount . <p> So , if I understand it correctly ... As a first-timer who came on my own , I do n't get a discount . But a friend introduced by me , would get the discount ? ? Or do I get a discount on my next visit ? <p> He asked how I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was only later that I realized he must actually be asking if I was introduced by someone . <p> Anyway ... I most likely wo n't be going back , partly because of the location . <p> After the haircut and looking for a bus-stop ( coming out from a longer distance in the process ) , I discovered it 's actually not far and near to Meidi-ya @ Liang Court . It 's along Robertson Quay which is just beside Clarke Quay . If coming by bus and walking from the bus-stop outside UE Square , it would be nearer than walking from Clarke Quay Central . <p> From that bus-stop outside UE Square , it 's just maybe 1015 minutes walking to the hotel . Turn right when you see a big colorful bridge . <p> But I 'm just not keen . The hotel 's entrance faces inside a small , looped cul-de-sac drive-in that is n't good for getting cabs or for tour buses to drive in . Poor location for a hotel . <p> I read that Midori @ Novena is good . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance and then being disappointed once more ... Maybe I 'll just let it grow long again .... and cut it myself . I have been quite tempted to buy a pair of haircutting scissors from Medi-ya . <p> Or if I 'm still interested in getting Ji Hoo 's look ... I might make the effort of trying out another salon next time . I 've already saved screenshots of his style to print and show . <p> Although it feels less hot and heavy now , $85 ... is still .... a pity , especially when I 'm broke . I had to dig out $85 from somewhere . And while the number is just a number , when you take out 1 piece $50 , and have to take out another $50 to make it enough , you start realizing how much it really costs . <p> I do n't know how those girls can spend more than $400 just on a perm and coloring in those salon reviews . <p> The right way , is actually to spend little , so that if it 's awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , hair salons in SG are ridiculously expensive , just like SG hotels . <p> Hey ... looking at the receipt now ... Turns out Mr Soga can spell my name ! ! O.O I 'm impressed and surprised . I thought he did n't know the name since I did n't expect the Japanese to be familiar with English names . <p> Update @ 10.49 a.m. 23 Nov : Still not happy with the haircut when I looked in the mirror this morning . Looks like did n't cut . <p> Some time back , I had actually tried Shunji Matsuo @ Heeren once ( now @Taka ) . Was cut by a non-Japanese stylist who was very careful and precise . But the end result was too short and not nice . So , I have n't been to any Shunji outlets again since then . <p> So far , if I try 1 hairstylist and it 's bad , I do n't go back to the same salon or outlets of that salon . <h> 2 comments : <p> Thank you for mentioning Beauty Undercover in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you but I have incorporated your comments into our website so that 
##3532851 <h> formal dresses in order to formal occasions <p> Official dresses , since the name indicates , should end up being worn in order to formal events . When it involves formal clothing , it continues to be very specific . However , are you aware when you need to wear the actual formal dresses ? Generally talking , the occasions for particular formal wear happen to be divided in to several groups . Read on and also the following content will highlight . <p> Wedding &; funeral service <p> Referring , it is simple for us to consider the wedding in addition to funeral . Both events tend to be bracketed collectively , that happens because the exact same black dresses works well on their behalf . Just since the fashion specialists say that the black official dress is really a must to gather in the actual closet for just about any woman . Obviously , the difference between your two occasions may be the dresses with regard to wedding are n't just limited by the dark gown . What is the greatest color usually depends upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional thinking , when referring to formal gowns , you may connect them using the floor-length dresses . In an over-all way , along the gown lies about the formality from the occasion , the greater formal the actual occasion is actually , and the actual longer the actual gown is going to be . So inside a certain method , the brief formal dresses will also be being so long formal gowns . If you intend to attend an event , what you have to choose is really a formal drink dress rather than gown . Party is recognized as as the semi-formal occasion to ensure that a brief gown in a color matching the skin tone is excellent . <p> Gala &; Golf ball <p> Both of these worth the actual name would be the formal occasions . The dresses ought to be simple as well as elegant rather than being large and fluffy .

##3533150 <p> Learning Mandarin Chinese online is actually quite easy . Once you find a suitable course ( read to the end to find out about my favorite online Chinese language course ) , you can log on from any computer and view the lessons , chat with other learners and play interactive learning games . <p> Here are 4 tips that will aid you in learning Mandarin . <p> 1 . Flash Cards Since I began studying Chinese I have always used flash cards . At first I made my own on index cards but then I found some online that I bought . You can make your own by writing the character on one side ( with or without the pin yin ) and the English translation on the back . I kept the pin yin on the back with the English so as to force myself to be able to recognize the character . As I studied each lesson , I would make flash cards for each word that I was n't able to easily recognize . I keep them with me throughout the day so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a few minutes to spare . I have also used them with a pocket chart ( like kindergarten teachers have ! ) on my wall . I keep them there and use them to make sentences or phrases . <p> 2 . Label Items Around the House This idea came to me from when I did my student teaching in a kindergarten . The teacher labeled everything in English and Spanish so the kids would get a feel for what the letters and words looked like . Although it 's a very simple idea , it works just as well for adults and with any language , including Mandarin . Do n't try to over do it though . I will take time to write out the labels ( I use sticky notes ) and post them . Try making them as you learn the vocabulary . Or do one room at a time . For these , I do like to put the pin yin with the character , at least for the first month or two . <p> 3 . Write Sentences After your first few lessons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to include a little English in them , that 's fine . Just get a feel for using the vocabulary . Note that English and Chinese grammar are quite different so your aim should be for using the words and not worry much about grammar at first . Keep this in a notebook so you can look back at your progress . <p> 4 . Listen to Audio Make sure to listen to the audio that comes with your course and also look for podcasts that teach or are spoken in Mandarin . Keep them on your iPod or mp3 player to listen to on your commute or during your workout . It will keep the target vocabulary 
##3534150 <h> Thursday , July 19 , 2012 <h> Rakuzan <p> The quest for curry ramen continues ! I 'm blown away by just how many curry specialty ramen shops there seem to be . Not too far from Miyagamiya lies Rakuzan , with curry ramen , tsukemen and tantanmen . I love curry tsukemen , and this is n't the first time I 've had curry tantanmen , but I could n't stop myself from choosing such a spicy , delicious-sounding combo . <p> The Bowl Once again , a curry tantanmen bowl delivers on its name . The broth was a light but syrupy curry , doused in the Chinese chili oil ra-yu . The noodles were long and thin . The menma stood out as being very thick and flavorful , and the chashu was very thick and tasted like it might have been barbecued . <p> Would I Go Again ? Yes . There is still tsukemen to be eaten . <p> Should You Go ? Yeah , it 's right 
##3534151 <h> Sunday , September 16 , 2012 <h> Kururi <p> A three day weekend means it 's time for a trip , and this time , a trip to Tokyo . A trip to Tokyo means Tokyo ramen . Last year when I visited Tokyo , I used it as an opportunity to try ramen shops I had n't had a chance to go to when I lived there . This time so much time has passed that I 've used it as a chance to revisit shops I thought were great , and see if they hold up . <p> Kururi is a famous miso ramen shop near Iidabashi . I had been to the main shop and the Takadanobaba branch when I lived in Tokyo , and both were amazing . Kururi stood tall as one of my favorite ramen shops in all of Tokyo . How would it fare on another visit ? <p> The Bowl Just as amazing as I remember ! The broth was a thick , hot , rich miso that is almost more like a sauce than a soup . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off by the fact that the soup was so thick that it could barely be drank , but it 's so good that it did n't matter in the end . The noodles were fat , similar to the kind you would expect to see in a thick tsukemen . The chashu slices were super tender and pretty tasty . <p> Would I Go Again ? My time in Tokyo is limited , but this

In concert , Ms. Haymon appeared with the Israel Philharmonic under Kurt Masur , the London Symphony Orchestra under both Myung-Whun Chung and Michael Tilson Thomas , the Cleveland Orchestra under Isaiah Jackson , and the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the world premiere of Ned Rorem 's Swords and Plowshares . <p> Ms. Haymon performed in the world premieres of Portriats by Richard Danielpour , with Yo-Yo Ma and Emmanuel Ax , and John Williams ' first song cycle , Seven for Luck .

Since I fundamentally believe singing is the murmuring of the soul , I firmly believe in simple un-manipulated tonal production . For me , that means singing on the breath with a low abdominal connection , forward placement and a relaxed body without neck , jaw and tongue tension . I believe whole-heartedly in the total singing actress/actor ; which means movement , languages , good body alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not afford to be limited to opera , but has to be willing to explore many musical genres . I also firmly believe that young singers should sound like young singers . While not forsaking the natural vocal timbre , young singers should be encouraged to preserve their youthful sound while allowing their voices to develop naturally on a solid technique ! Finally , I believe 
##3836152 <h> Pass the PMP exam in your first attempt ... <p> Passing the PMP exam requires you to think in ways you may not be aware of . A traditional approach to project management , and your years of experience may not come in handy when answering PMP questions . <p> Do n't believe me ? - Just try out a few mock test papers , and you will realize that the answers you thought to be the most accurate is n't correct most of the time . You are in for a big surprise if you continue studying for the exam by relying on your experience or your gut feel . <p> Here are some tips to make the right selection and think differently . <p> 1 . Choosing a Generic Answer versus a Hard Answer : Choices may be phrased in terms of " should " , " must " , " always " . For example , a project manager should " always " do the following , or " must " do the following . This is considered a hard answer . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not refer to it as " must do " or " always do " . Keep in mind that project management is a soft skill - part art and part science . So there are many different ways to handle the same situation . If there are a 100 people in a room , you 'll probably get a 100 different answers to handle the same situation . In such a situation , how can you expect only 1 correct answer . <p> For example , let 's take this question <p> Q : What is correct about the Project Charter : <p> Choice A : The project charter must be signed by the project sponsor . <p> Choice B : The project charter must be signed by a manager external to the project <p> Choice C : The project charter should be signed by the customer . <p> Choice D : The project charter should be signed by a manager external to the project . <p> Notice subtle differences in the usage of " must " and " should " ? Is it a must for the charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a best practice ? <p> Most of the time , PMI is quite gray about such issues , never taking stands in terms of what you must do , or should do . The PMBOK guide will often indicate that it is up to the project manager to make the most appropriate decision based on the circumstances and situations of the project . <p> Thus , it would be best to select a soft answer - a best practice - a recommendation , rather than a rule . So in this case , which option will you select ? <p> The correct answer is Choice D in this case . <p> 2 . Knowing the Right Order of Problem Solving : What happens when you encounter problems in your projects ? Are you able to make a decision immediately , or do you try to avoid confronting the situation , cursing and wishing the problem would disappear somehow . Do you think that ignoring the problem for a while may cause it to repair itself , or maybe you think that problems are a nuisance , and you are not responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such problems should be addressed by your boss or your customer , because they are responsible for creating them in the first place ! <p> Well , if you are doing any of this , you are out of luck . The PMP exam ca n't be passed with this kind of thinking . Begin to think differently . <p> To answer such a question , you first need to analyze it , and then understand the correct order of steps . <p> For example , assume that your customer just called you to add a big piece of additional functionality ( or scope change ) to the original specifications . This will add at least another month to your already tight time line . What would you do first ? <p> Choice A : Inform your boss that this additional scope can not be done within the time line . <p> Choice B : Tell the customer that this additional scope can not be done within the time line . <p> Choice C : Meet with the team and discuss alternatives to accommodate the additional scope within the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that you are willing to go the extra mile , and win over the customer . Do your best to meet the time line with the added scope . <p> Read the choices carefully and think for a moment ... What would you do in real life ? <p> Remember that a Project Manager is proactive . You are supposed to find solutions to problems . Just informing about problems to the management , your boss or your customer is not the solution . <p> You have to brainstorm , think about the various tradeoffs that can be made , weigh the pros and cons of each situation , and evaluate them on the triple constraints of the project ( Scope , cost and time ) . Infact , there are more than the 3 triple constrainsts . You have to also look at the trade-offs on risk , customer satisfaction , quality , employees , the project team etc . <p> Without first doing a thorough evaluation , going to the boss , management or customer is a waste of time . You can be more effective and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework , and then come out with solutions . <p> So irrespective of what you do in your real life project management , please think in the right way for getting the questions right for the PMP exam , and pass in your first attempt . You can also attend our PMP Exam Preparation Workshop on weekends in Singapore for more such tips on passing the PMP exam ! <h> 3 Comments on " PMP Success Tip : Think Differently " <p> Certainly great tips buddy ! One thing I would also like to add for PMP exam takers that they should always refer to PMBOK4 if therez any confusion . Go through PMBOK as many times as you can , during your preparation . It should be the base of your knowledge . PMBOK is not only for exam taker , it is for any Project Management professional . In my opinion PMBOK is the bible for Project
