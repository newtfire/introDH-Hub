The Battle of Plassey is often described by his admirers as his " finest hour " , when he used his skills and genius to divide the enemy and score a spectacular victory . He had under his command about 800 British and European forces complemented by 2,000 native sepoys . His enemy , Sirajuddaula the Nawab ( independent ruler ) of Bengal , had 50,000 troops under his command . When they met on the field of Plassey on the morning of 23 June 1757 , most of the Nawab 's commanders not only did not join in the battle , but actually misled the Bengal ruler to a pathetic defeat . <p> This placard and the other two below are situated on the sides of the pillar holding Robert Clive 's statue near the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London . This one portrays Clive 's famous hour long contemplation , under the shade of mango trees on 22 June 1757 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay the marching to face the Nawab of Bengal . <p> Robert Clive was born in 1725 in Styche Hall , near Market Drayton , situated in Shropshire in England . He was the first born in the family and as his family lived on a modest income he was sent to be brought up by his mother 's sister who lived in Manchester . However , at the age of nine his aunt died and he came back to live in Styche Hall . His adolescent life is full of stories of him fighting and engaging in anti-social behaviour . However , by the time he was eighteen his father was able to find him a job with the East India Company as a writer . This was quite a prestigious position in view of the money making potential that opened up to a young man posted to India . <p> Although his salary was 5 per year and he recieved an allowance of 3 per year to pay for other necessities , he could earn additional performance related income bonus and his lodgings and food were free . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India Company was the potential to make huge sums of money while working in India . <p> Clive boarded the East Indiaman Winchester in March 1743 for India and the journey to Madras took much longer than expected due to storm damage and the time it took to repair the ship while anchored in Brazil . He nearly died by drowning en route , but was luckily rescued when he fell overboard . He arrived in Fort St George in Madras in June 1744 and for a while his life was quite uneventful and boring . <p> All this changed when the British in Madras attacked the French in 1745 and a year later the French took revenge by taking Fort St George from the British . Refusing to accept the French terms and conditions to be a free man and leave the fort , Clive , along with some friends , escaped their imprisonment at night and dressed up as Indians travelled to Fort St David south of Pondicherry , which was still under the British control . There he enlisted in the East India Company Army and engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clive rose to become a lieutenant . However , with a peace agreement between the French and the British , Fort St George was handed back and restored to the British . For Clive at first it was a prospect of going back to boring clerical duties . In 1749 he sought and was successful in obtaining the job of Steward of St George . This job was potentially lucrative as it involved supplying food , furnishing and other items to the fort and he could earn commission from every order . <p> During the 1740s , the French power and influence was increasing and there had been an increasing tendency from local rival claimants for control to engage in warfare over territories . The French were intervening to place someone of their choice to power and were making gains from their king making role . The British , on the other hand , under the East India Company were focused on trade than territorial interventions . However , the great-French-British rivalry began to be felt strongly across the world as each aimed for world domination . <p> Clive 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British also began to intervene in local power struggles . The French and the British began to nominate and support different individuals for succession . In the early 1750s , rivalry between Chand Sahib and Muhammad Ali began . The British were supporting Mohammed Ali who was based in Trichinopoly and the French were on the side of Chand Sahib to the north west of Madras . In 1751 , after securing the city of Arcot , Chand Sahib lead a large force accompanied by the French to lay a siege on Trichinopoly to defeat Mohammad Ali . Clive joined the British Forces sent to support Mohammed Ali at Trichinopoly . <p> This placard illustrates his amazing victory at Arcot in 1751 when he was besieged by a large force . <p> The seize at Trichinopoly looked hopeless and Clive requested that he be made a captain and given permission to lead an expedition to take Arcot as a diversionary tactic . It was hoped that Chand Sahib would divert a large army to save Arcot which would make it easier for the British and Mohammed Ali to break the seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redeployment of a large number of French and Chand Sahib 's forces from Trichinopoly to Arcot . Clive successfully resisted a 50 day siege against all odds until reinforcements arrived . A series of subsequent victories against Chand Sahib 's and the French forces lead to the official recognition of Mohammed Ali as the new ruler . Clive became a hero and his new fierce reputation brought him and the British in South India much benefit . <p> As the Steward of both Fort St George and Fort St David , and later as commissary for the supply of provisions to the military , he earned a total of 40,000 . It was not a small sum for someone who started the services of the East India Company a decade earlier with an annual salary of 5 per annum . He returned back to England at the age of 28 with a huge fortune and returning back to India was probably not on the top of his agenda . In fact he tried to enter British politics by becoming a Member of Parliament , in the process spending perhaps around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1754 . He gave his father 6,000 to reduce the mortgage at Styche Hall and was also said to have been very generous to his friends . <p> His high levels of spending meant that he was running out of money quickly . Coupled with that , political intrigues in London led to the loss of the Parliamentary seat that he won , through which he was hoping to build his career in England . Unable to see a future for himself in England he again signed up to the services for the East India Company . This time however , as the governor of Fort St. David , and a lieutenant colonel in the British Royal Army . He sailed out of England in March 1755 for the second time and arrived on the west coast of India in October the same year . While he was in Bombay he joined a successful expedition with Admiral Watson against a Maratha pirate stronghold of Gheria under Tulaji Angria . In April 1756 he set sail for Madras and arrived there at the end of May 1756 . He took up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1756 . Unknown to him , about two days earlier , the conflict between the British and the new ruler of Bengal , Nawab Sirajudddaula , resulted in the British being expelled from Bengal , and the much disputed account of the " Black Hole " incident took place when many British soldiers died under the captivity of the Nawab . <p> On hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta , the Madras Council sent an expedition under Robert Clive to retake Calcutta and restore the British position in Bengal . In October 1756 , a large force was sent , consisted of four major ships under the British Crown ( the Kent , the Cumberland , the Tyger and Salisbury ) and two smaller ships called the Bridgewater and Blaze . In addition there were three East India Company Ships - Protector , Walpole and Marlborough - and three ketches ( small sailing crafts ) . The total force included over 500 British Company Soldiers , 150 Marines , 100 Artillerymen , 1,000 Indian troops and 160 other supporting troops . In December 1756 , British forces arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the British were expelled were retaken very quickly . <p> The British did not only retake Calcutta but pushed their cause further by attacking the French in Chandernagore and making all sorts of demands on the new Nawab . At the same time , Clive opened up channels of communication with disgruntled officers and personalities within the Nawab 's camp and managed to secure many of their support for overthrowing the Bengal Nawab Sirajuddaula . This culminated in the famous victory at the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 , described by many as Clive 's finest hour . Regardless , it was definitely his finest financial hour . Although the East India Company earned a staggering amount of money Clive himself made a total of 234,000 plus an additional 27,000 per year for life from rental income from a piece of land in Calcutta ( known as Clive 's Jagir ) . Other British officers also benefited financially from the Plassey expedition . <p> Robert Clive returned to England in 1760 a very rich man . He indulged himself by buying many properties in order for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knighted , made a Member of Parliament , and was given Irish peerage . However , he had to return to India again in 1764 as the governor and commander-in-chief because of chaos and fiscal disorders in Bengal . He restored order by a series of administrative reforms , including reorganising the Company 's army . He also scored an amazing feat by getting the Moghul Emperor Shah Alam II to agree to the British becoming the revenue collector of Subah Bengal . This was done after the famous Battle of Buxar in 1764 . He returned to England in 1767 . <p> This placard depicts the granting of administration of Bengal to the East India Company by the Mogul ruler Shah Alam in 1765 . <p> The corruption in the East India Company remained , however , and the Company appealed to the British government to save it from bankruptcy . In 1772 , Clive 's enemies in Parliament had built up a case that said he was responsible for the situation . Clive was forced to defend himself before Parliament . Although exonerated , he committed suicide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he delivered the following famous lines : <p> ' Consider the situation in which the Victory of Plassey had placed on me . A great Prince was dependent upon my pleasure ; an opulent city lay at my mercy ; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles ; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone , piled on either hand with gold and jewels ! By God , Mr. Chairman , at this moment I stand astonished at my own moderation . ' <p> This statue is located off Whitehall , near the Cabinet War Rooms , stands an imposing statue of Clive of India . Situated outside the India Office building , now known as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , this controversial statue was created sixty years after the Company 's fall in 1858 . In 1906-07 , at the 150th anniversary of Plassey , Lord Curzon ( a former viceroy of India ) proposed regenerating Clive 's memory in London and Calcutta . Accordingly , statues of Clive were erected in the two cities . <p> In addition to huge amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large country estates and many properties , Robert Clive also brought back many items and treasures from his India visits . His son Edward Clive who was appointed as the governor of Madras in 1799 also collected treasures and beautiful items from India , including a tent of Tipu Sultan . <p> He organised and participated in the campaign against Tipu Sultan . Many of these items are currently kept and some displayed at Clive Museum in Powis Castle in North Wales . <p> Some of the items collected by Clive 's wife are also displayed at the Museum . Edward Clive married the daughter of the Earl of Powis , Lady Henrietta Antonia Herbert , in 1784 . On the death of her brother , Edward Clive inherited the title and became the Earl of Powis . <p> Clive 's Properties rebuilt or purchased from his Bengal loot <p> Styche Hall , Shropshire <p> Robert Clive was born in Styche Hall in 1725 . When Robert Clive returned from his second tour of India in 1760 he had Styche Hall rebuilt for his father . The original half-timbered building nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired Sir William Chambers , one of the foremost architects of the time for the job . ( Chambers designed Somerset House in London and the Pagoda at Kew . ) <p> After the new building was completed , Clive gave money to his father to allow him to retire , and also to keep a coach , thereby creating the building of the Stable Block and Coach House . <p> The last member of the Clive family to occupy the Hall was Lady Mary Herbert , who died in 1927 . Lady Mary was a stalwart of the local community , and , apart from her many charitable works , held a Garden Party on the lawns of the Hall for the towns people every year . <p> In the late 1960s , after the estate was split up , the Hall was bought privately and converted into flats . This was financed by felling the oak woods which surrounded the house and selling the valuable timber . There was public outrage , needless to say , particularly because much of the woods became mere scrub land afterwards . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information and images were provided by Peter Brown and Clive Chapman from Market Drayton Museum ) <p> 45 Berkeley Square , London <p> In London , Robert Clive lived in house number 45 of the attractive and sought-after Berkeley Square in Central London . It is in this house where Clive allegedly committed suicide in 1774 . <p> Designed by William Kent in 1737 , in what was to become one of the grandest squares in Mayfair , Berkeley Square was built on land given to Lord Berkeley after he helped Charles II restore the monarchy . The square originally had thirty giant plane trees in the central garden , and houses were built on the east and west sides . <p> Sadly , only those houses on the west rank survived to this day whereas the others were torn down to build office blocks , shops and showrooms . Winston Churchill -- the Prime Minister of the UK during World War II -- lived in 48 Berkeley Square as a child . <p> Clive purchased 45 Berkeley Square in 1761 for 10,500 from Lord Ancram , from whom Clive previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after he returned to London in 1760 , three years after the Battle of Plassey . <p> Walcot Hall , Shropshire <p> Clive purchased Walcot estate in 1764 for 90,000 . ' Once established at Walcot , Clive continued in the tradition of buying votes , but this time with a sufficient bankroll , courtesy of Mir Jaffar . He was elected Member for Shrewsbury and proceeded to build a secure " interest " for himself and his family in the county . <p> In December 1767 , he wrote to Verelst " we shall come very strong into Parliament this year -- seven without opposition ; probably one more " . <p> In 1772 , he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire . <p> Clive greatly enlarged and transformed the house without rebuilding it . The estate plan of 1750 shows the main front looking north towards fishponds and a formal garden centring on a fountain pool lying to the east . Clive refurbished the east side and made the entrance front , and built a long range at right-angles on the south side running back westwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remaining possession of Clive still in Walcot Hall . ( Some of the information taken from Walcot Hall : A brief History by Judith Parish ) . <p> Claremont Landscape Garden / Palace , Esher , Surrey <p> In 1768 , Robert Clive bought Claremont Estate and decided to pull down the existing house and build something new and suitable for his lavish lifestyle . <p> He bought the estate for 25,000 and spent a large sum of money creating the new palace and the landscaped garden . In total , it is said that he spent 100,000 on landscaping , renovating and on the new building . Currently the building is occupied by Claremont Fan Court School . <p> He hired Lancelot Brown , popularly known as Capability Brown to undertake the task . At first Capability was reluctant to take on the work as his expertise was in creating beautiful gardens , not on producing buildings . However , Clive managed to persuade him to take on the task and with the help of a builder called Holland , who later became Brown 's son in law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house still has many decorations from Clive 's time , clearly showing how he wanted to portray himself as a hero and remembered as such for posterity . <p> The green area has a park with a lake and landscaped amphitheatre and currently serves as a National Trust Park . <p> When the Claremont Estate redevelopment was going on , Macaulay , in his essay on Clive says , <p> " The peasantry of Surrey looked with mysterious horror on the stately house which was rising at Claremont , and whispered that the great wicked Lord had ordered the walls to be made so thick in order to keep out the devil , who would one day carry him away bodily " . <p> Although Clive spent lavishly to create a beautiful house with a beautiful estate he never had the opportunity to enjoy the finished product as he committed suicide before the work was completed . <p> ( Below right is a picture of Clive 's bath on the basement of Claremont Hall ) .

##985452 <p> Tsunami waves are religion blind in the sense that it hardly discriminates the victim based on caste , creed , and religion . When killer waves were formed in the aftermath of volcanic eruption deep inside the ocean in southern Indian Ocean ( at the ground zero of the tremor ) , the Muslim inhabitants of the northern coast of Sumatra including Banda Aceh suffered a great deal . The same wave when hit the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka , it pummeled the shoreline killing thousands of Buddhists . When the pernicious wave hit the island of Pukhet in southwestern Thailand , it killed thousands of tourists , mostly Christians from Europe and America . When the dangerous wave came to Southern India in the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra , thousands of Hindu fishermen had died . Therefore , it seems as if the killer tsunami hardly chose its victims based on religiosity and ethnicity . <p> As per the WSJ article , a Muslim cleric , Mohamed Yunoos , had been helping the tsunami victims of a fishing village in the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madras . A Hindu fisherman by the name Arungan hung from the top of a Cashew nut tree for 45 minutes as the wave raged through the shoreline . After the fury of tsunami subsided , he found a safe haven in a mosque run by Mohamed Yunoos . Speaking of the Muslims who extended their helping hands , the Hindu fisherman said , " These men are like brothers to me . " The Muslim cleric made rooms for tsunami victims in a wedding hall , which has been transformed into a makeshift refugee camp . What a way to show the spirit of humanism ! <p> The coast of Madras that was hit by killer tsunami is inhabited mostly by low caste Hindus who make a living by fishing the coastal waters . In the aftermath of tsunami , many dead bodies lay scattered near the beaches but untouched by any upper caste Hindus living nearby for the fear that the dead bodies may belong to low caste Hindus . However , the Muslims from the area helped remove the decaying bodies so that final rites can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me this piece of news . <p> The WSJ article mentioned that Mr. Yunoos and his Muslim welfare organization , the United Islamic Jamaah , had offered their help to tsunami victim . We all should laud this effort by the Tamil Muslims . India had been plagued with sectarian feuds since early 1990s because of the controversy surrounding the Babri Mosque fiasco in Ayodha , Uttar Pradesh . In 2002 , the Hindu fanatics in Gujarat incited a riot in which thousands of Muslims were butchered . In the same year , both India and Pakistan flirted with a nuclear war over Kashmir , which both the sides claim to be their own since the great partition of 1947 . <p> I learned from the WSJ article that the village of Parangipettai , which is home to Mohamed Yunoos 's mosque , is perched on a small hill above the Bay of Bengal . That is the reason the mosque was spared the wrath and fury of the killer tsunami . The mosque grew over the years because of the patronage from some of the village folks who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The local Muslims are devoutly religious who live in the secluded hilltop far away from Hindu villages that dot Cuddalore district of coastal Tamil Nadu . According to the news , the brunt of the tsunami was borne by the Hindu villagers of Cuddalore district . Because of the hilltop location of Parangipettai , the Muslims were spared from the wrath of the killer waves . <p> As per the news , immediately after tsunami , the 500 members of Mohamed Yunoos 's mosque decided to assume a key role in post tsunami rehabilitation work in Cuddalore district . The local Hindus and politicians of the nearby district confirmed this piece of news . One of the Muslims from Parangipettai was riding his motorcycle near the shoreline when the big waves were coming . He alerted the local fisherman to come to shore and then he biked quickly to the hilltop village of Parangipettai to organize a relief work to assuage the pain of those unfortunate people living by the shoreline . Many Muslims took their motorbikes to the shore when tsunami-led waves had subsided and they brought injured fisherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name " Mahmoodhia Shadi Mahal " ( Mohammedan Wedding Palace ) . The victims , all Hindus , were housed , clothed , and fed by the local Muslims . One Hindu elder said that the local Muslims acted like as if they are gods . Mr. Yunoos 's mosque has spread the word for help to other Muslim communities elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East . The mosque in Parangipettai is preparing meal for 10,000 destitute people each day . <p> As per the WSJ report , local television stations in Madras have lauded Yunoos 's group for engendering new hope for Hindu-Muslim amity in India after the terrible tragedy of Gujarat riot . The news of this new humanitarian effort went all the way up to New Delhi from where the finance minister , Mr. Chidambaram , came to witness the benevolent work done by the Muslims of Parangipettai . In the meantime , more volunteers from Mr. Yunoos 's mosque have fanned out to villages dotting the shoreline with trucks carrying hot meals for Hindus who could not make it to the hilltop mosque . One such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Hindu temple with statue of Durga , who according to legend is supposed to protect the villagers from disasters and whatnot . The local Hindus those who were affected by the tsunami are philosophical about the natural disaster . As per the WSJ report , someone said , " We are all fishermen here . Religion comes second . " <p> This scribe was moved immensely by the comment of a mortal from Samiyarpettai . What a profound statement ! Certain seashores of Southern Asia took a beating on December 26 , 2004 by tsunami engendered by a 9.0 or more Richter scale earthquake near Banda Aceh , Indonesia . However , the show of humanity by a small Muslim community in Parangipettai , Tamil Nadu , India , caught my attention . The low caste Hindus in affected area near Parangipettai did not mind receiving aid from their Muslim brothers and sisters . The eye-opener was the refusal by the upper caste Hindu to perform the " Sat-kar " or last rite of the dead , which the Muslims did on humanitarian ground alone . The best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us dwell on this show of humanity by a small community of Muslims in an obscure part of coastal Tamil Nadu , India . This ought to be an eye opener for many people in South Asia who look at our world through an artificial lens . Deep down , we all are human being with flesh and blood and emotion . As the fisherman from Samiyarpettai , Tamil Nadu , India said , " We all are fisherman here . Religion comes second . " <p> **27;5973;TOOLONG <p> A.H . Jaffor Ullah ,

##989552 November , 2012 Friday <p> Breaking News : <p> Hazaribagh slum fire kills 11 , injures 2 <h> Book Review <p> The Islamic world in the new Century : The Organization of the Islamic Conference , 1969-2009 By Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu ( London : Hurst &; Company 2010 , 326 pgs . ) This book answers the question : what has the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) done in the past forty years of its existence ? It courageously addresses some existential questions of its relevance and place in today 's complicated , interconnected and multi-clustered world . Written from an insider 's standpoint , it is a fairly objective recount of the Organization 's successes and failures with much self-evaluation and criticism . Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu is the current Secretary General of the OIC since 2005 . He is the ninth , and first democratically elected , Secretary General of the OIC , but his association with the OIC goes back to 1980 when he took office as founding director general of the Research Centre for Islamic History , Art and Culture ( IRCICA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very informative and useful study of the history of the OIC within the context of the history of the Islamic world and international events during the past forty years . It provides a clear perspective on the OIC as an organization , what it stands for , its role and objectives , and how it came into existence and why . However , it is not just simply a historical narrative of events , but more importantly an in-depth analysis of the background and circumstances that prompted its creation and influenced its function . In that , the book is valuable in its honest evaluation of the OIC in terms of meeting objectives and expectations by admitting to its weaknesses and shortcomings , particularly with regards to inadequate financial and human resources as well as political will and support from the member states . The book falls in nine chapters , in addition to an annex of statistical indicators of the OIC member countries and appendices of important documents such as the Ten Year Program of Action , the new OIC Charter , Makkah Declaration on the Iraqi Situation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds light on the period following the abolition in 1924 of the last Caliphate , an institution under which many Muslims had lived for centuries as a united entity , nurtured and comforted by the feeling of belonging to one nation , the Muslim Ummah . Muslim world leaders had made several calls and taken several initiatives to convene Islamic fora to revive that concept of Islamic unity and solidarity in the contemporary world . However , it was not until 1969 , when an arson attack by a fanatical Australian Jew caused extensive damage to Islam 's third holiest sanctuary , the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem , that steps to form a representative of the Muslim world became more urgent . Thus , the OIC was established as the first intergovernmental Islamic organisation of the modern era . Ihsanoglu takes great care in clarifying the position and weight of religion as a frame of reference , drawing the line between religion and politics . He states that Islam provides a source of likeness amongst the OIC Member States , which came together in an organization based on the participation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the principle unit in this organisation , " writes Ihsanoglu . Chapter 2 details the formative years of the OIC and its subsequent expansion and development in terms of membership from 25 to 57 countries and the establishment of standing committees , subsidiary , specialised and affiliated institutions , which were created to meet the various objectives and mandates of the OIC in different fields including the political , economic , cultural and scientific . The third and fourth chapters are very interesting as they chronicle and explain the reform and restructuring process of the OIC , which is the primary theme of the book , from its early attempts culminating into the historic milestone achievement of the Third Extraordinary Islamic Summit in Makkah in 2005 , which heralded a new era for the OIC by launching the Ten-Year Program of Action ( TYPOA ) and was further endorsed by the adoption of a new charter at the Eleventh Islamic Summit in Dakar in 2008 . Thus , the principle mission that the OIC assumes today is to achieve modernization and moderation in the Muslim world shaped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motto ' Solidarity in Action ' . The following chapters delve into the various activities of the OIC undertaken in fulfillment of its role which were expanded on , reframed or added based on the new charter and TYPOA . Hence , the book documents OIC action with regard to some political causes of the Muslim world , particularly Palestine , Afghanistan , Bosnia , Jammu and Kashmir , Iraq and Somalia , as part of its role in promoting peace and resolving conflicts , which also includes addressing issues of Muslim minorities and communities in different parts of the world . It also highlights the new challenges and aspirations tackled by the OIC such as Islamophobia , post-disaster humanitarian relief , reinvigorating science , technology and innovation , attaining better economic and commercial cooperation among the member states and strengthening socio-economic development . Ihsanoglu argues that representative government , free speech and equal rights for all citizens are critical for Muslim societies , and as OIC is the voice of the Muslim world , he envisions the need to reform the OIC as a necessary step towards renewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past five years in reaching that goal and the

He used to tell us that a school is needed to mix with other students , to interact and differentiate between the bad company and the good company .

But my mother was that positive towards her daughters ' education and career . She was not negative either . Now I have developed my career and status and my own business . My mother realized that a women has also the potential . She encouraged my daughters to build up their career . She told them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my two daughters . Actually my working and my doing well changed my mother 's idea and views . Before that she was not optimistic and later on she was more positive . My father was very supportive all the time . <p> A high-quality study life <p> I was born in Calcutta . I spent a very brief period in Loreto convent Calcutta for two months before we went to Karachi . I was in Karachi in Saint Joseph convent school and college . Straight from college I got an opportunity to join a bank . <p> The career begins <p> I entered the bank . While working in the bank I took all technical education . I had one-year technical training in banking which included accounting , bookkeeping . After that we had to take another exam called the institute of bankers in Pakistan . For that I had to take evening classes from the institute of bankers . My technical education was financial banking . <p> It was Muslim commercial Bank . While doing the job over there I was getting paid , I got my training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch and I was number two in that branch . It was a ladies branch . From there they transferred me to east Pakistan Dhaka in 1964 I became the first women 's bank manager . I took a group of women under me and trained them and they became my professionals . <p> A wonderful life partner <p> I could have not achieved all the good things if was not supportive . He met me when I had a career . He married me when I was in a bank . I became manager in July and I got married in October 1964 . He never complained about anything . Even today he appreciates the way I have manage my business , children and grand children . He has always been supportive as well understanding with me . <p> An amazing family <p> I have two daughters and a son . They also have been very understanding when I started my business . I could not give them enough time but they understood that . They realized that she was not lazing around . She was not having fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that they all are established now . I balanced my time between my family and work <p> A appreciative and understanding in-laws <p> I did n't have to leave the bank just because I got married . My in-laws were very supportive . They always appreciate my work and they are proud of my work and me . They are first ones who call us and congratulate me when I achieve something . I was lucky that my in laws are very broad minded . <p> After marriage I took a break of 12 years ....... <p> I took this break to raise my children and to devote myself towards my family . I used this time to publish a magazine called " keya " which promoted the crafts . After that I became the chairperson of Bangladesh Handicraft and Cooperative Federation . At that time I used to have the meetings at home because I wanted to give time to my children as well . I also joined Karika , an organization promoting indigenous handicrafts , a job that had the flexible working hours necessary for a young mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfied working from home , so when my children reached their teens I started my cold storage business . In 1980 I set up RR Cold Storage with loans from BSB ( Bangladesh Shilpa bank ) . With the BSB loan I bought land in Munshiganj , imported machinery and set up the cold storage plant . I was determined to make the business successful . I was ready to take risks and I used to stick to my commitments . In 1997 I bought an ailing cold storage , revamped it with new machinery and new management . <p> My Experience <p> As the cold storage was located in remote area , there we did n't have access by road and we had to go by launch wearing life jackets . Even today we do the same thing . I have to visit the cold storage personally to interact with the farmers and the workers who have accepted me as a trustworthy employer . I have tried to make them feel free talking with me about any kind of problem they are having over there . <p> My business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also deciding the price and growth of the vegetable , renting out space as well as storing seeds for the farmers for the next year 's season . <p> A Clandestine dream that came true <p> I always had a dream to do something for the women of Bangladesh . I had a hidden ambition to promote women entrepreneurship in Bangladesh . As a board member and chairperson of MIDAS 's Women entrepreneurship Development Committee , I got the chance to help the women start business with collateral free loans . At the monthly meetings I counsel the women entrepreneurs on business strategies and upgrading products . I also helped to set up outlets known as " Mini marts " to market the products . I have initiated the Women 2 Women Support Programs whereby an established woman entrepreneur helps a potential woman entrepreneur for a whole year to give her a head start . <p> The working environment <p> When I was at the bank there was no woman in bank in Bangladesh . While I was in a meeting there were 400 men and I was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than any man . I could do the same balance sheets that the men do . It gave me a feeling of confidence . They used to respect me and listened to me . When I was in a bank the environment was good . I really did n't face any problem doing work in the bank . They never discriminated me as I was in woman . <p> My words for the young women <p> All the women should have a career now a day 's . For that they must study . If I can manage a business and a family at the same time , all the other women can do the same . They must have the hard work and take the initiative . If they try they can be the leaders everywhere they want to . They can be at home and do something productive . They must be encouraged by their family , life partner , the government , 
##992452 <p> i cant understand y 20/20 cricket is being used for globalisation in the non-test playing countries . the level of batting is very low in most of the non-test countries and in odis , they usually struggle to bat out their full 50 overs . 20/20 is not going to improve the level of batting in cricket . most non-test teams would struggle to make 100+ scores in 20/20 against the test-playing teams or even domestic teams of test-playing nations . 20/20 was initially launched to spread cricket in canada &; usa , where the game does not have a chance to take off . its just like showing the penalty corners package of a football match instead of showing the whole football match itself . <p> for globalisation , FC cricket should be used and the non-test playing teams should be encouraged to play more 4-day matches among themselves and even have a domestic 4-day competition . this will help improve the level of batting in the non-test teams &; it will show in the odis as they will start to make 250+ scores regularly playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get test status . <p> also , icc should make a list of non-test teams where cricket can take off like ireland , scotland , holland(maybe) , nepal , afghanistan , malaysia(maybe) , kenya , uganda as they have a bit of a cricketing culture . in canada , usa , uae there r expat based teams and the locals do nt care for cricket . to make cricket a 3 hour slam-boom-bang affair to spread cricket in places where it cant take off is useless . <p> 20/20 cricket should be kept limited only to non-asian test playing nations like aus , eng , sa , nz , wi. even asian teams have struggled in 20/20 and 20/20 can kill cricket in places like bangladesh where batsmen r too flashy . <p> 20-20 is an excellent idea and it will replace the current version of oneday cricket . this is necessary to save cricket . otherwise cricket will never be globalized , it will be limited to those few areas . <p> i do nt really agree on this ... i think 20/20 is the one way to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashy to the eye ... and even for weaker teams who do nt last much in normal cricket , 20/20 might be more of a chance as they do nt have to use too much gramatical shots , but rather slogs might end up working on few occasions ... and teams like bangladesh have a much higher chance of winning in 20/20s , than winning tests or even odis , infact i suspect bangladesh will be really good at 20/20 once they get used to it ... but i know that bd always takes longer than others to get used to somethin for some weird reason ... so ya ... i really cant agree with you im afraid ... <p> 20/20 is not going to attract people . its test cricket which is real cricket and so FC cricket is the thing which should be used for globalisation. there should be more efforts made by the icc to spread cricket in those countries where test cricket has a chance of taking off like ireland , scotland , kenya , nepal than canada , usa where people wont have the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , cricket should be spread like it is in its true form ( test &; fc cricket ) , it shouldnt be changed to be spread . if thats the case , y not reduce football to a game of just penalty strokes where the other 10 people besides the goalkeeper have a shoot at the goal . <p> u can c in stanford 20/20 where teams like bermuda , cayman islands , argentina were included and they struggled to make even 80 against domestic teams of west indies . now what help can that do in spreading the game there . it looks like doing more harm than good for the game in the associate countries . also , in nepal , where teams struggle to make even 150 in 50 overs , 20/20 will kill cricket completely over there . <p> Originally Posted by israr I am disappointed that people are losing enthusiasm in the ' real ' beauty of the game . <p> It 's instant gratification and glitz they 're after bro ... the attention span fluctuates too much to behold anything as beautiful .

Four day matches will not , as to someone who has never watched cricket and ca n't appreciate it , it is simply too slow . Twenty20 only takes 3 hours , like most other sports , therefore people will ( or should not ) lose interest . <p> My thoughts , are that Twenty20 SHOULD be used for globalisation . How ?

But do n't include the top nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When interest in these countries rises , they then move on to playing ODI 's , and maybe even Test 's down the track . <p> But Twenty20 must be used to promote cricket .

Only those who have ties with the main cricket playing nations will have interest . This is more like concentrating on your niche . They should ban 20/20 for global entertainment . For money making purposes " yeah " why not . But not for globalization . One ca n't compete against Football , or Basketball ( world wide ) . It is the Rugby , Hockey that we are competing against .

##998351 <p> The power sector in Bangladesh has been undergoing a process of significant institutional change . Since 1972 the operation of the power sector has been the responsibility of the Bangladesh Power Development Board ( BPDB ) , reporting to the Ministry of Power , Energy and Mineral Resources ( MPEMR ) . This responsibility has been subdivided over the years , initially with the setting up of the Rural Electrification Board ( REB ) in 1978 , and the subsequent creation of a co-operative based model for expansion of access , the co-operatives being known as Palli Bidyuit Samity ( PBS ) . In 1991 the responsibility for power distribution in Dhaka was vested with the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority ( DESA ) . Since the mid 1990s , the Government of Bangladesh has continued with the vertical unbundling of the sector , through the creation of separate publicly owned entities for generation , transmission and distribution , and the development of a Single Buyer market model . This has led to the entry of a number of Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) into the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of independently managed entities which are gradually taking over the operational responsibility previously vested with BPDB , thereby changing its status to that of a holding Company , with management control being decentralized into the business units .

##998650 <h> All-round Bangladesh breeze to win <p> Bangladesh 's fortunes continued to swing wildly on their tour of Europe , as they followed Tuesday 's big loss to Scotland with a comprehensive victory over Netherlands at The Hague . The eight-wicket win , in the first of two Twenty20s against Netherlands , was set up by unbeaten half-century from opener Tamim Iqbal . <p> Pursuing 145 , Bangladesh might have been in a bit more trouble had Tom Cooper held on to a regulation chance offered by Tamim early on : he came down the track to Tim Gruijters off the fifth ball of the chase and drove in the air straight to Cooper at extra cover , and the catch was grassed . From there on , Tamim grew rather cautious . He took only two fours off his first 31 deliveries . <p> At 66 for 2 halfway through the chase , with 79 more required , Netherlands might have fancied their chances . But Tamim squashed those hopes by opening up with three hits down the ground , for two sixes and a four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end , Mushfiqur Rahim extended solid support with 37 off 24 - he ensured Bangladesh finished with a flourish , depositing sixes over long-on and midwicket off Mudassar Bukhari to end the game in the 18th over . <p> Earlier Netherlands , after choosing to bat , could not quite get a partnership going . They were tottering at 14 for 3 , with the two most effective bowlers in the game , Mashrafe Mortaza and Shakib Al Hasan , both striking early blows . Michael Swart could not find adequate company , and despite his 57 off 41 balls and a few boundaries from the lower-middle order at the end , Netherlands could only manage 144 for 7 . <p> While this win might not have much of an impact on Bangladesh 's ranking - previous wins and losses on this tour have seen them go from nowhere on the Twenty20 table up to No. 4 and back down to No. 9 - it could help salvage some pride . <p> @FastTrackBully ... haha ...

##1003050 <p> I n Kohat , in the North-Western Frontier Province of Pakistan , a rape victim has been sentenced to death by stoning . Zafran Bi Bi , wife of Naimat Khan from Kenri Sheikhan , is facing execution for alleged adultery , reports Pakistani Human Rights activist Shaheen Burney , who has written to President Musharraf , requesting his intervention . <p> Zafran Bi Bi was arrested two years back together with Akmal Khan , the brother of her husband , and accused of adultery , which is according to the Islamic Law of Pakistan punishable by stoning to death . In police custody in Gambat police station and later in the court of Additional District Judge Anwar Ali Khan , Zafran Bi Bi declared that she was innocent and had been raped by Akmal . But she was kept in detention and the case was persuaded against her , while Akmal Khan was released . <p> Rationalist International calls upon all friends to send email messages to the President of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf and request him to intervene and stop the execution of Zafran Bi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International as well . <p> The following information regarding the zina sections of the Hudood Ordinances is extracted/based on the Commission of Inquiry for Women Report of 1997 ( pages 64-75 ) , that was headed by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid , a serving Justice of the Supreme Court at the time . Prepared by Shirkat Gah for the JAC Meeting Peshawar May 4th 2002 on Zafran Bibi Case . <p> 1 . Zina ( Enforcement of Hadd ) Ordinance was introduced by General Zia regime in 1979 . <p> - Offences covered under this law are : Zina ( both fornication and adultery ) rape , kidnapping , abducting or inducing a woman to illicit sex or compelling her to marriage against her will , enticement or detaining a woman with criminal intent , selling or buying a person for purposes of prostitution . <p> - Under the Zina law , for criminal liability for adults a girl is considered adult at 16 or on attaining puberty while a boy is considered adult at 18 or when pubert . <p> 2 . There are two sets of punishments under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving no discretion with the court and has very stringent rules of evidence . <p> - The number and qualification of witnesses is specified in the law . A hadd sentence requires the evidence of four adult male Muslim witnesses ( who are truthful persons and abstain from major sins ) . <p> - Non-Muslim males can only be witnesses when the accused is a non-Muslim . <p> Thus the evidentiary requirements for the punishment of hadd are discriminatory against women and non-Muslims . <p> - The confession of the accused before a competent court is the other form of evidence where the punishment of hadd may be awarded . If before the execution of sentence the accused retracts this confession , hadd can not be imposed . <p> 3 . The Zina Ordinance has been a controversial law since the day it was promulgated . It has been criticised for being derogatory and biased in the context of women . Before the promulgation of this law , women could not be tried for zina since previously zina was only a crime in the form of adultery . The punishment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adultery could only be made by the husband of the adulteress or in his absence by some person who had care of such woman on his behalf . But females could not be punished under this law . The crime was compoundable and bailable . If the complainant chose to drop the charges , or not to prosecute the offender , criminal proceedings against the accused were automatically dropped . <p> 4 . Statistics of appeals filed in the Federal Shariat Court ( 1980-87 ) show a high rate of acquittal . This low conviction rate indicates that an extremely large number of zina allegations are either false or based on suspicion . This is only one of the aspects of the exploitative nature of the law . <p> 5 . As soon as the law was changed to include women within the scope of its punishment , allegations of zina started to run into thousands . This clearly indicates that as long as it was only the male who could be punished for adultery , there was a reluctance to prosecute . The Ordinance became a tool in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Chief Justice of Pakistan , Justice Mohammad Afzal Zullah , confirmed that 95% of all Hudood cases in the superior courts had been decided in favour of women . ( The Muslim , Islamabad , March 9 , 1993 ) . Clearly these must have been false cases . <p> 6 . Jail figures also confirm that women are frequently victims of this law . In 1988 in Punjab jails out of a total of 657 women in jail , 306 were charged under zina . At 47% this is nearly half of all the women prisoners . 7th July 1997 figures of the following jails statistics were : <p> Name of jail <p> Total under Trial of Prisoners Charged with Zina <p> Multan Women 's Jail <p> 9138 <p> D.G.Khan <p> 2016 <p> Rawalpindi <p> 8922 <p> Faisalabad <p> 3316 <p> 7 . It is often argued that false accusations must eventually result in acquittal ; that the law of qazf operates as a check on such false accusations of zina ; and that any law can be grossly misused . Such arguments are weak and misleading . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused suffers arrest and often imprisonment during the period of trial . In the case of women , the stigma of such accusations and arrests is by itself a heavy penalty . A large number of female prisoners are unable to provide surety or to get legal assistance , particularly when they have been imprisoned at the instigation of their own families . Despite this , courts nevertheless sometimes require women to bring surety of family members who are the complainant party . <p> Law of Qazf does not act as any deterrent and is a weak law : <p> - It is a non-cognisable and a bailable offence . <p> - The complainant can not straightaway lodge an FIR . <p> - Majority of women do not have the facilities to initiate Qazf proceedings . <p> - The courts have ruled that during subsistence of the marriage , a husband can not be punished on allegations of Qazf . <p> - Prosecution for qazf have been few and far between . The number of qazf cases is less than 1% of the number of zina cases . The figure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charges of zina . <p> This law is a tool of exploitation in the hands of law enforcing agencies and ' family members ' of women who are perceived to defy ' norms ' of society by exercising their legal rights . Most of the FIRs are filed either by the parents because their daughter has married someone of her own choice or by the former husbands on remarriage of their former wives . The COI Report mentions its own review of case law reported in the Pakistan Annual Law Digest of 1995 . <p> Out of the 60 cases looked at by the Commission , 15 pertained to people who had married against the wishes of their families . One woman was accused of Zina even though she possessed and produced records of the Family Court and the High Court to prove that she had been legally divorced before she remarried . <p> That police officials collude with the families and pursuers of women has been exposed in a number of reported cases , where police officials have held inquiries on allegations of Zina even through intimation by post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in an impossible situation : if she reports rape , she runs the risk of being accused of Zina , if she does not , her possible pregnancy may result in her being charged of zina anyway . <p> 9 . " The argument that every law can be misused may be correct to some extent . But , thus stated , it addresses the wrong question . The relevant test is not whether a piece of legislation can ever be misused but rather whether it is worth enacting at all given the potential for its abuse and the results which its enforcement would produce . This Commission is strongly of the opinion that the zina Ordinance fails this test . Abundant data testifies that the result of this law has been the victimisation rather than the protection of people , and that the law has had a particularly adverse effect on the least privileged members of society . " ( COI Report 1997 page 70 ) <p> In conclusion the Commission of Inquiry made the following recommendation : <p> The Commission is convinced that all the Hudood laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with the injunctions of Islam . <p> Secondly , these laws have come into direct conflict both with the country 's Constitution ( such as of Article 25 ) and its international commitments ( as made at the Fourth World on Women at Beijing and under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ) . <p> Thirdly , in practical terms too , these laws have demonstrably failed to serve their purpose . They have not been any deterrent against crimes . And they have only led to proliferation of complaints in the courts , which , as it happens , have mostly been false or unjustified and have caused undue hardship . <p> It is necessary therefore that : <p> 1 . The Hudood laws are repealed . <p> 2 . The repealed provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code , 1860 , are re-enacted with an amendment to make marital rape a penal offence and to impose a severer punishment for rape on a minor wife . <p> 3 . If the Parliament considers it necessary to make any further laws in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by reaching a consensus that the proposed laws are in accordance 
##1003052 <p> This morning there was a knock at my door . When I answered the door I found a well groomed , nicely dressed couple . The man spoke first : <p> John : <p> " Hi ! I 'm John , and this is Mary . " <p> Mary : <p> Hi ! We 're here to invite you to come kiss Hank 's backside with us . " <p> Me : <p> " Pardon me ? ! What are you talking about ? Who 's Hank , and why would I want to kiss His backside ? " <p> John : <p> " If you kiss Hank 's backside , He 'll give you a million dollars ; and if you do n't , He 'll kick the snot out of you . " <p> Me : <p> " What ? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down ? " <p> John : <p> " Hank is a billionaire philanthropist . Hank built this town . Hank owns this town . He can do whatever He wants , and what He wants is to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kiss His backside . " <p> Me : <p> " That does n't make any sense . Why ... " <p> Mary : <p> " Who are you to question Hank 's gift ? Do n't you want a million dollars ? Is n't it worth a little kiss on the backside ? " <p> Me : <p> " Well maybe , if it 's legit , but ... " <p> John : <p> " Then come kiss Hank 's backside with us . " <p> Me : <p> " Do you kiss Hank 's backside often ? " <p> Mary : <p> " Oh yes , all the time ... " <p> Me : <p> " And has He given you a million dollars ? " <p> John : <p> " Well no . You do n't actually get the money until you leave town . " <p> Me : <p> " So why do n't you just leave town now ? " <p> Mary : <p> " You ca n't leave until Hank tells you to , or you do n't get the money , and He kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do you know anyone who kissed Hank 's backside , left town , and got the million dollars ? " <p> John : <p> " My mother kissed Hank 's backside for years . She left town last year , and I 'm sure she got the money . " <p> Me : <p> " Have n't you talked to her since then ? " <p> John : <p> " Of course not , Hank does n't allow it . " <p> Me : <p> " So what makes you think He 'll actually give you the money if you 've never talked to anyone who got the money ? " <p> Mary : <p> " Well , He gives you a little bit before you leave . Maybe you 'll get a raise , maybe you 'll win a small lotto , maybe you 'll just find a twenty-dollar bill on the street . " <p> Me : <p> " What 's that got to do with Hank ? " <p> John : <p> " Hank has certain ' connections . ' " <p> Me : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bizarre con game . " <p> John : <p> " But it 's a million dollars , can you really take the chance ? And remember , if you do n't kiss Hank 's backside He 'll kick the snot of you . " <p> Me : <p> " Maybe if I could see Hank , talk to Him , get the details straight from Him ... " <p> Mary : <p> " No one sees Hank , no one talks to Hank . " <p> Me : <p> " Then how do you kiss His backside ? " <p> John : <p> " Sometimes we just blow Him a kiss , and think of His backside . Other times we kiss Karl 's backside , and he passes it on . " <p> Me : <p> " Who 's Karl ? " <p> Mary : <p> " A friend of ours . He 's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank 's backside . All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times . " <p> Me : <p> " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Hank , that Hank wanted you to kiss His backside , and that Hank would reward you ? " <p> John : <p> " Oh no ! Karl has a letter he got from Hank years ago explaining the whole thing . Here 's a copy ; see for yourself . " <p> From the desk of Karl <p> Kiss Hank 's backside and He 'll give you a million dollars when you leave town . <p> Use alcohol in moderation . <p> Kick the snot out of people who are n't like you . <p> Eat right . <p> Hank dictated this list Himself . <p> The moon is made of green cheese . <p> Everything Hank says is right . <p> Wash your hands after going to the bathroom . <p> Do n't use alcohol . <p> Eat your wieners on buns , no condiments . <p> Kiss Hank 's backside or He 'll kick the snot out of you . <p> Me : <p> " This appears to be written on Karl 's letterhead . " <p> Mary : <p> " Hank did n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunch that if we checked we 'd find this is Karl 's handwriting . " <p> John : <p> " Of course , Hank dictated it . " <p> Me : <p> " I thought you said no one gets to see Hank ? " <p> Mary : <p> " Not now , but years ago He would talk to some people . " <p> Me : <p> " I thought you said He was a philanthropist . What sort of philanthropist kicks the snot out of people just because they 're different ? " <p> " But 9 says ' Do n't use alcohol . ' which does n't quite go with item 2 , and 6 says ' The moon is made of green cheese , ' which is just plain wrong . " <p> John : <p> " There 's no contradiction between 9 and 2 , 9 just clarifies 2 . As far as 6 goes , you 've never been to the moon , so you ca n't say for sure . " <p> Me : <p> " Scientists have pretty firmly established that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But they do n't know if the rock came from the Earth , or from out of space , so it could just as easily be green cheese . " <p> Me : <p> " I 'm not really an expert , but I think the theory that the Moon was somehow ' captured ' by the Earth has been discounted . Besides , not knowing where the rock came from does n't make it cheese . " <p> John : <p> " Ha ! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes , but we know Hank is always right ! " <p> Me : <p> " We do ? " <p> Mary : <p> " Of course we do , Item 7 says so . " <p> Me : <p> " You 're saying Hank 's always right because the list says so , the list is right because Hank dictated it , and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so . That 's circular logic , no different than saying ' Hank 's right because He says He 's right . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank 's way of thinking .

I 'll kiss Hank 
##1008252 <p> Natore zmaindary was famous not only in north Bengal . It was rather one of the big zamindaries of Bengal . The founders of this zamindary were Ramjivan and Raghunandan , both son of Kamdev . Ramjivan was the first zamindar of this zamindar family . His daughter-in-law ( wife of Ramkanta ) Maharani Bhawani was a reputed zamindar not only in the area but also earned fame among the zamindars of whole Bengal . In Natore zamindary there came into being two co-sharers in 1778 . One is known Barataraf ( composed of descendants of Sibnath ) and the other Chhotataraf ( composed of descendants of Viswanath ) . <p> After becoming zamindar Ramjivan built his Rajbari at Natore . It was constructed on a huge area of 50.42 acres of land . The Rajbari was protected on all sides by ditches . There were nine secular buildings in this Rajbari . They are the palace of Barataraf , palace of Chhotataraf , Kachari Bhaban and Guard-House of Barataraf , Kachari Bhaban of Chhotataraf , Rani Mahal , Guest-House , Honey Queen Bahaban , Tarkeshawar temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajbari are described below . <p> Main gateway of Natore Rajbari <p> Palace ( Barataraf ) <p> It is built in rectangular plan . It has a central reception hall ( 7.47x16.01 m ) with twelve rooms . The palace has four verandahs on four sides . For light and ventilation of the central hall room there are Venetian arch and clerestory windows in the upper part of the walls . Besides this , the hall room has three entrances each having one fan-light . In front of the southern verandah of the building there is an arched porch . Each entrance of the building has segmental arch and is fitted with wooden Venetian blind . The floor of each room of this building and the verandah are covered with marble stone . The parapet of the building has arrow slit . The walls of all the rooms of the palace are coated with plaster . The parapet of the central hall has merlon with turrets and below the cornice there is a frieze of undulating vines and leaves all executed in cut-plaster technique . <p> Kachari Bhavan ( Barataraf ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall room in the center this building has in all eleven rooms . There is a porch in front of the northern verandah . On the east and west of the central room there are ten rooms of various sizes . The hall room has twelve clerestory windows to facilitate the entry of light . All the rooms have segmental arched entrances . The building is coated with plaster and has no trace of any kind of ornamentation . <p> Guard-House and Store-House ( Barataraf ) <p> It is also a one storied building . It is divided into three blocks each having an iwan . The first iwan of the southern side is double-storied . While the first block of the building has seven rooms , middle one has only one and third one has four rooms . The rooms of the first block were used as guard house and those of middle and third blocks were used as storehouses . In front of each block there is a verandah . This building has some traces of decoration . Below the cornice has been depicted a row of dog-tooth design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a flower , a bud and a leaf . <p> Palace ( Chhotataraf ) <p> This palace is situated on the west bank of Ananda Kali tank . It is also one storied . There is a central reception hall around which are arranged fifteen rooms . This east-facing palace has three verandahs on the east , west and south . Each verandah has an arcade of semi-circular arch . In front of the eastern verandah there is a porch with two arched entrances on its north and south . The east and west sides the central hall room are respectively flanked by seven and eight rooms . The flat roof of each room of the palace is constructed with iron beams . The three verandahs of palace are covered with black and white marble stone . The inner part of the palace is without any ornamentation whatsoever . But the outer surface of the walls bears some sort of cut plaster decoration . The cornice of the building is supported by a row of small brackets below which runs a wide frieze having flower , female figure and undulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches of the verandah and those of the entrances of the rooms have some plaster decoration . The keystones of these arches bear the figure of a sage . In the ornamented scheme of the arches have been included undulating vines and figures of birds . On the front parapet of the porch has been incised on the plaster a medallion which perhaps indicates a symbol of royal insignia . This is also accompanied by undulating vines , leaves and sculptured human figure as used in classical Greek architecture . In the scheme of decoration is also noticed female figure flanked by two kores . <p> Since no exact date is found on the record the date of construction of these buildings can not be determined with exact precision . But the building style indicates that these were constructed after the earthquake of 1897 and most probably in the early years of the 20th century . <p> Decorated parapet of porch <p> Tarekeshawar Shiva Mandir <p> It is situated to the south-east corner of the Kachari Bhavan of Barataraf and the north bank of Tarekeshawar tank . It is an octagonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archway , one is east and the other is south . There is a narrow open verandah surrounded the structure . The temple is covered with a ribbed dome . The inner and outer wall surface is coated with plaster . But the outer wall surface is engraved with the epic story of Ramayan executed in cut-plaster technique . This temple was erected by Tara Sundari , daughter of Rani Bhawani in the last half of 18th century . <p> Besides this temple , SreSreShaymsundar Biggroha Mandir of Barataraf is also attractive for its architectural beauty . It is located inside the Guard-house and store house of Barataraf . <p> Other buildings <p> The other buildings of the Natore Rajbari , such as , Rani Mahal , Guest house of the Barataraf , Honey Queen Bhavan , Kachari Bhavan of Chhotataraf and a series of temples are in a dilapidated condition .

##1011551 <h> Fiction <h> The good guy <p> Naveed Islam <p> Esha shifts uneasily in the passenger 's seat as Safwan slams the door shut beside her . She nervously clicks open the lock on her leather purse and pulls out her mother 's old Nokia cellphone in one swift motion . Safwan 's footsteps on the rain-soaked asphalt echo in her ears like the ticking of a slow moving second hand on a clock . <p> Her thumbs dance along the number keys as the ? New Message ? screen flashes before her eyes : a single tap on 3 , two gentle presses on 6 , a jab on 8 . The door to her right unlocks and the wet smell of grass and earth from the garden outside her apartment building fills the car . She does n't have much time left . Press 0 for space and three clicks on 2 . The weight of the vehicle shifts slightly to the right as he seats himself in front of the steering wheel . Her thumb lingers on the 2 and jumps down a notch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashboard spark to life , but only for a moment . An arm reaches over and suddenly grabs hold of her wrist . The car stops shaking as Safwan 's unmerciful gaze meets her fearful eyes . <p> ? Who are you SMS-ing ? ? he asks with an uncharacteristically stern voice , changed from its usual unassuming boyish tone . <p> ? Tanveer Bhaiya , ? she says , taking care not to move any muscle on her face to suggest that she was lying , ? he 's a colleague of mine. ? ? Why is he calling you on a Saturday ? ? <p> She would have said that they wanted to see if she was free to come in , that she wanted to say no because he had asked her to spend the afternoon with him instead . It would have been another lie , since she did not want to be here . But , it no longer mattered . He had seen the message she was going to send from the corner of his eye . The recipient was a nameless string of numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her phone for fear that he would see it . <p> ? Whom are you asking not to call you ? Your Tanveer Bhaiya ? ? She does n't respond . ? Esha , I can find out who this is , you know. ? She remains quiet , her wrist being crushed under his strong grip . ? Let go , Safwan. ? <p> ? Tell me who you 're sending this to , ? he says , his voice beginning to shake . ? Is it him ? ? ? No. ? ? I told you to break up with him. ? ? I did , ? she said . This was true . She hated him for it . ? Then why are you sending him a message ? ? <p> ? I 'm not , ? she said , wincing in pain , ? I was asking Nadia apu not to call me ! ? ? Why ? ? he asks , his anger unwavering . ? I thought you would get mad , ? she says , ? I did n't want to ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to him , ? he says as his thin but muscular free arm , hidden beneath the rolled-up sleeves of a striped red shirt , wrestles with her over the phone . Esha 's arm twists and her body screams in pain . She grabs hold of his right arm and digs her pink polished fingernails into the meat on his forearm . He holds his ground and overpowers her , giving her a light shove that knocks her back against the armrest on the passenger 's side door . Esha sits in her corner defeated and glares at Safwan . He takes a cursory glance at the message , presses the cancel key and tucks it into the right pocket of his black dress pants . <p> ? We 're going , ? he says while releasing the handbrake . Esha sits facing forward . The rain pelts the windshield as pedestrians along the sidewalk scurry into shops and under awnings looking for shelter . Her fingers find the hem of her sky-blue orna and begin fiddling with it , a nervous tick from when she was a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safwan had bought for her two years ago when they were dating . They had been walking in Arcadia Plaza , casting sideways glances and secretive knowing smiles at each other as waves of shoppers obliviously passed them by . She had stopped at a small boutique and asked to look at the blue shalwar kameez at the top which , now that she thought about it , had looked turquoise in that light . Safwan had smiled , pulled out his wallet and insisted on buying it for her . She was like a child at a toy store who was being bought a present for her good behavior or academic accomplishment . But their relationship had ended a long time ago and she had moved on . Someone new had taken the space where Safwan 's slight frame , scruffy hair and simple good looks had once occupied . It had been years since he had been in her life . She had been happy until he came looking for her . <p> The boy who sat in the driver 's seat now was someone she did not recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt behind traffic . He pulled down his window and opened a pack of cigarettes from his back pocket . Safwan stuck a Benson in his mouth and let it dangle from his lip while he held a black Zippo lighter up to its tip . It burnt bright orange as he removed it from his lips with his index and ring fingers to exhale a puff . One hand remained on the steering wheel with the cigarette while another dangled from the side of the car . He had begun smoking during their relationship and had never been able to quit . <p> Esha resumed looking through her window as translucent beads of water dripped down the glass . She now wished for nothing more than to be washed away with the rain , to flow with the stream freely to where not even Safwan could keep her from finding happiness . Was n't she entitled to that too ? Could n't she smile and laugh again just like everyone else ? <p> ? Give me my phone back , ? she repeated , this time her patience waning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? <p> ? I was good to you and you took advantage of me , ? he said , the anger rising in him from somewhere dark but warm , ? you made me suffer so now it 's my turn . This is what you deserve ! I wo n't let you go back to him. ? <p> The car slowly edged forward but Esha did not care . She flung her door open as the cacophony of horns on the street welcomed her back from purgatory . A loud slam signaled the beginning of her march toward freedom . The rain beat down heavily as she climbed onto the sidewalk , ignoring the muted surprise of people in nearby cars and confused pedestrians on the street . Safwan 's door had slammed shut behind her . He was now giving chase while she walked down a wet and muddy street in high heels . She held her purse up above her forehead to see through the thick of water pouring from the heavens . Safwan grabbed her free hand and tugged hard enough to nearly trip her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and stared into her eyes with vengeance in his . They stood in the middle of the sidewalk in the rain . <p> ? I 'm going to scream if you do n't let me go ! ? ? Go ahead and scream ! ? ? I 'll do it ? ? No one will come. ? <p> Esha first brushed his hands off of her . He grabbed hold of her wrist and then she started crying for help . Safwan 's cold and unflinching stare stayed fixed on her as she struggled to break free . The men who hurried past them in the rain could n't care less and no one watching from their cars seemed to want to come out . Safwan brought his face close to hers , his wet hair sticking to his forehead and cheeks . <p> ? Get back in the car , ? he said , letting go of her arm . Esha stood there quietly for a minute before he repeated the order . They crossed back to where the traffic had barely moved . Cars behind them honked loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain . Safwan did not hold the door open for her this time . Esha sat back in the passenger 's seat and began to sob . Safwan slid into his space and moved his car forward as the street demanded . <p> ? Any other guy would have knocked you to the ground right there , ? he barked . Hot tears ran down Esha 's cheeks . Safwan sighed and turned to face her , his arm outstretched so that his elbow rested on the back of her seat . The livid glow in his eyes seemed to give way as he said , ? Do n't cry . It hurts me to see you cry. ? <p> Esha considered this for a moment and said , ? Give me my phone back. ? <p> Safwan dug into his pocket , pulled it out and tossed it back to her . She could tell he needed another cigarette . Esha now sat with her phone resting on her lap . Her hands are now bound , incapable of reaching out and finding happiness on her own . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would make the call and ask if the new person in her 
##1013350 <h> Female Abs <p> If you 're a female looking to get abs , there are two primary things that you need to take into account . Those things are : <p> diet and exercise . <p> If you make the mistake of only looking at your diet or only looking at your exercise regime , you 're going to be failing to see the results you 're after . <p> For female abs , both are going to be key . <p> Let 's look at the important points to know about each so that you can get on track to success . <p> Exercise Musts <p> First let 's look at what you need to know from an exercise point of view . If you 're going to be doing female abs workouts , you need to take a full body approach . Do n't make the mistake of hitting the ab mats for hours and hours at a time . <p> Doing that will only waste precious time that could be spent doing something more productive . Instead , focus on your compound movements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that will boost your metabolic rate the most , while recruiting the ab muscles to a larger degree . <p> Furthermore , if you are going to do any direct ab movements in your program , make sure that you somehow incorporate a reduced base of support for instability . This is what will get the ab muscles contracting as hard as possible . <p> For example , prone ball roll-ins or crunches on the exercise ball will both be terrific options . Likewise , doing a plank on an exercise ball is a good exercise for maximum ab recruitment . <p> Nutrition Smarts <p> On the nutrition side of things , this is where you really need to be paying attention . You want to be using a reduced calorie diet to create the deficit for fat loss to take place to get female abs , but not taking your calories so low that you suffer a metabolic slow-down . <p> That will only bring progress to a crawl . Additionally , your diet should be primary focused on lean proteins and vegetables , only adding the complex carbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best for ensuring that you burn fat all day long . If you 're eating too many complex carbs in the diet , even if they are healthy , you 'll be providing more than enough energy to your body , therefore giving it no reason to turn to body fat cells as a fuel source . <p> Instead , if you can focus on depriving it of the energy it needs slightly -- at a time when you 're less active so you can easily utilize body fat as a fuel source , you 'll see faster results . <p> So there you have the primary points that you should be noting when it comes to getting female abs. if you work hard , you will see success as long as you use the right approach .

##1797550 <h> Heart Attack <h> What is Heart Attack ? <p> Heart Attack ( or Myocardial Infarction ) means that part of the heart muscle suddenly loses its blood supply . Without prompt treatment , this can lead to damage to the affected part of the heart . An MI is sometimes called a heart attack or a coronary thrombosis . An MI is part of a range or disorders called ' acute coronary syndromes ' . <h> What causes Heart Attack ? <p> Thrombosis - the cause in most cases <p> The common cause of an MI is a blood clot ( thrombosis ) that forms inside a coronary artery , or one of its branches . This blocks the blood flow to a part of the heart . <p> Blood clots do not usually form in normal arteries . However , a clot may form if there is some atheroma within the lining of the artery . Atheroma is like fatty patches or ' plaques ' that develop within the inside lining of arteries . ( This is similar to water pipes that get ' furred up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of years in one or more places in the coronary arteries . Each plaque has an outer firm shell with a soft inner fatty core . <p> What happens is that a ' crack ' develops in the outer shell of the atheroma plaque . This is called ' plaque rupture ' . This exposes the softer inner core of the plaque to blood . This can trigger the clotting mechanism in the blood to form a blood clot . Therefore , a build up of atheroma is the root problem that leads to most cases of MI . ( The diagram above shows four patches of atheroma as an example . However , atheroma may develop in any section of the coronary arteries . ) <p> Treatment with ' clot busting ' drugs or a procedure called angioplasty ( see below ) can break up the clot and restore blood flow through the artery . If treatment is given quickly enough this prevents damage to the heart muscle , or limits the extent of the damage . <p> Uncommon causes Various other uncommon conditions can block a coronary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coronary arteries ( rare ) ; a stab wound to the heart ; a blood clot forming elsewhere in the body ( for example , in a heart chamber ) and travelling to a coronary artery where it gets stuck ; cocaine abuse which can cause a coronary artery to go into spasm ; complications from heart surgery ; and some other rare heart problems . There are not dealt with further . <h> What are the symptoms of a Heart Attack ? <p> Severe chest pain is the usual main symptom . The pain may also travel up into your jaw , and down your left arm , or down both arms . You may also sweat , feel sick , and feel faint . The pain may be similar to angina , but it is usually more severe and lasts longer . ( Angina usually goes off after a few minutes . MI pain usually lasts more than 15 minutes - sometimes several hours . ) <p> A small MI occasionally happens without causing pain ( a ' silent MI ' ) . It may be truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may think it is just heartburn or ' wind ' . <p> Some people collapse and die suddenly if they have a large or severe MI . <h> What should I do if I suspect I am having a Heart Attack ? <p> Call for an ambulance immediately . Then , if you have some , take one aspirin tablet ( see below for the reason for this ) . You will normally be admitted straight to hospital . <h> How is Heart Attack diagnosed and assessed ? <p> Many people develop chest pains that are not due to an MI . For example , you can have quite bad chest pains with heartburn , gallbladder problems , or with pains from conditions of the muscles in the chest wall . However , tests can usually confirm MI . These are : <p> A heart tracing called an ECG ( electrocardiograph ) . There are typical changes to the normal pattern of the heart tracing if you have an MI . Patterns that occur with an MI include things called ' pathological Q waves ' and ' ST elevation ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you have had an MI . <p> Blood tests . A blood test that measures a chemical called troponin is the usual test that confirms an MI . This chemical is present in heart muscle cells and damage to heart muscle cells releases troponin into the bloodstream . The blood level of troponin increases within 3-12 hours from the onset of chest pain , peaks at 24-48 hours , and returns to a normal level over 5-14 days . <p> A rough idea as to the severity of the MI ( the amount of heart muscle that is damaged ) can be gauged by the degree of abnormality of the ECG and the level of troponin in the blood . Another chemical that may be measured in a blood test is called creatine kinase . This too is released from heart muscle cells during an MI . <p> Your heart tracing will be monitored for a few days to check on the heart rhythm . <p> Various blood tests will be done to check on your general wellbeing . Other tests may be done in some cases . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not certain ) or to diagnose complications such as heart failure if this is suspected . For example , an echocardiogram ( an ultrasound scan of the heart ) or a test called myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may be done . <p> Also , before discharge from hospital , you may be advised to have tests to assess the severity of atheroma in the coronary arteries . For example , an ECG taken whilst you exercise on a treadmill or bike ( ' exercise-ECG ' ) . Or , angiography of the coronary arteries . In this test a dye is injected into the coronary arteries . The dye can be seen by special X-ray equipment . This shows up the structure of the arteries ( like a road map ) and can show the location and severity of any atheroma . <h> What is the treatment for Heart Attack ? <p> The following is a ' typical ' situation and mentions the common treatments offered . Each case is different and treatments may vary depending on your situation . <p> Aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs As soon as possible after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aspirin . Aspirin reduces the ' stickiness ' of platelets . Platelets are tiny particles in the blood that trigger the blood to clot . It is the platelets that become stuck onto a patch of atheroma inside an artery that go on to form the clot ( thrombosis ) of an MI . Another antiplatelet drug called clopidogrel is also usually given as soon as possible . This works in a different way to aspirin and adds to the action of reducing platelet stickiness . <p> Pain relief A strong pain killer given by injection into a vein will ease the pain . <p> Treatment to restore blood flow in the blocked coronary artery The part of the heart muscle starved of blood does not die ( ' infarct ' ) immediately . If blood flow is restored within a few hours , much of the heart muscle that would have been damaged will survive . This is why an MI is a medical emergency , and treatment is given urgently . The quicker the blood flow is restored , the better the outlook . There are two treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blocked artery . <p> Emergency angioplasty is , ideally , the best treatment if it is available and can be done within a few hours of symptoms starting . In this procedure a tiny wire with a balloon at the end is put into a large artery in the groin or arm . It is then passed up to the heart and into the blocked section of a coronary artery using special x-ray guidance . The balloon is blown up inside the blocked part of the artery to open it wide again . A stent may be left in the widened section of the artery . A stent is like a wire mesh tube which gives support to the artery and helps to keep the artery widened . See leaflet called ' Angioplasty ' for details . <p> An injection of a ' clot busting ' drug is an alternative to emergency angioplasty . In reality , this is the more common treatment as it can be given easily and quickly in most situations . Some ambulance crews are trained to give this treatment . Note : the common ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streptokinase . If you are given this drug you should not be given it again if you have another MI in the future . This is because antibodies develop to it and it will not work so well a second time . An alternative ' clot buster ' drug should be given if you have another MI in the future . <p> Both the above treatments usually work well to restore blood flow and greatly improve the outlook . The most crucial factor is the quickness in which one or other treatment is given after symptoms have developed . <p> A betablocker drug <p> Beta-blockers ' block ' the action of certain hormones such as adrenaline . These hormones increase the rate and force of the heartbeat . Beta-blockers have some protective effect on the heart muscle and they also help to prevent abnormal heart rhythms from developing . <p> Injections of heparin or a similar drug These are usually given for a few days to help prevent further blood clots . <h> Can Heart Attack be prevented ? <p> Everybody has a risk of developing atheroma which can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the risk and include : <p> Preventable or treatable risk factors : <p> smoking <p> hypertension ( high blood pressure ) <p> high cholesterol level <p> lack of exercise <p> a poor diet <p> obesity <p> excess alcohol <p> Having diabetes . But if you have diabetes , the increased risk of heart disease is minimised by good control of the blood sugar level , and reducing blood pressure if it is high . <p> Risk factors that are fixed and you can not change : <p> a family history of heart disease or a stroke that occurred in a father or brother aged below 55 , or in a mother or sister aged below 65 <p> being male . <p> ethnic group ( for example , British Asians have an increased risk ) . <p> Risk factors are discussed more fully in another leaflet called ' Preventing Heart Disease ' . Briefly , if you can reduce any risk factors , it reduces your risk of having an MI ( or of having a further MI if you have already had one ) . Some risk factors are fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a fixed risk factor , you may want to make extra effort to reduce 
##1797551 <p> Living with panic disorder is very common and this can be extremely debilitating to a person ? s social , work and family relationship . <p> Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder and is characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear usually accompanied by a pounding heart , sweatiness , weakness , faintness , or dizziness . During these attacks , people with panic disorder may flush or feel chilled ; hands may tingle or feel numb ; and may experience nausea , chest pain , or smothering sensations . Panic attacks usually produce a sense of unreality , a fear of impending fate , or a fear of losing control . <p> This disorder is a real illness that can be successfully treated with clonazepam i.e. Xetril . Clonazepam ( Xetril ) is a well established and preferred drug of choice for panic and seizure disorders in Bangladesh . <p> Clonazepam ( Xetril ) is an anti-anxiety medication in the benzodiazepine family . Clonazepam ( Xetril ) acts by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) in the brain . GABA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . It is believed that excessive activity in the brain may lead to anxiety or other psychiatric disorders . Clonazepam ( Xetril ) also is frequently used to prevent seizures . <p> Because of strong anxiolytic properties and euphoric side-effects clonazepam is said to be among the class of ' highly potent ' benzodiazepines . Although benzodiazepines are valuable in the treatment of anxiety disorders , they have some potential for misuse and may cause dependence or addiction . The sedative effects of clonazepam ( Xetril ) are relatively weak , when compared to its strong anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects ,

##1800252 <p> Historically , specifically starting from the ending tenure of the British regime in the Indian sub-continent , the geographical part of present Bangladesh has become an ideal land of religious persecution to the minority community . Nonetheless , India and Pakistan could be also unwashed out of the list , but the topic under discussion will be limited to Bangladesh due to the relevancy . <p> The proposition of independence in early 40s of the sub-continent based on 2-nation theory was the most blander to make this land ever vulnerable of communal incidents between people of two religions namely the Hindus and the Muslims . Soon after the proposal , popularly known as the ? Lahore Declaration ' , made in public in 1940 at Lahore , the communal tensions got momentum in the whole undivided India resulting several riots that killed thousands and made several others rootless of the either side . The most devastating two in the then undivided Bengal were in 1941 in Calcutta and in 1946 in Calcutta , Dacca &; Noakhali . Easy to understand that these were pre-planned as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intolerant to each other , even they open began bloody fighting between them . These gave the then so-called great leaders most footings claiming the division of India based on religion . Ultimately the division took place in August 1947 with a fashion of unique &; peculiar instance in the world history till date that a newly named country of Pakistan with its two parts differing each 1200 miles from the other at two opposite sides of the country with its original name of India . It seems a great success to leaders of both communities . Irony is that India was declared as a union state of secularism . On the other hand , the founding father of Pakistan declared that there was no more division by religion in Pakistan , instead , every one there would be treated as the Pakistani , not as a Muslim or as a Hindu , with equal rights . Both became in the same streamline of non-communalism . This is really pathetic to opine that leaders themselves were exposed to be hypocrites differing their basic theory of 2-nation within only few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 . This has become the most dilemmas in the history of Indian sub-continent that what the leaders did , they did it seems with their full of conscious that religious commonality were not the essential engine for building of a country or a nation . However , despite many other opinions , it is better to comment that they might think that they were able to prevent the people of the sub-continent from quarreling with each other such that sooner the separation was over , quicker they try to became secular . Further , they might think that the people of both India &; Pakistan would enjoy the independence under which the communal feelings would be buried . But they were mistaken being the reality has become the cruelest and long lasting that seems to be never-ending and regular event of prosecution of the majority over the minority in each of the now three countries of India , Pakistan and Bangladesh . It is painful to pass any negative comments on the farsightedness of great leaders of the sub-continent that they totally miscalculated the human psychology , especially while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular in case of millions of non-educated people who had blind religious belief with communal feelings &; superstitions . Again it is heartache to tell that it was their ( leaders ' ) ridiculous act of cutting off tree from its bottom and then watering its branches to rejuvenate . Once the division was sharp , and decision of migration of Hindus from Pakistan to India and the vice-a-versa by virtue of 2-nation theory was must , and thus the communal riots in each part of India and Pakistan ( both east &; west ) were imminent , this was plain &; simple . Neither Mr. Gandhi nor Mr. Jinnah could control anything , and as a result there were random massacres in terms of lives , wealth , identity , family &; social relations , roots of livelihood for thousands of years in ones homeland . Irony happened such that both of the leaders ( Gandhi and Jinnah ) were escaped not to experience much such that they passed away within few months of division of India . However , their followers could not be escaped and being persecuted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain religion from a certain part of the world is impossible unless all of them are killed or suicide or converted to other religion in any way . This has become crudely true for the Hindus of the then East Pakistan and present Bangladesh . Simple assertion hereunder is the clarity of the statement . <p> There was around 43 million population in this part on the day of division of India in 1947 , of whom 37% were counted as to around 16 million Hindus . However , the minorities were rich in all respects here in possessing &; controlling the wealth &; economy , educational &; cultural advancement and socially &; politically . Having had political debacle , they were psychologically weaken and at the same time were threatened by the majority by virtue of the political decision to leave their ( the Hindus ) homes of thousands years and relations rooted to the deepest of their birthland . Millions migrated to India and other millions were left in the then East Pakistan , however , with full of uncertainty and under continuous threat of life , prestige , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection to the home of their own . On such natural home-sick , they had to pay the highest at numerous times as in 1948 , 1952 , 1962 and 1964 while the majority jumped on them cracking everything each time . Their only wrong is why they love their homeland and why not they leave that forever . Yes , the majority community was success at all the times to kill &; conquer the lives of innocent minorities , their wealth and women . Cruelty does not know any mercy that the majority gets the only characteristic that later possesses as the main output of 2-nation theory ! This the independence of Indian sub-continent brought to the fate of minorities of this part of the world . <p> This way the minorities ( Hindus ) started becoming homeless , wreathless &; rootless and their population came down to 15% in the late 60s while there was , of course , certain deviation in terms of change of mentality of the majority community towards the minority during the movement of independence of the Bangladesh during 1970-71 . However , still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pakistan admin &; their allies in this part to be blamed as the spy of India , though participation by the people at the movement was irrespective of religion identity as a whole to fight against the occupant . One of the main ideological pillars of the independent movement was secularism , that 's why this could able to remove the communal feelings of the people here most significantly . As a result , out of four , secularism was declared as a state ideology constitutionally . However , the non-communal or secularist character of the country could prevail only for a little more than three years . Soon after the killing of Mujib in mid 1975 , this was crossed out from the constitution replacing with Islamic vise communal character of the constitution alias the country . So , again the torture started by the majority Muslims over the Hindus . In spite of regular and continuous communal treatment in each corner of the society , the most two eminent incidents occurred during in 1990 under the guidance of the then government of General Ershad and in 1992 under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These times the victims were so poor in all respects that they could resist nothing , but to be tortured in all the ways by the majority , and started migrating to India very silently due to changing political scenario in the sub-continent , clearly to say that India was obliged to accept the migrants from the then Pakistan under the tri-party ( Britain-India-Pakistan ) agreement before the independence of Bangladesh , after which they ( India ) were no more obliged to accept any migrant from Bangladesh . Thus the situation became more critical for the Hindus as infiltrated migrants to India . They became at a nowhere position , they could resist and protect nothing from the attack of majority . Result is that till mid 1996 their population came down to 10% from 15% in total population of Bangladesh . There was slide improvement of the situation during mid 1996 to mid 2001 while a moderate political situation prevailed due to rule of the a comparatively secular government in the country . However , again the communality started thriving on the eve of general election of 2001 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . The then new government totally denied the torture , though the culprits were their followers and the administration helped them all the way for such inhuman torturing over the minority . They had nothing to give except their lives and women . They could not even file any case to any legal authority , if they would do it simply they would be killed and the government is here to protect the killers telling that there nothing happens to the minority , they are fine , the vested corner is diminishing the image of the country through information terrorism . What a fate ! What a liar ! Thus again what to do , the Hindus of present Bangladesh , being one of the most destitute communities of the world are at the edge of being vanished forever , simple to say it 's ethnic cleansing . Within these three years ( 2001-2004 ) , they have declined to less than 9% . This indicates that the Hindu population in the geographical boundary of Bangladesh has been declined more than 75% from 1947 to 2004 , whereas the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If calculated , for the same period , statistically it is found that only the Muslim population has increased here by 400% during the same period , and if it is take as a normal population growth rate , while Hindu Population could be here 64 million at present Bangladesh , provided all of them could stay here , however the number is approximately 14 million at present . Where have these 50 million Hindu people gone ? Yes most of them have migrated to India , are migrating to India every day , will be migrating to India , if the condition is not improved in Bangladesh . Also few of them are migrating to other countries of the world , while also few of them are converted to Muslims . <p> If anyone could visit India and travel over train can see hundreds of kilometers at either side of the rail lines , there are thousands of huts and slams , further , if anyone could visit deserts and forests in the middle India namely the Dandakaranya , and again if s/he could visit slams nearby Delhi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are they , where were their original homeland ? Simply could know they are none but the most wretched people of present Bangladesh . All of them are living inhuman lives . <p> Thus , it is evident that Hindus either living in Bangladesh or migrated from Bangladesh are at threat with their identity and survivorship . <p> What the crime the Hindus do in this part of the world ? What is their fault ? Are not they human ? Can not they expect humanitarian help and shelter from the world community ? Could anyone please tell ? <p> It is found that world community are coming forward to rescue several aborigines and other destitute communities of human beings in different parts of the world . The Serbia and Bosnia &; Herzegovina are the examples where all the humanitarian efforts were taken to save Muslims there . There is such other several examples . <p> Likewise , it is possible to save the Hindus , who in all the ways are civilized and talented with their culture and heritage from the ancient time , and who love and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forefathers also lived peacefully , though once in the past . <p> Yes , the world community could come up in response to this SOS ( S ave O ur S oles ) message and could obviously save the Hindus still living in Bangladesh where they want to live and to contribute for the development of their birthland to bring it at the level of developed world , for which they possess the ability no less than any other community . <p> The process could start through try establishing comparatively secular forces in the state power . It seems the present electoral process in Bangladesh , though under so called non-party neutral caretaker government , has failed to ensure such takeover of power . These are more bitterly and rudely true for the Hindus who become the victim most community during the period starting from eve of the polls , on the day of polls and the process of atrocities continues long after the election over . Again , their only fault is that why they want to choose candidates of their won choice , seemingly a secular force they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think could assure a safe home for them . But , fact is that the evil forces of Islamist communalism prevent the Hindu voters in Bangladesh to apply their voting rights . Only a narrow percent of Hindus can caste their votes , again the rewards are the highest . Yes , they have to pay for their work done with their lives , houses , land &; wealth , wives &; daughters and finally to leave their beloved motherland . The October 2001 election of Bangladesh could be termed the worst instance in this regard . <p> Thus , it is proven that the present system of non-party caretaker government is absolutely incapable to ensure the voting rights of the Hindus and more of all their survivorship in Bangladesh . So , there needs purification of the total process of non-party caretaker government and national polls under this system of government such that the Hindus here could apply their voting rights without any fear and threat and then also they could survive being saved from the cruelty of the islamist forces . To do so , both internal and external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bangladesh send the SOS message to the whole world community of UN bodies , humanitarian organizations , government of welfare , secular &; democratic states , democratic institutes , secula r forces , media and 
##1801050 <p> There are few artists in the dance community that can be considered pioneers , have friends around the world , or are Grammy winners , but for Frankie Knuckles , all those things are true and then some . Widely respected around the globe for his DJ and productions skills , he is also credited with creating this thing called " house " while living in Chicago and inspiring more than a few of the modern-era DJ/producers like Ron Trent . An industry godfather , he still continues to challenge himself and his art form and looks forward to a phenomenal millennium . During an impromptu interview at Twelve West , Frankie took us behind the scenes to see how he got his first break , what it really means to be a Grammy winner , and what 's next for him . <p> Welcome - we 're sitting with Frankie Knuckles , who 's quite the world renowned , famous DJ and music producer . <p> FK : Go ahead embarrass me ! <p> We have to Mr. Grammy winner ! Tonight we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been and what he 's been doing , and he 's going to give us a little history about who Frankie Knuckles is and where he started . <p> FK : I 've been everywhere and I 've done everything . <p> OK , goodnight ! <p> No , come on ! The truth is , you started playing music when ? <p> FK : 1971 . My first job was at Better Days . Tee Scott gave it to me , God rest his soul . <p> And what was that gig like for you ? <p> FK : Well , I was playing at Better Days on Mondays and Tuesdays -- they had just decided to open up on Mondays and Tuesdays and he Tee Scott did n't want to do it . The owners wanted him to do it , but he did n't want to , because he was already playing five nights a week , so he said he knew somebody that he thought it would be great for . <p> Now mind you , I had never played records before that - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Levan and stuff , but I had never played records at all . But he offered me the job - he said he thought I could do it . <p> And here you are ... <p> FK : 27 , 28 years later - excuse me , 29 years later . <p> So what got you open to playing music , just that chance gig ? <p> FK : Well , I worked there for like 6 months and then I got fired . They said that the evening was n't really picking up or doing any business when actually it was , so I went to the Continental Baths and started working with Larry there and that 's what did it . <p> And when did you get hooked up with DefMix , which is a very well-respected DJ collective &; management company ? <p> FK : It 's a production company , as well as management . When I moved back to New York in December of ' 87 from Chicago , I went to For The Record to rejoin the record pool , and David Morales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were just beginning to come online with it . <p> Coming from Chicago , I had a few production credits under my belt , because I had worked with Jamie Principle at that point and Marshall Jefferson and everybody out of Chicago , so I had that little bit of experience under my belt and it helped . There were so many different record companies and labels out of England that were looking for me to do remixes and things like that , so it helped to launch the company pretty much . <p> Backtracking a minute , let 's go back to Chicago . When we spoke with Ron Trent , I do believe he mentioned your name in the conversation as somebody who was out there making some big time noise and definitely putting it down in Chicago and it inspired him a little bit , so let 's talk about the Chicago days . <p> FK : OK - it 's a good life , I have no complaints about it - many people ask me where am I from and I always tell them I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; grew up in Chicago , moved back home and got my life here . And as much as New York is my home , I think at this particular stage in my life , I 'm probably a citizen of the world , because I 've been around the globe so many times . The world has gotten extremely small for me because I 've got great friends in just about every major city and small village just about anywhere in the world , and that all comes out of the experience that I got from Chicago . <p> So when you became a Grammy winner - the first time the category was created - did that change your career at all , and what did it mean for you ? <p> FK : It changed it enormously . I tell you , I was very scared when it was going to happen . I was sick for three days . I could n't eat , and there was a lot of pressure even though everyone around me kept saying " there 's no pressure , you know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for something like that , I 'm the kind of person ... I try not to ever think about it . I could n't eat for like 3 days and then went to L.A. , and then it all happened . And it 's great , it 's wonderful , and being on the outside looking in you think " Well , OK - now everything 's opening up for him now , and everything 's going to happen " , but the reality of it is that it works two-fold . It can either work out really well for you , or it could be the kiss of death , and for me it was a little bit of both . <p> It was great because for one , it was the first award that was given out in that category , which means that there can only be one , and for the history books that 's going to be there . But the kiss of death is that automatically people in the industry looked at me and my career and everything and said , " OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight through the roof . " So people backed off . They said , " we ca n't afford him now . " But nobody thought to ask if I would still work with them or they just automatically assumed that , and therefore they said " everything 's changed for him now , he 's going to be hard to deal with , he 's going to be hard for this , that and the other thing . " And I mean , it took me too long to get here , and I had too many enormous influences in my life like Tee Scott and Larry Levan - people that I grew up with that helped me get here , and I 've seen some devastating things happen . In my personal humble opinion , it would be a slap in the face to them if I was n't to do right by myself , because to do right by myself , I 'm doing right by them , and keeping with what they brought me to do . So the thing I thought was more important to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel and still continue to do the club work , even if the production work was n't coming in . To just stick with clubs , because the last thing in the world I want to ever do is to lose my credibility as far as the street - as far as the clubs are concerned . It 's where I come from , it 's where I 'm going to always be . At the end of the day , it 's where I always end up . <p> I do n't want to lose that , and whether all the big production work came in , and believe me , a lot of work did come in , and I turned down a lot of it - it was just much to commercial and it 's not where I wanted to go . There 's lot of people that have their opinions about what my music has done ... <p> ... The Frankie Knuckles sound ? <p> FK : Anyone who knows anything about art or an artist knows that growth is extremely important . As you grow older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The core of it is still there - the spirit of that is always there , that never changes . But stylistically , your outlook on things may change and therefore the music itself might take a certain change . The song is always at the heart of it - that meaning of things that are personal to everybody is always there , and I 'm very selective that way about the stuff I choose to do . <p> So when did that wall come down for you ? How did you get around it when people initially thought , " Oh my God , he 's out of our league now " ? <p> FK : Well , it has n't completely come down - it has n't . Because right before it happened , I worked with Byron Stingley - I did " Back to Paradise " on his last album , which is a tribute to Larry and the Garage . Right at the same time , people were beginning to think , you know - " he 's up for this Grammy , and he 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no way we can work with him now " - and nothing could be further from the truth . <p> The thing that I try to make everybody understand is that in order to do what I do - and for me to do it at the level at which I CAN do it , and do it well - it costs money to do that . If you have to rely on me to pay for it , then it 'll take longer to get it done . You know , it 's a different thing if you 've got a label behind you and that kind of support , where that funding can come from . But if it has to come out of my pocket , then it 's definitely going to take a lot longer to get it done , but it does n't mean I do n't want to work with them . I have an enormous crew that works with me , and I 've got some of the best musicians , tech people and engineers in New York City - if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason why those records sound as good as they do . My goal with most of the music that I work on is to make sure that whatever project I work on now sounds as fresh 50 years from now as it does today . <p> So let 's talk a little bit about what is involved in some of the productions and remixing that you do . Is it that you get a track and you rework it , or do you actually bring in live musicians often and just rework the whole song ? <p> FK : We start all over again from scratch is what we do . I 'm usually presented with a project , I go into the office , I listen to it , and if it 's something I think I can work with or I hear something special about it , then I accept it . Immediately , the first thing I do is to strip away all of the original arrangement and accompaniment - all that stuff - and just keep the vocals and start all over again from scratch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me are all classically trained , and they 're some of the best guys in the business , and they 've worked with me for the past 12 years so they know me pretty well . They 've helped me to develop the sound that I have . So it 's easy , because just guiding them or just giving them the direction I want to go with it just makes it fall into place just that quick , that easy . <p> That 's what professionalism is about . <p> FK : The thing I try to never do is I never try to do the same thing for everybody . I never try to give everybody the same sound or the same thing . I listen to the spirit of whatever song it is that they give me and then I try to draw the best of that out of it . I try to construct the best platform for that particular song and that particular artist . Sometimes they 're very pleased with it , sometimes they 're not - sometimes everybody wants an " Unbreak My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commercial side of things . Then everybody that 's on this street/club level wants things that are done more like " Baby Wants to Ride " - the very kind of deep , ethereal kinda stuff that I used to do in the early days , with Jamie and with Fingers , Inc . But the thing I never try to do is try to carbon copy anybody 's one thing to the other - because I think one , the artists are all original and so are the songs , and the productions and it should stay that way . I like to think that the reason that they bring it to me is because they trust me to be able to do it , and do it well . <p> So , lets talk a little about this New York club scene , from your perspective making the majority of your living on the road . <p> FK : Well I think for one , my last residency happened to be at this particular spot where we 're at interviewing , here at Sound Factory Bar currently Cheetah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six year tenure that I was here , I was getting booked and getting offers to play everywhere in the world and I had to turn most of it down because I would n't leave here . I could n't be gone from here that often to do it . So once the bar closed , it opened up the market place for me to do it . And I figured I should take advantage of it and go do it , until the right thing came along . There were a few different things I tried out , and they did n't pan out , because my concept of what I want to do as far as doing a residency in a club here , and what these club owners and managers want to do were two completely different things . <p> I 'd rather not subject my audience to that if I do n't have to , and I like to think at this point I have that kind of control . I ca n't control anybody else 's club . If you own this club , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . But if you want me to come into it and bring my thing into it , then you 've got to at least respect what I 'm bringing . That 's the only thing I ask - do n't try to one , put a ticket on the door that 's astronomically ridiculous as far as price , and then jack up the price of drinks as well , because come on , $5 for a bottle of water this big ? Come on , that 's not what I 'm looking for . That 's not what I 'm in to and of course people bitch about it and they complain about it , and they do n't look at the owners of the club , they do n't look at management , they look to me . I 'm the center most point of everything that 's going on , so of course , they look at me . Even if they do take it to the management , management always says , " Do you know how much money we have to pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it , it 's always your fault . So after leaving here , and trying different things here that did n't pan out , I just figured it 's probably better to just concentrate on staying on the road and doing that . I 've done the occasional guest spots here and there , and they 've been quite successful . I 'm looking to do something a little bit more steady , but when the right room falls into place , I 'll do it . It is a good thing that I 've had the opportunity to go out on the road , because it 's been able to keep me in touch and keep my ear to the street and to the ground . <p> So why are you home with us now ? <p> FK : Normally , this time of year I 'm usually in Asia and the South Pacific . Normally , I head out the beginning of January . I go through Europe into Italy and Germany , and then fly over into Japan , then China , Singapore and go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Switzerland , which was my first stop . I was there for three days , on the fourth day I went skiing , fell , and fractured my ankle . I do n't care how good you think your balance is - do n't do it ! I fell , fractured my foot and my ankle and ended up having to have surgery on it , and I 've been convalescing for the past three months here at my house . But I 'm good now though ! <p> What 's coming up ? <p> FK : Well , I was going to go to Miami for the Winter Music Conference , but I 'm not going , because my first single 's not ready . It 's going to be a little while before its ' ready . I 'll hopefully have that out by the end of June , just in time to kickoff summer . I 'll have the second single ready by the end of summer , by the end of August . Right now , Byron Stingley is doing a duet on the album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm concentrating more on men this particular trip - I 've worked with so many great women -and the girls get everything - but I think it 's time the boys got their props . So I 'm trying to concentrate on the guys - I 've been talking with Will Downing - he 's a very old friend of mine . So it looks like he 's going to happen probably , and various other people - a couple of new guys .

To see the gallery in all its glory , you 'll need to enable Javascript . <p> Local resident Jafar Alam established the surf club and school in Cox 's Bazar . ( Stuart Butler ) <p> Bangladesh is a crash of crowds and the deafening roar of millions of individual pursuits churning together into a frenzy of collective activity . It is a human melting pot bubbling over in energy , and travelling in Bangladesh often means sights and experiences come at you so thick and fast that you sometimes have to sit down and take a deep breath . Long ignored by most of the world , this is a land of mile-wide rivers , bell-tingling cycle rickshaws and untamed swamps filled with man-eating tigers . It is also home to something even more unexpected : surfing . <p> Sitting in the southeast corner of this much maligned but ever-surprising nation , the bustling beach town of Cox 's Bazar may not have the surf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a near endless stretch of sand and all the charm of a happy go-lucky seaside resort that draws in huge flocks of holidaying Bangladeshis . It also has waves , and today it is the biggest -- and perhaps only -- surf town in the Indian sub-continent . How Cox 's Bazar went from being a mere seaside holiday destination to burgeoning surf town in the space of a few years is all thanks to one man : Jafar Alam . <p> Back in the 1990s , when Alam was just a boy , he was walking along the sands of Cox 's Bazar and became transfixed by the sight a man who appeared to be walking on water . When the man , a travelling Australian surfer , came to shore , Alam asked to buy his board . The Australian agreed , but did not stay around long enough to teach Alam how to surf . So for the next seven years , Alam rode his surfboard lying down . <p> But then Alam saw a surfer on television who was standing on a board just like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , becoming quite proficient despite the lack of a leash or any wax . <p> Then came the fateful day when Bangladeshi-style beach life would change forever . Alam met a group of American surfers riding his previously unknown waves , and they quickly took him under their wing . Showing him not only how to wax a board and stand on it , they also left him a stack of surfboards on the promise that he would teach other Bangladeshis how to surf . Fast-forward several years , and Cox 's Bazar now has about 70 local surfers and its own surf club and school , both of which were established by Alam with help from his American friends . Although the club and school are primarily aimed at teaching Bangladeshis how to surf , they will happily loan gear and give lessons to any traveller passing through . <p> As small as the local scene is , it is highly unusual . Unlike almost any other of the world 's surf regions , where male surfers vastly outnumber the girls , almost half the surfers in Bangladesh are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic society and women are expected to conform to a set of ideals that will not bring ' shame ' on their family . This includes not mixing with unrelated members of the opposite sex and not revealing too much skin or hair . Needless to say , the teenage girls taking to the waves of Bangladesh are often going against the norms of their society and the wishes of their family . In some cases they even have to surf in secret . <p> Although the standard of surfing in Bangladesh is still low , that does not make the highlight of the Bangladeshi surf calendar any less exciting . The Aloha Surf Classic competition , held each October in Cox 's Bazar , is open only to Bangladeshi surfers . But more than a mere surf contest , the beach festival also features skimboarding , skateboarding and bodyboarding alongside the men 's and women 's surf events . <p> So , while Bangladesh will never overtake Indonesia as a surf fantasy trip , there are enough waves here between April and November , as well as an utterly unique @ @ @ @ @ @
