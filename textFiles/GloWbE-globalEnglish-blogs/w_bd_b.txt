##3518150 <p> Shakib Al Hasan , who was axed as Bangladesh captain on Monday , has said that though he was surprised by the decision , it was n't entirely unexpected . Both Shakib and vice-captain Tamim Iqbal were stripped of their leadership posts by the Bangladesh board after the team 's defeat in both the Test and the one-day series in Zimbabwe last month . <p> " I am surprised by the sudden decision but I am not shocked . I can take things easy which is my strength , " Shakib told the Dhaka-based newspaper Daily Star . " The board definitely took this decision for betterment of the game , so I must accept it . " <p> Shakib , 25 , has been Bangladesh 's captain for two years , except for brief spells when the frequently injured fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza took charge . Shakib was named captain for 2011 after leading the side to an impressive 4-0 one-day series win over New Zealand at home and following it up with a victory over Zimbabwe late last year . <p> It has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , soon after he was named full-time captain , he complained that he was n't prepared for the job and that he was not getting a free hand in selecting the team . He also demanded a long run as captain and did n't want to take over on a " series-by-series " basis as the board wanted him to . He also had a strained relationship with the new selection panel headed by former captain Akram Khan , with Shakib saying he was n't consulted when the side to tour Zimbabwe was picked , while Akram insisted Shakib was . <p> The controversies and the loss to Zimbabwe , a team which was making its return to the Test arena after five years , seem to have led to Shakib 's sacking . " As a captain I must take the responsibility for the poor showing in Zimbabwe , " he said . " But still I believe that we had lack of preparation and that was one of the main reasons behind the debacle . " <p> Shakib said the board needs to investigate the reasons behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make someone scapegoat for any failure because we do n't want to dig deep to find out the real problem and this is no exception , " he said . " This is our system . We always try to solve problems casually . " <p> For the betterment of cricket in Bangladesh , Shakib is the guy that needs to be at the helm . This decision to remove him from captaincy is still okay if they wanted a message sent to him . But he must be brought back in some time , in say a year . Like some one else mentioned here , people get emotional with wins and losses.The bigger picture is that Bangladesh is still growing as a cricket nation and shakib is the man that will lead the growth . So this should be temporary . <p> Posted by shafiqo on ( September 07 2011 , 09:06 AM GMT ) <p> Vice captaincy can be of makeshift appointment basis . One series Kayes may be tried , another series may be Ryad or Razzak provided that they are selected for the match . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure his place in the squad , best 11 , perform consistently , earn popularity/respect among the current players/performers . Then he may be a good choice for captaincy . It is always difficult for the returnees . Persistence is the key quality required in all these players . <p> Posted by shafiqo on ( September 07 2011 , 08:46 AM GMT ) <p> A difficult decision was made , hopefully to save the team from further future debacles . This is not probably a permanent resolve from this type of school boyish grouping games . BD coaching staff &; board elders will have to ensurer skills on how to motivate young cricketers &; be respected guardians . This seems like the " Shoeb Malik incedent " in Pakistan team . Plz do n't let shakib fade out like Shoeb . He may have made some childish mistakes which he may not realize fully due to his age but he needs to be kept inspired as the best performer of the team . He 'll probably be a good captain in couple of years time . Tamim needs to be talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become like Shehwag . Shehwag 's arrogance is not a positve quality from a sports person . Tamim will also do better in future . Mushfiqur seems the best choice for now who can keep the BKSP buddies &; the under-19 team mates in harmony with the rest of the bunch with his matured JU educated exposure . <p> Posted by Quddus-Mamu on ( September 07 2011 , 03:20 AM GMT ) <p> Let 's make Nafees as a Captain and Mushfiq as his deputy .

Go Tiger Go . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( September 07 2011 , 01:24 AM GMT ) <p> A bunch of jokers ... in BCB ..... As captain and vice captain Shakib and Tamim both has shown immaturity and they have shown lacks in leadership traits ... So do the BCB . They should have nurtured and allowed them to grow . how many captains in last ten years ? ca n't remember ! ! It 's not a musical chair ! ! allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and needs to learn ... it does not come naturally .... Immature decision and behavior by the board and selectors actually hurting BD cricket ....

Now he is in NZ as player and coach ( Napier ? ) .... hope this two will not follow the same path .... A grim future for BD cricket ? ? ? board should concentrate more on developing the first class infrastructure rather than a search for a spineless captain ! ! ! <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( September 06 2011 , 16:06 PM GMT ) <p> Mashrafee and Shahriar mifht be the choice forODI and Test . Very good decision by BCB . WE want these two player in their best form now . After 5 years about captaincy .................... <p> Posted by sameer111111 on ( September 06 2011 , 15:33 PM GMT ) <p> Am an Indian and like the way Sakib carries himself on the field . He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hope this inspires him to do well as a player . The same can not be said about Tamim . A average player , albeit an entertaining one , he thinks too much of himself .

##3518151 <p> Stuart Law , the outgoing Bangladesh coach , has said the future of Bangladesh cricket is bright with young players such as Nasir Hossain in the national team and exciting talent waiting in the wings . However , he pointed out that the youngsters would need to be handled properly . <p> Law , who resigned recently after being in-charge of the Bangladesh team for nine months , was particularly pleased with Anamul Haque , the top-order batsman who was part of the Asia Cup squad but did n't make his international debut . " Young Anamul Haque Bijoy is a quality player , " he said , " Especially during the BPL , he looked like he was born to perform . " <p> The 19-year-old Khulna batsman has scored heavily in domestic cricket this season , topping the first-class batting charts with 816 runs , apart from five centuries in all formats . Anamul 's form won him a place in the Asia Cup squad in March but he could n't find a place in the eleven . During one of those days , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing he said to me which I will never forget . We were sitting in the dugout during one of the Asia Cup matches and I asked him , ' Where would you like to bat ? ' He said , ' I want to be No. 3 , I want to be the best player in the world . ' And I said , if that comes across , good on you . " <p> Law also praised two other youngsters . " I have been trying to see Mominul Haque get into the team . He 's scored runs in the A team tours . We 've been discussing him at lengths in selection meetings . He looked like a quality young player . Abul Hasan Raju , I love him . Bowls quick , 140-plus , has the slower ball and will get better as he plays more . " <p> The growth of the youngsters was the underlying theme of Law 's reign as the head coach as he wanted a few more performers within the team apart from Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law 's first series in charge and since then he has scored a Test fifty , made an ODI hundred and seen Bangladesh through to a win against Sri Lanka . <p> " You look for the standout players and those two Shakib and Tamim have been carrying Bangladesh for a while . I told the rest of the team that it is not about two players . It 's about other people sticking their hand up and doing well . Guys like Nasir have come through , he 's basically up there with Shakib and Tamim . " <p> But Law made it clear that he was n't looking to alienate the big performers who had to do well day in day out . He especially had gracious words for the world 's No. 1 allrounder though he reminded Shakib to take care of his fitness . <p> " He 's professional on the field but off the field he 's different . I do n't mean this in a bad way , but he could be fitter . He 's admitted that he can work a bit harder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cricket field , he creates something out of nothing . He 's a beautiful player to watch when he 's going great with the bat . I was probably in that boat as well , so I can understand . I did n't like training , I liked playing . " <p> The reason for Law leaving in May rather than the end of June was Bangladesh 's lack of international cricket . In fact , Bangladesh wo n't be seeing Test match action till November , which will be eleven months since their last Test in December 2011 . <p> Law believes this would hurt the team and requested the Bangladesh Cricket Board to plan well ahead of time . " What they need to do is to play more . Let 's target West Indies , New Zealand and teams like Ireland and Scotland . Let 's oblige to the Associate countries and play four-dayers with them , whenever we get time between international commitments . " <p> Law , who leaves the country on Sunday , said that for providing ample opportunities to cricketers , Bangladesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket here is a structure of which there 's no blueprint anywhere else in the world . It stops , it starts . It would be nice to see these games taking place in these days , rather than two teams have a fall-out and the whole tournament is suspended . That 's not good for cricket in this country . <p> " I know it 's a different culture but as an outsider looking in , it ca n't be good for cricket . We are all trying to say that domestic cricket is where we want our cricketers to learn , they 're learning by sitting back . That 's not helping them at all . " <p> @ Dashgar - IMO Ireland are better prepared now comapred to Bangladesh in 1999 or even 2001/2002 . Over time Ireland v Bangladesh , the Banga boys should win 2/3rds of the matches , that being said Ireland is a lot better than you have shown . Ireland very rarely capitulates like bangladesh does remember the Banga score cards in the W/Cup against the WIndies &; I think NZ . Anyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , under the assumption that Bangladesh 's economy can grow like ( or similar to ) the way India 's economy has grown , Bangladesh 's population will eventually provide a decent economy to grow the game . I just wish people did n't have to bag Banga to support Ireland or Afghan , ca n't people wish them ALLthe best ? @Ahmed Hossain - I do n't think you need to bag Ireland &; Afghan to support Banga . Afghan has done amazingly well from not even playing cricket at all 10yrs ago to where they are today . They have done well with a lot less matches than Bangladesh ! <p> Posted by Praxis on ( May 07 2012 , 07:56 AM GMT ) <p> So people here who are disagreeing with what Law has said , I would like to ask them something . What is the solution then , strip BD of their test status ? They hardly play any test recently ! There is a reason ICC gives more importance to BD cricket than Ireland or Afghanistan , BD has a population of almost 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people have n't noticed cricket is n't much popular as a game around the world , &; in most of the playing nations this popularity is declining . <p> Posted by Quddus-Mamu on ( May 07 2012 , 04:21 AM GMT ) <p> @Rahane-fan : how many times was India beaten by Ireland ? I do n't have that statistics coz I do n't follow Ireland Vs India match . May be you have that information . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( May 06 2012 , 23:02 PM GMT ) <p> @iNsiDers .... Ireland and Afghanistan talented sides than Bangladesh ? haha ... Well actually no because both Ireland and Afghanistan have not achieved what Bangladesh have achieved so far I mean have both Ireland and Afghanistan beaten ' every ' other top full member in Cricket ? Nope I do n't think so haha ... but Bangladesh have beaten top teams ' many ' times plus ' popular ' players like Tamim , Shakib , Nasir , Rahim , Mortaza are far more talented than any player of Ireland or Afghanistan in fact I do n't see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said end of story : ) ) ) ) ) ) " <p> Posted by iNsiDers on ( May 06 2012 , 12:20 PM GMT ) <p> Bright future ? Oh yes , they never had their own future ... they were always supported by other nations . Pakistan helped them giving test status . Ireland and Afghanistan are at their own and much much talented sides than Bangladesh . <p> Posted by Dashgar on ( May 06 2012 , 10:41 AM GMT ) <p> Ireland are more deserving ? Why ? Cos they beat England in the world cup just like Bangladesh did , and then lost to Bangladesh ? Or because they came 4th in the Intercontinental cup behind Afghanistan , Scotland and Zimbabwe XI . I 'm sick of hearing how great Ireland is , they have n't done anything to suggest they are better than Bangladesh in any way . That said I would still consider them and Afghanistan for Test status in the near future , but not at the expense of anyone . <p> Posted by Sarfin on ( May 06 2012 , 09:43 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters nothing . And thanks to well wishers . Surely we 'll be an exciting side within two years . BCB should make the FC tournament more competitive and should arrange more international tours . Six moths gap between ODI series or one year gap between Tests is not helping us . If you ca n't convince India , SA , England , Australia then concentrate on NZ , WI , ZIM . Arrange tri nation series with associates and low ranked teams . Keep the national team playing <p> Posted by Meety on ( May 06 2012 , 08:46 AM GMT ) <p> @Ahmed Hussain - Bangladesh 's biggest problem is their preparation , they have the talent , unfortunately their players choose the Dhaka League over the Domestic FC comp . That needs to change straight away . <p> Posted by abcdef12345 on ( May 06 2012 , 08:23 AM GMT ) <p> @lankanmeoww.You buy Mobile phone with money.But can you make another Sanath Jayasuriya or Chamnda Vaas with 50-60 US dollar ?

##3518152 <p> Mick Newell , the Nottinghamshire director of cricket , has confirmed that he has held discussions regarding taking up the Bangladesh coaching role . While Richard Pybus remains the first choice of the Bangladesh Cricket Board ( BCB ) to replace Stuart Law , ESPNcricinfo understands that talks between the parties have hit a stumbling block over financial issues and the BCB has been in touch with two other candidates - including Pybus - or their agents . <p> Newell has gone on record for the first time to confirm the story published by ESPNcricinfo on May 4 linking him with the job . " It would be a huge decision , " he told ESPNcricinfo . " I would like to coach at the international level and , having not been an international player , these opportunities do not arise that often . I have had a couple of conversations with an agent about the position , but I would need a great deal more information before making such a massive decision and I have had no direct contact with the BCB . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at Nottinghamshire . It would be very difficult to leave here . " <p> Newell was also considered for the Bangladesh coaching role before Law was appointed in July 2011 . Since then he has coached England Lions in the West Indies , while it is understood that Tamim Iqbal , an overseas player at Nottinghamshire in 2011 , has provided positive reports about Newell 's ability to the BCB . <p> BCB media committee chairman Jalal Yunus has said that it is " difficult " to name a coach , particularly at the moment . " It is still uncertain ; till today , it will be difficult to name someone . The progress at this stage means that it wo n't be completed in a week , probably you can say at the end of the month . " <p> @ Mujahid Islam , FYI most ex Bangladesh cricketers like Khaled Mahmud have very little coaching experience . Bringing them into the side would only drag the team backwards .

At independence , the literacy rate was about 15 percent , but many of those considered literate had received only limited education at traditional Koranic schools and could not read secular works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program of building schools and universities leading Tunisia to having today a well-educated Middle Class . Bourguiba also stressed education and employment for women saying " Female workers must be trained and given jobs . Work contributes to female emancipation . By her labor , a woman or young girl assumes her existence and becomes conscious of her dignity . " <p> Jobs in government and the private sector opened to the newly educated by the departure of the majority of the French , Jewish and Italian populations between 1956 and 1966 . There was also a significant possibility of migration to Europe , especially to France , until the mid-1970s after which it became more difficult to get work permits . <p> In November 1987 , Bourguiba named Ben Ali Prime Minister . Ben Ali , a General , came from the military and had no well-developed ideology or policy . Thus he continued the economic and social policies of Bourguiba . Shortly after having been named , in what has been called a " medical coup " , Ben Ali said that Bourguiba 's mental and physical health had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president promising to revitalize the country which had fallen into stagnation as Bourguiba had become increasingly senile but refused to delegate authority . <p> Ben Ali continued Bourguiba 's major policies . An emphasis was placed on developing tourism , but this opened relatively few jobs for the educated and led to speculation on land . The agricultural sector , especially in the central and south of the country , had more people employed than needed for the level of production . From an economic point of view , there was a migration to the cities and larger towns of the coastal area in a frustrating search for suitable occupations . The unemployment rate was high , and among the educated youth , unemployment , lack of social mobility and the flashy life-style of those with links to political power led to demands for change . <p> The demonstrations of the past month seemed to have begun spontaneously , led by the young but with no previously known leaders . The demonstrations had no links to opposition political parties , most of whose leaders were in exile , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completely absent from the demonstrations and from the demands of the demonstrators . <p> For most French commentators , the model was " May 1968 " which led to the end of the government of Charles De Gaulle . Tunisia is a revolution of the people who wanted fundamental changes from the small political group governing , an end to wide-spread and highly-visible corruption , and the creation of jobs . Ben Ali , like De Gaulle , symbolized the system and so there was strong agreement on what everyone could agree upon : " Ben Ali must go " . Unlike General De Gaulle , General Ben Ali had done nothing very special before becoming President . Although he tried to develop a " personality cult " with large pictures of himself in the streets and ever-present praise on the TV , Ben Ali had no real personality around which to develop a cult . <p> Now the issue is what structures the people 's revolution will give itself . If all goes as the constitutional order indicates , elections should be held within 60 days , the interim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament . Since political parties had been prevented from operating -- even the party of the President had only a name but no real structures -- we will have to see how political factions are created prior to the elections . There are a good number of different ideological currents in the opposition to Ben Ali , and there is no opposition leader who stands out as a " natural " next President . <p> The first efforts of an interim " national unity " government have been hotly contested with continued demonstrations . It was felt that too many people who had served Ben Ali were still in the government . However , there are few opposition figures who have administrative experience . The internal Tunisian situation merits to be watched closely . <p> The disintegration of Ben Ali 's government and power base has been closely watched in the Arab world . Although Ben Ali was not particularly liked by his neighbors , political leaders in Egypt , Libya , Algeria , Morocco , Syria and Jordan can see the parallels without too much difficulty -- a heavy-handed security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , yet frustrated population . Recent demonstrations in Algeria and Jordan set off by higher food prices have been met by some government action to limit taxes of food . However , higher food prices are only one sign of broader socio-economic weaknesses that have led to high unemployment , high rents and yet a housing shortage . <p> It is in Egypt that , following the Tunisian example , people have taken to the streets demanding that Hosni Moubarak must go . The cries of the Tunisian revolutionary movement " Liberty-Work-Dignity " have been taken up by other nations . The repressive forces of the state are stronger in Egypt than in Tunisia where there was a division of policy between the **27;8846;TOOLONG Army and the more pro-Ben Ali police and palace guard . <p> Throughout the Arab world , governments have been unable or unwilling to open serious discussions on socio-economic policies and alternatives . Islamic-based groups have played some role in focusing protests but have not done much in presenting realistic alternative policies . The violence of some of the Islamic groups in some countries has served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions without too many protests from Western governments . <p> What is outstanding in the revolution in Tunisia is that Islamic groups played no part in the demonstrations and that none of the demands were expressed in Islamic terms . The people 's revolution in Tunisia was based on the will of the people for change with a minimum of ideological coloring . It is likely that the people 's revolution in other Arab countries will also marginalize Islamic currents in favour of this-worldly reforms . Events will be closely watched both by those who hope and those who fear . People 's revolutions may be on the march in the Arab world . <p> The impact of the Tunisian revolution will be felt in Europe as well . President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said in a 24 January press conference that " We in France probably underestimated the aspirations of the Tunisian people for freedom . " However the underestimation came from having turned a blind eye to the situation in Tunisia , not from a lack of information . There has been for some time a host of Tunisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would listen . Also France has a good number of competent North African specialists who follow events closely . <p> Likewise , the Tunisian Revolution should have some impact on the way that European Union foreign policy is made . As Judy Dempsey pointed out in an analysis in the International Herald Tribune " Despite Mr Ben Ali 's repressive rule , the European Union has been negotiating ways to grant this North African country ' an advanced status ' that would involve more aid and trade , economic and political contacts between Tunisia and Europe . Stefan Fule , the E.U. Commissioner for Enlargement and the European Neighborhood Policy , was unequivocal in his praise for Tunisia last May when Brussels agreed to set up a group to prepare such a status . ' Tunisia is an important and reliable partner for the E.U. with which it has forged strong relations based on shared values and mutual respect and understanding . It is in many respects an example for the region . " <p> Of course , Judy Dempsey continued " It was never going to be easy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the former colonial powers , France , Spain and Italy rarely challenged the corruption , torture and wide human rights abuses in the region , while the United States pursued its own strategic interests . When the Union set up the Barcelona Process in 1995 , which was aimed at fostering regional cooperation among the 14 North African and Middle Eastern countries and with Brussels , civil society activists say it offered aid and trade but little in the way of incentives for political reforms . " <p> Now that the people 's revolution is underway in the streets , the E.U. diplomatic corps may look again at how its analysis of human rights and the rule of law is made . <p> Rene Wadlow is Representative to the 
##3522151 <h> Where is the Honor ? <p> Whenever I discuss or lecture on " women in Islam " or more specifically " honor killings " the apologists always say " honor killings is a culture thing , it 's not Islamic . " My personal favorite is when I hear " that does n't happen in America . " <p> Right now , we have two " honor killing " trials that are taking place in the U.S. for honor killings that " do n't happen here " . <p> In Buffalo , NY we have the case of Muzzammil " Mo " Hassan who allegedly murdered his wife Aasiya Hassan . According to WBEN of Buffalo , NY , <p> Aasiya Hassan was stabbed more than 40 times as the couple 's 4- and 6-year-old children and the suspect 's teenage son from a previous marriage waited in a minivan outside for her to complete the errand on their way to dinner , Bonanno said . <p> " Then ( Hassan ) took those knives and he sawed Aasiya 's head off , " using so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor said . <p> The other case is one that I wrote about previously , when I wrote the story of Noor Almaleki last year I contacted a few of her friends and co-workers to find out about Noor the person . I wanted to paint a real picture and get an understanding of the individual that lost her life in what was known in Arizona and throughout the U.S. as an " Honor killing " . <p> Opening statements began in the Maricopa County Court room in Arizona last Monday and now that the case has finally gone to trial with her father as the defendant against murder , it is time for a follow up . Let 's first revisit the facts of the case according to last year 's article . <p> October 20th , 2009 Noor 's own Father , Faleh Hassan Almaleki ran her down with his Jeep Cherokee . Noor fought for her life until Monday November 2 , 2009 , when she succumbed and died from her injuries . Noor was only 20 years old . Her father did n't just run over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking in a parking lot with her fianc 's mother , Amal Edan Khalaf . The 43-year-old woman was seriously injured . <p> Some friends of Noor said that her father had taken her to Iraq and told her they were visiting relatives . Once there , he married her off and left her to fend for herself . Noor then had to find enough money to make her way back to America and , once here , she moved in with the fianc she loved . A friend , Nicole Furugia , said she had gone with Noor to look into getting a restraining order against her father , " She was very determined on getting it , she was scared . " <p> Family members told police that the father was upset that his daughter failed to live by traditional Muslim values , and prosecutors have also said Almaleki has admitted killing his daughter because she disgraced the family by not following traditional Iraqi or Muslim values . <p> Faleh Hassan Almaleki was charged with first-degree murder , aggravated assault and two counts of leaving the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the attack , driving to Mexico and later taking a plane to London . He was detained by British authorities and extradited back to the United States . <p> Last year at the preliminary hearing speaking before a Maricopa County judge , county prosecutor Stephanie Low said Almaleki has admitted purposefully running down his daughter . Low indicated that Mr. Almaleki does not deny that his actions were intended to harm and even kill Noor : <p> " By his own admission , this was an intentional act and the reason was that his daughter had brought shame on him and his family , " Low said . " This was an attempt at an honor killing . " <p> Even though Arizona has the death penalty , the decision not to seek the death penalty was taken after Almaleki 's attorney , Billy Little , a public defender , asked the judge to take special precautions to ensure that the County and Attorney 's Office would n't wrongly seek the death penalty because ... Almaleki is a Muslim . <p> Further , Little requested that the office make public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . " An open process provides some level of assurance that there is no appearance that a Christian is seeking to execute a Muslim for racial , political , religious or cultural beliefs , " Little wrote , referring to County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' Christian faith . <p> Laura Reckart , a county prosecutor , responded that Little 's concern about the " supposed bias " of the office 's death penalty review process was " without legitimate factual or legal basis . " She wrote that the state can seek the death penalty for any person convicted of first-degree murder if it can prove the existence of at least one aggravating factor , not because of religion . <p> However , the debate stopped there . On February 16th , Reckart filed a motion indicating prosecutors would not seek the death penalty . Mike Scerbo , a spokesman for the County Attorney 's Office , issued the following statement on February 19th : <p> " The defendant is charged with first degree murder and , if convicted , will spend the rest of his life in prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision on whether to seek the death penalty is made on a case by case basis . Cultural considerations played no part in the decision not to seek the death penalty . " <p> So now a year and a half later Faleh Hassan Almaleki is on trial for the murder of his own daughter . <p> The defense now is claiming that the whole thing was an accident , according to the AZ Central website , <p> Oct. 20 , 2009 , marked the first time Almaleki had seen his daughter in months . He planned to leave the DES office to avoid a confrontation and then spotted Khalaf again as he drove out of the parking lot . <p> His daughter straggled behind , playing on her cellphone . <p> That 's when he decided to spit on Khalaf , Mullins said . <p> Khalaf stepped in front of Almaleki 's Jeep and he swerved , trying to avoid her , Mullins continued . He could n't . He hit Khalaf , a tree and a curb . <p> He looked back and realized he 'd also hit Noor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almaleki panicked . He called family members , who told him to drive away . " Frantic and desperate , Faleh does what they said , " Mullins said . <p> I have a special attachment to this case and wanted once again to give the reader some insight to the real person , not have Noor appear as just a statistic or a photo of some young woman who was killed . <p> I tracked down a friend of Noor from her High School days and we spoke by telephone . For her security , and since the trial is currently ongoing , I will not divulge this friend 's name . I asked , <p> " Tell me about Noor , when did you meet " ? <p> Friend : " Noora , that 's what we called her , the " a " being the letter of her last name- it was easier for us to remember . We met in Dysart High School in El Mirage , Arizona in our sophomore year . " <p> GA : " Did you know she was from Iraq , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Friend : " I knew she was n't white or Hispanic , but it was after we had become friends that I found out where she was from . She did n't talk about it . " <p> GA : " How did she dress and act , could you look at her and know she was Muslim , did she dress differently ? " <p> Friend : " She dressed like an American ; she was like any other teenage American high school student . A typical American , she never wore a head scarf or anything like that . " <p> GA : " Did she talk to you about her family or any problems she was having with her father ? " <p> Friend : " I found out through someone else when her father took her back to Iraq and sold her , married her off . I could n't believe her father would do that . We were all like when is Noora coming back home ? " <p> GA : " What other type of things or hobbies was Noor into besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She took art classes and we did pottery , you know , a ceramics class . She liked to just hang out like we all did in high school . She used to come by and visit me at work after school and we would hang out and just talk . " <p> GA : " Now that the case has gone to trial her father is changing his story and saying that it was an accident , he says he was trying to spit out the window at Amal Khalaf and hit them accidentally . " <p> Friend : " I think that 's a bunch of bull , I got a text when it happened , Noora 's dad ran her over and I thought it was an accident and it was no , Noora 's dad ran her over and it was on purpose , that just blew my mind , I was like are you serious ? They held a vigil for her and a bunch of people from high school were there and I could n't go and it broke my heart . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was going crazy because they could n't figure out what happened . But I do n't doubt for a second that he did it on purpose . " <p> GA : " If you had to describe Noor to someone that had never met her , what would you say ? " <p> Friend : " I 'd say that she was a beautiful person inside and out , she had a sense of humor , she definitely knew how to make you laugh . She just seemed like she was happy all the time , I never really saw her upset . She was quick to say a kind word , she was so sweet . She was friends with everybody ; she did n't judge or discriminate against anybody . She was just a really sweet person , I do n't think she had a mean streak on her , I ca n't even imagine her trying to hurt a fly . She was definitely somebody that you 'd just like to talk to that you 'd like to see in the hallway and say hey how ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She definitely did not deserve this at all , it breaks my heart that somebody so sweet and innocent had to have this happen to her . Its , their frightening and it 's pretty ridiculous , you know , I do n't understand the culture and to me it 's just outrageous . " <p> Noor 's little brother Ali has a Facebook page where I found a picture that he had done for a school project . <p> What he has written there is a lot different from what he stated while Noor was fighting for her life . Going back to an exclusive interview by channel 5 KPHO , <p> Peter-Ali Almaleki told CBS 5 News in an exclusive interview Saturday that for years his father and sister have been at odds . <p> He said much of the conflict stems from his sister choosing to not follow in the family 's Muslim traditions . <p> And for a traditional Muslim family , he said that disrespect was the ultimate insult to his father . <p> " Different cultures , different values , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another culture . " <p> " It 's hurt my mom more than anybody , " he said . <p> Really ? I think that his sister Noor might have a different opinion . <p> Here are just a few examples of " honor killings " from right here in the U.S. from an article I wrote early last year , <p> In the Atlanta suburb of Jonesboro in July , 2008 , a Pakistani immigrant strangled his 25-year-old daughter with a bungee cord because she was determined to end her arranged marriage and had gotten involved with a new man . <p> In upstate New York a few weeks earlier , Waheed Allah Mohammad , an immigrant from Afghanistan , was charged with attempted murder after repeatedly stabbing his 19-year-old sister . The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that Mohammad was " infuriated because his younger sister was going to clubs , wearing immodest clothing , and planning to leave her family for a new life in New York City " -- she was a " bad Muslim girl , " he told sheriff 's investigators . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bullet-riddled bodies of the Said sisters -- Sarah , 17 , and Amina , 18 - were found in an abandoned taxi . Police issued an arrest warrant for their father , an Egyptian immigrant , Yaser Abdel Said , who had reportedly threatened to kill them upon learning that they had boyfriends . According to the Dallas Morning News , Yaser Said was given to " gun-waving rants about how Western culture was corrupting the chastity of his daughters . " <p> Yaser Said was never captured , but the Said sisters ' 911 call they placed as they were dying was . The audio can be heard here . <p> When will we hear from the " women 's rights " organizations ? How can any human rights group , especially a woman 's group not speak out against this ? I have asked before , where is the National Organization of Women ( N.O.W. ) ? Should they not be out there every day screaming and using this very trial to publicize these atrocities that are occurring to women on a daily basis worldwide ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more " Noor 's " have to die before we as a country speak up loud and clear and say " No more ! " <p> How prevalent are honor killings ? Go to the Stop Honor Killings website and look for yourself . They have 100 pages of killings with an average of 10 per page that only dates back to 2003 . <p> As I have explained before , <p> " The United Nations estimates that as many as 5,000 women are murdered in such honor killings each year for offenses like immodesty or refusing an arranged marriage . " <p> I have no doubt that Faleh Hassan Almaleki will be found guilty and spend the rest of his miserable life in jail , but , we have no right to let Noor Almaleki 's death be in vain . <p> Go to the website mentioned above and get involved . Educate yourself and speak out about it to anyone who will listen . <p> These so called " honor killings " are on the rise and they are anything but honorable . The only way to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and women and make sure it does n't continue . <p> This article is dedicated to and in memory of each and every woman ( and man ) who has died in a killing of " honor " . May they all rest in peace . <p> **25;8875;TOOLONG Contributing Editor Gadi Adelman is a freelance writer 
##3522152 <h> Successes of India 's tuberculosis Programme <p> For a country like India that has the largest number of people infected with tuberculosis ( TB ) in the world , there are significant life-saving advances made in TB care and control over the past years , despite challenges . A lot more remains to be achieved but the gains made over the past decade , are commendable . Saving 2.2 million ( 22 lakh ) lives from TB is no less achievement - for India 's national TB programme officially called the Revised National TB Control Programme ( RNTCP ) . It is the largest TB programme in the world - more appreciated when we consider the positive side of its outcome . <p> " What we have achieved in the past decade in TB control , we were n't able to achieve in the preceding 30-40 years of national TB programme " said Dr KS Sachdeva , Chief Medical Officer ( CMO ) , Central TB Division , Government of India . <p> RNTCP , is run by Directorate General of Health Services , Ministry of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new sputum positive TB case detection rate of more than 73% in 2010 and a treatment success rate of more than 87% against global benchmark of 70% and 85% respectively ( these benchmarks were used by WHO Stop TB Strategy only till 2005 ) . The WHO recommended treatment for TB called Directly Observed Treatment Short-course ( DOTS ) is now being offered to more than 1,25,000 patients each month in India , which is largest in the world in terms of patients initiated on treatment in a country . <p> " As we all know , TB is an infectious disease and it is very important for us to detect TB early and provide complete treatment . It is seen that most patients do not feel the need to continue the treatment as they feel better of the programme emphasizing for adherence to the treatment and keeping default rate to the minimum with the help of community DOTS provider , majority of the patients enrolled under the programme complete their treatment " said Dr Sachdeva . One wonders if RNTCP programme performance is optimal , then how come India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TB ? <p> Dr Sachdeva further informs that having achieved the global objectives of case detection and treatment success rate for last three consecutive years ( these ' global objectives ' of detecting 70% new TB cases and treating 85% of them , were in use by global WHO Stop TB Strategy till 2005 ) , the programme has set for itself an ambitious target of Universal Access to Quality TB Care for all TB patients from whichever healthcare provider they choose to seek care . This calls for reaching out the unreached and fostering an active involvement of private healthcare providers , non-governmental organisations and empowering community to demand for quality anti-TB services . This probably refers to implementing the Patients ' Charter for TB Care -- a rights and responsibilities based framework that is an integral component of WHO Stop TB Strategy -- but has n't been rolled out satisfactorily - in letter and spirit . <p> Newer challenges like multi-drug resistant TB and TB-HIV co-infection have the potential to reverse the gains made by the programme in the last decade . Conscious of these challenges , the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rolled out by the programme in the year 2000 and the entire country is now implementing TB-HIV collaborative services " said Dr Sachdeva . <p> The programme recognizes treatment of multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) as a ' standard of care . ' With close to 100,000 MDR-TB patients every year in India , it is indeed a matter of hope that India recognizes MDR-TB treatment as a standard of care . However , the number of patients of MDR-TB currently on treatment is abysmally low - and India 's RNTCP aims to treat 30,000 MDR-TB patients annually by 2013 . Despite of recognizing seemingly-insurmountable challenges , how can one ignore that only a small minority ( 30,000 every year ) of MDR-TB patients in India are , thankfully , likely , to receive standard care by 2013 , and many times more number of MDR-TB patients in India will not be able to access the standard care . What are the options for them , one wonders ? <p> Dr Sachdeva said the best way to prevent emergence of MDR-TB is by implementing quality DOTS services . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the outcome of poor DOTS programme performance . So how will more of the same be a solution , one wonders . <p> However for patients who do develop MDR-TB , DOTS Plus services for management of MDR-TB were rolled out in thr year 2007 and by December 2010 , 12 states are implementing the DOTS Plus and the entire country wil be covered by 2011 in phase wise manner . Covering the entire country , does n't imply providing standard care for MDR-TB to all - rather as said above , RNTCP aims to at least provide proper care to 30,000 patients annually by end of 2013 . <p> While we should see the challenge MDR-TB poses to TB programmes globally , and in India as well , the country " has one of the most ambitious plans to scale up treatment of MDR-TB compared to any other country in the world " said Dr Sachdeva ( because by 2013 , the RNTCP intends to place at least 30,000 patients of MDR-TB on treatment annually ) . Thanks to India for envisioning one of the most ambitious plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough - and unacceptable - to turn an alarming number of MDR-TB patients on the blind spot . <p> The treatment duration for MDR-TB is long - two years - and expensive - it costs about Rupees one lakh ( INR 100,000 ) per patient for the drugs alone . <p> One of the challenges in scaling up treatment is laboratory capacity . The diagnosis of MDR-TB is a laboratory-based diagnosis and needs to be done from a RNTCP accredited TB Culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing ( C and DST ) Laboratory . Strengthening laboratory capacity of India and other high burden MDR-TB countries is clearly warranted before treatment of MDR-TB patients can be effectively and successfully rolled out . RNTCP currently aims to establish a network of 43 C and DST laboratories to diagnose MDR-TB by end of 2013 , said Dr Sachdeva . A value-added service at each of these 43 C and DST laboratories is that it will be equipped with the newer molecular based diagnostic tests ( line probe assay - LPA ) which can diagnose MDR-TB within 48 hours as compared to 6-12 weeks with conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diagnosis time for MDR-TB so drastically and enable the patients to be put on appropriate standard treatment as soon as possible . <p> " The programme further intends to leverage on newer diagnostic platforms which are being made available by validating and demonstrating their effectiveness in programme settings . The Indian government is committed to support the programme till it ceases to be a public health problem " said Dr Sachdeva . <p> India and many other countries have made unprecedented progress in TB control programmes over the past decade but a lot more needs to be done by all means to effectively control TB . Only coming years will testify how well India could succeed in achieving universal access to quality TB care for all TB 
##3804450 <h> No more religion based politics in Bangladesh <p> Bangladesh will be the first ever Muslim dominated nation , which is set to ban religion based politics soon . Bangladeshi law minister Barrister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters that the existing constitution will be replaced under the directives of the Supreme Court soon , which will stop doors for anyone in continuing religion based politics in the country . The new constitution will be printed and brought into effect in weeks . He said , " Religion-based parties will be prohibited according to the sections 12 and 38 of the constitution . No separate laws will be required ! " <p> When asked who will bell the cat , Shafique said according to the Representation of People Order RPO , all political parties should have themselves registered for participating in the polls . " In this case , it is the Election Commission 's responsibility to consider whether the constitution of a political party contradicts with the national constitution . " <p> Religion based politics came into existence in Bangladesh since founding father of the nation , Bangabandhu Sheikh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was virtually transformed into Sharia Constitution by the subsequent Military Rulers in the country . Military dictator Hussain Muhammed Ershad amended the constitution thus making Islam as the state religion of Bangladesh . Ershad played key role in giving patronization , support and indirect funding to various Islamist political parties in emerging and gaining strength . Taking the advantage of such situation , dozens of Islamist and religion based political parties grew like mushroom in Bangladesh . Most of these Islamist political parties were actively involved in recruitment and sending of Bangladeshi ' Jihadists ' to various ' battle grounds ' in Afghanistan , Palestine and Kashmir . Some of the leaders of the Islamists parties are still active in spreading Jihadist notion amongst people in the rural areas as well as giving instigations to people in participating in Jihad in ultimately turning Bangladesh into a neo-Taliban state . <p> Things would have been worst in the country , especially after sudden military interference in 2007 and continuous military dictated rule by so-called interim government for two years , if Bangladesh Awami League was not elected to power with huge mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman played the most important role during the war of independence of Bangladesh in 1971 . It believes in secularist Bangladesh under socialist rule . <p> Anti-Islamist forces in Bangladesh are particularly delighted to know that , very soon , religion based politics will be banned in the country , which will certainly put several Islamist and religion based political parties into extinction . <p> Bangladesh is a land of braves and heroes . It has century-long heritage of religious harmony and tolerance . Because of Islamists and existence of religion based politics in the country , for past few decades , the excellent atmosphere of religion harmony has been severely hampered . The country even has witnessed the emergence of Jihadist forces such as Jagrata Muslim Janata JMJ , Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh JMB , Hizbut Tahrir HT , Hizbut Towhid HuT , Khelafat Majlish , Khatmey Nabuat Andolan KNA , Khatmey Nabuat Movement KNM , Harkatul Jihad Bangladesh HuJI , Jadid Al Qaida , Islamic Constitution Movement , Zaker Party , Muslim League , Allah'r Daal , Hezbollah Bangladesh etc . For the sake of uprooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bangladesh , it is essential for Bangladesh Awami League to continue in power at least for a second term it ends the current term in 2013 . International community needs to extends fullest support towards the leadership of Sheikh Hasina Prime Minister in Bangladesh and leader of Bangladesh Awami League . On the other hand , the Prime Minister also needs to take several measures in immediately stopping country-wide terrorism , extortion , corruption , nepotism , hooliganism and anti-people
