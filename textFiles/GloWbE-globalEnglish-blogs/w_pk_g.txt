Certainly the first house appointed for mankind is the one at Bakkah ( Makka ) , blessed and a guidance for the nations . In it are clear signs : the place of Abraham ; and whoever enters it is safe ; and Pilgrimage to the house is a duty which people owe to Allah -- whoever can find a way to it . " ( The Quran , 3:94-96 ) <p> The Holy Quran tells us here that the Kabah was the first House of worship on earth that man built . Historical evidence , too , bears out that this House has existed from the most ancient times that we can go back to , and that it was visited annually by people and regarded as sacred . Thus Islam has chosen as its central shrine , not a place of significance in its own history ( and there are numerous such places ) , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- where man first built a house of worship . Similarly , Islam accepted in essence the ancient pilgrimage to the Kabah , and did not institute some entirely new ceremony . <p> This clearly shows that Islam seeks to draw attention to the beginning and the roots of religion , and its original principles . As mankind became more advanced , and separate nations appeared , various prophets arose in each nation who gave more detailed religious teachings , applicable particularly to local circumstances . As time went on , and these religions developed separately , and were further interpreted by man 's own thought , they diverged from one another as well as from the basic principles at their root . <p> So Divine wisdom , in order to make these divergent religions converge again , sent the final faith to the place which was the first where a religious monument was built , to call mankind back to the original principles of religion -- the simple fundamentals which had become lost in the haze and maze of the details of religious doctrines , ceremonies and controversies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Pilgrimage , and not just believers or Muslims . For instance : <p> " Pilgrimage to the House is a duty which people owe to Allah . " ( 3:96 ) <p> " Proclaim to people the Pilgrimage : they will come to thee on foot and on every lean camel , coming from every remote path . " ( 22:27 ) <p> There is , of course , a prophecy here that people from all nations and religions will join Islam and go to the Pilgrimage . But the Quran addresses all people because the Kabah is where mankind first received religion , and therefore mankind is being called back to unite on the original , simple faith . <p> Abraham , and the Jewish and Christian faiths <p> Besides addressing mankind generally , the Quran , by establishing the Kabah as the Muslim religious centre and instituting the ancient Pilgrimage as one of its pillars , also specifically addresses the Jews and Christians and calls on them to unite on the original principles of their religions . For Abraham , who re-built the Kabah from a ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and features of the Pilgrimage , is a figure accepted by both Jews and Christians . <p> It was long after the time of Abraham that Moses arose who founded the Israelite religious law , and laid the basis of the beliefs and customs which define the Jewish religion . When , in the course of time , the followers of this law forgot its true purpose and aim , sticking to its observance only in letter , in a hypocritical manner , and corrupting it to suit their desires , God then sent Jesus to revive the real spirit of the faith , and show how man could attain nearness to God . He was generally rejected by the Jews . The later generations of Jesus ' followers themselves misinterpreted his teaching and the metaphorical language he used to express man 's relation with God . This led them to reject observance of the Divine law altogether , and to coin the belief that Jesus was the son of God who had come to atone for mankind 's sin of not adhering to the Divine commandments , and that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian religion came into being . So there were two opposing religions with conflicting tenets : salvation by rigid adherence to the letter of the law , and salvation through belief only in Jesus . <p> The Quran calls upon these two faiths to step back and consider their common origin . It tells them that Abraham , the great teacher who preceded these two religions , attained salvation by simple submission to the One God and the practice of virtue . He neither followed any rigorous , detailed religious law , nor did he merely trust to belief in salvation through someone else 's intercession . As the Quran says : <p> " Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian , but he was an upright man , one who submitted to God , and not one who took others for gods . " ( 3:66 ) <p> In other words , the particular doctrines now associated with the names Jew and Christian were unknown to Abraham . He followed the simple , broad principles of religion . The Quran says : <p> " Who has a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing good to others , and follows the faith of Abraham , the upright one . And God took Abraham for a friend . " ( 4:125 ) <p> Meaning of submission to God <p> Submitting to God entirely ' means that in everything one does , one gives up all one 's lower , selfish desires , and whole-heartedly follows the difficult path prescribed by God . It means that when worldly considerations and our baser desires show us one path , and the guidance of the faith shows us a different path , we reject the former and follow the latter . It is exactly what we pledge ourselves to when taking the baiat to join this Movement : I will hold religion above the world . <p> Submission to God does not mean observing rules and regulations in a purely mechanical way , to the letter , and at the same time sticking to your wrong desires . Submission to God also does not mean fatalism , or submitting to circumstances which befall us , and being inactive , claiming that it is God 's will . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly , where we adopt all means , fair and foul , of achieving a desired end , thinking not of right or wrong for one moment , but if we happen to fail in our endeavours , we then claim that we are submitting to God by accepting His verdict . Were we submitting to God when using unlawful and unscrupulous means to get what we wanted ? Submission to God involves a conscious struggle to overcome one 's base desires , and follow what we know is the right path . <p> Simple principles of faith <p> The simple principles of faith followed by Abraham were , then , submission to God and the doing of good to others . In consequence , he was raised to the position of a friend of God , as stated in 4:125 above . And these were the principles Islam came to restore , and to which it invites Jews and Christians ( and others ) as being the precepts followed by their own revered founders . The Pilgrimage is a restoration of the original principles of religion , of a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all mankind to set aside later religious differences and return to the original purpose of religion . <p> Islam is not requiring people of other faiths to accept beliefs which are entirely novel and unprecedented , and alien to their traditions . That is what Christianity , as preached , is asking people to accept , namely , that Jesus died for their sins . That is not a principle , because for one thing , it could not have been followed by those who lived before the time of Jesus . It is the simple principles described above which are , and have always been , the path to salvation . The Quran tells us that both Jews and Christians assert that none but a Jew or a Christian shall receive salvation . It rejects this baseless claim , saying : <p> " Nay , whoever submits himself entirely to God and does good to others , he has his reward from his Lord , and there is no fear for such , nor shall they grieve . " ( 2:112 ) <p> This is the whole crux of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made religion a cumbersome matter : the Jews with their meticulous , detailed law , to be followed to the letter ; the Christians with their confusing , incomprehensible explanations of how God could be one and three at the same time , and how Jesus was man and God at the same time . <p> Regretably , Muslims of later times also made religion a burdensome , complicated matter , marked by trivial details and futile controversies . <p> Then the Reformer of this age arose and drew attention to the simplicity and the true inner spirit of the faith . <p> Sacrifice <p> This is a feature of the Pilgrimage in which Muslims all over the world also participate . The Quran says with regard to the sacrificed animals : <p> " Not their flesh , nor their blood , reaches God , but what reaches Him is your righteousness and doing of duty . " ( 22:37 ) <p> Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad explained this by saying that the true sacrifice is not of the animal which is being slaughtered , but of the animal desires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhort people in his khutbas at this Id that the real sacrifice by an individual at this occasion is to give up a bad habit permanently . If we took this advice , what would we be like in a few years ' time ! <p> Hazrat Mirza has referred to this verse many times , to explain that in all the religious obligations , such as prayer etc. , it is not the outward act which counts with God , but how much righteousness you learn from it . The Quran says : <p> " You can not attain to righteousness unless you spend ( in God 's way ) out of what you love . " ( 3:91 ) <p> So when we fulfill the Islamic obligation of either charity or giving money in the cause of Islam , that only helps us if we also part with some of our desires and things we cherish , and not just money . You can not buy God with money , you can not please Him by offering Him the meat of an animal , you can not flatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the greatest ' . You have to offer yourself , and sacrifice a part of yourself -- this is what God requires . <p> To sum up , the message of the Pilgrimage and this Id is that all mankind should unite on the fundamental principles of religion revealed to it , and live as one brotherhood with equality for all . But that is only possible through a sacrifice of one 's animal desires , which 
##942550 <h> A Vernacular Web <h> The Indigenous and The Barbarians <p> When I started to work on the World Wide Web I made a few nice things that were special , different and fresh . They were very different from what was on the web in the mid 90 's . <p> I 'll start with a statement like this , not to show off my contribution , but in order to stress that -- although I consider myself to be an early adopter -- I came late enough to enjoy and prosper from the " benefits of civilization " . There was a pre-existing environment ; a structural , visual and acoustic culture you could play around with , a culture you could break . There was a world of options and one of the options was to be different . <p> So what was this culture ? What do we mean by the web of the mid 90 's and when did it end ? <p> To be blunt it was bright , rich , personal , slow and under construction . It was a web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of tomorrow , full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer . One could say it was the web of the indigenous ... or the barbarians . In any case , it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions , professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts . <p> I wrote that change was coming " soon " instead of putting an end date at 1998 , for example , because there was no sickness , death or burial . The amateur web did n't die and it has not disappeared but it is hidden . Search engine rating mechanisms rank the old amateur pages so low they 're almost invisible and institutions do n't collect or promote them with the same passion as they pursue net art or web design . <p> Also new amateur pages do n't appear at such amounts as ten years ago because the WWW of today is a developed and highly regulated space . You would n't get on the web just to tell the world , " Welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions have changed and there 's no need for this sort of old fashioned behavior . Your CV is posted on the company website or on a job search portal . Your diary will be organized on a blog and your vacation photos are published on iphoto . There 's a community for every hobby and question . <p> This is why I refer to the amateur web as a thing of the past ; aesthetically a very powerful past . Even people who were n't online in the last century , people who look no further than the first 10 search engine results can see the signs and symbols of the early web thanks to the numerous parodies and collections organized by usability experts who use the early elements and styles as negative examples . <p> Just as clothing styles come back into fashion so do web designs . On a visual level things reappear . Last year I noticed that progressive web designers returned to an eclectic style reincorporating wallpapers and 3D lettering in their work . In the near future frames and construction signs will show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their meaning and contexts . <p> In the past few years I 've also been making work that foregrounds this disappearing aesthetic of the past . With these works I want to apologize for my arrogance in the early years and to preserve the beauty of the vernacular web by integrating them within contemporary art pieces . But this is only half of the job . <p> Creating collections and archives of all the midi files and animated gifs will preserve them for the future but it is no less important to ask questions . What did these visual , acoustic and navigation elements stand for ? For which cultures and media did these serve as a bridge to the web ? What ambitions were they serving ? What problems did they solve and what problems did they create ? Let me 
##942750 <h> Main menu <h> Post navigation <h> A little bit of Pink , A little bit of Star Trek <p> Finally , they did it ! Apple finally switched over to Intel ! Yay ! I ca n't begin to tell you guys how happy I am , and although I 'm a bit late at writing this blog , I am pretty excited about what lies ahead for Apple . <p> Now , there 's been a lot of stuff about this on the internet about this transition , and I 've been thinking about how this will affect us all . <p> First of all , the fact the Mac OS X has been ' leading a secret double life for the past five years ' reminds me of the Pink Project and the Star Trek Project . The pink project started something like the NeXT OS , which eventually was given a huge make-over and became the new Mac OS X. The Star Trek project , however , never really hit the market . It was a project that aimed at porting the Mac OS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Intel platform . After a lot of investment , and quite a lot of progress , the project got cancelled , like many other unfortunate Apple products . <p> But once I got to think about the Star Trek project and Mac OS X , I begin to see that the Star Trek project had absolutely nothing to do with the porting of OS X to the Intel platform . We all know that Mac OS X is just NextStep with Mac face ( and maybe just a few changes under the hood ) . Developers know that Mac OS X still has deep NextStep roots -- all the NS stuff that lies inside it , NSOutlineView , NSScrollView . And if I 'm correct , NextStep was ported to the x86 platform in its later days , and Steve Jobs said monday that Mac OS X was always designed to be crossplatform from the beginning . <p> It 's pretty wonderful to see that Steve Jobs decided to keep the Intel port of NextStep ( which was ported to Mac OS X ) alive all these years , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best things that happened to Apple . <p> Actually , that 's not it , alias . Here are a few reasons why Apple made the switch : <p> 1 . PowerPC undoubtedly is way faster than current Pentium 4 ? s on the market . But the question is , how long can the best , stay the best . Ever since Apple made the switch from Motorola 's 68k processors to the AIM PowerPC ( basically IBM 's design , but scaled by the AIM ) , it has had trouble with the line . The roadmap does n't look good . Both Motorola and IBM have been unable to deliver the expected performance ( and clock speed ) gains . <p> 2 . With both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 using PowerPC variants ( and , by the way , being way bigger markets for IBM than Apple ) , IBM 's attention to Apple will , most likely , be lackluster . <p> 3 . Apple needs consistency , and since 1996 , Intel has been consistent , while the AIM alliance has failed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comment of yours , which you posted a long time ago .

##946550 <p> Agitation : : . Keeping the developer , stop bath , or fixer in a gentle , uniform motion while processing film or paper . Agitation helps to speed and achieve even development and prevent spotting or staining . <p> Archival Processing : : . Extra steps are taken when developing and printing to ensure the most stable image is made . <p> Bitumen : : . Hydro-carbon which hardens by the action of light . It was used by Joseph Nicephore Niepce to produce the world 's first photograph in the early 19th century . <p> Base Exposure Time : : . The initial exposure time used for making a " straight " print . This is determined by using a test strip . <p> Bleaching : : . Lightening selected areas of the image using bleaches or reducers . The most common bleach is potassium ferricyanide . Other tonal techniques include burning , dodging , flashing , and toning . <p> Burning : : . Allowing more light to fall upon a particular area of the print making that area darker . Other tonal techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Black &; White : : . A photographic film or paper used to create monochrome images . Though we think of black and white mainly in terms of a gray scale , prints can have a wide variety of subtle tones , from blue- to brown-black . Though the overwhelming majority of photography today is shot and printed in color , black-and-white has attracted a fiercely loyal and dedicated group of photographers . <p> Burn-out : : . Jargon that refers to loss of details in the highlight portion of a scene due to overexposure . With slide film , it might mean that no image detail has been recorded on the film , or that highlights show no texture or tonal information . A highly burnt-out or burnt-up slide may show clear film base in overexposed areas . <p> Characteristic Curve Regions : : . The characteristics curves are shaped similar to a ski ramp , with the bottom portion sloping up slightly ( called the " toe " ) , a steep middle portion known as the " straight line " and a top portion that begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both film and paper characteristic curves are similar in shape . <p> Color Enlarger Head : : . A type of head of an enlarger that has a set of three color filters ( cyan/magenta/yellow ) that can be adjusted to make a color print from a negative or transparency . It can also be used to produce different paper grades using special variable contrast paper . <p> Cold Light Enlarger : : . A diffusion type of enlarger with fluorescent lamps as the light source . These types of enlarger heads scatter the light more evenly across the surface of the negative . One advantage of the cold light head is that it can render more subtle tonal gradations and will minimize the effect of dust and scratches on the negative which are translated to the print . The cold light head does generate some heat while in operation , but considerably less than its condenser enlarger counterpart . <p> Chlorobromide Paper : : . Photographic paper coated with an emulsion made up of both silver chloride and silver bromide . Used for producing enlargements with a warm , slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Developer . <p> Contrast , Contrast Values : : . The perceived difference between light areas ( highlights ) and dark areas ( shadows ) of a scene . The range of contrast levels between the highlights and the shadows is called Contrast Values . <p> C-41 : : . The current process for all standard color negative films . <p> Contact Print : : . A print made by exposing photographic paper while it is held tightly against the negative with a clear glass on top to weight it down . Images in the print will be the same size as those in the negative . <p> Contrast Grade : : . Numbers ( usually 1-5 ) and names ( soft , medium , hard , extra-hard , and ultra-hard ) of the contrast grades of photographic papers , to enable you to get good prints from negatives of different contrasts . Use a low-numbered or soft contrast paper with a high contrast negative to get a print that most closely resembles the original scene . Use a high-numbered or an extra-hard paper with a low-contrast negative to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An enlarger with a sharp , undiffused light that produces high contrast and high definition in a print . Scratches and blemishes in the negative are emphasized . <p> Dye Transfer Print : : . Introduced in 1946 , Dye Transfer is the finest color printing process in the history of photography . The colorants produce an amazingly wide spectrum of colors , defining the largest color space of any process in existence . The extremely long tonal scale of Dye Transfer retains detail in both bright highlights and dense shadows . Dye Transfer is the only continuous-tone color process yielding prints on a fiber-base . Prints may be displayed for many decades without fading , and have a dark storage stability of over 500 years . Density , Image Density : : . Buildup of silver deposits in a particular area produced by exposure and development . The more silver present in a shadow , the more the image density . Conversely , the less silver deposit in the highlights , the less the image density . Technically , density is measured in terms of the logarithm of opacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface of drying film they will leave a residual mark as they dry . <p> Diffusion Enlarger : : . An enlarger that scatters light before it strikes the negative , distributing light evenly on the negative . Detail is not as sharp as with a condenser enlarger ; negative blemishes are minimized . <p> Developer : : . Chemical solution used to convert the invisible silver halide crystals in the film emulsion into visible metallic silver . <p> Dilution : : . Reduction in the strength of a liquid by mixing it with an appropriate quantity of water . <p> Dodging : : . Holding back light from a particular area of the print to make that area lighter . Other tonal techniques include burning flashing , toning , and bleaching . <p> Developing Tank : : . A small plastic or stainless steel tank , into which 35mm film roll or 120 roll film is placed on spiral reels , for processing . Lightproof tops allow solutions to be poured in and out in daylight . <p> Dish development : : . Method of development used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shallow dish of developer and agitating by rocking the dish . <p> Emulsion : : . The light sensitive surface layer of film and paper . Usually consists of silver halides in gelatin . It 's put there to protect and hold the light-sensitive material , usually silver halides in gelatin , in which the image is formed on film and photographic papers . <p> Easel : : . Sits on baseboard of enlarger and holds paper flat and in position . Two or four adjustable blades adjust to fit different sizes of paper or border . Use to crop during printing . <p> Edge number : : . Film has a clear unexposed strip running the length of both edges . This strip , called the rebate , is pre-exposed with edge numbers to identify each frame as well as a product code to identify the film make and type . <p> Emulsion Side : : .

Shaped portion at the start of 35mm film used to aid loading . <p> Film Leader Retriever : : . Device which can be inserted into a 35mm cassette to pull out a film leader which has been fully wound in . Useful if you want to re-use film that was removed mid-roll . Also helpful during film processing . <p> Fiber Based Paper : : . Photographic paper without a resin ( plastic ) coating . Processing times are longer than for other papers , but the paper is probably more archival permanent than resin coated papers . <p> Film Characteristic Curve : This curve describes a graphical relationship between the logarithm of the exposure value ( horizontal axis ) and density ( vertical axis ) of film . Each brand of film may exhibit a different characteristic curve . <p> Fixer , Fix : : . A chemical solution used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flashing : : . Pre-exposing the paper to a much diffused white light in order to reduce the contrast level between the highlights and shadows and extend the tonal range . Other tonal techniques include burning , dodging , toning , and bleaching . <p> Flat Negative : : . A flat negative is low in contrast , usually caused by underexposure or underdevelopment of film . Flat light shows no change in brightness value throughout the entire scene . <p> Fibre-based Paper : : . A printing paper that doesn't't have a resin coated surface . It takes much longer to wash and dry but the results can look better and it has better archival qualities . <p> Gelatin : : . The medium used on photographic materials as a means of suspending light-sensitive silver halides . <p> Grades , Paper Grades : : . A classification system for specifying the degree of paper contrast , ranging from 0 ( very soft ) to 5 ( very hard ) . <p> Grain : : . Clumps of silver-halide grains in film and paper that constitute the image . These grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and in the development process ( paper grain ) . Unlike film , the grain in printing paper is largely responsible for the image tone . Graininess is most noticeable in even , mid-tone areas of a print . <p> Hard Developer : : . A paper developer that can be used alone or in combination with other developers ( two-bath development ) . When used alone , a hard developer can produce a wide range of tones . Contrast can be varied by changing paper grades , changing filtration , or using a softer developer to obtain intermediate contrast grades . <p> Highlight Separation , Highlights : : . Important bright areas ( highlights ) of a scene in which detail must be recorded ( exposed ) onto the film . Highlights are represented on a negative by dense deposits of black metallic silver , reproducing as the bright areas on a print ( also see shadow detail ) . <p> Hypo Clear : : . Chemical solutions used to speed up the efficient removal of fixer from the prints in subsequent water washings of the prints . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by duping a positive slide or transparency onto color negative film . This inter negative can then be printed on color negative ( Type " C " ) paper . Negative printing materials have lower contrast than do positive papers , but this inter negative process will reduce overall sharpness and color saturation . <p> Intensification : Chemical method of increasing the density of the photographic image . It is only suitable for treating negative materials and works better on negatives that have been underdeveloped rather than underexposed . <p> Jug : : . A container for water , you fill her up and pour out to use whenever the need be . <p> Kettle : : . Invaluable piece of equipment when it 's all going wrong . Use to make tea or coffee to accompany quantities of chocolate . <p> Latent Image : : . The invisible image that is formed when the silver halide compounds in film are struck by light . Upon development , this image , or series of light and dark tones , is made manifest . <p> Line Film : : . A high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white only- ( with no gray areas ) . <p> Masking : : . A technique for controlling contrast in the printed image . <p> Mackie Line : : . Is an effect sometime found on a negative or print , in which a light line forms along the boundaries of the darkest image areas . It may also be caused during processing by the diffusion of exhausted developer , lack of agitation , or by Solarization . <p> Negative Carrier : : . Removable holder which fits between lens-board and lamp-house of an enlarger . Holds negative flat and in a fixed position . Can be glassed or glassless . Glass prevents negatives popping or buckling from heat of the lamp but introduces more surfaces for dust to settle on . <p> Ortho : : . Short for Orthochromatic -- a high contrast film that 's sensitive to all color other than red and deep orange . As a result these can be handled under red safelight conditions and are designed primarily for reproducing halftone images or artistic black and white shots that have few mid tones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object blocks light . Technically , opacity is expressed as a ratio of the incident light to the transmitted light . <p> Posterization : : . Photographic technique using a number of tone separated negatives which are printed on high contrast material . A master negative is made by printing these in register . The final print from this contains selected areas of flat tone in place of continuous tone . This effect is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Solarization . <p> Print Tongs : : . Plastic tongs , often with rubber tips , used to lift prints and transfer between developing trays without allowing solutions to come in contact with skin . <p> Pearl Surface : : . There are two surfaces of Ilfochrome Classic printing material . Pearl is a slightly textured matte finish on a resin-coated paper base . It is less susceptible to reflections and fingerprints than the glossy surface and is easier to mount , but is only available in one ( medium ) contrast grade . It is not considered archival . <p> Paper Characteristic Curve : : . This curve describes a graphical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density ( vertical axis ) of a printing paper . Each brand of paper may have a different initial characteristic curve and graded paper curves will be different than variable contrast paper curves . The shape of the curve can be altered by different developers , development times , temperatures , and toning . <p> Photogram : : . Where an image is created by placing an object directly onto printing paper and exposing it to a light source . Many photographers and artists have tried this technique including pioneers Thomas Wedgwood and Fox Talbot along with the Surrealist , Man Ray . <p> Pull-Processing : : . A technique used to reduce subject contrast and film speed by overexposing and under developing . <p> Push-Processing : : . A technique used to increase contrast and film speed by underexposure and over development , also known as up-rating . <p> Reflected Light : : . Light bounced off a subject , not falling on it ( incident light ) . <p> Resin Coated Paper : : . Photographic paper with the emulsion coated in a resin ( plastic ) . Processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper may not be as archivally permanent ( see other paper types : variable contrast , graded contrast , fiber based ) . <p> Reducer : : . A chemical that 's used to reduce the density of a processed negative , often referred to as Farmer 's Reducer . <p> Replenisher : : . A solution used to top up and maintain part used processing chemicals . This is more economical because you can extend the life of previously used stock by replacing a measure of it . <p> Solarization : Reversal or partial reversal of tones in a photographic image caused by vast amounts of over-exposure . It is often inaccurately used to describe the partial reversal effect caused by fogging photographic material with light , which is actually the Sabattier effect . <p> Sabattier Effect : : . Part positive part negative effect formed when an emulsion is briefly re-exposed to white light during development , and then allowed to continue development . Also known as Pseudo-Solarization . <p> Squeegee : : . Tool with rubber blades or rollers , used to squeeze water out of wet prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( shadows ) of a scene in which detail must be recorded ( exposed ) onto the film . Shadows are represented on a negative by sparse deposits of black metallic silver , reproducing as the dark areas on a print ( also see highlight separation ) . <p> Soft Developer : : . A paper developer that can be used alone or in combination with other developers ( two-bath development ) to achieve more subtle contrast control . Commonly used with graded papers to achieve intermediate grades , that is , to soften the contrast . <p> Stop Bath : : . Acid solution used after development to instantly arrest further development . <p> Safelight : : . Orange or red light used in a darkroom . Gives out light of a wavelength to which photographic paper is relatively insensitive . Safe lights are not actually safe .

The range of tones ( zones ) within a particular area or scene . <p> Tone : : . A black and white photograph is made up of a series of gray tones . Controlling these tones allows us to control the nature of the photograph , both emotionally and technically . Since the number of gray tones is quite large it needs to be broken down from a continuous range to a series of distinct zones . These zones make up what is known as the Zone System . <p> Toners : : . Used to change the color of the photographic print by chemical baths . Through the system of bleaching and toning , the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Toning : : . Soaking the print in selenium to help darken the black areas and give the print an overall feeling of " richness " .

In both the situations , step is inline with thousands of Facebook users and according to their urge of boycotting Facebook on May 20th . <p> Pakistani govt. should do this and they should also record their protest to the facebook as a prove of a responsible muslim state .

##954951 <p> All the jurisprudential rulings and Islamic beliefs have been transmitted to us by the companions . No one can claim that he worships Allah based upon the Qur'an and the sunna without the companions acting as the intermediaries to reach these two fundamental sources for the Muslims the world over . <p> Yet the companions disagreed and differed among themselves after the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , reviling and cursing each other , fighting and eventually killing each other . It is not possible for us then , given these circumstances , to accept rulings from them without discussion , critique , examination and opposition . Likewise , it is not possible to judge for or against them without knowing their status and without reading their biographies concerning what they did during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and after his death . This is necessary so as to distinguish the trustworthy from the falsifier , the believer from the corrupt one , the sincere one from the hypocrite , and to know those who turned back upon their heels , from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general do not allow this and vehemently prevent criticism of the companions or finding any fault with them . They are pleased with all of them and send blessings upon them , as they send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad , without the exception of any of them . <p> The question that must be posed to the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a is this : Does criticizing and finding fault with the companions deserve banishment from Islam ? Or does this act conflict with the Qur'an and the sunna ? <p> To answer this question , it is necessary for me to examine the deeds and sayings of some of the companions during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and after his death , referring to what has been mentioned by the scholars of the ahl al-sunna in their Sahihs , Musnads and their historical works . I shall do this in a concise manner without referring to any Shi'i book , since their views on some of the companions are well known and require no further elucidation . <p> To remove any confusion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use in arguing against me , I must state that when we mention the companions in this chapter , we refer to some , not to all of them . Those whom we refer to may be the majority or the minority , we will discover this during the course of our research , if Allah wishes . <p> I say this because many trouble makers accuse us of being against the companions . They say that we revile and curse the companions so as to influence those who listen to us and to block the path to research . On the contrary , we refrain from insulting and reviling the companions . We are pleased with the sincere companions whom the Qur'an calls " the thankful ones " . We dissociate ourselves from those who turned back upon their heels , those who reverted after the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and caused most Muslims to be misguided . Yet , even these we do not malign nor insult them . We merely expose their deeds , which have been chronicled by the historians and the hadith scholars , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our brothers from the ahl al-sunna do not like this , they consider it as an act of cursing an insulting . <p> The noble Qur'an , and it is Allah 's word , which does not shy away from the truth , has opened this door for us and has informed us that amongst the companions were hypocrites , corrupts ones , tyrants , liars , polytheists , reverts , and amongst them were those who troubled Allah and His Messenger . <p> The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , who did not speak from desire and , in Allah 's name , can not be reproached , has opened this door for us and has taught us that among the companions were apostates , heretics , those who broke oaths and dissenters ; amongst them were those who will enter the fire without their companionship benefitting them . On the contrary , it ( companionship ) will work against him , causing an increase in punishment on the day when no wealth or progeny can be of any benefit . <p> Allah , the most wise , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Prophet bears witness that the situation is so , but , in spite of this , the ahl al-sunna want to prevent the Muslims from speaking or debating about the companions , so that the truth may not be known . They do this so that the Muslims may not know the friends of Allah whom they can befriend . They do this also as the Muslims might know the enemies of Allah and His Prophet and would oppose them . <p> One day , I was in the capital of Tunisia in one of its largest mosques . Having completed the obligatory prayer , the Imam sat in the middle of a circle of those who had prayed and he began the session disparaging and labelling as infidels , those who speak against the companions of the Prophet ( P ) . He talked at length saying : " Beware of those who , under the pretext of academic research and a desire to reach the truth , speak against the honour of the companions . The curse of Allah , the angels and all mankind are upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : ' If there comes to you a hadith from my companion , accept it , for , by Allah , even if you were to spend to the extent of Uhud in gold , you would not reach the standing of even a one tenth of them ' " . <p> One of the enlightened members who was accompanying me interrupted him and said : " This hadith is false and a lie against the Prophet of Allah " . The Imam and some of the audience became furious and turned to us in disbelief and aversion . Realising that the situation called for diplomacy with the Imam , I said to him : " O Sir , eminent teacher , what is the sin of the Muslim , who reads in the Qur'an : ' Muhammad is just a Messenger . Other Messengers have gone before him . If he dies or is killed , will you turn back upon your heels ? Whosoever turns back upon his heels will not harm Allah . And Allah will reward those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the sin of the Muslim who reads in Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim the saying of the Messenger of Allah ( S.A.W. ) to his companions : ' On the day of resurrection you will be grabbed from the left , and I will say : ' Where are they being taken to ? ' It will be said : ' To hell , by God ' . I will say : ' My Lord ! These are my companions ' . It will be said : ' You do not know what they did after you . From the time you left them they never ceased to apostatize ' . I will say : ' Away with him , away with him , woe to him who changed things after me . And I do not see anyone of them being saved except that he will be like a forlorn sheep ' " . <p> Everyone listened to me in silence , alarmed . Some of them asked me if I was sure the hadith is to be found in al-Bukhari ? I responded : " Yes , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no companion and that Muhammad is His slave and Prophet " . <p> When the Imam realised the effect I had on those present , due to my memorizing the hadith which I related , he said calmly : " We learnt from our shaykhs , may Allah have mercy on them , that sedition always lies dormant . May Allah curse one who awakens it " . <p> I said to him : " O Sir , the discord in its lifetime has not been dormant . But we are sleeping . The one amongst us who wakes up and opens his eyes to know the truth you accuse him of reviving discord . In any case , Muslims claim to follow the book of Allah and the sunna of His Prophet ( P ) , not the sayings of the shaykhs who are pleased with Mu'awiya , Yazid , and ' Amr b. al-'As " . <p> The Imam interjected saying : " Are you not pleased with our master Mu'awiya ( R ) , the scribe of the revelation ? " I said : " This matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to know my view regarding this subject , I give you my book " Then I was Guided " . Perhaps it will awaken you from your sleep and open your eyes to some realities " . <p> The Imam accepted my talk and my gift with some reluctance . After a month , however , he wrote a wonderful letter to me , praising Allah for having guided him to the right path and showing affection and love for the ahl al-bayt , peace be upon them . I sought his permission to print his letter in the third edition of the book , as it contains sublime affection and sincerity of the soul which , when it recognizes the truth , adheres to it . This reflects the reality of most of the ahl al-sunna , who lean towards the truth as soon as the veils are lifted . <p> However , he requested me to keep his letter secret and not publish it since it was necessary for him to have adequate time to convince the congregation who prayed behind him . He also wished his conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to what he said . <p> Let us return to the subject of the discussion on the companions so that we may reveal the bitter truth which the Qur'an , the most wise book , has recorded and which the noble Prophetic sunna has mentioned . <p> Let us begin with the words of Allah , through which no falsehood comes , neither from the front nor from behind . It is the final ruling , the just and it is the criterion ( between truth and falsehood ) . The most exalted says , regarding some of the companions : <p> " And of the people of Medina are those who are bent on hypocrisy . You know them not , but We know them . Twice will We punish them , and then they will be cast into severe punishment " ( 9:101 ) . <p> " They swear in Allah 's name that they did not speak evil . They have certainly spoken words of disbelief . They disbelieved after submitting . And they contemplated that which they could not attain " ( 9:74 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Allah saying : " If He gives us of His bounty , we will surely spend in charity and be among the righteous people " . But when He gave them of His bounty , they were miserly with it and turned back aversively . So He filled their hearts with hypocrisy until the day they meet Him due to their breaking the promise with God which they gave , and because they lied " ( 9:77 ) . <p> " The desert Arabs are the most disbelieving , hypocritical and most deserving to be ignorant of the ordinances sent down by Allah unto His Messenger . And Allah is the All Knowing , the Wise " ( 9:97 ) . <p> " And of the people are those who say : ' We believe in Allah and the last day ' . They believe not and seek to deceive Allah and those who believe . Instead they fool only themselves , though they do not perceive this . In their hearts is sickness , and Allah increases their sickness . For them is a painful chastisement due to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrites come to you they say : ' We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah ' . Allah knows that you are His Messenger , and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars . They have made their oaths as a shield and turn people away from Allah . Evil indeed is that which they do ! That is because they believed and then disbelieved . Their hearts were sealed and they do not understand " ( 63:3 ) . <p> " Do you not see those who claim to believe in what was revealed unto you and what was revealed before you ? They seek judgement from the evil ones even though they were ordered to disbelieve in them . Satan wishes to lead them astray completely . When it is said to them : ' Come to what Allah has revealed and come to the Messenger ' , you see the hypocrites turn away from you in aversion . Yet when misfortune befalls them due to what their own hands have earned , they come to you swearing by Allah , saying : ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah , but He deceives them . When they stand to prayer , they do so in a lazy manner , they seek to show off to the people , they do not remember Allah but for a little while " ( 4:142 ) . <p> " If you see them , their appearances will please you , and if they speak , you will listen to them . They are as blocks of wood propped up . They believe that every cry is against them . They are the enemy , so beware of them . Allah will destroy them as they forge lies " ( 63:4 ) . <p> " Allah knows those from among you that hinder people and those who say to their brothers : ' Come to us and you will not have to fight except for a little while ' . Covetous they are over you . When fear comes , you will see them looking towards you , their eyes rolling as though death hovers upon them . And when the fear is gone , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe and Allah has made their deeds of no avail , that is easy for Allah " ( 33:19 ) . <p> " And among them are those who listen to you until , when they leave you , they say to those who have been given knowledge : " What did he just say ? " They are those whose hearts Allah has sealed and they follow their own desires " ( 47:16 ) . <p> " Do those in whose hearts is sickness think that Allah will not expose their rancour ? Had we so wished , we would have shown them to you , you would have recognized them by their signs . Surely you shall know them by the tone of their speech . Allah is aware of your deeds " ( 47 : 30 ) . <p> " Those who lagged behind from among the desert Arabs will say to you : ' We were busy with our properties and our families . So seek forgiveness for us ' . They utter with their tongues what is not in their hearts " ( 48:11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book explain clearly the hypocrisy of some of them who infiltrated the ranks of the sincere companions so much so that , had it not been for Allah 's revelation , their realities would have been hidden from the bearer of the message himself . <p> However , the ahl al-sunna always argue with us concerning this . They say : " What have we to do with the hypocrites ? May Allah curse them . The companions are not from them , or these hypocrites were not amongst the companions " . If you ask them : " Who are these hypocrites concerning whom more than 150 verses were revealed in chapters 9 and 63 ? " They will respond : " They are ' Abd Allah b . ' Ubayy and ' Abd Allah b . Salul " . Besides these two people , they do not find any other people . <p> Glory be to Allah ! If the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) himself did not know most of them , how can the hypocrisy be restricted to Ibn Ubayy and Ibn Abi Salul , those two who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah ( S.A.W. ) knew a few of them and told their names to Hudhayfa b. al-Yamani , as you say , and ordered him to conceal their matters to the point where ' Umar bin al-Khattab , during the days of his Caliphate , used to ask Hudhayfa about himself : " Was he ( ' Umar ) from among the hypocrites ? Had the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) mentioned his name ? " This is in accordance with what you report in your books . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had given a clear indicator by which the hypocrites would be known , i.e. , hatred towards ' Ali b . Abi Talib , as you report in your Sahihs . <p> Most of these companions , whom you are pleased with and accord top positions to , hated ' Ali , they waged wars against him , they murdered and cursed him when he was alive and dead . They did this to him , his family and those who loved him . You consider all of them to be amongst the eminent companions . <p> The wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he inform Hudhayfa of their names sometimes , and inform the Muslims of their signs at other times . This was done so that he fulfills his obligation to the people and no one could then claim : " We were not aware of this " . <p> What the ahl al-sunna say nowadays is of no value , they say : " We love Imam ' Ali ( R ) , may Allah brighten his face " . We say to them : " There can not exist in the heart of a believer , love for the friend and enemy of Allah " . Imam ' Ali himself said : " One who equates us with our enemies is not from us " . <p> Furthermore , when the noble Qur'an speaks of the companions , it speaks of them in numerous descriptions and distinctive signs . If we exempt the sincere , grateful companions , then the rest of them have been described in the wise book as being corrupt , deceivers , forsakers , breakers of oaths or they turn back , they express doubt in Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , disobey the orders of Allah and His Messenger , prevent others from jihad , hasten to vain things and business , abandoning the prayer , saying what they do not practise , claim to do favours to the Prophet due to their Islam , having hard hearts and not being humble in the remembrance of Allah and the truth that was revealed , raising their voices above the Prophet 's , troubling the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , or listening to the hypocrites . <p> Let us be satisfied with this brief description , for there are many verses which we have not cited for the sake of brevity . For the benefit of all , however , it is necessary to mention some verses that were revealed to criticize the companions who were described by those attributes but who , due to politics , were all regarded , after the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and after the cessation of revelation , as upright , trustworthy and just . It was not possible for any Muslim to speak against them or criticize or find faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some companions <p> In order that an obdurate person may not think that the verses on the hypocrites do not pertain to the companions , as the ahl al-sunna claim , we have decided to present some of the verses that refer specifically to the believers . <p> In the wise book , Allah 's says : " O You who believe ! What is it with you that when it is said to you to go forth in the cause of Allah you cling heavily to where you are ? Do you prefer the life of this world to that of the hereafter ? Little is the comfort of this life when compared to that of the hereafter . If you do not go forth , He will inflict a grievous punishment upon you and substitute another people in your place . You can not harm Him in the least . And Allah has power over all things " ( 9:34 ) . <p> " O you who believe ! whoever of you reverts after having believed , Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggling in the way of Allah , not afraid of the sternest critics . That is the grace of Allah . He bestows it upon whom He wills . Allah 's knowledge encompasses everything " ( 5:54 ) . <p> " O you who believe ! Do not be treacherous to Allah and His Prophet . Do not knowingly betray your trust . And know that your property and your children are a test and that with Allah lies great reward " ( 8:28 ) . <p> " O You who believe ! Respond to Allah and His Prophet when they call you to what enlivens you . And know that Allah comes between a man and his heart and that to Him you shall be gathered . Beware of discord that it should not affect especially those of you who do wrong ; know that Allah is severe in punishment " ( 8:25 ) . <p> " O You who believe ! Remember the bounties of Allah when armies came against you but we sent against them winds and forces that you could not see . Allah saw clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and from below . And behold ! The eyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats and you imagined various things about Allah . Then the believers were tested and they were shaken tremendously . The hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is sickness say : " Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but delusions " ( 33:12 ) . <p> " O You who believe , why do you say what you do not practise , grievous is the sin in the eyes of Allah that you say what you do not do " ( 61:3 ) . <p> " Has the time not now arrived for those who believe that their hearts should humbly be engaged in the remembrance of Allah and the truth which has been revealed " ( 57:16 ) ? <p> " They seek to impress upon you that they accepted Islam as a favour to you : Say : ' Do not count your Islam as a favour to me . Allah has done you a favour by guiding you to the faith , if you are truthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your fathers , your sons , your brothers , your mates and your kins or the wealth that you have gained , or the business in which you fear a decline , or the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Prophet or struggling in His path then wait until Allah brings about His decision and Allah does not guide those who are corrupt " ( 9:14 ) . <p> " Those who do not believe in Allah and the last day seek to be excused . Their hearts are in doubt and in their doubt they hesitate " ( 9:45 ) . <p> " Had they come out with you they would have only added disorder , hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you . And there are some amongst you who would have listened to them . Allah is well aware of the wrongdoers " ( 9:47 ) . <p> " Those who stayed behind rejoiced in their inactivity , doing so behind the Messenger of Allah . They hated to struggle with their property and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Do not go forth in the heat ' . Say : ' The fire of Hell is more hot ' , if only they understood " ( 9:81 ) . <p> " That was because they followed what brought forth the wrath of Allah . And they hated Allah 's pleasure . So He made their deeds of no value . Or do those in whose hearts there is sickness reckon that Allah will not bring their wickedness to light ? Had We so wished , We would have shown them to you , you would have recognized them by their marks . Surely , you will know them by the tone of their speech . And Allah knows your deeds " ( 47:30 ) . <p> " And a group from the believers disliked it . They dispute with you about the truth after it was made clear , as if they were being driven to death whilst they were watching it " ( 8:6 ) . <p> " Here you are invited to spend in the way of Allah ! Amongst you are some who are misers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . Allah is free from all wants and you are needy . If you turn back He will substitute another people and they will not be like you " ( 47:38 ) . <p> " And among them are those who slander you in the distribution of alms . If they are given from it , they are pleased . If they are not , they become angry " ( 9:58 ) . <p> " And among them are those who listen to you until , when they leave you , they say to those who have been given knowledge : ' What did he say just now ? ' They are those upon whose hearts Allah has placed a seal . They follow their desires " ( 47:16 ) . <p> " And among them are those who trouble the Prophet and say : ' He is all ears ' . Say : ' He listens to what is best for you . He believes in Allah and has faith in the believers . And he is a mercy to those of you who believe ' . But those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 9 : 61 ) . <p> This amount of clear verses are sufficient to satisfy the researchers that the companions can be divided into two groups : <p> 1 . One group believed in Allah and His Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , submitting its affairs and leadership to them . It obeyed Allah and His Prophet , dedicating itself whole heartedly to them , sacrificing for their cause . This group was the successful one . It represented a minority . The Qur'an called these people the ' grateful ones ' . <p> 2 . Another group outwardly believed in Allah and His Prophet , but had sickness in it 's heart . It did not submit it 's affairs except for personal interests and worldly benefits . It opposed the Prophet in his rulings and commands , and preferred itself over Allah and His Prophet . This group was amongst the losers and represented the majority . The Qur'an referred to it succinctly when Allah , the Glorified and Honoured , said : " We have come to you with the truth , but most of you hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this " majority " , during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , lived with him , prayed behind him and accompanied him when he travelled . They sought , by any means possible , to get close to him so that their true state may not be revealed to the sincere believers . They tried their best to put up a show , making the believers envious due to their excessive worship and piety in the eyes of the people . <p> If this was their state during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , what were they like after his death ? No doubt they were energetic , they multiplied in numbers , spread and increased , as did their cover-ups and representatives ( in the community ) . There was no Prophet who could recognise them and no revelation to disgrace them . Especially as , with his death , appeared the early signs of dissension and fragmentation amongst the people of Medina , who were inclined towards hypocrisy . The Arabs in the peninsula apostatized for they were severe in their disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Musaylima the liar , Tulayha , Sajjah bint al-Harth and their followers . All of them were among the companions . <p> If we leave aside all of them and concentrate solely on the Medinan companions of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , we can certainly state that the thorns of hypocrisy appeared in them too . Most of the believers amongst them turned back upon their heels for the sake of the Caliphate . <p> In the previous discussion , we learnt that they plotted against the Prophet ( P ) and his successor , they disobeyed the commands that the Prophet of Allah ( P ) had issued to them when he was on his deathbed . <p> This reality is something from which there is no escape for the researchers , seeking the truth , for they are confronted with it when reading the historical texts and the biographical accounts of the Prophet . Allah 's most glorified book has recorded it in the most clear expression and the most wise verses when it said : " Muhammad is just a Messenger . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is killed , will you then turn back upon your heels ? And whosoever turns back upon his heels will not hurt Allah in any way . Allah will reward those who are grateful " ( 3:144 ) . <p> The grateful ones are a minority amongst the companions , who did not turn back , they were steadfast to the covenant they gave to the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and did not change in any way . <p> This noble verse , with its clear implications , refutes the claim of the ahl al-sunna , i.e. , that the companions have no relation to the hypocrites . Even if we , for argument 's sake , accept this , then this noble verse is addressed to the sincere companions who were not hypocrites during the life of the Prophet ( P ) , but instead reverted upon their heels immediately after his death . <p> The reality of them will become clear when we examine their status during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , and after his death , and what the Prophet of Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadith , biographical and historical works . <p> The Prophet 's sunna reveals the truth about some of the companions <p> In order that no obstinate person may allege that the Prophetic hadiths , which relate to the companions , have any defect and so judge them as being weak , we have relied solely upon the hadiths cited in al-Bukhari , which is the most authentic book for the ahl al-sunna . In keeping with his well known approach , al-Bukhari has concealed many of these hadiths in order to protect the reputation of the companions . Although the other Sahihs of the ahl al-sunna have recorded other numerous traditions and in more explicit terms , we shall be contented with this concise number of traditions which al-Bukhari has reported , so that our argument may be complete . <p> In volume 1 , in the chapter entitled : " The Fear of the Believer of His Acts being made Futile without him Realising It " , in " The Book of Faith " , al-Bukhari reported : " Ibrahim al-Tayyimi said : ' Whenever I compare my words with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ibn Abi Mulayka said : ' I met thirty companions of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and each one of them feared hypocrisy within himself . Not one of them could claim to believe in Gabriel or Michael ' " ( volume 1 , page 97 ) . <p> If Abu Mulayka met thirty companions of the Prophet ( P ) and each one felt that he was a hypocrite and could not claim to have proper belief , how can the ahl al-sunna raise them to the level of Prophets , and not accept criticism of any of them ? <p> In volume 4 , in " The Chapter on Spies and Spying " , in " The Book of Jihad and Campaigns " , al-Bukhari related : " Hatib b . Abi Balta'a ( he was amongst the companions of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ) sent someone to the polytheists of Mecca informing them of some of the plans of the Prophet of Allah ( P ) . His letter was brought to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . The Prophet of Allah ( P ) said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' He apologised to the Prophet saying that all he wanted was to protect his relatives in Mecca . The Prophet of Allah ( P ) believed him but ' Umar ( R ) said : ' O Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) let me chop off the head of this hypocrite ' . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) replied : ' He witnessed the battle of Badr . How do you know , perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr and said : ' Do as you wish , for I have forgiven you ' " ( vol. 4 , p. 19 ) . <p> If Hatib , who was among the first companions at Badr , could divulge the secrets of the Prophet ( P ) to his idolatrous enemies of Mecca and could betray Allah and His Prophet ( P ) with the excuse of protecting his relatives , and if ' Umar himself testifies to his hypocrisy , what can be said of the companions who converted after the conquest of Mecca ? Or after Khaybar , or after Hunayn ? And what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered , without accepting Islam ? <p> As to what has been quoted in the last paragraph , i.e. , the words attributed to the Prophet ( P ) , that Allah said to the people of Badr : " Do as you wish for Allah has forgiven you " we will leave the remarks to the perceptive reader . <p> In volume 6 , in " The Book on the Merits of the Qur'an , Sura al- Munafiqun " , al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih in " The Chapter on Allah 's words : ' It is the same whether you seek forgiveness for them or you do not . Allah will never forgive them , for Allah will not guide the corrupt ones ' " : " A man from the Muhajirun hit an Ansari man . The Ansari said : ' O Ansar , help me ' . And the Muhajir said : ' O emigrants , help me ' . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) heard this and said : ' What is this argument which is characteristic to the claims of the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah ! A Muhajir hit an Ansari ' . He said : ' Leave that alone for it is a detestable act ' . ' Abd Allah b . ' Ubayy heard that and said : ' They have done it ? By Allah , if we returned to Medina , those who are powerful will expel the weaker ! ' This reached the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and ' Umar got up and said : ' O Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , let me cut off the head of this hypocrite ' . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Leave him alone . Let the people not say that Muhammad kills his companions ' " ( S ahih al-Bukhari , vol. 6 , p 65 ) . <p> The hadith clearly shows that hypocrites were among the companions . For the Prophet of Allah accepted ' Umar 's words , that the man was a hypocrite , but prevented him from killing him , lest it be said that Muhammad killed his companions . Perhaps the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) knew that most of the companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many of his companions would remain alive . Where are the ahl al-sunna with regards to this painful reality which refutes their claims ? <p> In volume 3 , al-Bukhari reported in " The Chapter on Traditions of Fabrications " , from " The Book of Testimony " : " The Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by harming my family ? ' Sa 'd b . Mu'adh got up and said : ' O Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , I will relieve you from him . If he is from the Aws , we will behead him . And if he is from our brothers , the Khazraj , we will do as you order ' . Sa 'd b . ' Ubada got up , and he was the chief of the Khazraj , and before this he was a righteous man but he was filled with zeal ( for his tribe ) and said : ' By Allah ! You have lied . You will not kill him for you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and said : ' By Allah , you have lied ! By Allah , we will certainly kill him for you are a hypocrite and argue on behalf of the hypocrites ' . <p> The argument between the Aws and the Khazraj became so heated that they were about to fight each other . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) was on the pulpit , and he kept on placating them until they finally kept quiet , whereupon he also kept quiet " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 5 p. 156 , and vol. 6 , p. 8 ) . <p> Sa 'd b . ' Ubada , the chief of the Ansar , is accused of hypocrisy , having been , as the report testifies , a righteous man , and he is called a hypocrite in the presence of the Prophet ( P ) who did not defend him . The Ansar , whom Allah has praised so much in His book , instigated the ' Aws and Khazraj who were prepared to fight each other for a hypocrite who had annoyed the Prophet ( P ) concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . Knowing all this how can we be surprised by the hypocrisy of others , those who had dedicated their lives to fighting against the Prophet ( P ) and his message , or those who intended to burn the house of his daughter after his death , for the sake of the Caliphate ? <p> Al-Bukhari has reported in his Sahih , in volume 8 , in " The Book of Unity " , in " The Chapter on Allah 's words : ' The angels and the holy spirit ascend to Him ... ' " , " ' Ali b . Abi Talib sent some pieces of gold from Yemen to the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . The Prophet ( P ) distributed it among some people . The Quraysh and the Ansar became angry and said : ' He has given to the notables of the Najd and forsaken us ' . The Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Rather , I was placating them ' . A man came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah ! ' The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Who will obey Allah if I were to disobey him ? He entrusts me to the people of the earth , do n't you trust me ? ' <p> Khalid b. al-Walid asked him if he could kill him , but the Prophet ( P ) prevented him from that . When he went away , the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' From the offspring of this man will come a people who will recite the Qur'an but it will not go past their throats . They will pierce Islam as an arrow pierces the game . They will kill the Muslims but will spare the idolaters . Were I to meet them , I would kill them as ' Ad was killed ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 8 p. 178 ) . <p> This is another hypocrite among the companions , accusing the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) of injustice in distribution , and then confronts him in total disrespect with the words : " O Muhammad , fear Allah " . Although the Apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that from his descendants would emerge a people who would pierce Islam as an arrow pierces the game , killing the Muslims and sparing the idolaters , despite all of this , the Messenger of Allah ( S.A.W. ) prevented Khalid from killing him . <p> In this is an answer to the ahl al-sunna , who always argue with me saying : " If the Prophet of Allah knew that there were hypocrites among his companions who would be the cause for leading the Muslims astray , it would have been obligatory upon him to kill them so as to protect his umma and to protect his religion " . <p> In volume 3 , in " The Chapter if the Imam urges for a Treaty " in " The Book of Treaties " , al-Bukhari relates : <p> " Al-Zubayr reported that he argued against a man from the Ansar who had participated at the battle of Badr , and that he presented the matter to the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) about a stream which both used for irrigation . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Zubayr , and then let the water flow to your neighbour ' . The Ansari became angry and said : ' O Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , is it because he is your cousin ? ' The face of the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) changed ( with anger ) and he said : ' Irrigate and then hold it ( the water ) until it reaches the walls ' " ( Volume 3 p. 171 ) . <p> This is another group of the hypocritical companions who believed that the Prophet of Allah ( P ) was influenced by sentiments and would favour his cousin . They said it impudently until the Prophet 's face changed colour due to intense anger . <p> Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih , in volume 4 , " The Chapter on What the Prophet used to give to those whose Hearts were to be Placated " ; in " The Book of " Jihad and Campaigns " ; " From ' Abd Allah ( R ) , who said : ' On the day of the battle of Hunayn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution ( of booty ) . He gave al-Aqra b . Habis one hundred camels , and he gave ' Uyayna the same amount . He also granted some to the eminent Arabs , giving them preference in the distribution that day . A man said : ' By Allah ! There is no justice in this distribution and the pleasure of Allah is not sought in it ' . I said : ' By Allah , most certainly I will inform the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ' . So I came and informed him . He said : ' And who will be just if Allah and His Prophet are not just ? May Allah bless Moses . He was troubled more than this , and yet he remained patient ' " ( al-Bukhari Volume 4 , p. 61 ) . <p> This is another hypocrite amongst the companions of the Prophet of Allah ( P ) and perhaps he was amongst the prominent Qurayshis . As a result , the narrator refrained from mentioning his name , afraid of the repercussions from the rulers of the time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swears that Muhammad was not just , and that he ( the Prophet ) did not wish to please Allah in his distribution . May Allah have mercy on Muhammad for he was troubled more than this , yet he was patient . <p> In volume 4 , in " The Chapter on the Signs of Prophethood in Islam " , in " The Book of the Beginning of Creation " , al-Bukhari recorded : " Abu Sa'id al-Khudri ( R ) said : ' We were with the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and he was distributing portions . Dhu'l-Khuwaysira came to him . He was from the Banu Tamim . He said : ' O Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . Be just ' . He said : ' Woe be to you ! Who will be just if I am not just ? You would be disappointed and at a loss if I were not just ' . ' Umar said : ' O Prophet of Allah give me permission to smite his neck ' . He said : ' Leave him alone . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours , makes it appear insignificant . They recite the Qur'an but it does not go past their throats . They pierce through the religion as an arrow pierces through the game ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 4 , p. 179 ) . <p> This is another group of hypocritical companions who outwardly exhibited such an abundance of piety and humility that even the Prophet ( P ) said to ' Umar : " The prayers and fasts of one of you seems little compared to their prayers and fasts " . There is no doubt that they would memorize the Qur'an completely , but it did not go past their throats . The words of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) : " Leave him alone for he has companions " indicates the presence of the hypocrites in huge numbers among the companions . <p> In volume 7 , in " The Chapter on He who does not Face The People with Reprimand " , in " The Book of Ettiquettes " , al-Bukhari reported : " ' A'isha said : ' The Prophet of Allah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people kept away from it . This reached the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . He delivered a sermon , wherein , after praising Allah , he said : ' Why is it that a group of you refrain from doing something that I do ? By Allah , I am the most knowledgeable of them concerning Him , and I fear Him most ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 7 , p. 96 ) . <p> This is another type of companions who kept away from the practice of the Prophet ( P ) . No doubt they mocked at his actions and , as a result , we see him ( S.A.W. ) delivering a sermon and swearing by Allah that he was the most knowledgeable of them regarding Allah , and that he was the most God fearing . <p> Al-Bukhari in volume 3 , in " The Chapter on Sharing Together in Sacrifice and the Sacrificial Animals " , in " The Book of Oppression " stated : " ' Ibn ' Abbas said that on the fourth morning of Dhu'l-hijja , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage , and not anything else . When we came forth , he ordered us to make ' umra and then go to our wives ( there was a lot of things that the people said against that ) . ' Ata said : " Jabir said : ' If one of us goes to Mina , the semen would still be dripping from his penis ' . That reached the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and he addressed the people saying : ' It has reached me that some people say so and so . By Allah , I am the most pious and God fearing amongst you ' " ( al-Bukhari vol. 3 , p. 114 ) . <p> Here is another group of companions who disobeyed the commands of the Prophet in the shari'a rulings . The saying of the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) : " It has reached me that some people say so and so " indicates that a lot of them had refused to free themselves from the state of ihram for their wives , on the pretext that they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penises . It did not occur to these ignorant ones that Allah had enjoined a ritual bath and purification upon them after every physical union . How could they proceed to Mina with semen dripping from their penises ? Were they more versed than the Prophet of Allah himself in the rulings of Allah ? Or were they more virtuous and God fearing than him ? <p> No doubt the mut'a marriage , or temporary union with women , was proscribed after the Prophet ( P ) by ' Umar , following the same pattern as above . For if , during the life of the Prophet ( P ) , they rejected his commands concerning the cohabitation with their wives during the days of the pilgrimage , then it is not surprising to find them prohibiting temporary marriage after his death , denying for themselves what the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ordered and considering the marriage of mut'a as fornication , as the ahl al-sunna say today . <p> In volume 4 , in " The Chapter What the Prophet used to give to Those whose Hearts were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Campaigns " , al-Bukhari reported from Anas b . Malik that when Allah had given the Prophet some property of Hawazin , he gave it to Qurayshi men . The Ansar said : " May Allah forgive the Apostle of Allah , he gives the Quraysh and neglects us when our swords are still dripping with their blood " . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) gathered them in Quba , summoning only them , not leaving any one of them aside and said : " What is this that has reached me about you ? " When they repeated their words to him , he said : " I have given it to men who recently converted from disbelief . Are n't you happy that the people go away with wealth , and that you return to your homes with the Prophet of Allah ? By Allah , what you return with is better than what they return with " . They said : " Certainly , O Prophet of Allah we are pleased " . He said : " After me you will see a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Prophet at the pond " . Anas said : " But we were not patient " ( Sahih , al-Bukhari vol. 4 p. 60 ) . <p> Now we ask ourselves : " Was there amongst all the Ansar even one man who was guided and convinced by what the Prophet of Allah ( P ) did ? Did he believe that he ( the Prophet ) did not follow his own desires and inclination ? Did he understand Allah 's words in this regard : ' Nay ! By your Lord , they can not believe until they appoint you as a judge in their disputes and until they do not find in their souls , resistance against your decisions and they totally submit ' ( 4:65 ) . <p> Was there anyone amongst them defending the Apostle of Allah ( P ) when they said : ' May Allah forgive the Apostle of Allah ? ' Certainly not ! There was no one who had the level of belief which the noble verse demanded . Their words after that : ' Certainly , O Prophet of Allah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The testimony of Anas b . Malik , who was amongst them , was appropriate when he said : ' He advised us to be patient , but we were not patient ' " . <p> In volume 5 , in " The Chapter on the Battle of al-Hudaybiyya " , in " The Book of Wars " , al-Bukhari reported from Ahmad b . Ishkab , who said : " Muhammad b . Fudayl informed us from ' Ala b . Musayyab , from his father who said : ' I met al-Bara ' b . Azib ( R ) and said : ' You are honoured , you accompanied the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) You also paid allegiance to him under the tree ' . He said : ' O nephew ! You do not know what we innovated after him ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 5 , p. 66 ) . <p> Al-Bara ' b . Azib spoke the truth . Most people do not know what the companions did after the death of their Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , who oppressed his successor , his cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who oppressed his daughter al-Zahra and threatened to burn her . Nor do they know of the usurping of her rights to the gifts from her father , her inheritance and the khumus . Nor do they know of their opposing the successors of the Prophet ( P ) and the changing of the shari'a rulings , of the burning of the Prophetic sunna , or placing restrictions upon it . Nor do they know of the injury done to him due to the cursing and killing of his family , and their banishment and exile and granting power to hypocrites and corrupt ones , the enemies of Allah and His Prophet . <p> Yes , all these and more they did after his death . These things remain unknown to the masses who do not know the facts except what has been dictated to them by the Caliphs ' schools , who specialised in changing the rulings of Allah and His Prophet , doing so by personal judgments which they called good innovations ( bida ' hasana ) . <p> Due to this , we say to the ahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , in the companionship and the companions . For here is al-Bara ' b . ' Azib , and he is amongst the foremost who pledged fealty to the Prophet ( P ) under the tree , saying to his nephew in the present tense : " Do not take pride in my companionship or my pledge under the tree , for you do not know what I did after him " . <p> Allah said : " Those who pay allegiance to you in fact pay allegiance to Allah . The hand of Allah is over their hands . And whoever violates that oath has done so against his own self " ( 48:10 ) . <p> How great was the number of companions who violated the pledge , so much so that the Prophet ( P ) took a pledge from his cousin ' Ali to fight them as has been documented in the historical texts . <p> In volumes 1 and 3 of his Sahih , in " The Chapter on if People who leave the Imam in the Friday prayer " , in " The Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b . ' Abd Allah ( R ) , who said : " A caravan came from Syria bringing foodstuffs . We were praying the Friday prayer with the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . All the people left except twelve men . This verse was then revealed : ' And if they see trade or vain things , they hurry away and leave you standing ' " . ( al-Bukhari , vol. 1 , p. 225 : vol. 3 , p. 6 , 7 ) . <p> This is another group of hypocritical companions who observed no piety or humility . They fled from the Friday prayer to inspect the caravan and trade , leaving the Prophet of Allah standing in front of Allah , fulfilling his obligation in humility and awe . <p> Was the belief of these Muslims complete ? Or were these the hypocrites who scoffed at the prayers and when they stood to observe it , did so in a lacklustre manner ? None of them is exempted from this except those who stood with the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) to complete the Friday prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies their status and investigates their reports will be appalled by their actions . No doubt their flight from the Friday prayer occurred several times and , as a result , the book of Allah , the most Glorified , has recorded it by stating : " Say that which is with Allah is better than vain pleasures and trade " . <p> So that you may realise , O dear reader , the extent of their respect for the prayer ( the contemporary Muslims show more respect than they did ) I present the following narration to you : <p> Al-Bukhari reported in volume 3 , in " The Chapter on what has been narrated Regarding Plants " in " The Book of Deputyship " : " From Sahl b . Sa'id ( R ) who said : ' We used to rejoice on Fridays for there was an old woman who used to cut some roots of the silq ( a kind of vegetable ) which we used to plant on the banks of our water streams . She would cook them in her pot adding some barley on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that there was no fat or melted fat on it . When we finished the Friday prayers , we would go to her and she would serve it to us . Due to that , we used to he happy on Fridays . We would neither eat nor take the midday nap until after the prayer ' " ( Sahih al-Bukhari vol. 3 p.73 ) . <p> Good for those companions who rejoiced on Fridays , not because they would meet the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) or listen to his sermons and his exhortations or would pray behind him , nor because they would meet each other , or would rejoice due to the day 's blessings and mercy ; they rejoiced on Fridays because of a special dish that an old woman would prepare for them . If a contemporary Muslim were to say that he rejoiced on Fridays for food , he would be regarded as dimwitted and negligent ( of the importance of the day ) . <p> If we wish to research and investigate more , we would find that the grateful ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not exceed twelve in number . These were the devoted ones who did not hurry towards vain pleasures and trade , abandoning their prayer . They were steadfast with the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) in wars on a number of occasions when the rest of the companions turned their backs and fled . <p> In volume 4 , in " The Chapter on what is Detested in Argument and Disagreement in War " , in " The Book of War and Campaigns " , al-Bukhari reported from al-Bara ' b . ' Azib who said : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) appointed an infantry of fifty men on the day of Uhud , and appointed ' Abd Allah b . Jubayr as the leader . He said to them : ' Even if you see birds snatching us , do not leave your positions until I send for you ' . They were defeating them . He said : ' And I saw , by Allah , the women fleeing with their anklets and legs visible as they had raised their dresses . The companions of ' Abd Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , the booty ! Your companions have prevailed so what are you waiting for ? ' ' Abd Allah b . Jubayr said : ' Have you forgotten what the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said to you ? ' They said : ' By Allah ! We will go to them and take something from the booty ' . When they came to them , their faces were turned away and they started to retreat . At that time , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) called them from behind . Only twelve men remained with him whilst seventy of us fell " . ( Sahih al-Bukhari vol. 4 , p. 26 ) . <p> We know from what the historians relate of this battle that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) left with one thousand companions , each one desiring to fight in Allah 's path , allured with the help that had come at Badr . However , they disobeyed the commands of the Prophet ( P ) , causing a loathsome , horrible rout in which seventy people were killed , the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( P ) . The remainder fled , and only twelve people remained with the Prophet ( P ) on the battlefield , according to what al-Bukhari says . The other historians reduce this number to only four . These were ' Ali b . Abi Talib , who resisted the polytheists , thereby protecting the front of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ; Abu Dijana who protected the rear , Talha and Zubayr . It is said that Sahl b . Hanif was also there . <p> It is in this context that we can understand the saying of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) : " I do not see any one amongst them saved except like abandoned livestock " . ( We will discuss this hadith presently ) . <p> Allah , Glory be to Him , the Most Exalted , threatened them with hellfire if they fled from battle and said : " O you who believe ! If you meet those who disbelieve in battle , do not turn back ! Whosoever flees from them on that day , except as a strategy or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrath and his abode is in Hell , it is an evil path " ( 8:6 ) . <p> What , then , is the status of these companions who flee from prayer to pursue vain things and trade , and then flee from battle due to fear of death abandoning the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) alone in the midst of the enemy ? In both cases , they all turn their backs and flee , none remain with him except twelve men according to the best estimate . Where were the companions , O people of perception ? <p> Perhaps some researchers , when they read of such events and narrations , pay little attention to them and assume that they were occasional happenings which Allah forgave and that the companions did not repeat them afterwards . <p> Certainly not , the noble Qur'an informs us of startling facts , for Allah , Glory be to Him , has recorded their fleeing on the day of the battle of Uhud in His words : " Allah fulfilled His promise when you , by His Permission , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to arguing about the order and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight of what you coveted . Amongst you are those who desire this world and amongst you are some who desire the hereafter . Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you . But He forgave you . And Allah is full of grace to the true believers . You were climbing ( high ground ) without glancing at any one and the Prophet was calling you from behind . Then God gave you one distress after another so that you should not grieve at what booty you lost and what has befallen you , and Allah is well aware of what you do " ( 3:153 ) . <p> This verse was revealed after the battle of Uhud , wherein the Muslims were routed due to their craving after the worldly goods when they saw the women raising their dresses and showing their legs and their ankles , according to al-Bukhari 's report . They disobeyed Allah and His Prophet ( P ) as is related by the Qur'an . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek His forgiveness , not repeating such acts afterwards ? <p> Certainly not ! They did not repent and perpetrated worse than this at the battle of Hunayn , which occurred in the latter part of the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . According to the historians , they were 12,000 in number in that battle . Despite their larger numbers , they took to flight and turned their backs as usual , leaving the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) amidst the enemies of Allah , the polytheists . He had only 9 or 10 persons from Banu Hashim , at the head of whom was Imam ' Ali b . Abi Talib , according to al-Ya'qubi in his history , as well as according to other sources . <p> If their flight on the day of Uhud was disgraceful , then , at Hunayn , it was even more despicable and evil , for the steadfast ones who stayed with him at Uhud were four from out of a thousand companions , a ratio of 1:250 . <p> At Hunayn , there were only ten patient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Uhud occurred at the beginning of the emigration and the people were still few in number , and only recently converted from the period of ignorance , what was their excuse at the battle of Hunayn which occurred at the end of 8 A.H. , when only two years of the life of the Prophet remained ? Despite their superior numbers and preparedness , they ran away head over heels from the battle , not even looking back at the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . <p> The noble Qur'an clearly explains their feeble stances and their running away from that battle in the following words : " And on the day of Hunayn when your large numbers elated you but yet availed you naught , the land constrained you despite its width , and you turned in retreat . Allah sent tranquillity on the Prophet and on the believers and sent down an army which you did not perceive , and punished those who disbelieved , that is the chastisement for the disbelievers " ( 9:26 ) . <p> Allah explains that He strengthened the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the fight , by sending tranquillity to them , and then assisted them with an army of angels who fought by their side and helped them against the disbelievers . There was no need of the deserters who fled from the enemy because they were afraid to die , disobeying thereby their Lord and their Prophet . Every time Allah tested them He found them failing . <p> For further clarification , it is necessary for us to examine the narration reported by al-Bukhari , especially the routing of the companions in Hunayn . He reported in volume 5 , in " The Chapter on Allah 's Words " ; ' On the day of Hunayn when you were elated by your numbers , yet it availed you not ... ' " , in " The Book of Military Campaigns " , from Abu al-Qatada who said : " On the day of Hunayn , I saw a Muslim fighting a polytheist while another polytheist was coming up from the rear to kill him . I hastened to the one who was coming up from the rear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and dismembered it . He grabbed me and squeezed me heavily until I feared for my life . Then he let up ; I broke free and struck him , killing him . The Muslims were routed , and I was defeated with them . ' Umar b. al-Khattab was with the people ; I said to him : ' What is the matter with the people ? ' He said : ' It is by Allah 's decree ... ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 5 , p. 101 ) . <p> By Allah , how amazing is the conduct of ' Umar b. al-Khattab , who is held by the ahl al-sunna to be among the bravest of the companions , if not the bravest of them all ? They relate that Allah strengthened Islam through him and that the Muslims did not openly preach Islam until after his conversion . History informs us of the true events and how he turned his back and fled from battle on the day of Uhud . Just as he turned back on the day of Khaybar when the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Khaybar to conquer it , placing him at the head of an army . He and his companions were routed and they returned accusing him ( ' Umar ) of cowardice , and him accusing them of cowardice . He also retreated and fled on the day of Hunayn with those who fled ; perhaps he was the first to flee , and people followed him since he was the bravest of them . As a result , we see Abu Qatada who was among the thousands who fled , turning and asking ' Umar b. al-Khattab , as one surprised : " What is the matter with the people ? " ' Umar b. al-Khattab was not satisfied with his running away from the battle and leaving the Prophet of Allah ( P ) in the middle of the polytheists . He further pretended to Abu Qatada that it was the decree of Allah ! <p> Did Allah order ' Umar b. al-Khattab to flee from the battle ? Or did He command him to remain firm and to persevere in the wars and not to run away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who believe ! If you meet the disbelievers in battle , do not turn upon your heels " ( 8:1 ) . <p> Allah took a covenant from him and his companions about that , as has been related in Allah 's wise book : " They had promised Allah before not to turn upon their heels , and the covenant with Allah must be answered for " ( 33:15 ) . <p> How can Abu Hafs ( ' Umar ) turn away from the battle and allege that it is Allah 's decree ? Where does he stand regarding the injunctions of these clear verses ? Or are there seals upon the hearts ? <p> We are not here discussing the personality of ' Umar b. al-Khattab , we shall devote a special chapter to him . The hadith of al-Bukhari is nonetheless striking and leaves us with no alternative but to make quick observations . What concerns us at this point is the testimony of al-Bukhari that the companions , in spite of their large numbers , turned back on the day of Hunayn . Whoever reads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most surprising things . <p> If the decree of Allah was not obeyed by most companions , as we realized from the preceding discussions , then their disobedience to the commands of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) while he was alive and in their midst is not surprising . As for his commands after his death , may my father and mother be sacrificed for him , these were neglected , changed and altered without any concern . <p> The Companions ' position regarding the Orders of the Prophet during his lifetime <p> Let us begin with the commands he issued during his lifetime which were countered by the companions with revolt and disobedience . <p> For the sake of brevity , we shall discuss only those reports documented by al-Bukhari in his Sahih . We will devote special pages to the rest of the Sahihs of the ahl al-sunna , they are replete with far more instances , and with far more explicit and challenging reports . <p> Al-Bukhari reported in volume 3 , in " The Chapter on the Conditions on War and Making Treaties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Conditions " , after reporting the episode of the treaty of al-Hudaybiyya and ' Umar b. al-Khattab 's opposition to what the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) had agreed to , he doubted him , saying to him openly : " Are n't you really the Prophet of Allah " ? .. to the end of the story ... Al-Bukhari said : " When they finished the matter of writing down the terms of the treaty , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said to his companions : ' Arise and sacrifice the animals and then shave your heads ' . He said : ' By Allah ! Not a man stood up from them , even after he repeated himself three times . Yet no one amongst them rose . He went to Umm Salama and related to her what he had encountered from the people ' " ( S ahih al-Bukhari , vol. 3 , p. 182 ) . <p> Are you not surprised , O reader , at the insolence and disobedience of the companions with regards to the order of the Prophet ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them responded . <p> It is necessary here to relate a discussion that took place between some scholars and myself in Tunis after the publication of my book " Then I Was Guided " . In it , they had read my remarks on the treaty of al-Hudaybiyya , and , in turn , had added their comments to mine , saying : " If the companions had disobeyed the order of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) on the sacrifice and shaving , and none of them complied with his order , then ' Ali b . Abi Talib was among them and therefore he also did not comply with the order of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) " . I responded to them with the following : <p> Firstly : ' Ali was not reckoned to be among the companions . For he was the brother and cousin of the Prophet of Allah , the husband of his daughter and the father of his progeny . ' Ali was with the Prophet of Allah on one side , and the rest of the people on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ordered his companions to slaughter the animals and to shave their heads , then Abu'l-Hasan ( A.S. ) was not counted among them . For he was to him ( the Prophet ) what Aaron was to Moses . Do n't you see that the greetings upon the Prophet are not complete unless the greetings upon his family are added to them ? Without doubt he ( ' Ali ) is the leader of the progeny of Muhammad . As for Abu Bakr , ' Umar , ' Uthman and other companions , their prayers are not complete unless they mention ' Ali b . Abi Talib along with Muhammad b . ' Abd Allah . <p> Secondly : The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) always used to share with ' Ali , his brother , his sacrifices , as occurred in the farewell pilgrimage when ' Ali came from Yemen and the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) asked him : " What did you offer for sacrifice O ' Ali ? " He replied : " What the Prophet of Allah offered " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadith reporters and historians have recorded this incident . He must have been his partner at al-Hudaybiyya too . Thirdly : ' Ali b . Abi Talib was the one who wrote the terms of the treaty of al-Hudaybiyya , as dictated by the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , and had never disputed with him in anything throughout his life ; not at al-Hudaybiyya , nor at any other occasion . History has not recorded a single instance at which ' Ali ( A.S. ) delayed carrying out an order of the Prophet ( P ) or disobeyed him even once , God forbid , or that he ever fled from a battle and left his brother and cousin amongst the enemies . Rather , he constantly offered himself as a sacrifice . In short , ' Ali b . Abi Talib was like the Prophet ( P ) himself . As a result , the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) used to say : " None is allowed to remain in the mosque while ritually impure ( junub ) except I and ' Ali " . <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presented and admitted that ' Ali b . Abi Talib never in his life opposed any order of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . <p> Al-Bukhari reported in volume 8 , in " The Chapter on Abhorrence of Differences " , in " The Book on Adherence to the Qur'an and Sunna " , from ' Abd Allah b . ' Abbas who said : " When the time of the Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) death drew near , there were people in the house , among them ' Umar b. al-Khattab . He said : ' Come so that I may write for you something so that you may never go astray ' . ' Umar said : ' Surely the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) is overcome by pain ; you have with you the Qur'an , and the book of Allah is sufficient for us " . The members of the household differed and argued amongst themselves . Among them were those who said : ' Come closer , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) will write for you something so you will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what ' Umar had said . When the noise and differences intensified in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , he said : ' Go away from me ' " . <p> Ibn ' Abbas used to say : " The calamity of all calamities was the clamour and differences that occurred between the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and his writing the dictate for them " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 8 , p. 161 ; vol. 1 , p. 37 , and vol. 5 , p. 138 ) . <p> This is another command of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) which the companions countered with rejection , disobedience and degradation of the status of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . <p> It must be noted that when he ( the Prophet ) asked for paper and ink to be brought so that he could write for them a letter which would prevent them from going astray , ' Umar b. al-Khattab said in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) : " The Prophet of Allah is delirious " , i.e. , hallucinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expression and changed it to " overcome by pain " , because the one who said it was ' Umar b. al-Khattab . You see , he omitted the name of ' Umar in the narration , saying : " and they said the Prophet of Allah is delirious " . This is the honesty of al-Bukhari in transmitting hadith . ( We will , God willing , devote a special chapter to this . ) <p> In any case , most hadith scholars and historians relate that ' Umar b. al-Khattab said : " Surely the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) is delirious " and many companions followed him and said what he said in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . It is for us to picture the awful event and those raised voices , the intense clamour and dissension in his presence . No matter how the narration expresses it , it can inform us only a little of the actual scene . It is the same if we read a historical book on the life of Moses ( P ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the effect of a film which we see with our eyes . <p> In volume 7 , in " The Chapter on What is Allowable in Anger and Intensity for Allah 's sake " , al-Bukhari reported in " The Book of Morals " : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) made a small room with a mat from palm leaves . He came out ( of his house ) and went out to pray on it . The people followed him in this . The next night they also came , but the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) delayed and did not come out to them . So they raised their voices and threw stones at the door . He came out angrily and said : ' You insisted on it ( the prayer ) , until I thought it would become obligatory upon you . Offer your ( optional ) prayer in your homes , for surely the best prayer of a man is in his house , except the obligatory prayer ' " ( Sahih al-Bukhari , vol. 7 , p. 99 ; vol. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most unfortunately , ' Umar contravened the order of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and gathered the people for supererogatory prayer during his Caliphate , saying regarding his action : " This is an innovation , a wonderful one " . Most of the companions followed his innovation , they espoused his views and supported him in every thing he did and said . ' Ali b . Abi Talib , and the ahl al-bayt , differed with him for they did not act , except according to the orders of their master , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and did not substitute anything for it . If every innovation leads to error and every error leads to the fire , what about the errors which were invented to oppose the rulings of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ? <p> In volume 5 , in " The Chapter on the Battle of Zayd b . Haritha " , in " The Book of Campaigns " , al-Bukhari reported on the authority of Ibn ' Umar ( R ) who said : " The Apostle of Allah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group but they sought to find fault in his leadership . He said : ' If you find fault in his leadership , you also sought to find fault in the leadership of his father before him . By Allah , he was created for leadership and was the most beloved of men to me ; and now he ( Usama ) is the most beloved of people to me after him ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 5 , p. 84 ) . <p> This event has been related in detail by the historians ; how they angered the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) until he cursed those who stayed behind the expedition of Usama , as he was a young general who had not reached seventeen years of age . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had put him in charge of an army in which were Abu Bakr , ' Umar , Talha , al-Zubayr , ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf and all the Qurayshi notables ; the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) did not draft ' Ali b . Abi Talib , nor any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . <p> Al-Bukhari always summarizes events and edits the hadith to protect the honour of the " pious predecessors " amongst the companions . Despite this , what he reports is sufficient for one who wishes to attain the truth . <p> In volume 2 of his Sahih , in " The Chapter on Reproach of He who Fasted Continuously " , in " The Book of Fasting " , al-Bukhari reported on the authority of Abu Hurayra who said : " The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) forbade fasting two days continuously without breaking it and a Muslim said to him : ' But you fast continuously , O Prophet of Allah ! ' He replied : ' And who among you is like me ? Verily I stay awake at night and my Lord grants me sustenance and water ' . When they refused to stop fasting continuously , he joined them one day 's fast with another day , and then they sighted the crescent . Then He said : ' Had it ( the crescent ) been delayed , I would have continued fasting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having failed to desist as he had ordered " ( Sahih al-Bukhari , vol. 2 , p. 243 ) . <p> Well done to these companions who the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) prohibited from doing something but they did not desist from it . He kept on repeating the prohibition , but they would not listen . Did they not read Allah 's words : " Whatever the Prophet gives you , accept it , and whatever he forbids you from , keep away from it , and fear Allah ! Indeed Allah is severe in punishment " ( 59:7 ) . <p> Despite the threat of grave punishment by Allah , Glory be to Him , to those who opposed His Messenger , some companions did not attach any importance to His threats and warnings . <p> If this was their condition , then there can be no doubt about their hypocrisy , even though they outwardly exhibited an abundance of prayer , fasting and strict adherence to religion , to the extent that they even forbade themselves from cohabitation with their wives so that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrained from what the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) did , as has been discussed previously . <p> Al-Bukhari , in his Sahih , volume 5 , in " The Chapter on the Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) sending of Khalid b. al-Walid to Banu Judhayma " , in " The Book of Military Campaigns " , on the authority of al-Zuhri from Salim from his father , he said : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) sent Khalid b. al-Walid to Banu Judhayma and he invited them to Islam . It did not seem proper to them to say we have submitted ourselves and so they said instead : ' We have left idol worship . We have left idol worship ' . Khalid started to kill them and to take captives . He gave each one amongst us his captive . Then , one day , Khalid ordered each man to kill his captive . I said : ' By Allah ! I will not kill my prisoner and none of my companions will kill theirs ' . This happened till we came to the Prophet ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( S.A.W. ) raised his hands and said twice : ' O Allah ! I am innocent of what Khalid has done ' " ( al-Bukhari vol. 5 , p. 107 , vol. 8 , p. 118 ) . <p> The historians have chronicled this event in some detail and shown how Khalid perpetrated this despicable act of disobedience . He , and some of his companions who obeyed him , did not adhere to the commands of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) regarding the prohibition of killing anyone who accepted Islam . Certainly , this was one of the worst sins that caused the flowing of innocent blood , and the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had ordered them to invite the people to Islam , not to kill them . <p> Khaild b. al-Walid was overcome by the urge of the Jahili period , and a Satanic force overcame him . This was because the Banu Judhayma had killed his uncle al-Fakiha b. al-Mughira , during the time of Ignorance . He came upon them and said : " Lay down your arms for the people have accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied and many of them be killed . <p> When some of the sincere companions learned of Khalid 's intentions , they fled from the army and joined the Prophet ( P ) and related the news to him . The Prophet of Allah ( P ) then dissociated himself from his acts and sent ' Ali b . Abi Talib who compensated them for the loss of blood and property . <p> To know this incident in some detail , there is no harm in reading what ' Abbas Mahmud al-'Aqqad has written in his book : " The wonderful exploits of Khalid " , wherein al-'Aqqad writes on pages 57 &; 58 as follows : <p> " After the conquest of Mecca , his ( the Prophet 's ) concern was directed to the cleansing of the Bedouin tribes surrounding it ( Mecca ) from idol worship . He sent expeditions to the tribes to invite them and to ascertain their intentions . Amongst the expeditions was that of Khalid b. al-Walid to Banu Judhayma , numbering about 350 emigrants , Ansars and Banu Sulaym . He sent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banu Judhayma were the fiercest tribe during the period of Ignorance and were known as the " spoonful of blood " . <p> Among those that they had killed on one occasion were al-Fakiha b. al-Mughira and his brother , the paternal uncles of Khalid b. al-Walid and the father of ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf and Malik b. al-Sharid and his three brothers from Banu Sulaym in one place , as well as several others from various tribes . <p> When Khalid came to them and they knew that the Banu Sulaym were with him , they donned their weapons and rode forth for battle , refusing to give in . Khalid asked them : ' Are you Muslims ? ' It is said that some of them answered in the affirmative and some of them said : ' Saba'na ! Saba'na ! ' i.e. , we have left idol worship ! We have left idol worship ! He then asked them : ' Why are the weapons on you ? ' They replied : ' There is enmity between us and some Arab tribes and we feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons ' . <p> He said to them : ' Drop your weapons for the people have accepted Islam ' . A man among them who was called Juhdam cried out : ' Woe be unto you O Banu Judhayma ! This is Khalid . By Allah , captivity will follow your dropping of weapons . After captivity he will behead you . By Allah ! I will never give up my weapons ' . He was still saying this when his weapons were taken away along with those of others . The other people dispersed . <p> Khalid ordered that they be handcuffed and put to the sword . Banu Sulaym and the other Arabs with them accepted his orders of killing them . The Ansars and Muhajirun , however , refused to kill anyone without being commanded by the Prophet ( P ) to fight them . The news reached the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) who raised his hands towards the sky and said three times : ' O Allah ! I dissociate myself of what Khalid has done ' . He then sent ' Ali b . Abi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and property that had been destroyed . <p> The event appalled the prominent companions , those who had accompanied the expedition as well as those who had not . ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf was so incensed that he accused Khalid of deliberate slaughter to avenge his two uncles " . <p> This is the verbatim quote of what al-'Aqqad reported in his book " The wonderful exploits of Khalid " . And al-'Aqqad is like the other ahl al-sunna thinkers , for , after relating the entire episode , he seeks a cold , fictitious explanation to defend what Khalid had done , an explanation which is baseless and which no sound reason can accept . There is no excuse for al-'Aqqad except that he wrote " The wonderful exploits of Khalid " . Everything he presented in defence of Khalid is presumptuous , fragile as a spider 's web . Whoever reads it realises the folly and weakness of his defence . <p> How can there be any excuse when he himself bore testimony in his own words that the Prophet ( P ) sent them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admitted that the Banu Judhayma had removed their arms after having donned them when Khalid deceived them by telling his companions : " Remove your weapons , for the people have become Muslims " . He also confessed that Juhdam had refused to lay aside his arms and warned his tribe that Khalid will deceive them by his words : " Woe unto you O Banu Judhayma , he is Khalid ! By Allah , there is nothing after the removal of your arms except captivity , and after captivity beheading . By Allah ! I will never lay down my arms " . Al-'Aqqad said that the Banu Judhayma crowded him until he removed his arms . This shows the submission of the tribe and of their good intentions . <p> If the Prophet of Allah ( P ) sent them as preachers of Islam and had not ordered them to fight , as you yourself testified , O ' Aqqad , then what was Khalid 's excuse in opposing the orders of the Prophet ( P ) ? I do n't think you can legitimize it , O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , declared their Islam , and finally won over their companion , who had sworn that he would not lay aside his weapons until they pacified him , as you have yourself admitted , O ' Aqqad , then what is Khalid 's excuse for betraying them and killing them when they were passive and were bereft of their weapons ? <p> You have said that Khalid issued orders against them , their hands were tied and they were put to the sword . This is another deed that I do not think you can justify , O ' Aqqad ! Did Islam order Muslims to kill those who do not fight them , even assuming that they did not declare their Islam ? Certainly not . This is the argument that the Orientalists , the enemies of Islam , propagate today . <p> Then , once again , you admit that the Prophet ( P ) did not order him to fight the people , for you said that the emigrants and the Ansar rebuked Khalid for having killed anyone without being commanded by the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aqqad , for seeking excuses for Khalid ? <p> In replying to al-'Aqqad , it is sufficient for us to note that he completely refuted and destroyed his own excuses by saying : " The revulsion to the event extended to all the prominent companions , those who were present in the expedition and those who were not " . If the prominent companions expressed their disgust towards Khalid to the extent that they fled from his army and complained to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and if ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf accused Khalid of deliberately killing the people in revenge for his two uncles , as al-'Aqqad has testified , and if the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) had raised his hands to the sky and said three times : " O Allah , I dissociate myself from what Khalid b. al-Walid has done " , and if the Prophet sent ' Ali with property to compensate the Banu Judhayma for the blood spilt and for the loss of property so as to appease them , as al-'Aqqad has testified , this in itself proves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wronged them and committed excesses against them . Can someone ask al-'Aqqad , who tries his best to defend Khalid , is he ( al-'Aqqad ) more learned than the Prophet of Allah ( P ) who dissociated himself from his acts three times ? Or is he more learned than the prominent companions who reproached him ? Or more than the companions who were present at the event but escaped from the expedition dismayed by his repulsive acts which they had witnessed ? Or is he more learned than ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf , who was with him in the expedition and , without doubt , knew Khalid better than al-'Aqqad ? He accused him of deliberately killing the people so as to exact revenge for his uncles . <p> May Allah fight blind fanaticism and jahili zeal which changes the truth . Although al-Bukhari summarized the matter in four lines , what he has mentioned is sufficient to convict Khalid , and the other companions who obeyed him in killing innocent Muslims , and whom al-'Aqqad has mentioned by saying : " Banu Sulaym and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , al-Bukhari mentions only two or three who did not comply with his commands , they fled from the army and returned to the Prophet complaining of Khalid . You can not convince us , O ' Aqqad , that the emigrants and Ansars who totalled 350 , as you have said , did not obey Khalid in killing the people , and that they all fled from the army , no researcher can believe this . This is merely an attempt on your part to preserve the nobility of the pious ancestors , the companions , and to hide the realities at any cost . The time has come to remove the veils and to know the truth . <p> How many despicable massacres of Khalid b. al-Walid has history related to us , especially on the day of al-Battah when Abu Bakr appointed him to be the head of a big army comprising of foremost companions . He deceived Malik b . Nuwayra and his people when they removed their weapons ; he ordered that their hands be tied and then beheaded them without a fight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the same night that her husband was killed . When ' Umar b. al-Khattab came to know what happened , he castigated him and told him : " You killed a Muslim man then sprang on his wife , by Allah , I will stone you with your stones , O enemy of Allah " . Abu Bakr stood beside Khalid and said to ' Umar : " Stop moving your tongue against Khalid , he used his reasoning and erred " . This is another issue whose discussion is lengthy and mentioning it is repulsive . <p> The rights of how many unfortunate people have been usurped because a tyrant is strong and powerful ? How frequently a tyrant is helped in his tyranny and falsehood because he is rich and close to the apparatus of the rulers . When he examines the story of the Banu Judhayma , al-Bukhari cuts the story short and says : " The Prophet sent Khalid to Banu Judhayma , he invited them to Islam . They did not deem it proper to say ' We have submitted ' , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Were the Banu Judhayma Persians or Turks or Indians or Germans that they did not deem it proper to say " We have submitted " , O Bukhari ? Or were they an Arab tribe in whose language the Qur'an was revealed ? Blind fanaticism and the major plots which were conspired to protect the nobility of the companions made al-Bukhari utter such statements so as to vindicate the act of Khalid b. al-Walid . Al-'Aqqad also says : " Khalid asked them : ' Are you Muslims ? ' " Al-'Aqqad then says : " It is said that some of them replied in the affirmative and some of them replied ' saba'na , saba'na ( we have left idolatry ) ' " . The words " it is said " show clearly that the community would accept anything which people conjured up so as to defend Khalid b. al-Walid . This is because Khalid b. al-Walid was the raised sword of the ruler and was the defender of the usurping Caliphate . He was its follower , exemplifying overwhelming strength to whoever resolved to rebel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saqifa on the day that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) passed away . There is no power nor strength except with Allah , the most High , the most Great . <p> The Companions ' conduct towards the Prophet 's commands after his death . <p> Their neglecting of the Prophet 's sunna : <p> Al-Bukhari reports in volume 1 in " The Chapter of Neglecting of the Salat " from Ghaytan : " Anas b . Malik said : ' I know nothing which is performed now that was performed in the time of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ' . It was said : ' The prayer ' . He ( Anas ) responded : ' Have you not neglected it amongst the things that you have neglected ? ' <p> He said : " I heard al-Zuhri say : ' I visited Anas b . Malik in Damascus and I found him crying . I said to him : ' What makes you cry ? ' He said : ' I do not know of anything which I encountered during the time of the Prophet except this salat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume 1 , p. 134 ) . <p> Al-Bukhari has also reported in volume 1 in " The Chapter of the Superiority of the Fajr in Congregation : " Al-A'mash told us : ' I heard Salim saying : ' I heard Umm Darda say : ' Abu Darda came to me whilst he was angry . I said to him : ' What has angered you ? ' He said : ' By Allah , I do not know from the umma of Muhammad ( S.A.W. ) anything else except that they prayed in congregation ' " ( al-Bukhari vol. 1 , p. 159 ) . <p> In volume 2 in " The Chapter of going to a Mosque in which there is no Minbar " al-Bukhari reports that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said : " The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) used to go out on the day of ' id al-fitr and ' id al-duha to the mosque . The first thing that he used to do was to pray , then he would exhort the people . The people continued this practise until I went out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of ' id al-duha or ' id al-fitr . He wanted to ascend the pulpit before praying . I caught hold of his clothes but he pushed me away , ascended the minbar and delivered the sermon before the prayer . I said to him : ' You have altered the sunna , by God ' . He said : ' Abu Sa'id , what you know has gone away ' . I said : ' By Allah , it is better than what I do not know ' . He responded : ' The people would not remain after the prayer , so I delivered it before the prayer ' " ( al-Bukhari , vol. 2 , p. 4 ) . <p> The companions during the time of Anas b . Malik and Abu Darda and during the lifetime of Marwan b. al-Hakam , and this was a period which was very close to the lifetime of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , changed the sunna of the Prophet ( P ) and had discarded everything , even the prayer , as you have heard , and reversed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for their evil benefits , i.e. , the Banu Umayya adopted the practise of reviling and cursing ' Ali and the ahl al-bayt from the pulpits after every sermon . Most of the people at the ' id al-fitr and ' id al-duha had dispersed when the prayer was completed , as they did not like to hear the Imam curse ' Ali b . Abi Talib and the ahl al-bayt . As a result , the Banu Umayyad intended to change the sunna of the Prophet ( P ) , so they delivered the khutba before the prayer at the two ' id s , so that the practise of cursing and abusing ' Ali could be established in the presence of the entire Muslim community , against their will . <p> At the head of this was Mu'awiya b . Abi Sufyan , for he established this practice which , for them , became one of the best ways of getting close to Allah . It reached a point where some historians reported that one of their Imams finished his sermon on a Friday and , having forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead the prayer . The people from every corner started screaming at him : " You have abandoned the sunna ! , You have forgotten the sunna ! Where is the sunna ? " <p> Yes , unfortunately , this innovation which Mu'awiya b . Abi Sufyan initiated , remained in continuous practice for eighty years on the minbar of the Muslims - and even to this day its influences remain . Despite this , the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a are pleased with Mu'awiya and his followers and they do not accept any reproach or criticism of him , under the pretext of respect for the companions . <p> Praise be to Allah that the sincere Muslims researchers have begun to differentiate between truth and falsehood . Many of them have begun to distance themselves from the deeds of the companions which Mu'awiya , his partisans and followers , instituted . Now the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a have begun to wake up to this repulsive inconsistency . They defend all the companions to the extent that they curse one who reviles even one of them . If you tell them : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he reviled and cursed the best of all companions and certainly meant to curse the Apostle of Allah who said : ' He who has cursed ' Ali has cursed me , and he who has cursed me has cursed Allah ' " ; at that , they stammer and hesitate in answering . They say things , which if they point to anything , merely indicate the stupidity of their minds and deep , blind fanaticism . Some of them , for example , respond by saying : " These are the lies fabricated by the Shi'as " and others say : " They are the companions of the Prophet of Allah , they can say what they wish to about others . As for us , we are not at their level to criticize them " . <p> Glory and all Praise be to You , my Lord ! Your words in the noble Qur'an led me to the realities which were difficult for me to comprehend and believe . Everytime I used to read : " And We have prepared for hell many of the jinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; they have eyes with which they see not and ears with which they hear not . They are like cattle , nay , worse yet , they are those who are heedless " ( 7:179 ) . <p> I used to be astonished at this and would ask myself : " How can this be ? " Can a dumb animal be better guided than this human ? Is it possible for a person to admire a stone , then worship and seek sustenance and assistance from it ? However , praise be to Allah , my astonishment ceased when I dealt with people and travelled to India where I saw astonishing upon astonishing things , doctors in anatomy , well versed in knowledge of the cell structure of human and its formation , yet they worshipped the cow . <p> Had this sin been committed by the ignorant Hindus , one would have accepted their excuse . But you will see the cream of their intellectuals worshipping cows , stones , the sea , the sun and the moon . After seeing this , there remains no alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the glorious Qur'an points to , especially those human beings who are more misguided than animals . <p> Abu Dharr al-Ghifari 's testimony regarding some of the companions <p> Al-Bukhari reports in volume 2 under the heading " That from which Zakat is paid is not Buried Treasure " from al-Ahnaf b . Qays who said : " I was sitting with the notables from Quraysh , and there came a man of coarse hair , clothes and appearance who stood in front of them , greeted them and said : ' Inform those who hoard ( wealth ) that a stone will be heated in the hell fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts until it comes out from their shoulder bones , then it will be put on their shoulder bones until it comes from their nipples , it will be moving inside them ' . Then he went away and sat near a pillar . I followed him and sat near him , although I did not know who he was . I said to him : ' I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' They do not understand anything . My friend said to me .... ' . I said to him : ' And who is your friend ? ' He said : ' The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ' . He said to me : ' O Abu Dharr , do you see Uhud ? ' He said : ' I looked at the sun , to see how much of the day remained . I thought that the Prophet wanted to me to go somewhere for a need . So I said : ' Yes ' . He said : ' I do not wish to have gold the size of Uhud unless I would spend it all ( in charity ) except three dinars ' . These people do not understand , they collect only worldly pleasures . No , by Allah , I will not ask them for worldly possessions nor seek their guidance in religion until I meet Allah the most Honourable , most Majestic ' " ( al-Bukhari , volume 2 , p. 12 ) . <p> Al-Bukhari also reports in section seven in " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Most High : ' Indeed I have given you al-kawthar ' " . On the authority of ' Ata b . Yasar , from Abu Hurayra , that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : " While I will be standing , a group of my followers will be brought there and , after I recognise them , a man will come between me and them and will say : ' Come along ' . I will ask : ' Where to ? ' He will say : ' To the fire , by Allah ' . I will say : ' What is with them ? ' He will say : ' They apostatized after you and moved backward ' . Then another group will be brought and , as I will recognize them , a man will come between me and them saying : ' Come on ' . I will say : ' Whereto ? ' He will say ' To the fire , by Allah ' . I will say : ' What is their case ? ' He will say : ' They renegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them being spared except a few who are like cattle without a shepherd ' " . <p> From Abu Sa'id al-Khudri : " It will be said : ' You do not know what they initiated after you ' . I will say : ' Woe , woe unto those who changed things after me ' " ( Bukhari vol. 7 , p. 209 ) . <p> Al-Bukhari volume 5 in " The Chapter of The Battle of al-Hudaybiyya and the Saying of Allah the Almighty : ' And verily Allah was pleased with the believers as they pledged their fealty to you under the tree ' " . From ' Ala b. al-Musayyab , who narrated from his father , who said : " I met al-Bara'a b . ' Azib ( R ) and said to him : ' You are fortunate , you were a companion of the Prophet and paid allegiance to him under the tree ' . Whereupon he said : ' My nephew , you do not know what we innovated after him ' " ( al-Bukhari , volume 5 , p. 66 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion who was , at least , honest with himself and with the people . His testimony is confirmation of what Allah said regarding them : " If he dies or is killed , will you then go back on your heels ? " <p> It is also a confirmation of the Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) statement : " Then it will be said to me : ' They apostatized after you and receded from Islam ' " . <p> Al-Bara ' b . ' Azib was an eminent companion amongst the earliest notables who pledged their allegiances to the Prophet under the tree . He is bearing witness against himself and against other companions that they innovated practices after the death of the Prophet ( P ) so that the people may not take pride in them . He made it clear that being a companion of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and giving him allegiance under the tree which was called " the pledge of pleasure " did not prevent a companion from going astray and reverting to unbelief after the Prophet ( P ) . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) words : ' You will surely follow the practices of those who were before you ' " . " On the authority of ' Ata b . Yasar , from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri , that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' You will follow the practices of those before you , literally even if they enter a lizard 's burrow , you will follow them ' . We said : ' O Prophet of Allah , ( do you mean ) the Jews and the Christians ? ' He said : ' And who else ' " ( al-Bukhari vol. 8 , p. 151 ) ? <p> History 's testimony about the companions <p> For us , after the Qur'an and the sunna , there is another form of testimony which can be more explicit and clear for it was actually lived and felt by the people . They witnessed and interrelated with it , this evolved into history which was recorded and related , memorized and printed . <p> If we read the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a historical books like the works of al-Tabari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibn Qutayba and others , we see the most surprising things ; we realise that what the ahl al-sunna say regarding the upright conduct of the companions and the absence of blemish in any of them are simply views which are based on no proof , no sound reason will accept them . No one will agree with these views except the fanatics , in them light has been overcome by darkness . They do not differentiate between the companions and Muhammad , the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , the infallible one , who uttered not one word from his own desire and did nothing but what was right . The Qur'an bore witness to their hypocrisy , corruption and lack of uprightness . You find them defending the companions more than they defend the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . I cite some examples of these : <p> When it is said to any one of them that Sura ' Abasa does not refer to the Apostle of God ( S.A.W. ) but , rather , refers to one of the prominent companions whom Allah rebuked for his pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not find him accepting this interpretation . He says instead : " Muhammad was nothing but a man , he erred on several occasions and Allah rebuked him more than once . He is not infallible except in proclaiming the Qur'an " . This is his view regarding the Prophet of Allah . <p> If , however , you tell him that ' Umar al-Khattab erred in innovating salat al-tarawi which the Prophet of Allah ( P ) forbade and instead ordered the people to pray in their houses by themselves if a prayer is of a supererogatory nature ( i.e. , not compulsory ) , you will see him defending ' Umar b. al-Khattab with defences which can not be discussed . He will say : " It is a good bida ' " and he will exert all efforts to find an excuse , despite a clear text from the Prophet ( P ) forbidding it . If you say to him that ' Umar abrogated a share for those whose hearts were to be appeased as a share ordained by God in His glorious book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umar knew that Islam was strong , therefore he said to them : ' We do not need you ' . He is more versed in the Qur'an than everyone else " . Are you not surprised at this ? <p> The limit was reached when I said to one of them : " Let us leave aside this " good bida ' " and those whose hearts were to be placated . What is your defence of him when he threatened to burn the house of Fatima al-Zahra and all who were residing in it unless they came out to pledge allegiance " ? <p> He said to me quite candidly : " The truth was with him . Had he not done that , many of the companions would have sided with ' Ali b . Abi Talib and discord would have occurred " . <p> Our conversations with this group of people does not help or benefit us . It is very unfortunate that most of the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a reason in this way for they do not know the truth except according to ' Umar and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth by the men ; they are supposed to know the men by the truth ( know the truth and you will know it 's people as Imam ' Ali has said ) . <p> This type of belief spread amongst them and ' Umar surpassed all the sahaba . They are all seen as upright and it is impossible for anyone to disparage or criticize them . By this method , they built a thick wall and an impenetrable barrier for every researcher who seeks to know the truth . You will find that he does not finish one wave but several others oppose him ; he does not overcome one danger except that several others are put in his path . It is impossible for the poor researcher to arrive at the shore of safety unless he is persevering , patient and brave . <p> If we return to the topic of history , we find that in the case of some companions , their secrets are exposed , their veils dropped and their true colours are shown , things which they had sought to hide from the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be close to them , also tried to hide . <p> The first thing that grabs the attention is their stance regarding the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , the morning after his death , may my soul be sacrificed for him . How could they leave his corpse when they had not prepared , washed it nor shrouded or buried it ? Instead , they rushed to their meeting in the hall of Banu Sa'ida , debating and arguing amongst themselves over the Caliphate , whose religiously designated owner they knew . They had pledged allegiance to him during the lifetime of the Prophet ( P ) . <p> What convinces us that they used the occasion to benefit from the absence of ' Ali and the Banu Hashim , whose morals had prevented them from leaving the Prophet of Allah ( P ) and rushing to the Saqifa , is that these companions wanted to finalize the matter quickly , before they had completed their noble task , and then impose upon them a decided issue . They ( the Banu Hashim ) were not able to say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill anyone who sought to nullify the matter which they had decided upon , on the pretext of combating those who opposed and on the pretext of averting anarchy . <p> The historians have recorded surprising and strange things , that had occurred in those days , by those companions who later became the Caliphs of the Prophet ( P ) and commanders of the believers ; like their forcing people to pay allegiance by violence , threats and power ; their attack on the house of Fatima and opening it , and the pressure on her stomach with the door which she was behind , causing her to miscarry her child . And their coercing ' Ali , with his hands tied , and threats to kill him if he refused to pay allegiance . Similarly , their denial of Fatima 's rights of gifts and her inheritance and her share as a close relative of the Prophet . Up to her death , she was angry with them and she would pray against them in every prayer . She was buried at night in secrecy and no one attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions who refused to pay the zakat to Abu Bakr in protest until they knew the reason of ' Ali being overlooked for the Caliphate . This was because they had pledged to him during the Prophet 's time at Ghadir Khum . <p> Or like their dishonoring the women and transgressing the limits of Allah in their killing of innocent Muslims and forcing themselves upon the women without observing the stipulated waiting period ( ' idda ) . <p> Historians have also recorded their altering the rulings of Allah and His Prophet ( P ) which are clear in the book and the sunna and substituting , instead , judgments based on their personal reasoning that served their personal purposes . <p> They have recorded events like some of them consuming alcohol and continuing to commit fornication when they were governors of Muslims and their judges . <p> Events like the exile and banishment of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari from the city of the Prophet ( P ) until he died in solitude without having committed any sin . Similarly their beating of ' Ammar b . Yasir until he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mas'ud until his limbs broke and their isolating the sincere companions from positions of power which they gave instead to the corrupt ones and hypocrites from the Banu Umayya , who were the enemies of Islam . <p> Historians have also recorded the insults and curses directed against the ahl al-bayt , whom Allah had cleansed and purified completely , and the killing of virtuous companions who followed them . <p> Events like their usurping the Caliphate by force , aggression , murder and threats ; and removing anyone who opposed them by different ways like assassination , poisoning and other means and their seizing the city of the Prophet by the army of Yazid to do in it as they pleased in spite of the saying of the Prophet : " Indeed , my sanctuary lies in the city , whoever violates it will have the curse of Allah , the angels and mankind all upon him " . <p> Historians have also recorded events like their stoning the house of Allah with large catapults and burning the holy sanctuary and their killing some companions who were in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Faithful and the leader of the successors and the master of the pure household at the battles of the Camel , Siffin and al-Nahrwan , due to their despicable greed for this transitory world . He was , to the Prophet of Allah , the position that Aaron was to Moses . <p> Events like their killing of the two masters of youths in paradise , Imam al-Hasan by poison and Imam al-Husayn by slaughter and mutilation , and their killing of the whole household of the Prophet ( P ) . Apart from ' Ali , b . Husayn , no one was saved . They committed other acts due to which human conscience cries out . I spare my pen from writing about them . The ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a are aware of many of these deeds and due to that try their utmost to prevent the Muslims from reading history or researching the lives of the companions . <p> All the crimes and acts of violence that I have mentioned quoting from the historical books are , without doubt , the actions of the companions . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to insist on the companions being faultless and to judge them all as being virtuous , not allowing criticism of any of them . <p> It must be stressed that we are absolutely aware of the moral probity , uprightness and piety of some of them , of their love for Allah and His Prophet ( P ) and their remaining true to the covenant given to the Prophet ( P ) until they died and that they did not change in the least . Allah is pleased with them and makes them reside in the proximity of their beloved Prophet Muhammad ( S.A.W. ) . <p> They are too great , honored and exalted for any person to ruin their reputation , or to fabricate any lies about them , for the Lord of Glory and Power has Himself praised them on several occasions in His glorious book just as He has acclaimed their companionship and their sincerity to the Prophet of mercy more than once . History has recorded nothing but the most honourable status , filled with chivalry , nobility , bravery , piety and servitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gardens of eternity with doors opened for them , the pleasure of Allah is greatest for those who are grateful . As the book of God reminds us , the grateful ones are a small minority , so do not forget ! <p> As for those who submitted yet no faith entered into their hearts , they accompanied the Prophet of Allah ( P ) either out of desire , fear or some personal motives which they kept hidden . The Qur'an rebuked and threatened them , the Prophet of Allah warned and cursed them on several occasions . History has recorded some despicable acts and stances ... they do not deserve any respect and reverence , let alone that we should be pleased with them and accord them the position of Prophets , martyrs and upright ones . <p> This , by my life , is the true view for those who weigh things in a just manner and do not transgress the limits imposed by Allah for His slaves , i.e. , love for the believers and enmity and dissociation from the corrupt ones . Allah says in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who befriend a group that has Allah 's anger upon it ? They are not from you , nor you from them . They swear falsely , knowingly . Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them . Evil indeed is what they used to do ! They used their oaths as a cover to obstruct men from the path of Allah ; for them is a humiliating chastisement . Neither their wealth nor their progeny will avail them with Allah . They are the inhabitants of the hell fire , they will dwell therein eternally . On the day when Allah will resurrect all of them , they will swear to Him as they swear to you . They will think that they have something , but they are liars . Satan has won them over and caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah . They are the party of Satan . Most certainly , the party of Satan are the losers ! Those who resist Allah and His Prophet are the most abased . Allah has written that I and my Prophet will triumph , indeed Allah is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who believe in Allah and the last day loving those who resist Allah and His Prophet , even if they be their fathers , their sons , their brothers or their kinsfolk . For them , Allah has written faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself . And He will grace them with gardens below which rivers flow to dwell therein forever . Allah is pleased with them and they with Him , they are the party of Allah . Certainly , the party of Allah are the successful ones " ( 58:14-22 ) . <p> I must not fail to record in this respect that the Shi'as are on the truth for they do not accord love except to Muhammad and his progeny and for the companions who walked on their path and the believers who followed them in goodness until the day of judgement . On the other hand , non-Shi'a Muslims accord love to all the companions paying no heed to those who resisted Allah and His Prophet , and they generally cite as their proof the words of Allah the Exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who preceded us in faith , and cause not in our hearts any rancour for those who believe . O Our Lord , you are most kind , most Merciful " ( 59:10 ) . <p> You will find them being pleased with ' Ali and Mu'awiya without being concerned with the deeds which the latter committed . The least of what can be said of them is that these are acts of disbelief , deviation and fighting against Allah and His Apostle . I have previously mentioned an odd instance , there is no harm in repeating it . One of the righteous people visited the grave of the eminent companion , Hujr b . ' Adi al-Kindi and found a man crying bitterly . Assuming him to be a Shi'a , he asked him : " Why are you crying ? " He replied : " I am weeping over our master Hujr , may Allah be pleased with him " . <p> He replied : " Because he refused to curse our master ' Ali , may Allah be pleased with him " . <p> Whereupon the righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , may Allah be pleased with you " . <p> Why this persistence and obsession with the love for every companion ? We find that they do not send blessings to Muhammad and his family without adding " and all the companions " . The Qur'an did not order them to do this nor did the Prophet ( P ) demand it nor did any companion say it . The sending of blessings is only for Muhammad and his household , as revealed in the Qur'an and as was taught by the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) to them . <p> If I ever doubted anything , one thing I do not doubt and never will doubt , is that Allah asked the believers to love the close relatives , they are the ahl al-bayt . He made this obligatory for them , like a reward for the message of Muhammad . The most High said : " Say , I do not seek from you any reward except love for my kindred " ( 42:20 ) . <p> The Muslims have unanimously agreed upon the need for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed about others . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : " Leave that which causes you doubt , for that which causes you no doubt " . <p> The position of the Shi'as regarding love for the ahl al-bayt a nd their followers is indubitable , whereas the view of the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a for the love for all companions presents grave doubts . Otherwise , how can the Muslims accord love to the enemies and murderers of ahl al-bayt ( A.S. ) and be happy with them ? Is n't there a clear contradiction ? <p> Let us leave aside the talk of those who have gone astray and some Sufis who maintain that a person 's heart does not become pure and knows no real faith until there remains not an atom 's weight of hatred for all of Allah 's servants be they Jews , Christians , heretics and polytheists . They have some incredibly strange sayings about that , agreeing with the Christian church evangelists who deceive men by saying that Allah is love and religion is love . One who loves His creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rituals . <p> These , by my life , are idle talks , not accepted by the Qur'an , sunna nor reason . The noble Qur'an says : " You will not find a community believing in Allah and the last day , loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger " . He also says : " O you who believe ! Do not take Jews and Christians as friends . For they are friends of each other . Whosoever amongst you takes them as friends , they are amongst them , God does not guide the wrongdoing community " ( 5:51 ) . <p> The Most High has said : " O you who believe ! Do not take your fathers and brothers as friends if they prefer disbelief over belief . Whoever amongst you befriends them , they are the wrongdoers " ( 9:23 ) . He also said : " O You who believe , do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends and protectors . You show them love when they have rejected the truth that has come to you " ( 60:1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said : " The faith of a believer is never complete until his love is for Allah 's sake and his hatred is for Allah 's sake " . And he also said : " Love for Allah and love for His enemy can never co-exist in the heart of a believer " . <p> Traditions of this genre are innumerable . Reason in itself is enough proof that Allah , Glory be to Him , has made believers love faith and adorned it in their hearts . He has made them hate disbelief , corruption and disobedience . For a man may hate his son or his father or his brother for his opposition to the truth and his swaying back and forth to the path of Satan ; and he may love a stranger to whom he has no connection , except the brotherhood of Islam . <p> For all of this , it is incumbent that our love , affection and friendship be to those whom Allah has commanded us to love , just as it is necessary that our animosity , hatred and dissociation be from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered us to dissociate from . <p> As a result of this , our affection is for ' Ali and the Imams from his progeny , even though there was no preceding love for them ; this is because the Qur'an , sunna , history and reason have left us no doubt regarding them . <p> Because of this , we dissociate ourselves from those companions who usurped his rights to the Caliphate , even though there was no preceding hatred for them ; this is because the Qur'an , sunna , history and reason have left for us grave doubts regarding them . <p> Since the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) instructed us : " Abandon that which causes doubt for that which does not cause doubt " , a Muslim must not follow any doubtful matter nor neglect the book in which there is no doubt . <p> Similarly , it is incumbent on every Muslim that he free himself from the chains and blind imitations and judge according to his reasoning , without any preceding notions nor latent jealousy ; because desires and Satan are two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he sees them as beautiful . What a wonderful poetry Imam al-Busayr said in al-Barda : <p> " Deny the soul and the devil . Obey them not <p> They are foul advisers so refute them " . <p> It is incumbent on Muslims to fear God in dealing with His upright servants . As for those who are not pious , there is no sanctity for them . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : " There is no sin in slandering a corrupt person " . This is so that the Muslims be made aware of his matter , and so that they may not be deceived by him nor befriend him . <p> It is necessary today that Muslims be truthful with themselves and take a good look at their painful , sad , debased reality and do away with praising and taking pride in the greatness of their predecessors and seniors . If our predecessors were on the right path , as we think today , we would not have arrived at this conclusion which is certainly the result of the revolution that occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may my soul and the souls of all the world be ransomed for him . <p> " O you who believe , stand firmly for justice and bear witnesses for Allah , even if it be against yourselves , your parents or your kin whether they be rich or poor . For Allah is better than them both . Do not follow desires lest you stray . And if you deviate or decline then verily Allah is well informed what you do " ( 4:135 ) . <p> Views of those who know regarding some of the Companions <p> Imam ' Ali ( A.S. ) said , describing those companions who are seen as among the earliest companions : " When I finally accepted the matter of leadership , one group broke their pledge ; the other deviated and others missed the truth as if they did not hear Allah 's words when He said : " That is the abode of the hereafter that we have created for those who do not strive to exalt themselves in the earth nor to create mischief . The best outcome is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they heard and perceived it 's meaning but alas ! the world seemed glittering in their eyes and it 's embellishments seduced them " ... ( Nahj al-Balagha , p. 90 ) . <p> And he ( A.S. ) also said about them : " They chose Satan as their master in their affairs , and he made them partners . He has laid eggs and hatched them in their bosoms . He creeps and crawls in their laps , he sees through their eyes and speaks through their tongues . He has led them to sins and adorned for them what is foul , like the action of one whom Satan has made a partner in his authority and speaks falsehood through his tongue ( Nahj al-Balagha page 96 ) . <p> He said regarding ' Amr b. al-'As , the famous companion : " How strange it is with the son of Nabigha .. he has uttered falsehood and sinned with his tongue . Is not the worst of speech , lies ? When he speaks , he lies ; when he promises , he breaks it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is asked for something , he is miserly . He betrays his pledge , and he ignores kinship ... " ( Nahj al-Balagha , page 200 ) . <p> The Prophet of Allah said : " The signs of a hypocrite are three : When he speaks , he lies ; when he promises he breaks it ; when he is entrusted with something , he betrays " . All these vices , and even more than these were present in ' Amr b. al-'As . <p> He said , in praise of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and in criticism of ' Uthman and those with him who had banished him to Rabdha , and exiled him till he died alone : " O Abu Dharr , You were angry for Allah 's sake , so place your hopes in Him for whom you were angry . The people were afraid of you for their world , and you feared them for your religion . So leave in their hands that , due to which , they were afraid of you , and flee with that , due to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have denied them and how little you need what they have denied you . Tomorrow you will know who has profited and you will know the envious ones . Were the skies and the earth a burden for a servant and were he to fear Allah , then Allah would remove his burden . So love nothing but the truth and hate nothing but lies . Had you accepted their world , they would have loved you , had you appropriated to yourself some part of it , they would have given you asylum " ( Nahj al-Balagha , page 299 ) . <p> Regarding al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas , who was also a prominent companion , he ( A.S. ) said : " O son of the accursed one ! O tree which has neither root nor branch . By Allah , He will not assist whoever you help and whoever you raise will not stand straight . Go away from us . May Allah distance you from your purpose . Do what you like , and may His mercy be withheld from you if you remain alone " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.S. ) said of Talha and al-Zubayr , the two famous companions who waged war against him after having sworn their oaths of allegiance to him , then they breached it : " By Allah , they did not find any evil in me , they did not do justice between me and them . They are demanding a right which they abandoned and blood which they spilled " . This is a rebellious group which contains the near one ( Zubayr ) , the scorpion 's venom and doubts which cast veils . The matter is clear and falsehood has been shaken from it 's foundation , and it 's tongue has stopped uttering mischief . <p> You hurried to me shouting allegiance ! allegiance ! like she camels having delivered newly born young ones , leaping towards their young . I held back my hand but you pulled it towards yourself . I drew back my hand but you dragged it . O Allah , these two have severed all bonds of friendship and wronged me ! They broke their oaths and instigated the people against me . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfasten what they have tied , and do not make strong what they have woven . Show them the evil of what they aimed and acted upon . Before the battle , I gave them a chance to correct their deed and treated them with respect but they belittled the blessing and refused the safety " ( Nahj al-Balagha , p. 306 ) . <p> In a letter to them , he said : " O two respected Shaykhs ! Revert from your present position for the worst that can befall you now is shame . Later , both shame and hell fire will be combined against you . Peace " ( Nahj al-Balagha , p. 626 ) . <p> Regarding Marwan b. al-Hakam , who had been taken as captive at the battle of the Camel , then set free . He was amongst those who had given a pledge and then broke the pledge : " No need have I for his pledge for it is the palm of a Jew . If he swears with his hand , he will violate it after a short while . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nose , he is the father of four rams who will also rule . The people will face hard days through him and his sons " ( Nahj al-Balagha , p. 176 ) . <p> He said of those companions who journeyed with ' A'isha to Basra in the battle of the Camel , amongst them were Talha and Zubayr : " They came out dragging the wife of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) just as a maid slave is dragged for sale . They took her to Basra where they put their women in their houses but exposed the wife of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) to themselves and to others in the army in which there was not a single person who had not offered me his obedience and sworn to me allegiance willingly , without being forced . They approached my officers and treasurers of the public treasury and its other inhabitants . They killed some of them in prison and others by treachery . By Allah , even if they had killed willfully a single Muslim without any fault , it would have been lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were present in it but did not disagree with it nor prevented it by tongue or hand , not to say that they killed Muslims of a number equal to that with which had marched on them " ( Nahj al-Balagha , page 370 ) . <p> His words regarding ' A'isha and the companions who followed her at the battle of the Camel : " You were the soldiers of a woman and the followers of an animal . The animal snorted and you responded , and when it was killed you fled .

##954952 <p> As discussed , the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a permit no criticism or condemnation of any of his companions and maintain the belief in their collective uprightness . If any free thinker writes about them and undertakes to criticize the deeds of some companions , they defame him ; in fact , they deem him to be an unbeliever even if he is amongst their own scholars . This is what has happened to some of the free thinking Egyptian and non-Egyptian scholars like Shaykh Mahmud Abu Rayya , author of " The Lights on the sunna of Muhammad " and " Shaykh al-Muzayra " , and like Qadi Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Antaki , author of " Why I chose the school of ahl al-bayt " , and like Sayyid Muhammad b . ' Aqil who composed the book " The complete advice for he who befriends Mu'awiya " . Indeed , some Egyptian writers labelled Shaykh Mahmud Shaltut , grand Shaykh of the University of Azhar , an infidel when he issued the ruling that it was permissible to worship according to the Ja'fari madhab . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egyptian schools , is despised for merely recognizing the Shi'i school which is traced to the teacher of the scholars , Ja'far al-Sadiq ( A.S. ) ; then what do you think they would do to one who chooses to follow this school after research and conviction , and undertakes to criticize the madhab he used to follow , having inherited it from his fathers and forefathers ? This is what the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a will not permit , for they consider it as heresy in religion and going out of the fold of Islam ; as though Islam is , in their reckoning , the four madhabs and everything else is false . These are petrified and stagnant minds resembling those minds which the Qur'an talks of , and that which the Prophet 's ( P ) call encountered . It defied him intensely , for he invited them to monotheism and abandoning the numerous gods . The most High says : " And they wonder when a warner comes to them from amongst themselves , and the unbelievers say : " This is a lying sorcerer , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprising thing " ( 38:5 ) . <p> I am safe from the malicious attacks that will be directed against me from those zealous persons who have kept themselves in authority over others . To them , no one has the right to oppose their writings even if his writings do not take anything away from Islam . Otherwise , how could one who criticizes some of the companions be judged to have gone out of the fold of Islam and become a disbeliever when the foundations and branches of religion does not have anything to do with that ? <p> Some fanatics were propagating amongst themselves that my book " Then I was Guided " is like Salman Rushdie 's work , in order to prevent people from reading it and so as to encourage them to curse the book . <p> This is a plot , forgery and great slander which the Lord of the Worlds will account for . How can they compare " Then I was Guided " which calls to the belief in the infallibility of the Messenger ( P ) , his being beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ahl al-bayt from whom Allah has removed all filth and purified completely , with " The Satanic Verses " in which its accursed writer reviles Islam and the Prophet of Islam ( P ) and considers Islam is due to the inspiration of the devils ? <p> Allah says : " O you who believe ! Stand firmly for justice and bear witness for Allah , even if it be against yourselves " ( 4:135 ) . <p> Due to this noble verse , I care not except for the pleasure of Allah , Glorified and Exalted be He , and I fear no criticism as long as I am defending the correct Islam and distancing its noble Prophet from every error , even if that is at the expense of criticizing some close companions , even if they were among " the rightly guided Caliphs " , because the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) is more worthy of distancing from error than any mortal . <p> The unbiased , perceptive reader will understand from all my works what is my desired goal for the issue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the Prophet of Allah ( P ) and his infallibility , and to defend him against the misconceptions which the Umayyads and the ' Abbasids cultivated about Islam and the Prophet of Islam during the early centuries when they ruled the Muslims with tyranny and force , changing Allah 's religion according to what worldly goals , base politics and evil desires dictated . <p> Their major plots have influenced a large segment of Muslims who followed them out of good intentions towards them and accepted all the distortions and lies they narrated , assuming them to be true and to be a part of Islam ; and that it was obligatory on every Muslim to follow them , not to question them . <p> Were the Muslims to know the truth of the matter , they would not accord any importance to them or to their narrations . Had history narrated to us that the companions obeyed the commands and prohibitions of the Prophet of Allah ( P ) and had not argued with him or opposed his judgments , and that they did not disobey him in numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have judged all of them to be upright and we would have had no such scope for discussion or speech against them . However , amongst them were liars , hypocrites and corrupt ones , according to the Qur'anic text and the authenticated correct sunna . <p> They disagreed with each other in his presence and disobeyed him in the matter of writing the testament to the point that they accused him of hallucination and prevented him from writing . They did not to follow his commands when he appointed Usama over them . They differed on his Caliphate to the extent that they neglected his washing , preparation and burial arguing , instead , about the Caliphate . Some of them were happy about it and others rejected it . Indeed , they differed on everything after him until they accused each other of disbelief , cursed each other , fought and killed each other , and dissociated from each other . Due to this Allah 's one religion split into different sects with divergent views . <p> Given this situation , it is necessary , therefore , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and most desirable of nations created for man to decay ; it became the lowest , most ignorant and debased nation on the face of the earth , it 's respect destroyed , sanctity defiled and its people colonized , banished and evicted from their lands ; they could not defend themselves against the transgressors nor could they remove the shame on it 's face . <p> The sole cure for this difficulty , as I see it , is self criticism . Let us forget the praising of our forebears , our false glories which have evaporated and have become ruined museums , empty even of visitors . The reality calls upon us to examine the reasons for our maladies , our remaining behind , our fragmentation and our failures , until we discover the disease and identify a beneficial cure for our well being ; before it overcomes us and affects the last one of us . This is the desired goal , Allah is the only one worthy of worship ; He is the guide of his servants to the right path . <p> And as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no value to the opposition of those fanatics who know nothing except insults and slander in their arguments for defending the companions . We will neither rebuke nor hate them after observing their situation , for they are deprived , misguided by their good intention for the companions . This has prevented them from arriving at the truth . They are like the children of the Jews and Christians who have trust in their fathers and grandfathers and do not impose upon themselves the task of research in Islam ; relying , instead , on the utterances of their predecessors , that Muhammad was a liar and that he was not a Prophet . Allah says : " The people of the book went astray only after clear signs came to them " ( 98:3 ) . <p> With the passing of successive centuries , it has become difficult for a Muslim today to convince a Jew or a Christian of the Islamic creed , what if someone tells them that the Bible and Torah in circulation are forgeries and proves that by the Qur'an , will this Muslim find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim who believes in the uprightness of every companion and is zealous about it with no proof . Is it possible for anyone to convince him otherwise ? <p> If they are not able to find fault and criticize Mu'awiya and his son Yazid , and there are numerous others like them who distorted Islam by their evil deeds - what if they are told about Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman , the truthful one , the distinguisher , and one whom the angels are shy of ? Or of ' A'isha , mother of the believers , wife of the Prophet ( P ) , daughter of Abu Bakr , whom we have discussed in the preceding chapter of how the reliable authors of the Sihah works , according to the ahl al-sunna , have narrated from her ? Now we have reached the stage of the role of the three Caliphs . Let us discover some of their deeds which the Sunni Sahih and Musnad and reliable historical works have recorded against them , so that we can illustrate firstly that the concept of collective uprightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing even from some close companions . <p> Secondly , we will illustrate for our ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a brothers that these criticisms do not amount to insults or slander or denigration , rather , they are means of removing the veils so as to reach the truth , and that they are not inventions or lies of the Rafidis , as most people claim . On the contrary , they are narrations from books that have been judged to be correct and they have obligated themselves to accept it . <p> Abu Bakr during the life of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) <p> In volume 6 page 46 of his Sahih , in " The Chapter on the Interpretation of Sura al-Hujurat of the Qur'an " , al-Bukhari relates that Nafi ' b . ' Umar reported from Ibn Abi Malika that " The two pious ones , i.e. , Abu Bakr and ' Umar ( R. ) were very nearly destroyed , for they raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W ) when the delegation from Banu Tamim came to him ; one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of Banu Majasha , and the other recognized another person . Nafi ' said : ' I do n't remember his name ' whereupon Abu Bakr said to ' Umar : ' You only wish to contradict me ' . He replied : ' I did not wish to contradict you ' . And their voices rose in argument over that matter , and Allah revealed : ' O you who believe , do not raise your voices ... ' . Ibn Zubayr later said : ' After this , ' Umar 's voice was not heard by the Prophet to the extent that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had to ask what he had said . And he ' Umar did n't mention the matter about his father , I mean Abu Bakr ' " . <p> Similarly , in volume 8 , page 145 in " The Chapter concerning Adherence to the Qur'an and the Sunna " under the heading of " What is Disliked about getting Embroiled in Argument and Contention " al-Bukhari relates : " Waki ' informed us from Nafi ' b . ' Umar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , Abu Bakr and ' Umar , were nearly destroyed when the delegation of Banu Tamim came to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . One of them pointed to al-Aqra b . Habis al-Tamim al-Hanzali , the brother of Banu Majasha , and the other indicated someone else . Then Abu Bakr said to ' Umar : ' Surely , you only wish to contradict me ' . ' Umar said : ' I did not wish to contradict you ' . And their voices rose in front of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , and the verse was revealed : ' O you who believe , do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet nor address him the way you do each other lest your deeds be in vain and you perceive not . Those that lower their voices in the presence of the Prophet , they are those whose hearts Allah has tested for piety ; for them is forgiveness and a great reward ' " . <p> Ibn Abi Malika said that Ibn al-Zubayr later said : " Thereafter ' Umar did n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whenever he spoke to the Prophet about something , he would do so in a whisper and could not be heard to the extent that the Prophet had to tell him to speak up " . <p> Similarly , in volume 5 , page 116 in the " Section on Military Campaigns ( the delegation of Banu Tamim ) " al-Bukhari in his Sahih relates from Hisham b . Yusuf , on the authority of Ibn Jurayj , who informed them , on the authority of Ibn Abi Malika , who related that ' Abd Allah b . Zubayr informed them that a delegation from Banu Tamim came to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , and Abu Bakr said : Make the chief al-Qa'Qa'a b . Ma'bad b . Zurara and ' Umar said : " Rather , select al-Aqra b . Habis " . Abu Bakr said : " You do only wish to contradict me " , and ' Umar said : " I did not wish to contradict you " . And they argued until their voices had risen , and the following verse was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put yourselves forward between Allah and his Apostle ... " <p> It is apparent from these narrations that Abu Bakr and ' Umar did not behave in a proper way , i.e. , in accordance with proper Islamic conduct in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and allowed themselves to advance in front of Allah and His Prophet without permission ; nor did the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) ask for their views in appointing anyone from Banu Tamim as a leader ; then , they were not content until they were arguing in his presence and their voices had risen in front of him ( S.A.W. ) with no respect or care for what is customarily decreed by good character and morals , values of which none of the companions could have been ignorant and which they could not have ignored after Allahs Prophet ( S.A.W. ) committed his life to their education and upbringing . <p> Had this event occurred in the early days of Islam , we would have sought to find an excuse for the two shaykhs and would have tried to find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established that the event occurred in the last days of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , since the delegation from Banu Tamim journeyed to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) in 9 A.H. , and he only lived for a few months after that . Every historian and hadith scholar who has mentioned the coming of the delegation to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) has testified to it . In addition , the noble Qur'an also refers to it in one of the last chapters : " When help and victory from Allah comes , and you see people entering Islam in large groups ... " . <p> That being the case , how can the apologists make excuses for the stance of Abu Bakr and ' Umar in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ? If the account was restricted to the position here exemplified by the two companions only , we would not have the scope for wide criticism and objection . However , Allah , who is not shy of the truth , recorded the incident and revealed a Qur'anic verse that followed . It contains rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that , were they to repeat their deed , Allah would negate their good works . Similarly , the narrator of the event began his report with the statement : " The two pious men , Abu Bakr and ' Umar , were almost destroyed ... " . And the narrator of the incident ' Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr , attempted to convince us that ' Umar , after the revelation of this verse concerning him , whenever he spoke to the Prophet ( P ) , he did so in such a low voice that he had to be asked to repeat what he said . <p> In spite of the fact that he did n't mention the equally reproachable conduct on the part of his grandfather Abu Bakr , the historical accounts and the hadith , preserved by the hadith scholars , proves the opposite of it . It suffices to mention the calamity of the Thursday , just three days before the death of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , when we find the very same ' Umar uttering his sinister words : " Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah is enough for us " . The people were differing between themselves , there being those who said : " Draw near to the Prophet so that he may write his behest for you " ; and there were those who were saying what ' Umar said . <p> When the clamor and dissension had increased , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said to them : " Go away from me ; it is not fitting that the argument should occur near me " . It is to be understood from the intensity of the rude talk , clamor , disagreement and contention that they overstepped every limit that Allah had set for them in S ura al-Hujurat , as we have already mentioned . There is no possibility of our being convinced that their disagreement , contention and clamor were done quietly in one anothers ears ; on the contrary , it is to be understood from all this that they raised their voices so loudly that even the women , who were behind the curtain and the veil , participated in the argument , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the letter may be written " . Thereupon ' Umar said to them : " You are indeed the women of Yusuf - if he is ill you squeeze tears from your eyes and if he gets better you ride his neck " . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) then said to him : " Leave them alone , for they are better than you " . <p> Our conclusion from all of this is that they did not carry out Allah 's command : " O you who believe , do not advance before Allah and His Prophet and do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet ... " nor did they respect the position of the Prophet or behave properly when they slandered him with the term hajara ( i.e. hallucinating ) . <p> Even prior to this , Abu Bakr had uttered abhorrent words in the presence of the Apostle ( S.A.W. ) when he said to ' Urwa b . Mas'ud : " Go lick the clitoris of al-Ab " . Regarding this expression , al-Qastalin , a commentator on al-Bukhari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " is one of the crudest insults among the Arabs ... " If such expressions were being uttered in the presence of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , what then is the meaning of " and do not raise your voices over his as you do with each other ? " <p> The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) was of exalted character ( as his Lord described him ) and more shy than a virgin in her chambers ( as is reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim ) , for both have clearly reported that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) was neither corrupt nor obscene , and used to say : " The best among you is the one possessing the most upright character " ; then how is it that the close companions were not influenced by his exalted character ? <p> I would add to all this that Abu Bakr did not carry out the command of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) when he appointed Usama b . Zayd over him and made him one of his soldiers , and severely rebuked those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever stays behind from the army of Usama " . This was after he had received the news about people defaming him on the matter of appointing Usama as the leader , an incident reported by most of the historians and biographers . <p> Similarly , he hurried to Saqifa and participated in the elimination of ' Ali b . Abu Talib from the Caliphate , and left the body of Allah 's Apostle ( S.A.W. ) a covered corpse , may my father and mother be sacrificed for him . He did not concern himself with bathing , or enshrouding , or preparing him for burial , or burying him ; busying himself , instead , with the position of the Caliphate and leadership for which he extended his neck . Where then was the close companionship , the alleged friendship and good character ? I am astonished at the attitude of these companions towards their Prophet , who devoted his life to their guidance , nourishment and advise , these companions to whom the Qur'an advised ; " What befalls you concerns him , he is watching you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , we see them leaving him as a stiffening corpse , and hurrying instead to Saqifa to appoint one among themselves as Caliph ! Today , we live in the twentieth century which we claim is the most wretched one , wherein morals have vanished and values have evaporated ; yet , in spite of all this , if a neighbour amongst the Muslims dies , they rush to him and busy themselves until they bury him in his grave , in accordance with the saying of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) : " Honoring the dead means burying him " . <p> ' Ali b . Abi Talib , the Commander of the Faithful , disclosed these events when he said : " By God , Ibn Abi Qahafa put the shirt of Caliphate on himself while he surely knew that my position vis a vis the Caliphate was like the position of a pivot to a grinding mill " . After this , Abu Bakr allowed the attack upon the house of Fatima al-Zahra , and threatened to burn it unless those who dissented from pledging allegiance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned in their books and narrators have transmitted it generation after generation . We are not going to mention it here , whoever wants to know more should read the historical books . <p> Abu Bakr after the death of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , His denial of the truthful and pure Fatima al-Zahra and his usurpation of her rights <p> In volume 5 , page 82 in " The Book of Military Campaigns " in " The Chapter of the Conquest of Khaybar " , on the authority of ' Urwa , from ' A'isha , al-Bukhari reports that Fatima ( A.S. ) , the daughter of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , sent someone to Abu Bakr asking for her inheritance from what Allah 's Apostle had left behind . This included the fay property bestowed on him by Allah , i.e. , booty gained without fighting in Medina and Fadak , and from what remained of the khumus booty from the battle of Khaybar . On that , Abu Bakr said : " Allah 's Apostle said : ' Our property is not inherited . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad can eat of this property ' . By Allah , I will not make any change in the state of the sadaqa of Allah 's Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allah 's Apostle , and will dispose of it as he used to do " . So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima . So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him , and did not speak to him till she died . She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet . When she died , her husband , ' Ali , buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr . When Fatima was alive , the people used to respect ' Ali much , but after her death , ' Ali noticed a change in the people 's attitude towards him . So ' Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him the oath of allegiance . ' Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those six months ... " . <p> Muslim reports in volume 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the Chapter " We do not leave Inheritance , but whatever we leave is Sadaqa " on the authority of ' A'isha , the mother of the believers ( R ) , that Fatima ( A.S. ) , the daughter of Allahs Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , asked Abu Bakr al-Siddiq , after the Prophets death to apportion to her the inheritance from what the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had left from his share of the spoils of war . Thereupon Abu Bakr said to her : " The Prophet of Allah said : ' We do not leave inheritance . What we leave is charity ' " . Then Fatima , daughter of the Prophet of God ( S.A.W. ) , became angry with him and avoided him , continuing thus until she died ; she lived for six months after the Prophet 's death . ' A'isha said : " Fatima used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from what the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) left behind of his share of Khaybar and Fadak , and from his sadaqa in Medina . Abu Bakr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing which the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) used to do , I will also do it . This is because I fear that , should I depart from what he commanded , I would go astray ' . As for the Prophets sadaqa of Medina , ' Umar has given it to ' Ali and ' Abbas , and , as for the properties of Khaybar and Fadak , ' Umar withheld them , and said : ' These two are charities from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) his rights fall to his deputies , and their administration is for whosoever is the leader . Thus they are till today ' " . <p> The two Shaykhs ( al-Bukhari and Muslim ) abridged and shortened these reports so that the truth may not be clear to the researchers . For them , this is a familiar art , which they espoused in order to preserve the honor of the first three Caliphs . ( We have a separate treatise concerning the two scholars on this issue , and , God willing , we will present it in the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have reported are sufficient to disclose the truth about Abu Bakr , who refuted the claim of Fatima al-Zahra , which merited her anger upon him and her shunning him unto her death ( A.S. ) , and necessitated her burial at night in secret by her husband ; and , according to her will , Abu Bakr was not being permitted by her to attend . We also learn from these narrations that ' Ali did not pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr for a period of six months , which is the period that Fatima lived after her father and that he was compelled to take this oath when he found that the faces of the people were turning against him , and so he sought to reconcile with Abu Bakr . <p> What al-Bukhari and Muslim altered was Fatimas ( A.S. ) claim that her father , the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , had given her Fadak as a gift during his lifetime ; and it ( Fadak ) was not therefore an inheritance . Even if we were to assume that Prophets do not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P ) , she refuted his claim and opposed him by quoting the text of the Qur'an which states " And Solomon inherited from David " . In any case , Fadak was not covered by this alleged hadith , since it was a gift to her and was in no way a part of inheritance . <p> Consequently , one finds that all historians and scholars of tafsir , as well as of hadith , relate that Fatima ( A.S. ) claimed that Fadak was her property and that Abu Baker refuted her , asking her to provide witnesses to support her claim . She brought ' Ali b . Abi Talib and Umm Ayman , but Abu Bakr did not accept their testimony , considering it insufficient . Ibn Hajar admitted this in his al-Sawaiq al-Muhriqa when he reported that Fatima claimed that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had given her Fadak as a gift but had no witness to her claim except ' Ali and Umm Ayman . Yet their testimony did not meet the stipulated conditions to be considered as sufficient proof . <p> Imam Fakhr al-Din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , Fatima claimed that he had given Fadak as a gift to her , whereupon Abu Bakr said to her : ' You are the dearest of people to me in poverty , and the most beloved in richness , but I can not ascertain the truth of your claim . Therefore , I am not allowed to rule in your favour ' " . Imam al-Razi said : " Umm Ayman testified for her , as did the trustee of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . Abu Bakr then asked her to bring a witness whose testimony could be accepted according to the s hari'a , and there was none " . <p> Fatima 's claim that Fadak had been given to her as a gift from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , and Abu Bakr 's denial of her claim , as well as his rejecting the testimony of ' Ali and Umm Ayman , are well known to the historians . Indeed all of them have mentioned this , from Ibn Taymiyya to the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But al-Bukhari and Muslim abridged the narrations , and reported only Fatima 's request , specifically relating to the inheritance , so that the reader should assume that Fatima 's anger against Abu Bakr was improper , and that Abu Bakr had only acted upon what he had heard from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W ) ; and that she was the wrong-doer , Abu Bakr the victim . All this was to protect Abu Bakr 's honour . There was no consideration to observe honesty in transmission , nor reliability in hadith transmission , a fact which would have exposed the shortcomings of the Caliphs and would have refuted the lies and pretexts composed by the Umayyads and the supporters of the " rightly guided " Caliphate , even though this was at the expense of the Prophet himself ( S.A.W. ) , or his " part " , al-Zahra ( A.S. ) . Because of this , al-Bukhari and Muslim have won the leadership of the hadith scholars among the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a and their books have been regarded as the most authentic books after the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof , and we will , God willing , research the subject in a separate chapter so that we may expose the truth for those who wish to know it . <p> However , we still have enough proof to challenge Muslim and al-Bukhari , who only transmitted a small amount of merits of Fatima al-Zahra ( A.S. ) . There is enough evidence for the conviction of Abu Bakr who knew al-Zahra and her status with Allah and His Prophet ( P ) more than al-Bukhari and Muslim did . Despite this , he refuted her , and did not accept her testimony or that of her husband , of whom the Prophet of Allah said : " ' Ali is with the truth , and the truth is with ' Ali , hovering about him wherever he goes " . Thus , let us compare the testimonies of al-Bukhari and Muslim with what the bearer of the Message ( S.A.W. ) confirmed about the merits of his own flesh and blood , al-Zahra . <p> Fatimas Impeccability according to the Qur'anic Text <p> In his Sahih , volume 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-bayt " Muslim reports that ' A'isha said : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) emerged one morning wearing a cloak of black hair . Al-Hasan came and he covered him with the cloak . Then al-Husayn came , and he joined him . Then Fatima came and he brought her within . Then ' Ali came and he covered him too . Then he recited : ' Allah desires to cleanse you from impurities , O ahl al-bayt , and purify you completely ' . Since Fatima al-Zahra was the only woman in the umma whom Allah had thus cleansed and purified from every sin and disobedience , I wonder who was Abu Bakr to reject her testimony and ask her for witnesses ? <p> Fatima is the leader of all believing women and the leader of the women of the umma <p> Al-Bukhari reported in his collection , volume 7 , in " The Book of Seeking Permission " under the section about " One who confides to his Companion in the Presence of others , and does not inform of the secret of his Companions until he dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that A'isha , the mother of the believers , said : " We , the wives of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , were all together with him , not one of us left , and then Fatima ( A.S. ) came walking along , by Allah , her style was similar to that of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . When he saw her , he welcomed her saying : ' Welcome my daughter ' and then he made her seat on either his right or his left and whispered to her . She began to weep bitterly . When he perceived her sadness , he whispered to her a second time whereupon she laughed . I said to her while I was still with his other wives : ' The Prophet of Allah favored you among us with a secret , and then you wept ' . When the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) left , I asked her : ' What was the secret he told you ' ? Fatima said : ' I can not breach the confidence of the Prophet of Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' I hold you by whatever right I have over you to tell me ' . She said : ' It is allright for me to do so now ' and she informed me : ' When he whispered to me the first time , he informed me : ' Gibra'il used to present the Qur'an once every year to me , and this year he had done so twice . There could be no other reason for this except that my time is near . So fear Allah and be patient . For I am the best of those who should go before for you ' . Then Fatima ( A.S. ) said : ' Then I wept as you saw . And when he saw my grief , he shared a second secret with me . He said : ' O Fatima , are you not happy that you are the leader of the believing women or the leader of the women of this umma ? ' " <p> If Fatima al-Zahra ( A.S. ) , is the leader of the believing women , as is affirmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her claim to Fadak and rejects her testimony , then what testimony is acceptable after this , I wonder ? <p> Fatima al-Zahra is the leader of the Women of Paradise <p> In volume 4 of his collection , al-Bukhari reported in " The Book of the Beginning of Creation " in " The Chapter on The Virtue of Closeness to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) " that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : " Fatima is the leader of the women of paradise " . It necessarily means , therefore , that Fatima is the leader of the women of all the worlds , for the dwellers of paradise are not only from the umma of Muhammad , as is obvious . How then could Abu Bakr , " the truthful one " have repudiated her evidence ? Do n't they allege that he attained the title " al-Siddiq " because he used to believe in everything that his companion Muhammad said to him ? Why did he not believe him regarding what he said of own " part " , al-Zahra ? Or was it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gifts as it pertained to the Caliphate , which was the right of ' Ali , the husband of Fatima ? His denial of Fatima and her husband , who bore witness on her behalf on the question of the gift , was by far the better choice for him because , in so doing , he closed the doors to any further claims she might make . What a monstrous plot this was , nearly enough to make the mountains disappear . <p> Fatima is a part of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , and the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) is angered when she is angered <p> In volume 4 , in " The Book of the Beginning of Creation " under " The Chapter of the Virtues of Fatima ( A.S. ) , the daughter of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) " al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that Abu Walid said that Ibn ' Uyayna reported on the authority of ' Amr b . Dinar on the authority of Ibn Abi Malika , on the authority of al-Miswar b . Mukhrima that the Prophet of Allah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and whoever angers , her angers me " . " Fatima is a part of me , and whatever she detests , I detest and what hurts her , hurts me " . If the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) becomes angry when his part , al-Zahra , gets angry , and suffers for her suffering , it follows therefore that she is preserved from all errors ; otherwise it would not have been permissible for the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) to say something like this . This is because it is permissible to cause suffering and to anger anyone who commits a misdemeanor , regardless of his status , as the Islamic shari'a does not allow leeway for special treatment for ties of kinship , far or near , aristocrat or peon , rich or poor . If the matter is as stated , then who was Abu Bakr to hurt al-Zahra and not heed to her anger ? In fact he angered her until she died ; she was offended and even shunned him , not speaking to him until she passed away , supplicating against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of Ibn Qutayba and other historians . <p> Indeed these are bitter and painful truths which jolt the pillars and shake our faith . The impartial researcher , devoted to the truth and reality , has no alternative but to admit that Abu Bakr wronged al-Zahra and usurped her rights . It was possible for him , as Caliph of the Muslims , to placate her and give her what she claimed . This is because she was truthful as even Allah , the Prophet and all the Muslims , among whom was Abu Bakr , attest to her veracity . But it was politics that overturned everything ; the truthful person became a liar and the liar , a truthful person . <p> Yes , it was a part of a plot instigated to alienate the Prophets family from the position that Allah had chosen for them . It had started with the alienation of ' Ali from the Caliphate , and the wrongful seizure of the gift and inheritance of al-Zahra ; and also the repudiation of her testimony , along with her humiliation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of the Muslims . It ended with the murders of ' Ali , al-Hasan and al-Husayn , and all their children , their wives , were taken as prisoners of war , whilst their supporters and those who loved and followed them were killed . Perhaps these plots continue even till today ; their actions are still being enacted and their fruits are still being reaped . <p> Certainly any free-thinking , unbiased Muslim will know , when he reads the history books and differentiates truth from falsity , that Abu Bakr was the first to wrong the ahl al-bayt . Reading the collections of al-Bukhari and Muslim suffices to expose the truth , if the researcher is truthful in his research . <p> Here we have al-Bukhari as well as Muslim admitting apologetically that Abu Bakr used to believe any ordinary companion who petitioned him . But he denied Fatima , leader of the women of paradise , the one about whom Allah had affirmed His cleansing and His purifying her ; and he ( Abu Bakr ) repudiated the testimonies of ' Ali and Umm Ayman ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is reported in volume 3 of Bukharis Sahih , in " The Book of Testimonies " , in " The Chapter of one Ordered to Fulfill a Promise " , and , likewise , by Muslim in " The Book of Merits " under the heading : " Gods Prophet ( S.A.W. ) was never asked for something and he denied the request and his generous giving " , that Jabir b . ' Abd Allah ( R ) said : " After the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) died , some property came to Abu Bakr from ' Ala b . Hadramiyy , and Abu Bakr said : ' Whoever has given a loan to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , or to whom he had promised anything , let him come to us ' " . Jabir said : " I said : ' The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) promised to give me this and this .. ' and he thrice spread his hands ' " . Jabir said : " And he counted five hundred dinars , then another five hundred and another five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakr why he believed Jabir b . ' Abd Allahs claim that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) had promised to give him this and this and this , and filled his hands three times to the sum of fifteen hundred dinars , without asking him to produce a single corroborating witness ? Was Jabir b . ' Abd Allah more God-fearing and pious than Fatima , leader of the women of all the worlds ? Even more strange than all of the above , is the fact that Abu Bakr repudiated the testimony of her husband ' Ali b . Abi Talib , he whom Allah had cleansed from all impurity and had purified ; he upon whom the invocation of blessings is an obligation for each Muslim , just as he invokes on the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . The Prophet made love for him an act of faith , hatred towards him an act of hypocrisy . <p> Furthermore , al-Bukhari has narrated another incident that gives us a true picture of the oppression on al-Zahra and the ahl al-bayt . From " The Book of the Gift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chapter entitled : " It is not lawful for someone to take back his gift or charity " , al-Bukhari relates in his Sahih that the tribe of Suhayb , which was a client of Ibn Jadh'an , laid claim to two houses and a room that they claimed that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) had given to Suhayb . Marwan said : " Who will testify as witness on your behalf ? " They said : " Ibn ' Umar " . So they called him , and he corroborated their claim that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) gave Suhayb two houses and a room . Marwan based his judgment on Ibn ' Umar 's testimony " . <p> Observe , O Muslim , this behaviour and the judgments that favour some but not others . Is this not oppression and injustice ? If the Caliph of the Muslims could judge in favor of plaintiffs solely on the testimony of Ibn ' Umar , then is it not appropriate for a Muslim to ask himself : " Why were the testimonies of ' Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that the joint testimony of a man and woman is stronger than that of a man only , if we are seeking to fulfill of all the conditions stipulated in the Qur'an regarding the requisite number of witnesses . Or is it that the sons of Suhayb were more trustworthy in their petitions than the daughter of the Prophet ( A.S. ) ? Or was it that ' Abd Allah b . ' Umar was reliable in the eyes of the judges while ' Ali was not ? As for the claim that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) does not bequeath an inheritance , the hadith that Abu Bakr presented ; this was refuted by Fatima al-Zahra , who resorted to the book of Allah , that source of evidence that is never to be rejected , for it has been proven that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : " If a hadith comes to you from me , compare it with the book of Allah , and , if it agrees with the book of Allah , act upon it , and , if it contradicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is no doubt that this hadith was contradicted by numerous verses of the noble Qur'an . Was there any one to ask Abu Bakr and the Muslims at large , why was Abu Bakr 's single testimony accepted in connection with the narration of this hadith , which contradicts other narrations , reason and is against Allah 's book ? And why were the testimonies of Fatima and ' Ali , which were in agreement with other transmissions , with reason , and were not against the book of Allah , rejected ? <p> On top of all this , Abu Bakr , however high his status might be , and whatever his supporters and defenders may relate of his merits , can not attain the station of al-Zahra , the leader of the women of the world , nor the station of ' Ali b . Abi Talib , whom the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) preferred above all the other companions in every field . Let us cite , by way of example , the day when the Prophet of Allah gave the standard and confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and His Prophet and , in turn , Allah and His Prophet loved him . All the companions longed for it , each wishing it to be given to him but he gave it to none but ' Ali . The Prophet of Allah said of him : " Surely , ' Ali is from me , and I am from him , and he is the guardian of every believer after me " . <p> However much the extremists may doubt the authenticity of these hadiths , they will not doubt this ; that the blessings on ' Ali and Fatima is a part of the blessings upon the Prophet ( P ) , and that the prayers of Abu Bakr , ' Umar , ' Uthman , all those given the glad tidings of heaven , and all the companions along with all the Muslims , would not be accepted if they did not invoke therein blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad , whom Allah had cleansed of every impurity and has purified , as is reported in the Sihah books of the ahl al-sunna such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This reached the point that Imam al-Shafi'i said : " His prayer is invalid who does not invoke blessings on you " . <p> If it is permitted to lie and make spurious claims against these members of the Prophets household , then we can say good-bye to Islam , and perdition to the world . If you , however , ask why Abu Bakr 's testimony was deemed admissible and that of the members of the Prophets household was rejected , the answer is that he was the judge ; and it is up to the judge to rule as he sees fit , for the truth is with him in all cases . Thus , the claim of the strong is akin to the claim of the lion , its proof resulting from the fang and the claw . <p> Come with me , O reader , so that the veracity of this statement may be made clear for you . See what contradictions al-Bukhari relates in his Sahih , especially regarding the matter of the inheritance of the Prophet . Al-Bukhari relates that Abu Bakr reported the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not bequeath ; whatever we leave is charity " . This is the hadith that all the Sunnites believe , on which they base their proof for Abu Bakr not responding to Fatima al-Zahra 's demand . <p> What clearly proves that the hadith was invalid , and was not known , is that Fatima claimed her inheritance , and so did the wives of the Prophet , the mothers of the believers , for they petitioned Abu Bakr , seeking their inheritance . This is what al-Bukhari reported and what is used as proof that Prophets leave no inheritance . But al-Bukhari contradicted himself by verifying that ' Umar b. al-Khattab distributed the Prophets inheritance among his wives . For , in " The Book of Deputyship " , in " The Chapter of Sharecropping by Division and the Like " al-Bukhari reports on the authority of Nafi ' from ' Abd Allah b . ' Umar ( R ) , who informed him that the Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaybar to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give his wives one hundred wasaq ( share of the crops ) each , eighty wasaq of dates and twenty wasaq of barley . ( When ' Umar became the Caliph ) he gave the wives of the Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares , or carrying on the previous practice . Some of them chose the land and some chose the wasaq , and ' A'isha chose the land " . <p> This narration clearly demonstrates that Khaybar , from which Fatima claimed her share , was like an inheritance for her from her father . Abu Bakr disallowed her claim on the basis that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) did not bequeath an inheritance . The narration also clearly shows that ' Umar b. al-Khattab divided Khaybar in the days of his Caliphate among the wives of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and gave them the option of owning the land or taking the wasaq ( i.e. share of the crops ) , with ' A'isha choosing the land . If the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) did not bequeath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inherited ? And how is it that Fatima , the daughter , did not inherit ? <p> Give us a legal opinion on this , O you of perception , and for you there will be rewards and blessings . In addition , ' A'isha , the daughter of Abu Bakr , appropriated the house of the Prophet of Allah ( P ) completely and no other wife got what ' A'isha did . She it was who buried her father in that house , and buried ' Umar beside her father , and yet forbade al-Husayn from burying his brother al-Hasan beside his grandfather , which led Ibn ' Abbas to tell her : " You rode a camel , you rode a donkey , and , if you live , you 'll ride an elephant , for the ninth part is from the eighth , and in everything you do what you like " . <p> In any case , I do not wish to prolong this subject , for it must be left for the researchers to refer to the annals of history . Nonetheless , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fatima al-Zahra ( A.S. ) delivered when Abu Bakr and other prominent companions were present , so that who are destroyed are destroyed after clear signs come to them and those who are saved are saved after clear signs come to them . <p> " Did you intentionally discard the book of Allah and hurl it behind your backs ? It says : ' And Solomon inherited David ... ' and it says , regarding the story of Zakariyya : ' Grant me from Thyself an heir who will inherit me and the family of Ya'qub , and make him , O my Lord , one with whom You are well pleased ' . And Allah says : ' Those who are related by birth are to inherit each other in accordance with Allah 's Criterion ' . And Allah says : ' Allah dictates to you regarding your male children , they get the share of two females ' and again : ' It is prescribed for you that , if death approaches , you bequeath property , bequeath it to your parents and your closest kin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pious ' . Did Allah dictate to you a special verse that my father had dismissed ? Or are you more knowledgeable than my father and cousin i.e. , ' Ali regarding the specific and general teachings of the Qur'an ? Or is it that you say people of different faiths can not inherit each other ? What you do is recorded , sealed and waiting for you to stand before it on the day of gathering ! Yes , the best judge is Allah ; the best leader is Muhammad ; and the specified time is the day of resurrection , when all who have lied will be the losers " . <p> Abu Bakr kills the Muslims who refused to pay him the Zakat <p> Both al-Bukhari , in " The Book of Calling the Apostates to Repent " in " The Chapter on Killing those who Refuse to Accept the Obligatory Laws and those Associated with Apostacy " ; and Muslim , in " The Book of Faith " in " The Chapter on the Order to Fight People " , report , on the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died , and Abu Bakr was made his successor , there were some Arabs who turned to disbelief . ' Umar said : ' O Abu Bakr ! How can you fight the people when the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) has said : ' I have been ordered to fight the people until they say : ' There is no God but Allah ' and whoever says this , makes himself and his property inviolable except by legal right , and his reckoning is with Allah ? ' Abu Bakr replied : ' By Allah ! I will fight whoever differentiates between salat and zakat , for zakat is a lawful right upon the property ! By Allah ! Were they to withhold even a single animal that they used to give the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , I will fight them over their withholding it ' . Then ' Umar said : ' By Allah ! I saw then that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr to the cause of fighting , and I realized then that it was correct ' " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umar , who had threatened to burn the house of Fatima , the leader of the women , along with those companions inside it who withheld the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr . If the burning to death of ' Ali , Fatima , al-Hasan , al-Husayn and a party of the best of companions who had refused the pledge was a trivial thing for them , then the killing of those who refused the zakat is just a simple matter . For what is the value of these distant desert tribes , compared to the Prophets family and the virtuous companions ? I would add to it that those who refused to give their pledge perceived that the Caliphate was their right according to the designation of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . Even if we assume that there was no appointment on them , then it was still their right to refuse , to criticize and to voice their views if there was consultation , as they claim . The threat of them being burnt to death is established by overwhelmingly numerous reports . Had ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give their pledge , to prevent the shedding of Muslim blood and to preserve the unity of Islam , there would have been no delay in carrying out the threat of burning them . <p> Yet the controversy subsided and their power grew strong ; and there was no more opposition mentioned after the death of al-Zahra and after ' Alis reconciliation with them . How could they then desist from acting against some tribes that refused to pay the zakat to them ? A refusal based on the argument of waiting until the matters of the Caliphate and what happened after the Prophets death were clarified , the Caliphate being , as ' Umar himself admitted , a sudden decision . <p> It is not strange therefore that Abu Bakr and his government should have undertaken the killing of innocent Muslims and the destruction of their sanctity and the enslavement of their women and progeny . Historians have documented that Abu Bakr sent Khalid b. al-Walid , who burnt to death the tribe of Banu Sulaym . He then sent him then to al-Yamama and to Banu Tamim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them while in captivity . He killed Malik b . Nuwayra , an eminent companion whom the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) had entrusted with charity money of his people , having confidence in him . He Khalid then slept with Maliks wife on the same night of her husband 's murder . There is no strength and no power except with Allah , the Highest most Powerful . <p> Malik and his people were guilty of nothing by way of opposition except that they had heard of what had transpired after the death of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ; the alienation of ' Ali and the oppression of al-Zahra , to the extent that she died still angry at them . Similarly , they heard the opposition of the chief of the Ansar , Sa 'd b . ' Ubada , and his breaking of the oath , as well as the reports , which the desert tribes had circulated , casting doubt on the validity of the pledge to Abu Bakr . Due to all this , Malik and his people hesitated giving the zakat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be killed ; their women and children taken as prisoners of war ; their sanctity be defiled and they be subdued , so that the views of the dissidents and the arguments on the Caliphate may not spread to the rest of the Arabs . <p> Most unfortunately , you will find those who defend Abu Bakr and his government justifying his errors , despite the fact that Abu Bakr himself admitted them . They say what ' Umar did : " By Allah , I perceived that Allah had opened Abu Bakrs heart to fighting and I realized then that it was right " . <p> Can we ask ' Umar the secret of his conviction concerning fighting the Muslims , about whom he himself had said that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) had forbidden fighting as they had professed the declaration " there is no God but Allah ? " Indeed , ' Umar himself had opposed Abu Bakr with this hadith . How then did he suddenly change his stance and convince himself about fighting them and know that it was the right thing simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How did this operation of expanding his heart occur ? And how did ' Umar alone perceive it , to the exclusion of everyone else ? <p> If this " opening of the heart was figurative rather than literal , how would Allah open the hearts of a people to what would make them oppose His rules , which He had dictated through the tongue of His Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ? How could Allah have said to His servants , through His Prophet : " Whosoever says : ' There is no God but God ' you are forbidden to kill him , for his accounting lies with me " , then He opens the heart of Abu Bakr and ' Umar to fighting them ? Did revelation descend upon the two of them after Muhammad ( P ) ? Or was it personal judgment , ( ijtihad ) dictated by political reasons , which discarded the laws of Allah ? <p> As for those apologists who claim that they had reverted from Islam and that it was therefore obligatory to kill them , this allegation is not correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who withheld the zakat had not reverted from Islam . How could they have done so when they prayed with Khalid and his forces when he came to destroy them ? Furthermore , Abu Bakr himself nullified this spurious claim by paying blood money for Malik from the state treasury and apologized for his death . No apology is needed for the killing of an apostate , nor is any blood money paid from the state treasury . None of the righteous predecessors ever said that those who withheld the zakat had reverted from Islam , except in the later periods when there sprang up different schools of thought ( madhahib ) and sects . The ahl al-sunna then tried their utmost , though unsuccessfully , to justify the actions of Abu Bakr , and found it necessary to formulate the charge of apostasy against them ; for they knew that abusing Muslims was wicked and that killing them was tantamount to disbelief . This is what has been reported in the Sahih literature of the ahl al-Sunna , and even when al-Bukhari reported the account of Abu Bakr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight whoever differentiates between salat and zakat ... " he gave the chapter the title , " Whosoever refuses to accept the obligatory commandments , and what is attributed to them with charges of apostasy " ; this is clear proof that he did not himself believe in the charge of their apostasy ( as is obvious ) . <p> Yet , others have attempted explanations of the hadith , as did Abu Bakr , that zakat is a right upon property . It is an interpretation taken out of its rightful context . <p> Firstly : Because the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) forbade the killing of whoever said " la ilaha illa Allah " ; there are several narrations on this , verified by the Sihah , as we will show presently . <p> Secondly : If zakat were a right on property , then the hadith allows , in this instance , for the judge to take the zakat by force from those who refuse it , without killing them or the spilling their blood . <p> Thirdly : If this explanation were correct , the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who refused to give the zakat to him . ( The story is well known , and there is no need to repeat it ) . <p> Fourthly : We quote what has been authenticated by the Sihah regarding the prohibition of killing whoever says " la ilaha illa Allah . " I shall restrict myself to al-Bukhari and Muslim and to some traditions , for the sake of brevity . <p> Muslim , in " The Book of Faith " in " The Chapter of Prohibition on the Killing of a Kafir after he says " la ilaha illa Allah " , and al-Bukhari , in " The Book of Military Expeditions " relates : " Khalifa informed me , on the authority of Miqdad b. al-Aswad , that he said to the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) : ' What do you think , if I were to meet a man from the disbelievers , and we were to fight , and if he struck one of my hands with his sword and severed it , then fled from me to the shelter of a tree , beseeching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I , O Prophet of Allah , kill him after he has said this ? ' The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Do not kill him ' . So he said : ' But , O Prophet of Allah , he cut off one of my hands , then he said it after severing it ' . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Do not kill him . Were you to kill him , he would be in your position before you killed him , and you would be in his position before he had uttered those words ' " . <p> This hadith shows us that it is forbidden to kill the kafir who professes " There is no God but Allah " , even after his attack upon a Muslim and his cutting of his hand . There is no question here of the acceptance of Muhammad as a Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , nor of the obligatory prayer , zakat , fast of Ramadan , or pilgrimage . Where , then , do you go and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahih in " The Book of Military Campaigns " in the chapter entitled : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) sent Usama b . Zayd to al-Haraqat from Juhayna " , and Muslim in " The Book of Faith " in " The Chapter on the Prohibition of the killing of a kafir after he has said ' There is no God but Allah ' " , on the authority of Usama b . Zayd , who said : " The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) sent us to al-Haraqat and we arrived there at dawn and attacked them ; I and an Ansari were in combat with one of their men . After we defeated him , he said : ' There is no God but Allah ' ; the Ansari turned away from him , but I struck him with my spear until I killed him . When we returned , he informed the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) who said : ' O Usama , did you slay him after he said : ' There is no God but Allah ? ' I said : ' He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) kept on repeating this until I wished I had not accepted Islam prior to that day " . <p> This hadith proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is forbidden to kill whoever says " There is no God but Allah " . Because of this , we observe the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) severely rebuking Usama until the latter wished he had not accepted Islam prior to that day , acting in accordance with the hadith " Islam cleans whatever was done before it " ; and he yearned for Allah 's forgiveness for that grave sin . <p> Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih in " The Book of Clothing " in " The Chapter On White Clothes " ; and Muslim narrated in " The Book of Faith " in " The Chapter on Whoever Dies not associating anything with Allah will enter heaven " that Abu Dharr al-Ghifari ( R ) said : " I came to the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and he was clothed in a white outfit and was asleep . I came again and this time he was awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no God but Allah ' and then dies in this state , enters paradise ' . I said : ' Even if he fornicates and steals ? ' He said : ' Yes , even if he fornicates and steals ' . I said : ' Even if he fornicates and steals ? ' He said : ' Yes , even if he fornicates and steals ' . I said : ' Even if he fornicates and steals ? ' He said : ' Yes even if he fornicates and steals , despite what Abu Dharr feels ' " . <p> Whenever he used to relate the hadith , Abu Dharr used to say : " Despite what Abu Dharr feels " . This is another hadith which confirms admission to paradise for anyone who says : " There is no God but Allah " and then dies in that state , killing him is forbidden . This is in spite of what Abu Bakr or ' Umar and all their helpers , who interpreted away the realities and turned them upside down , so as to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulings of Allah , might have felt . <p> Most certainly Abu Bakr and ' Umar knew these rulings for they were closer than we are to grasping the rulings , and closer than others to the bearer of the message . However , for the sake of the Caliphate , they reinterpreted the bulk of the rulings of Allah and His Prophet ( P ) , even though they had knowledge and proofs . <p> Perhaps , when Abu Bakr resolved to fight those who withheld the zakat , and ' Umar opposed him with the Prophetic hadith forbidding that , he ( Abu Bakr ) convinced his companion that it was he ( ' Umar ) who had carried the firewood to burn the house of Fatima by himself , and that the least that could be said for Fatima was that she used to testify , " there is no God but Allah " . He perhaps also persuaded him that ' Ali and Fatima were still of high standing in the capital city of the Caliphate whereas the tribes withholding the zakat , if they were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have a major influence on the centre of the Caliphate . With that , ' Umar perceived that Allah " had opened Abu Bakr 's heart " to fighting such tribes and admitted that he was right . <p> Abu Bakr prevents the writing of the Prophet 's sunna as did ' Umar b. al-Khattab and ' Uthman b . ' Affan after him <p> Whenever the researcher dwells into the history books and acquaints himself with the inner workings of the governments of the three Caliphs , he realizes with absolute certitude that they were the ones who forbade the writing and recording of the noble Prophetic hadiths . Indeed , they even prevented people from talking about the hadith and transmitting it to the people , for they undoubtedly knew that it would not serve their interests or , at the very least , that the hadith would oppose and contradict a lot of their verdicts ; and what they had interpreted was based on their reasoning and according to what their interests dictated . The hadith of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) is the second source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes clear the primary source , the noble Qur'an , and this was left forsaken and forbidden during their reign . For this reason , the hadith scholars and historians agree that the collection and recording of the hadith started during the time of ' Umar b . ' Abd al-'Aziz ( R ) or even a little later on . Al-Bukhari reported in " The Book of Knowledge " in " The Chapter on How Knowledge is Acquired " that ' Umar b . ' Abd al-'Aziz wrote to Abu Bakr b . Hazm and said : " See what there is of the hadith of Allahs Apostle ( S.A.W. ) and commit it to writing . I fear the studies of the sciences while the scholars pass away . Nothing should be accepted but the hadith of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) ; so let them i.e. the learned spread the knowledge and let them sit together so that the one who is ignorant will learn . Knowledge is not destroyed until it becomes a secret " . <p> Yet , after the death of the Prophet ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You relate from the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) hadiths about which you disagree , and those after you will differ over them even more . So do n't relate anything from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and to whosoever asks you regarding them , say : " The book of Allah is between us and you ; therefore , enjoin whatever is halal in it and forbid whatever is haram in it " . <p> By Allah , how surprising is this command of Abu Bakr . Here he is , a few days only after that sad day ( called " The Calamitous Thursday " ) , agreeing exactly with what his companion ' Umar b. al-Khattab had said : " The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) is hallucinating , but the book of Allah is enough for us " . <p> Here is Abu Bakr saying : " Do n't transmit anything from the Prophet . And , to whosoever asks , you say : " The book of Allah is between us ; therefore enjoin whatever is halal in it and forbid whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Allah for his clear admission that they hurled the sunna of their Prophet ( S.A.W. ) behind them , and it became a forgotten thing for them . <p> The question that must now be posed to the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a , i.e. , the people who defend Abu Bakr and ' Umar and reckon them to be the best of creation after the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , is this : <p> If your Sihah books report , as you claim them to do , that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) said : " I am leaving for you two things after me . If you adhere to them you will never go astray ; the book of Allah and my sunna " , and , assuming we accept the authenticity of this tradition , then how is it that the best of your men reject the sunna and did not accord it any weight , rather , they prevented the people from writing or speaking about it ? Did anyone dare ask Abu Bakr from which verse did he deduce the legality of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their women and children as prisoners of war ? <p> For the book of Allah , which is between us and Abu Bakr , states : " And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah thus : ' If you bestow your bounty upon us , we will most certainly spend in charity and we will be righteous ' . Yet , when Allah showered them with His bounty , they became miserly and turned back from their covenant , and were averse to it . So Allah put hypocrisy into their hearts as a result , until the day they will meet Him because they turned back from what they had promised Allah , and because of their lies ..... " ( 9:75-77 ) . This verse , by the consensus of all commentators , was revealed concerning Tha'laba , when he refused to pay the zakat during the lifetime of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . I would add that Tha'laba rejected the zakat and refused to give it to the Prophet ( P ) , as he said it was jizya . Allah , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of this , the Prophet ( P ) did not fight him nor take his property by force , even though he was capable of doing so . In the case of Malik b . Nuwayra and his people , they did not deny that the zakat was an obligatory duty among the injunctions of the religion , but rather , they rejected the one who had usurped the Caliphate after the Prophet , having done so by force , oppression and manipulation of opportunity . <p> The position that Abu Bakr took became even stranger and more astonishing when he discarded the book of Allah behind his back , even though Fatima al-Zahra , the leader of the women of the world , argued against him by it , citing to his audience unambiguous clear verses from the book of Allah which confirmed the inheritance of the Prophets . He did not accept it ; he nullified it completely with a hadith which he brought forth to serve his personal need . If he truly said : " You relate from the Prophet of Allah hadith about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will differ even more over them . So do not relate anything from the Prophet 's hadith . And to anyone who asks you about it , say : ' The Book of Allah is between us , so enjoin what is halal therein , and forbid what is haram therein .... ' " , then why did Abu Bakr not do as he preached , when he argued with the truthful , purified one , who was a part of the chosen Messenger ( S.A.W. ) , regarding the h adith of the Prophet : " We Prophets do not bequeath ... " ? Why did he not judge with her according to the book of Allah , enjoining its halal therein and forbidding its haram ? " The answer is obvious : in this instance , he would have found the book of Allah against him , and Fatima would have triumphed in all her claims over him . If she were to have triumphed against him on that day , she would have later argued on the appointment to the Caliphate for her cousin , ' Ali . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Allah says regarding these matters : " O You who believe ! Why do you preach that which you do not practice ? Grievous indeed is it with Allah that you preach what you do not do " . <p> Due to all this , Abu Bakr could not be comfortable if the hadiths of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) were circulating among the people and committed to writing , to memory , to transmission from town to town , village to other villages ; when those hadith were manifest texts that opposed the politics upon which his state was built . There remained no solution for him therefore but to wipe away and conceal the hadiths , indeed , to obliterate and burn them . His own daughter , ' A'isha , testified against him . She reported : " My father collected the hadith of the Prophet , and they were five hundred in number . He spent the night being undecided about them . I said that he was undecided because of a complaint or something that had reached him . In the morning he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadiths that are with you ' . I gave them to him , and he burnt them ... " . <p> ' Umar b. al-Khattab was more severe than his companion on the traditions of the Prophet of Allah and forbade the people from transmitting them <p> We saw the politics of Abu Bakr in preventing the preservation of hadith to the extent that he burnt all the hadiths that had been collected in his time , all five hundred of them so that they would not spread to the companions and other Muslims who were thirsty to know the sunna of their Prophet ( P ) . When ' Umar ascended to the Caliphate , according to Abu Bakr 's will , he pursued the same type of politics , though in his own well known severe and harsh manner . He did not limit himself to the forbidding and prevention of the transmission and recording of the hadith ; but rather , he intimidated and threatened and beat and even imposed house arrest . <p> In volume one of his Sunan in " The Chapter on being Honest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qarza b . Ka'b : " ' Umar b. al-Khattab sent us to Kufa and accompanied us , walking with us to the mountain passes . He said : ' Do you know why I have walked with you ? ' Qarza said : ' We said : ' For the right of companionship of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , and for the right of the Ansar ' . ' Umar said : " Rather , I did so for something I wish to tell you , and I hope you will remember it as I have walked with you . You will come upon people in whose hearts the Qur'an is vibrating like the vibration of a kettle . When they see you , they will stretch their necks in awe and say : ' These are the companions of Muhammad ' . So reduce the traditions from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , and I will support you ' " . And when Qarza b . Ka'b later came to them they said : " Relate hadith to us " . He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim related in his Sahih in " The Book of Manners " in " The Chapter on Seeking Permission " that ' Umar threatened to beat Abu Musa al-Ash'ari because of a hadith he reported from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said : " We were sitting with Ubay b . Ka'b when Abu Musa al-Ash'ari came to us , upset . He stopped and said : ' I beseech you by Allah ! Has any of you heard the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) say : ' Permission is to be sought three times . If it is granted , proceed , if not , return ' . Ubay said : ' What about it ? ' Abu Musa said : ' Yesterday I sought permission three times from ' Umar . He did not grant it , so I went away . I came to him today , and when I entered , I informed him that I had come yesterday , greeted him three times and then left . Then ' Umar said : ' We heard you but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking permission until it was granted to you ' " . Abu Musa said : " I sought permission according to what I heard the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) say . He said to me : ' By Allah ! I 'll beat your back and your stomach unless you bring someone to testify to this ' . Ubay b . Ka'b said : ' By Allah , none will go with you except he who is the youngest amongst us ' . Go forth , O Abu Sa'id ' . So I went until I came to ' Umar and I said : ' I have heard the Prophet of Allah say this ' " . <p> Al-Bukhari also reported this incident , but , as is his norm , he abridged and edited from it ' Umar 's threat to beat Abu Musa , in order to protect ' Umar 's honour although Muslim added Ubay 's address to ' Umar : ' O Ibn al-Khattab ! Do not inflict suffering upon the companions of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) ' " . <p> Al-Dhahabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 from Abu Salama who said to Abu Hurayra : " During the time of ' Umar , did you transmit this ? " He replied : " Had I narrated in his time as I narrate to you now , he would have whipped me with his whip " . <p> ' Umar , after forbidding the collection of hadith and threatening the people to beat them , burnt the traditions the companions had collected . He addressed the people one day thus : " O People ! It has come to my knowledge that certain books have appeared in your hands . I wish , by Allah , that I could change and correct them . Let there not remain anyone amongst you with a book except that he gives it to me so that I may check it " . The people assumed that he wished to examine them to correct them on an issue so that there would be no differences in it , and so they brought their books to him whereupon he burnt them in the fire . <p> In his Jami ' Bayan al-'ilm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umar b. al- Khattab wanted to write down the sunna , then it seemed better to him not to do so . So he wrote to the cities ordering that anyone in possession of it must destroy it . <p> In spite of his plan , however , and despite his threats , his proscription , prohibition and his burning of books , some of the companions still persevered in relating what they had heard from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) whenever they met people on their journeys outside of Medina who asked them about the hadith s of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . ' Umar deemed it proper to confine them within Medina , even forcing house arrest on them and undertaking forceful measures . Ibn Ishaq narrated from ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf who said : " ' Umar did not die until after he had summoned all the companions of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) from the farthest places ; ' Abd Allah b . Hudhayfa , Abu Darda ' , Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and ' Uqba b . ' Amir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadiths that you have related in the outlying areas from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) ? ' They said : ' Are you forbidding us to do so ? ' He responded : ' No ! But stay with me . By Allah ! You will not leave me as long as I am alive ' " . <p> And after him came the third Caliph , ' Uthman , who followed the same course as his two predecessors . He ascended the minbar and declared openly : " It is not permissible for anyone to narrate from the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) any hadith that was not heard during the times of Abu Bakr and ' Umar " . <p> In this manner , the restriction continued throughout the rule of the three Caliphs , a period of twenty-five years . If only it had been limited to that period , rather , it continued . When Mu'awiya grabbed the reins of power , he ascended the pulpit and declared : " I forbid you the hadith , except those accepted during the time of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah " . This has been reported by Muslim in volume 3 in " The Book of Zakat " in " The Chapter on the Prohibition of Questioning " . <p> Thereafter , the Umayyad Caliphs adopted this path , forbidding authentic hadiths of the Prophet while specializing in the fabrication of forged and false hadiths against him . It reached to an extent that Muslims of every age have been afflicted by contradictions , myths and legends that do not have any connection whatsoever to Islam . Here is what al-Mada'ini reports in his book , al-Ahdath : " Mu'awiya wrote the same letter to all of his governors after the year of the unity : ' Anyone who reports anything regarding the merits of Abu Turab ( ' Ali b . Abu Talib ) and his family is exempt from my protection ' . The preachers in every place , every minbar then took to cursing ' Ali and dissociating from him , defaming him and his family " . <p> Mu'awiya then wrote to his governors in all the regions : " Do not accept the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . He further went on : " Seek out from among you those who follow ' Uthman and those who love him , as well as his friends and protectors and those who relate his merits and praises . Associate with them , frequent their gatherings , make them close to you and honour them . Write to me anything that each one of them narrates , and give me his name , his father 's name and his progeny " . <p> They did that until the merits and praises of ' Uthman were numerous , all because of the rewards , cloaks , gifts and land grants he sent to them , flowing out to the Arabs and the non-Arab clients . It multiplied in every city and they competed for status and worldly gains . Every man who came to the officials of Mu'awiya was welcomed when he related praises or merits of ' Uthman ; his name was recorded and he was befriended and rewarded . This continued for a while . Then Mu'awiya wrote to his officials : " The hadith in favor of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . When this letter reaches you ask the people for the hadiths regarding the merits of the companions and the first Caliphs . Do not leave any information that any Muslim narrates in favor of Abu Turab , except that you come up with another one that contradicts it from one of the sahaba . This is dearer to me and more of a delight to my eye and more of a refutation to the argument of Abu Turab and his party ( Shi'a ) , and more damaging to them than recounting the good deeds and merits of ' Uthman " . <p> His letters were read to the people and many narrations on the merits of the companions were reported , most of them spurious , there was no truth in them . And the people really exerted themselves in this until they started doing so from the pulpits . The teachers in the learning circles started doing this and taught the children and youths until they began to narrate and learn them as they learnt the Qur'an . They even taught their daughters and wives and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as Allah willed . <p> Then Mu'awiya sent a common letter to his officials in every region : " Seek out one against whom there is proof that he loves ' Ali and his family , and then erase his name from the national register and cut off whatever stipend he is given from the state " . He reinforced this with another letter : " Whosoever you accuse of aiding these people , place him in fetters and demolish his home " . The affliction was most severe and rampant in Iraq especially in Kufa to the extent that , if a Shii was visited by someone whom he trusted , he would bring him to his house and tell him his secrets and thereafter , he would live in fear of his servants and slaves and would not speak until he had taken a severe oath of silence from them . Several spurious and calumnious hadiths surfaced ; and the jurists and judges and those in authority promoted them . The worst perpetrators of this calamity were those who recited the Qur'an to show off to others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals while forging hadith ; so that they could please those in authority and be in their gatherings , thus gaining money , property and positions . This continued until the hadith and the reports fell into the hands of the religionists , who could not allow lies and accusations . Rather , they accepted these hadiths and transmitted them assuming they were authentic , for , had they known they were spurious , they would not have narrated nor acted upon them . <p> I say the responsibility of this falls on Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman who prevented the recording of the true hadiths of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) on the pretext that they were afraid the hadiths would be mixed with the Qur'an . This is what their helpers and defenders maintain . This claim amuses even the lunatics . Are the Qur'an and sunna sugar and salt so that , if they are mixed , they could not be separated from each other ? Even sugar and salt do not mix for each is in a specific container . Did it not dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one special scroll and the sunna of the Prophet in a separate book , as is the situation with us today , and has been since the recording of the traditions from the time of ' Umar b . ' Abd al-'Aziz ( R ) ? Why has the sunna not been mixed with the Qur'an , even though the hadith books exceed hundreds ? Moreover , the Sahih of al-Bukhari is not mixed with that of Muslim , which in turn is not mixed with Ahmad b . Hanbals Musnad nor the Muwatta ' of Malik b . Anas , let alone being mixed with the noble Qur'an . <p> This argument is weak like the house of a spider , it can not stand up to the scrutiny of proof . In fact , the proof against it is even more clear . Al-Zuhri reported on the authority of ' Urwa that ' Umar b. al-Khattab wanted to commit the sunna to writing and sought the counsel of the companions of the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . They advised him to do so ; but ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning arose saying : " I had wanted to write the sunna down then I remembered the people before you that wrote books and chose to follow them , leaving the book of Allah ! And By Allah , I will not mix the book of Allah with anything , ever " . <p> Look , O reader , at this narration . The companions of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) advised ' Umar to write down the sunna and he went against all of them and chose to impose his own view ; claiming that the people before them had written books and had chosen to follow these books to the exclusion of Allah 's Book . Where was the claim of mutual consultation ( shura ) , which the ahl al-Sunna wa'l-Jama'a invoke ? Where are these people who chose to adhere to their books instead of the book of Allah ? <p> We have not heard of them except in ' Umar b. al-Khattab 's imagination . Assuming these people did exist , there is no ground for comparison as they manufactured books from themselves to distort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woe unto those who write the book with their own hands then they say ' This is from Allah ' to gain thereby a small prize . Woe unto them for what they wrote and for what they gained by their deed " ( 2:79 ) . As for books of the sunna , these are not like that , for they originate from the infallible Prophet who did not utter anything from his own desire but , rather , from the revelation that descended upon him . The sunna clarified and explained the book of Allah . The most High stated : " We have sent unto you the reminder , to explain to the people what has been revealed to them " ( 16:44 ) . And the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : " I was given the Qur'an and with it something similar to it " . This is a simple matter for anyone who knows the Qur'an , for there is no mention in it of five prayers , no specified amount for zakat or rules of fasting or hajj and various other rulings which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , Allah said : " What the Prophet has given you accept it ; and from what he has forbidden you , eschew it " . <p> And He says : " Say ! ' If you love Allah , then follow me so that Allah may love you ' " . <p> If only ' Umar knew the book of Allah and paid more attention to it in order to learn from it obedience to the injunctions of the Messenger , and not to argue or refute him . If only he had known the book of Allah and given more attention to it so that he could learn the judgment of al-Kalala which he did not know up to the time he died . During his Caliphate , he issued rulings on it based on various contradictory verdicts . If only he knew the book of Allah and paid more attention to it to learn the rulings of tayammum which he did not know even during the days of his Caliphate . He used to rule that he who does n't find water should not pray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due attention to know the laws of divorce of two utterances , after which one should live with the wife in accordance with proper forms of behaviour or should separate from her with kindness . Instead , he made all three divorces count as one ; and , by following his own view and personal judgment , he opposed Allah 's decrees , discarding them . <p> The truth that can not be denied is that the Caliphs prevented the spread of hadiths . They threatened and exiled whosoever spoke of them . This is because it would have frustrated their plans and exposed their plots and would not have given them any room for interpreting things as they interpreted the Qur'an . This is because Allah 's book is silent and multifaceted , whereas the sunna of the Prophet is comprised of the words and deeds of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , no one can oppose it . Due to this , the Commander of the Faithful , ' Ali ( A.S. ) , said to Ibn ' Abbas when he sent him to debate with the Khawarij : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Qur'an has different interpretations . You will say things and they will say other things ; but debate them by using the sunna , for they will not find any escape from it " . <p> Abu Bakr bestows the Caliphate upon his companion ' Umar and , in doing so , goes against the clear texts <p> On this matter specifically , Imam ' Ali ( A.S. ) said : " By Allah ! Ibn Abi Quhafa has dressed himself with the Caliphate ! Yet he knows that my position to it is like that of a pole in relation to the hand mill ! The current flows from me and even birds can not aspire to my heights . I put a curtain against the Caliphate and detached myself from it . I began to think whether I should fight for my rights with a fettered hand ( i.e. unsupported ) or endure the blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the old would become feeble , the young would become old , and a believer would strive until he met his Lord . <p> I perceived being that patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there was prickling in the eye and suffocation in the throat . <p> I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one passed away ; but he handed the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after him . ( Then ' Ali quoted al-'Asha 's verse : ' My days now pass on the camel 's back ( i.e. , with difficulty ) , while there were days ( of ease ) in the company of Jabir 's brother ) ' . <p> It is surprising that , during his lifetime , he wished to be released of the Caliphate , yet he confirmed it for the other one after his death . How cleverly the two shared it 's udders between themselves . This one put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure with harsh speech and a rough touch . Many errors were made , and so many excuses offered " . <p> Every researcher and examiner knows that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) designated and appointed ' Ali b . Abi Talib to the Caliphate before his death . Most of the sahaba , amongst whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of it also . Because of this , Imam ' Ali used to say : " He knows my position to it is like the pole to the hand mill ... " . Perhaps it was this that caused Abu Bakr and ' Umar to forbid the transmission of hadiths from the Prophet ( P ) , as we have shown in the preceding chapter , adhering only to the Qur'an . The Qur'an , even though it contains the verse of successorship , does not clearly mention the name of ' Ali . The hadiths , however , specifically mention his name ; for example the Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) saying : " Of whomsoever I am the master , this ' Ali is his master " and " ' Ali is to me as Aaron was to Moses " ; and " ' Ali is my brother and successor and the Caliph after me " ; and " ' Ali is from me , and I am from him , and he is the leader of every believer after me " . <p> This helps us understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' Umar took in the proscription and burning of the hadiths of the Prophet ; thereby muzzling the people to the extent that even the companions did not mention the hadiths , as has already been mentioned in the report of Qarza b . Ka'b . This restriction continued for a quarter century , i.e. , the period of the first three Caliphs , until the coming of ' Ali to the Caliphate . Now we see he made the companions bear witness , on the day of assembling , to the hadith of Ghadir Khum , thirty of them bearing witness , seventeen of whom were veterans of Badr . <p> This is manifest proof that these companions , and there were thirty of them , would not have spoken up had the Commander of the Faithful not asked them to do so . Were ' Ali not the Caliph , with power in his hands , they would have remained silent , fearing to bear witness . <p> This had actually happened in the case of some companions in whom fear and jealousy prevented them from bearing witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' b . ' Azib , Zayd b . Arqam , and Jarir b . ' Abd Allah al-Bajli . The claim of ' Ali ( A.S. ) reached them , but he was not allowed to manage the Caliphate in peace . His days were filled with trials , mischief and plots . Wars were waged against him from every side ; and their jealousy and grudges surfaced by his showings at Badr , Hunayn , Khaybar until he fell martyred . Those Prophetic traditions did not find receptive ears among those who broke their pledges , the deviants , those who missed the truth and the opportunists . They indulged in immorality , taking bribes and being fond of the world during the Caliphate of ' Uthman . The son of Abu Talib could not , within three or four years , rectify the corruption and deviation of a quarter century , except by destroying himself , God forbid . ' Ali it was who said : " I know very well what will correct you , but I will not cure you by corrupting myself " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended the Caliphate and continued the same plan that we have already described , i.e. prohibiting all hadiths except those which were prevalent at the time of ' Umar . Indeed , he even went a step further and commissioned a group of the companions and their followers to fabricate traditions . Thus the sunna of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) was lost in the web of their lies , tales and their spurious merits . <p> The Muslims continued thus for a full century during which the sunna of Mu'awiya was followed by the general Muslim public . When we say " the sunna of Mu'awiya " , we mean the sunna that was pleasing to Mu'awiya from the acts of the first three Caliphs Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman ; and also whatever else he and his followers added by way of lies , forgeries , curses and insults against ' Ali and the members of his household , and his followers amongst the sincere companions . This is why I reiterate and repeat that Abu Bakr and ' Umar succeeded in their plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the pretext of referring to the Qur'an . <p> For you can clearly see today , after the passing of fourteen centuries , if you argue by the successively transmitted Prophetic texts which prove that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) appointed ' Ali as his successor , it will be said to you : " Let us leave aside the Prophetic sunna that is differed upon , the book of Allah is sufficient for us ; and the book of Allah did not relate that ' Ali is the successor of the Prophet , but instead said : " Your affairs are by mutual consultation " . This is their argument , every scholar of the ahl al-sunna I talked to , spoke of the shura as their slogan and standard practice . <p> Disregarding the fact that the Caliphate of Abu Bakr was a sudden event , through which Allah shielded the Muslims from evil , it was not done by consultation , as some claim . Rather , it was done by negligence and force , by coercion , intimidation , and beatings . Several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this group were ' Ali b . Abu Talib , Sa 'd b . ' Ubada , ' Ammar , Salman , Miqdad , al-Zubayr , al-'Abbas and many others , as the eminent historians of this event admitted . Nonetheless , let us leave this matter alone and turn towards Abu Bakr 's appointment of ' Umar as successor after him ; and let us ask the ahl al-sunna who brag about the principle of shura : " Why did Abu Bakr appoint ' Umar as his successor and impose it upon the Muslims rather than leaving the matter open for mutual consultation , as you claim " ? <p> For further clarification , as is our custom , we depend only on the books of the ahl al-Sunna , and present to the reader how Abu Bakr appointed his companion as his successor . Ibn Qutayba reported in his History of the Caliphs ( Ta'rikh al-Khulafa ' ) , in " The Chapter of Abu Bakrs illness and his Designation of ' Umar ( R ) as his successor " : " Then he summoned ' Uthman b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . So Abu Bakr dictated and ' Uthman wrote thus : ' In the name of Allah , the Beneficent the Merciful . This is what Abu Bakr b . Quhafa does decide as his last will and testament in this world that he is about to leave , and the first testament to the hereafter that he is about to enter . <p> I appoint ' Umar b. al-Khattab as my successor , if you perceive him as a just man among you , and this is my opinion of him and hope in him . If he distorts and changes , I only wish for your good , and I do not have knowledge of the unseen . And those who do wrong will soon know their fate ' " . <p> He then put his seal upon the document and gave it to ' Uthman . When the news that he had named ' Umar as his successor reached the emigrants and the Ansar , they entered and said : " We see that you have placed ' Umar as the Caliph over us . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are among us , how about when you leave us ? Now you are going to meet Allah , the Most High and Majestic , and He will ask you about it , what will you say ? " Whereupon Abu Bakr replied : " If Allah asks me , I will most certainly say : ' I appointed as Caliph over them he who seemed to me to be the best of them ' " . <p> Some historians , such as al-Tabari and Ibn al-Athir , relate that when Abu Bakr called ' Uthman to write his last testament , he lost consciousness while he was dictating and ' Uthman wrote the name of ' Umar b. al-Khattab . When he regained consciousness , he said : " Read what you have written ! So he read it and mentioned ' Umar 's name . Abu Bakr asked him : " From where did you get this ? " He answered : " You were never wont to oppose him " . Abu Bakr replied : " You are right " . <p> When he finished his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon him . Talha said to him : " What will you say to your Lord tomorrow ? You have chosen a severe , harsh man to govern us . People run away from him and their hearts beat because of him " . Abu Bakr said : " You all helped me , and he was my support . So now support him " . He said to Talha : " Do you try to scare me with Allah ? If I am asked about it tomorrow I will say : ' I selected the best of your people to rule them ' " . <p> Since the historians all agree that Abu Bakr appointed ' Umar as his successor , without having sought the counsel of the companions , we can only say that he did so despite the wishes of the companions who hated ' Umar . Whether it was Ibn Qutayba who reported that the Muhajirun and Ansar entered and said : " You are fully aware of his severity with us " or Tabari who said : " Some companions , Talha among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you say to your Lord now that you have chosen to rule over us a harsh , severe man from whom people run away and because of whom hearts beat faster ? ' " The end result is still the same : that the companions did not decide their affairs by mutual consultation ; and they did not approve the appointment of ' Umar , whom Abu Bakr had imposed upon them without seeking their counsel . The result is that which Imam ' Ali foretold when ' Umar b. al-Khattab treated him so harshly to gain his pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr ; for he said : " He has milked for you milk , half of which will be for you ; so enforce his command today and he will return it to you tomorrow " . <p> This is exactly what one of the companions said to ' Umar b. al-Khattab when he came out with the letter appointing him as the Caliph . He said to ' Umar : " What is in the document , O Abu Hafs ? " ' Umar said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to hear and obey " . Whereupon the man said : " By Allah , I know what is in it . You made him the leader in the first year , and now he has made you the leader " . <p> This clearly proves to us , beyond any doubt , that the principle of shura , which the ahl al-sunna claim as their standard , had no basis for Abu Bakr and ' Umar . In other words , Abu Bakr was the first to destroy and discard the principle , thereby opening the doors for the Umayyad rulers to follow his action , a Caesar-like dynasty , handed down from father to son . After them , the ' Abbasids did likewise ; the idea of shura remained a dream which the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a seek but never actualize . <p> This reminds me of a conversation that took place between a Wahhabi scholar from Saudi Arabia and myself in a Nairobi mosque in Kenya concerning the problem of the Caliphate . I was advancing the view that the Caliphate was according to designation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wished , and that there was no room for people to decide in the matter . He was a proponent of the shura and was defending it strongly . He also had with him several of his students who were studying under him and supporting everything he said , on the pretext that his argument was based on the noble Qur'an , wherein Allah said to His Prophet ( S.A.W. ) : " And seek their counsel in the matter " and also : " Their affairs are to be decided by a shura between them " . <p> I realized that I was overpowered by them , for they had learnt all the Wahhabi ideas from their teacher and also that they would not listen to the true hadiths , but rather , relied on some hadith which they had memorized , most of which were false . I therefore surrendered to the principle of shura and said to them and to their teacher : " Can you convince the government of His Highness , Your King , of the principle of shura , so that he might step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious predecessors ? Thereby giving the Muslims in the Arab peninsula the freedom of choice of their ruler ? I do n't think he will do that , for his father and grandfathers not only ruled the Caliphate , but also the entire Arab peninsula became part of their kingdom . They even called the entire Hijaz ' The Saudi Kingdom ' . Upon that , their leader , the scholar , said : " We have no business with politics ; we are in the house of Allah wherein we are ordered to remember his name and observe the prayers " . I replied : " And also to seek knowledge " . He said : " Yes , it is so and we also teach the youth here " . I said : " And so we are engaging in an academic discussion " . He said : " And you have denigrated it by touching on politics " . <p> I left with my companions ; I felt sad for the Muslim youths whose minds the Wahhabis had so controlled in every way and declared a war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madhhab which , I think , is the closest to that of the Prophets family . The Shaykhs used to have respect and piety from the educated and non educated people alike , since most of them came from notable backgrounds of a pure lineage . Then the Wahhabis came and , taking advantage of their poverty , deluded them with money and other material things and they changed their outlook , i.e. , they convinced them that such respect for the Shaykhs was in fact idolatry because it entailed the veneration of a human being . So the sons turned against their fathers . Regrettably , this is what has happened in many of the Islamic countries in Africa . <p> Let us return to the topic of the death of Abu Bakr . We find him , just before his death , regretting what he had done , for Ibn Qutayba reported in his " History of Caliphate " Abu Bakr 's words : " Yes , by Allah , I regret only three things that I wish I had not done : ( 1 ) " If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another narration , that " I had not violated the house of Fatima even if they had declared war upon me " ; <p> ( 2 ) " If only , on the day of Saqifa at Banu Sa'ida , I had instead pledged to Abu ' Ubayda or ' Umar and that he were the leader and I the minister " ; <p> ( 3 ) " If only , when I came upon Dhi al-Faja'a al-Sulami , while he was a prisoner of war , I had slaughtered him or spared him instead of burning him " . <p> And we add : " If only , O Abu Bakr , you had not oppressed al-Zahra , had not hurt or angered her ; and if only you had repented before her death and had pleased her . This is specifically with regards to the house of ' Ali , which you exposed and allowed to be burnt . <p> Regarding the Caliphate , if only you had left your two companions and cronies , Abu ' Ubayda and ' Umar , and given the pledge to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bearer of the message , that he would be the leader . Then the world today would be different from what we see and Allah 's religion would have spread all over the globe , as Allah had promised and His promise is always true . <p> With respect to al-Faja'a al-Sulami , whom you burnt to death , if only you had not burnt the Prophetic traditions , the hadiths , which you had collected . You would have learnt the correct shari'a rulings from them and would not have resorted to personal judgment by your own views . <p> Lastly , while you were on your death bed , if only you had thought about your appointment of a successor and returned the truth to its owner , he whose position to the Caliphate was like the pole to the millstone . For you were the most aware of his merits , his excellence , his asceticism , his knowledge and his piety ; for he was like the Prophet himself ( S.A.W. ) , especially when he submitted the matter to you and did not rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were free to advise the umma of Muhammad ( S.A.W. ) and to choose for it one who would have corrected its affairs , governed it properly and taken it to the summit of glory . <p> We ask Allah , Glorified and Exalted be He , to forgive your sins , and to placate Fatima and her father , as well as her husband and her sons for your sake . For you angered a part of al-Mustafa , and God gets angry when she is angry and is happy when she is happy . One who hurts Fatima hurts her father according to the text of his hadith ; and , according to Allah 's words , ' Whosoever causes suffering to the Prophet of Allah , for them is a painful punishment ' " . <p> And we seek Allah 's refuge from His anger and we ask Him to be pleased with us and with all the Muslim men and women , the believing men and the believing women . <p> ' Umar b. al-Khattab contravenes the book of Allah with his personal reasoning <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one filled with his ijtihad ( personal reasoning ) as opposed to the clear texts from the noble Qur'an and the noble sunna of the Prophet . The ahl al-sunna use that as pride and virtue , for which they praise him . The objective ones among them seek excuses and far fetched defenses for him , neither reason nor logic can accept them . How can one who opposes the book of God and the sunna of His Prophet be one of those who exercises ijtihad ? Allah says : " It is not proper for any believing man or believing woman , if Allah and His Prophet have decreed a matter , that they should have any option in their matter . And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Prophet has most manifestly gone astray " ( 33:36 ) . <p> And our Glorious Creator also says : " Those who do not judge according to what Allah has revealed , they are unbelievers , and those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed they are indeed wrongdoers ... and those who do not judge by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5:44/45/47 ) . <p> In " The Book of Adherence to the Qur'an and Sunna " in " The Chapter on what is Mentioned regarding Blameworthy Opinions , Strained Analogies , and Acting and Saying about Things of which you have no Knowledge " , al-Bukhari reported that the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : " Allah does not arbitrarily take away knowledge after having bestowed it , but rather , He takes it away with the passing away of the learned and their knowledge , whereupon the people are left in ignorance , seeking and giving religious opinions from their personal ideas . And in so doing , they are led astray and lead others astray " . <p> Similarly , in the same book , al-Bukhari reports in his Sahih in the next chapter : " The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , when asked about something for which a revelation had not come , used to say ' I do n't know ' ; or he did not reply until a revelation came to him , he did not speak based on his own opinion or on analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that which Allah has shown you ' " . The scholars , old and new , have said one thing : " Whoever exercises his personal judgment in the Qur'an has disbelieved " , and this is clear from the unambiguous verses and from the words and deeds of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) . <p> How then can this rule be forgotten whenever the matter pertains to ' Umar b. al-Khattab or any of the companions or one of the Imams of the four madhabs ? Indeed , personal interpretation , even in contravention to the judgments of Allah , gets one reward if it is wrong and two if it is right ! <p> One could well say that this point is agreed upon by both the Shi'as and the Sunnis according to Prophetic hadiths accepted by both . However , I reply that this is true but they differ on the issue of ijtihad . The Shi'a enjoin ijtihad in matters where nothing has come down from Allah or His Prophet ( P ) . As for the ahl al-sunna , they do not restrict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pious predecessors , they do not see any harm in ijtihad even in the face of clear texts . The great scholar , al-Sayyid Sharaf al-Din al-Musawi relates in his book , al-Nas wa'l-Ijtihad , more than 100 instances wherein the companions , especially the three Caliphs , contravened the clear texts of the Qur'an and sunna . The researchers should study this book . <p> Since we are essentially on this subject , it is necessary to mention some of the instances wherein ' Umar went against clear texts , maybe due to his ignorance of the texts , and this would be astonishing ; for he who is ignorant is not fit to judge what is legal and forbidden , from his own volition . Allah says : " Do not say anything false that your tongues may put forth that this is halal and this is haram , so as to ascribe false things to Allah . Those who ascribe false things to Allah will never prosper " ( 16:116 ) . <p> An ignorant person can not take up the position of Caliph and lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to the truth more worthy to be followed or he that can not lead unless he is guided ? What is with you ? How do you judge " ( 10:135 ) ? <p> It is also possible that ' Umar was not ignorant of the texts , he knew them yet relied on ijtihad due to what the circumstances dictated . The ahl al-sunna do not consider this to be kufr or deviation ; just as they assume he must have been ignorant of the presence of one of his contemporaries who knew the correct rulings . This defense is baseless since he knew of Imam ' Ali 's total command of the Qur'an and sunna . Otherwise , he would not have sought ' Ali 's guidance in many dilemmas , so much so that he said : " Were it not for ' Ali , ' Umar would have perished " . Why , I wonder , would Umar then seek ' Ali 's guidance in the matters in which he depended on personal reasoning , which he knew had defects ? <p> I believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of ijtihad that corrupted the creed of Islam as well as its legal rulings , nullified them , and caused dissension among the learned of the umma and their fragmentation into numerous sects and schools of thought . And from this spread dissension and opposition , the failure and disappearance of the Islamic spirit and the material and spiritual backwardness of the umma . <p> We are left to imagine that , even with Abu Bakr and ' Umar in the seat of the Caliphate and the removal of its divinely prescribed person , had the former two collected the Prophetic sunna and preserved it in a special book , they would have done themselves and the umma general good . Then , no extraneous matter would have entered the Prophetic sunna , and Islam then , with its Qur'an and sunna , would have been a one religion , one people , one nation , one creed . Today , we see the opposite . <p> This is because the hadiths were collected , burnt and proscribed from being recorded and transmitted even by word of mouth . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no power except with Allah , the Most High , the Most Powerful . <p> Following are some of the clear texts to show that ' Umar exercised personal reasoning as opposed to resorting to the Qur'an : <p> ( 1 ) The Qur'an states : " And if you have had sexual emission , then purify yourselves . But if you are ill or on a journey , or one of you has passed excrement or have had sexual intercourse , and can not find water , then make tayammum on clean earth .... " ( 5:6 ) . <p> It is well known from the Prophetic sunna that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) taught the companions how to make tayammum , even in the presence of ' Umar himself . <p> In " The Book of Tayammum " in " The Chapter entitled ' The pure earth is the ablution of a Muslim in the absence of water ' " , al-Bukhari in his Sahih reports the following hadith on the authority of Imran : " We were on a journey with the Prophet ( S.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night then we pitched camp . There is no sweeter camping to the traveler than this . We did not wake up until the sun had risen . The first to arise was so and so , then so and so ... whose names were recollected by Abu Raja ' , but he forgot ' Awf , then ' Umar b. al-Khattab , who was the fourth . When the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) slept , he was not awakened by anyone until he himself arose . This was because we did not know what was happening to him in his sleep . When ' Umar woke up and realized what had befallen the people , and he was a very corpulent man , he cited the takbir and raised his voice with it . He persisted in saying the takbir and raising his voice until it awoke the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . When he awoke , the men complained to him about what had befallen them . He said : ' There is no good nor harm here , move from this place ' . So they moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water with which he made wudu , and then , after the call to prayer was pronounced , he led the people in prayer . When he finished the prayer , he saw a man who had separated himself , he had not prayed with the group . He said : ' What prevented you , O so and so , from praying with the people ? ' He said : ' I am ritually impure and there is no water ' . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' Then use the earth , for that is sufficient for you ' " . <p> However , ' Umar gave a verdict against the book of Allah and the sunna of his Prophet by saying : " Whoever does not find any water must not pray " . This was his opinion which was recorded by most of the hadith scholars . In volume 1 of his Sahih , in " The Book of Purification " in " The Chapter on Tayammum " Muslim reported that a man came to ' Umar and said : " I have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Then do not pray " . Whereupon ' Ammar said : " Do n't you remember , O Commander of the Faithful , when you and I were on an expedition with the Prophet ? We both became ritually impure and could not find water . You did not pray whereas I rolled over in the dust and prayed . The Prophet ( S.A.W. ) said : ' It would have been enough for you to strike the earth with your palms , then blow upon them , then wipe your face and hands ' " . ' Umar said : " Fear Allah , O ' Ammar " The latter said : " If you wish , I will not relate it " . <p> Glory be to Allah ! ' Umar was not content with opposing the clear texts from the Qur'an and the sunna , he even tried to prevent the companions from opposing his views . ' Ammar was forced to placate the Caliph by his offer : " If you wish I will not narrate it " . How can I and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornness on reasoning despite the testimony of a companion of a clear text ? <p> ' Umar was not convinced and held this view stubbornly until his death . His view influenced many companions who perceived things his way . In fact , they sometimes preferred his view over the view of the Prophet of Allah . Muslim reported in " The Book of Purification " in " The Chapter on Tayammum " , volume 1 , on page 192 on the authority of Shaqiq who said : " We were seated with ' Abd Allah and Abu Musa when the latter said : ' O Abu ' Abd al-Rahman , what do you think of a man who becomes ritually impure and does not find water for a whole month ? What does he do regarding the salat ? ' ' Abd Allah replied : ' He does not make tayammum even if can not find water for a whole month ' . <p> Abu Musa said : ' What about the ayat in Sura al-Maida : ' And if you do not find water then make tayammum on clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were permitted for them , according to this verse , they would seek to make tayammum with earth even if the water became cold for them ' . Then Abu Musa said to ' Abd Allah : ' Did you not hear what ' Ammar said : ' The Prophet of Allah sent me on a mission and I became ritually impure and could not find water , so I rolled in the dust as does an animal . When I met the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , I mentioned that to him and he said : ' It would have been enough for you to do with your hands thus : he struck the earth with his hands once then wiped the left over the right hand , over the backs of his hands and face ' ' . ' Abd Allah said : ' Did you not narrate that ' Umar was not convinced by ' Ammar 's story ? ' " <p> If we study this narration which has been authenticated by al-Bukhari , Muslim and other Sihah books , we understand how influential the views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sahaba , and from this we also understand the extent of the contradiction in the legal rulings , as well as the erosion and mutual contradiction of the narrations . Perhaps these are what led the Umayyad and the ' Abbasid rulers to devalue Islamic rulings , not according them any importance and permitting numerous discordant rulings on one matter . It is as though they said to Abu Hanifa , Malik , Ahmad and al-Shafi'i : " Say what you wish according to your own views , for if your head and Imam , ' Umar , said whatever he wished instead of the Qur'an and the sunna , then there is no blame on you , for you are merely the followers of the followers of the followers , you are not innovators " . <p> Yet more surprising than all of this is what ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud said to Abu Musa : " Do not make tayammum even if you do not find water for a whole month " . ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud , who was among the most prominent companions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find water should leave his prayer completely and not perform the tayammum . It appears that Abu Musa attempted to convince him otherwise by the noble verse which was revealed specifically for this subject in Sura al-Ma'ida . ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud 's retort was : " If it was permitted for them by this verse , they would then seek to make tayammum with earth if the water got cold for them " . <p> From this we also understand how they used their own ijtihad to interpret the Qur'anic texts as they felt appropriate . Regrettably , what they felt was severity and harshness for the umma , even though Allah says : " Allah desires to make things easy for you and not difficult " ( 2:185 ) . <p> This poor fellow says : " If it were permitted for them by this verse , they would seek to make tayammum if the water got cold for them " . Did he put himself in the position of conveying the message from Allah and His Prophet ? Is he more protective and affectionate over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abu Musa tried to convince him with the sunna of the Prophet reported by ' Ammar , and how the Prophet taught him to do the tayammum . ' Abd Allah rejected this famous sunna of the Prophet by saying that ' Umar was not convinced by ' Ammar 's narration . <p> From this , we understand that ' Umar b. al-Khattab 's view was the convincing proof for some companions and that ' Umar 's approval of a hadith or a Qur'anic verse was the sole criterion for determining the authenticity of a hadith or meaning of the verse , even if it contradicted the words and actions of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) . As a result , we see today the actions of many people contradicting the Qur'an and sunna , whether it be in regards to the halal or the haram . This is because the ijtihad of ' Umar , as opposed to the texts , became a madhab to be followed . When some of the backsliders , and some who had knowledge , saw that the hadith which had been prohibited during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrators and scholars and were against ' Umar 's madhab , they themselves manufactured other false hadiths and attributed them to the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , so that they could support the madhab of Abu Hafs . Some examples are mut'a marriage , tarawi prayer , etc . Thus contradictory narrations came into being , and have remained until today a matter of disagreement between the Muslims . This will remain like this as long as there are those who defend ' Umar , just because he is ' Umar , and as long as no one desires to do any research to find the truth and no one will say to ' Umar : " You erred ' Umar , the salat is not forsaken due to lack of water ! There is an ayat for tayammum mentioned in the book of Allah ... and that there are hadiths of tayammum mentioned in every book of the sunna . Your ignorance of them does not permit you to ascend the position of the Caliphate , nor the leadership of the umma . And your knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rulings . When Allah and his Prophet have decreed a matter it is not appropriate , if you are a believer , for you to have an opinion in it so that you may judge by what you like and reject what you wish . You are more aware than I am that whoever disobeys Allah and His Prophet has certainly gone completely astray " . <p> Allah says : " The sadaqa is for the needy , the poor , those who are employed in its collection and those whose hearts need to be placated , for those in bondage and in debt , and to be spent in the way of Allah and for the wayfarer . This is a command from Allah and Allah is full of knowledge , full of wisdom ... " ( 9:60 ) . <p> It was a well known practise of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) that he would allot a special share for those whose hearts needed to be placated , for their share which Allah had made obligatory for them . However , ' Umar b. al-Khattab nullified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text , saying to the people : " We have no need for you . Allah has strengthened Islam , it has no need for you " . Indeed , he nullified this ruling during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr when the people whose hearts were to be placated came to him , as was their custom with the Prophet . Abu Bakr wrote an authorization for them , and they went to ' Umar to receive their allotment . ' Umar tore up the letter and said : " We have no need for you . Allah has strengthened Islam , it has no need for you . If you accept Islam , it is well ; if not , the sword shall judge between us " . Thereupon , they returned to Abu Bakr and said to him : " Are you the Caliph or is he ? He replied : " Rather he , if Allah wishes " . Abu Bakr rescinded what he had written in agreement with ' Umar , his companion . <p> The surprising fact is that even today you find those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his merit and ingenuity . Among these is Shaykh Muhammad ( known as al-Dawalibi ) , for he states in his book " Usul al-Fiqh " ( p. 239 ) , that : " Perhaps the ijtihad of ' Umar ( R. ) in cutting off the stipend which the Qur'an had enjoined for those whose hearts needed to be placated was in the forefront of those rulings he issued which were in accordance with the changing requirements that come with the passage of time . In spite of the fact that the Qur'anic text still stands applicable , and has not been abrogated " . Then he further defends ' Umar by saying that the latter looked at the reason for the text , and not at its apparent or literal meaning ... and he continues to the end , which no sound mind can understand . <p> We , however , accept his admission that ' Umar changed the Qur'anic rulings as a result of his view that rulings may be changed according to the times . However , we reject his view that ' Umar looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We say , instead , to him and to all others , that the text of the Qur'an and the sunna do not change with the passing of time . The Qur'an explicitly states that even the Prophet ( P ) himself does not have the right to make any changes . Allah said : " And when our clear signs are recited unto them , those who do not hope to meet us say : ' Bring us another Qur'an or change it ' . Say unto them : ' It is not for me to change it of my own accord ; I only follow what is revealed to me . Should I disobey my Lord , I fear the penalty of that great Day ' " ( 10:15 ) . And the pure sunna of the Prophet says : " What Muhammad has declared to be halal is halal until the day of Judgment , and the haram is haram until the day of Judgment " . <p> However , according to the claim of al-Dawalibi and those who support him concerning ijtihad , legal rulings change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those rulers who change the rulings of Allah for the rulings dictated by the people , forged rulings necessitated by their needs . Certainly , this is against the judgment of Allah . Among them are those who say : " Break your fast so that you may be strong and overpower your enemy . There is no need for fasting in this age wherein we fight backwardness , poverty and ignorance . Fasting prevents us from production " . They also prohibit polygamy for they see oppression and abuse of the women 's rights in that . There are those who claim that , in the time of Muhammad , the woman was considered " a drop of urine " , but now we have emancipated her and given her full rights . <p> This President has looked at the reason of the text and not at its apparent meaning , the same way as ' Umar looked at it , and has said : " It is necessary now that the inheritance of the male and female be equally divided between them , since Allah gave the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting the family at a time when the woman was inactive . But today , because of stupendous efforts , the woman works and support the family " . He even cites as an example to the people his wife who supports her brother and has become , as a result of her grace and favour , a minister . <p> He also allowed fornication and said it is a personal right to whoever has reached the age of maturity , as long as it is not done by force or as a profession . He opened child care centers for illegitimate children , claiming that he is merciful towards these illegitimate children , who used to be buried alive for fear of poverty and disgrace . He also had other well known opinions . <p> The strange thing is that , to some degree , this President admired the personality of ' Umar for he mentions him sometimes with admiration , and then on another occasion he says that he ( ' Umar ) did not bear responsibility , whether alive or dead , for the ijtihad , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . And yet another time , as if now aware that the Muslims rebutted his interpretations , he said : " ' Umar was among the first and greatest of those practising ijtihad in his time . So why then can I not make ijtihad in my modern time , for ' Umar was the leader of a nation and I too am the leader of a nation " . <p> Yet stranger still is that , whenever this particular leader mentions Muhammad , the Prophet of Allah ( P ) , one can observe in his speech ridicule and scorn . He said in one of his sermons that Muhammad did not even know geography for he said : " Seek knowledge even if it be in China " , assuming that China was the furthermost point on the globe and that Muhammad did not picture that the world would reach this stage wherein crafts of iron would fly in the air ! So what do you think would happen if he was told or they related to him about uranium , potassium , nuclear sciences and laser weaponry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not understand a thing from the book of Allah and the sunna of His Prophet , yet found himself one day ruling a country in the name of Islam , even though he ridiculed Islam and followed Western civilization . He wanted to make his country an advanced European state in keeping with his concept of advancement . He followed the example of many Presidents and kings when he got assistance , praises and accolades from the Western countries and kingdoms . They even gave him the title of " The Greatest Mujahid " . Yet I do not reproach him , for what he has brought is not surprising ; every cup can only pour out what was poured into it . If I want to be neutral , I would instead blame Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman who opened this door from the day of the Prophet 's ( S.A.W. ) death and caused every ijtihad which the Umayyads and ' Abbasids undertook . Seven centuries followed , and in every one of them , the truths of Islam were wiped out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a point where the leader , Imam of the Muslim people , would deliver a sermon ridiculing the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) and no-one would say anything against him , not from within or without the state . <p> This is what I say now and what I say to some of the brothers from the Islamic movement : " If today you reject the ruler who does not follow the Qur'anic texts and the Prophetic sunna , then it is necessary that you also reject those who started this innovation of ijtihad instead of texts , if you are indeed objective and wish to follow the truth " . But they do not accept what I say and criticize me ; how can I dare to compare the present day rulers with the rightly guided Caliphs ? My response is that the leaders and kings of today are the inevitable result of what has happened in history . For , since the death of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) until today , when have the Muslims ever been free even for a day ? They say : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , and if the day comes when we attain power , we 'll burn you to death " . I say : " Allah will never let you see that day " . <p> ( c ) Allah says : " Divorce is permitted twice , after which there must be harmonious cohabitation or separation with kindness . It is not lawful for you ( men ) to take back anything of what you have given your wives except when both partners fear that they would not be able to keep within the limits ordained by Allah . Then there is no blame on either of them if she gives something for her freedom . Those are limits set by Allah so do not exceed them . And those who exceed the limits of Allah are the wrongdoers . <p> When a husband divorces her , she is not lawful for him again until she has married another husband and he has divorced her irrevocably . Then there is no blame upon them if they reunite if they feel that they can observe the limits ordered by Allah . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who understand " ( 2:230 ) . <p> The Prophet 's noble sunna explained , with no ambiguity , that the wife is not forbidden to her husband except after three divorces . And then , it is not allowed for her husband to reunite with her , except after she has married another man . If this man divorces her also , it is possible for the first spouse to seek her hand in marriage again , the same way as other men ; and it is up to the woman to accept or reject , the choice is hers . <p> ' Umar b. al-Khattab however , as usual , transgressed Allah 's limits , which He had made clear for people who understand ; he changed this ruling with his own judgment by which he pronounced that a single effective divorce , if done with three pronouncements , made the wife unlawful for her husband . In this , he contravened the Qur'an and the Prophet 's sunna . <p> In " The Book of Divorce " , in " The Chapter of the Three Divorces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbas , that : " The triple divorce during the time of the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and Abu Bakr , and for two years of the Caliphate of ' Umar , were recognized as one . Then ' Umar b. al-Khattab said : ' The men hasten in a matter wherein they are required to have patience . We should endorse it for them ' . And he did so " . <p> By God , how strange that a Caliph could dare to change Allah 's judgement in the presence of the companions , and that they agreed with him in everything that he said and did . No one opposed or even questioned him ; yet they lead us poor souls into believing that one of the companions said to ' Umar : " By Allah , if we see any crookedness in you , we will straighten you with the sword " . This is a lie and fabrication so as to brag that the Caliphs were the best examples in freedom and democracy . History , however , refutes this by the actual events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions are in complete contrast . <p> Or perhaps they feel that the crookedness was in the Qur'an and sunna , and that ' Umar b. al-Khattab straightened and corrected them . We seek Allah 's protection from this folly . <p> I was in Qafsa , where often I had to give counsel to those who had declared their wives unlawful by the pronouncement " You are forbidden three times " . They rejoiced when I informed them about the correct rulings of Allah in which the Caliphs had not meddled with their personal judgments . However , those who claimed to be knowledgeable scared them by saying that everything is halal with the Shi'as . I remember one of them who debated with me in a decent manner saying : " If our master ' Umar b. al-Khattab ( R ) changed Allah 's ruling in this matter and in others , and the companions agreed with him , why did our master ' Ali , may Allah brighten his face and be pleased with him , not refute our master ' Umar ? <p> I replied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) when the Quraysh said he was a courageous man but knew nothing about warfare : - <p> " May Allah free their parents from this ! Is there anyone among them with more experience in it than me , and more senior to it than me ? I was in the battle when I was not yet twenty and here I am now over sixty . But then , no opinion is accorded to him who is not obeyed " ( sermon 27 , Nahj al-Balagha ) . <p> Did the Muslims listen to Imam ' Ali except his Shi'as who believed in his Imamate ? He opposed him on the prohibition of mut'a and the innovation of tarawi prayers , and he opposed every ruling which Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman changed . But his views remained confined to his partisans and followers . The other Muslims waged war against him , cursed him and tried their utmost to kill him and obliterate his memory . <p> There is no stronger proof of this opposition than the heroic stand he took on the occasion when ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for the Caliphate after the death of ' Umar , stipulating the condition , having chosen him to be the Caliph , that he should rule according to the practice of the two Caliphs , Abu Bakr and ' Umar . ' Ali ( A.S. ) rejected this condition and said : " I will judge by the book of Allah and the sunna of His Prophet " . For this they abandoned him and chose ' Uthman b . ' Affan who accepted the condition to rule according to the sunna of the two Caliphs . If ' Ali could not go against Abu Bakr and ' Umar even in their death , how could he have opposed them when they were still living ? <p> So today we see that the gate to the city of knowledge , who was the most knowledgeable of men after the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) , the wisest judge , the one who memorized the Qur'an and the sunna of His Prophet most , abandoned by the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a who prefer instead Malik and Abu Hanifa , al-Shafi'i and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from worship to contracts . And they do not refer in anything to Imam ' Ali . Their Imams like al-Bukhari and Muslim did the same thing regarding the hadith . For you see them relating hundreds of hadith from Abu Hurayra , Ibn ' Umar , al-Aqra ' and al-A'raj and those close and far , and relating only a few hadiths from ' Ali which were attributed to him , in which there is a defilement of the honour of the ahl al-bayt . They were not satisfied with that , they further disclaim and declare as unbeliever any of his sincere Shi'as who imitates and follows him . They call them names like " Rawafid " ( rejecters ) and other names that are disgraceful . The truth is that ' Ali 's followers committed no sin except that they followed ' Ali , who was shunned and alienated during the period of the first three Caliphs . Then he was cursed and fought against by the Umayyads and ' Abbasids . Anyone who has any perception and knowledge of history will realize this is the clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were wrought against him , his family , and his Shi'as . <p> ' Uthman b . ' Affan follows the practice of his two companions in opposing the texts <p> Perhaps when ' Uthman b . Affan pledged to ' Abd al-Rahman b . ' Awf , on the eve of his being sworn in as the Caliph , that he would govern according to the sunna of the two Caliphs , Abu Bakr and ' Umar , he really meant that he would use his personal judgment as they had done ; and that he would change texts of the Qur'an and the Prophetic hadith as they had done . Whoever studies his lifestyle during the period of his Caliphate will find that he went much further in ijtihad , to the point where he made people forget the ijtihad of his two companions , Abu Bakr and ' Umar . I do not wish to prolong this subject which has provided copious material for the history books , old and new , about the strange things that ' Uthman innovated which caused the people to revolt against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will mention a few instances in order to illustrate for the reader and every researcher what those who supported personal interpretation innovated in the religion of Muhammad ( P ) . <p> ( 1 ) Muslim in his Sahih in " The Book of the Prayer of the Traveller " , reports that ' A'isha said : " When Allah enjoined the salat , He made it two rak'as . Then He finalized it at four for those praying at their places of residence , but the prayer of the traveller was fixed to be two rak'as in accordance with the first injunction " . In the same book , Muslim reported , on the authority of Ya'la b.Umayya , who said : " I said to ' Umar b. al-Khattab : ' There is no harm on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear fitna from those who disbelieve but now the people have believed ' . ' Umar said : ' I was taken aback by what startles you now , so I asked the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) about it and he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a charity to you , so accept Allah 's charity ' " . <p> Muslim reported in his Sahih in " The Book of Shortening the Prayer of the Travellers " from Ibn ' Abbas who said : " Allah enjoined the prayer through the tongue of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , four rak'as for those in residence , and for those travelling two rak'as , and , in a state of fear , one rak'a " . <p> Muslim also reported , on the authority of Anas b . Malik , who said : " Whenever the Apostle of Allah ( S.A.W. ) went on a journey of three amyal ( miles ) or three farsakhs , he prayed two rak'as " . ' Ammar also said : " We journeyed with the Prophet of Allah from Medina to Mecca and he prayed two rak'as until he returned . I said : ' How long did he stay in Mecca ? He replied ' Ten days ' " . <p> From the above hadiths reported by Muslim in his Sahih , it is clear that the noble verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a journey , was understood by the Prophet of Allah and explained by word and deed to show that it was a dispensation and charity which Allah had granted to the Muslims , and that it was obligatory on them to accept it . This refutes the claim of al-Dawalibi and those like him who argue in defense of ' Umar and seek to rectify his errors ; that he looked at the reasoning of the injunction and not at the apparent meaning . The Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) taught him on the occasion of the revelation of the verse to shorten the prayer . ' Umar expressed his surprise that the established texts are not contingent upon the cause(s) for their revelation , and , as a result , the prayer is to be shortened on a journey even if the people may be secure and not afraid of being harassed by the unbelievers . What ' Umar said was different from what al-Dawalibi and the scholars of ahl al-sunna said , yet they seek excuses for him because of their high regard for him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incumbent that he also exercise his personal judgment in the Qur'an and hadith texts so that he might be considered as being amongst the " rightly guided Caliphs " . He went so far as to make the prayer four rak'as on journey instead of the two as legislated . <p> Many a time I have asked about the reason for the changing of this injunction and the addition to it , and what are the arguments for it , but I can only perceive that he wished to lead the people , especially the Banu Umayya , into thinking that he was more pious and God-fearing than Muhammad , Abu Bakr , and ' Umar . <p> Muslim , in " The Chapter on the Prayer of the Traveller and the Shortening of the Prayer at Mina " , on the authority of Salim b . ' Abd Allah , who narrated from his father , who reported that the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) prayed the prayer of a traveller at Mina and at other places as two rak'as , as did Abu Bakr , and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his Caliphate then he finalized it at four " . <p> It is also reported in Muslim that al-Zuhri said : " I said to ' Urwa : ' Why does ' A'isha say the full prayer while on a journey ? ' He said : ' She interpreted the same way that ' Uthman did ' " . This is how Allah 's religion and its rulings and texts have become subject to the interpretations and explanations of people . <p> ' Uthman also exerted his reasoning to support ' Umar 's position regarding the prohibition of the mut'a hajj and the mut'a marriage . Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih in " The Book of Hajj " , in " The Chapter of al-Tamattu ' and Iqran " , from Marwan b. al-Hakam , who said : " I saw ' Uthman and ' Ali . ' Uthman used to forbid people to perform hajj al-Tamattu ' and hajj al-Qiran ( hajj and ' umra together ) , and when ' Ali saw this , he assumed ihram for hajj and ' umra together saying : ' Labbayk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' I will not leave the tradition of the Prophet for the saying of anyone ' " . <p> Muslim also reported in " The Book of Hajj " in " The Chapter on the permissibility of al-Tamattu ' " , on the authority of Sa'id b. al-Musayyab who said : " ' Uthman and ' Ali met at ' Usfan . ' Uthman had prohibited mut'a or the ' umra , whereupon ' Ali said : ' What do you want to do on a matter which the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) did , and now you prohibit it ? ' ' Uthman said : ' Leave us alone ' . ' Ali said : ' I can not leave you alone ' . When ' Ali saw this , he assumed ihram for ' umra and hajj together " . <p> Yes ! This is the man ' Ali b . Abi Talib , ( A.S. ) for he could not abandon the sunna of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) for the word of any man . The second narration illustrates to us that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uthman 's words to ' Ali : " Leave us alone " shows us he would go against everything and would not follow him in what he reported from his cousin ( S.A.W. ) . The narration has been abridged since it says : " And ' Ali said : ' I can not leave you alone ' when he saw that " . What is it that ' Ali saw ? <p> There is no doubt that the Caliph , in spite of ' Ali 's reminding him of the Prophetic sunna , insisted on following his own view even though it was in conflict with the sunna . He forbade the people from al-tamattu ' ; and upon that , ' Ali opposed him and consecrated himself for both , i.e. , the ' umra and the hajj . <p> ( c ) ' Uthman b . ' Affan exerted his own reasoning in parts of the prayer and did not say the takbir before the prostration nor upon rising from it . <p> In his Musnad , volume 4 , p. 440 , Imam Ahmad b . Hanbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said : " I once prayed behind ' Ali and was reminded of a prayer that I prayed with the Prophet of Allah ( S.A.W. ) and the two Caliphs . He said : " So I went and prayed with him , and he made takbir every time he prostrated and when he raised his head from the ruk'u " . I asked him : " O Abu Najid ! Who was the first to depart from this ? " He said : " ' Uthman ( R ) when he became old and his voice became weak he stopped doing it " . <p> Yes ! In this way the sunna of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) was discarded and replaced instead by the sunna of the Caliphs , kings , companions , the Umayyads , and the ' Abbasids ; and everything was innovated , introduced into Islam . Every innovation leads to misguidance ; and every misguidance leads to the fire , as the bearer of the message ( S.A.W. ) has said . <p> As a result , you observe today different modes and types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are one , but their hearts are divided . For even though they line up for prayer in one row , you will see one letting his arms hang by his sides , while another will fold his arms . Another holding his folded arms in a specific way , placing his arms above his navel while another places them near his heart . And still another will place his feet together , while another will stand with his feet apart . Each one thinks that he is right . If you ask anyone of them about it , it will be said to you : " My brother , they are all modes ; do n't pay any attention to them , but pray as you wish , for the important thing is that you pray " . <p> Yes , this is true to a point , for indeed the most important thing is the prayer . However , it is essential that the prayer be the form of the prayer of the Prophet of Allah ( P ) ; for he said : " Pray as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for us to make every effort to research the prayer of the Prophet ( S.A.W. ) , for prayer is the pillar of religion . <p> ( d ) ' Uthman was the one of whom the angels of the Merciful one were shy . Al-Baladhuri said in volume 5 page 54 of his Ansab al-Ashraf : " When the news of Abu Dharr 's death at al-Rabdha reached ' Uthman , he said : ' May Allah have mercy upon him ' . Whereupon ' Ammar b . Yasir said : ' Yes ; and Allah has bestowed upon him mercy from our being weary of him ' . ' Uthman said to ' Ammar : ' O one who bites his father 's penis ! Do you think I am sorry for exiling him ? ' Whereupon he ordered that he be taken into custody , and said : ' Go to his place as well ' . <p> When they were ready to leave , the Banu Makhzum approached ' Ali and asked him to speak to ' Uthman about him . ' Ali said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiled a righteous Muslim , and he perished in your exile . Now you seek to banish someone like him ? ' They exchanged words until ' Uthman finally said to ' Ali : ' You deserve to be banished more than ' Ammar ' . ' Ali said : ' Then do so if you wish ' . <p> The Muhajirun then went to ' Uthman and said : ' If anytime someone speaks to you , it is highly improper that you exile and banish him ' . Whereupon he rescinded his judgment against ' Ammar " . <p> And in the Ta'rikh of Ya'qubi volume 2 p. 147 , he reported that ' Ammar b . Yasir recited the funeral prayer over Miqdad and buried him without informing ' Uthman , due to the testament Miqdad had made . ' Uthman became extremely angry with ' Ammar and said : " Woe unto me because of this son of a black woman ! I wish I had known this " . <p> Is it possible for someone who is so modest that even the angels are shy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best of the believers ? <p> ' Uthman was not satisfied with insulting ' Ammar and swearing at him : " O one who bites his father 's penis " . Instead he ordered his servant to grab ' Ammar . They stretched his hands and legs whereupon ' Uthman kicked him with his booted feet in the testicles , crushing them . He was weak and old , he lost consciousness . This story is well known amongst the historians , for a group of the companions recorded many such events and requested ' Ammar to narrate his misfortune . <p> ' Uthman did the same to ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud when he passed him with one of his troopers , ' Abd Allah b . Zam'a . The latter grabbed ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud and carried him until they came to the door of the mosque , whereupon he hurled him to the ground , breaking one of his ribs . All this was because ' Abd Allah b . Mas'ud had voiced his opposition to ' Uthman 's giving the corrupt Banu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thus the revolt against ' Uthman began and the events transpired to the extent that he was killed and they prevented him from being buried for three days . Four people came from the Banu Umayya to recite his funeral prayer , but some of the companions prohibited them from doing so . One of them said : " Bury him , for Allah and his angels have sent blessing upon him " . They said : " No ! By Allah , he will never be buried in the burial ground of the Muslims " ! He was eventually buried in the " Hash Kawkab " - a place where the Jews used to bury their dead . When the Umayyads came to power , they made this place a part of al-Baqi ' . <p> This is a simple account of the history of the three Caliphs - Abu Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthman . Though it is simple , due to our wish to be brief and to provide only a few examples , it is still sufficient to remove the veil covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew such qualities nor did they , for a single day in their lives , dream of exemplifying them . The obvious question that arises is : What do the ahl al-sunna wa'l-Jama'a say regarding these facts ? <p> For the people practising the remembrance of God , the answer is this : " If you know these , then do n't deny them , for your own Sihah books have verified their veracity despite efforts to obscure them . You have thereby destroyed the myth of the rightly guided Caliphate . <p> If you deny them and do not agree to their veracity , then you have denied your own " Sahih " collections and your reliable books which have reported them 
##955150 <h> Breaking up relations <p> The seventh Greater Sin is Qat'a ar-Rahm , the breaking up of relations with one 's kith and kin . This is clearly verified by Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) as well as Imam Musa al-Kadhim ( a.s . ) , Imam ' Ali ar-Ri ? a ( a.s. ) and Imam Muhammad al-Taqi ( a.s . ) . The Qur'an has also decreed Hell-fire and the curse of Allah ( S.w.T. ) upon those who cut off ties with their relatives . <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) says : <p> " Beware of those who cut off relations because I have found them cursed thrice in the Qur'an . " <p> 1 ) Surah al-Baqarah , Ayat No.27 <p> Whoever break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined , and make mischief in the land , these it is that are the losers . <p> In the Qur'anic terminology when the word Kh ? sir ( loser ) is used it denotes the one who is to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 ) Surah ar-R ? ' d , Ayat No.25 <p> And those who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder which Allah has ordered to be joined and make mischief in the land ; ( as for ) those , upon them shall be curse and they shall have the evil ( issue ) of the abode . <p> 3 ) Surah Muhammad , Ayat No.22-23 <p> But if you held command , you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship . Those it is whom Allah has cursed , so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes . <h> The Denouncement of " Cutting Off Kinship Ties " in the Traditions <p> Numerous traditions have reached us in this regard . A few of these reports are quoted here : <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) states : <p> There is destruction in enmity , especially with the relatives . I do not mean the destruction of the law but rather the destruction of the religion . ( Enmity among people not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroys one 's religion ) . <p> ( al-K ? fi , Chapter of Qat'a ar-Rahm ) <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) says : <p> " Protect yourself from ' Haliqa ' for it destroys the people . " The narrator asked " What is ' Haliqa ' " , Imam replied , " To sever relations . " <h> The Worst Deed in the Eyes of Allah ( S.w.T . ) <p> A man approached the Holy Prophet ( S ) and enquired , " What is the worst deed in the eyes of Allah ? " <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) replied , <p> " To attribute partners to Allah . " <p> The man then asked , " After this which is the worst sin ? " <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) said : <p> " To sever relations " . <p> After this the same person asked , " After this which is the worst sin ? " <h> Goodness in Return of Ill-Treatment <p> The man said , " My relatives give me all sorts of troubles and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Imam ( a.s. ) told him , <p> " Do you also want to cut off relation with them ? If you also become like them , then Allah will never have mercy for you . " <p> Allama Majlisi ( r.a. ) says , " If one behaves kindly to the relatives who are bad , they would at one time or the other regret their behaviour . Then the Mercy of Allah ( S.w.T. ) will be upon both of them . If the ill-behaved relatives do not rectify their ways then at least the Mercy of Allah ( S.w.T. ) will be upon the one who continues kindness to them ( the relatives ) . <p> It is very clear to us that we must not sever relations even with those relatives who are unkind to us and who want to cut off the relationships . <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) says : <p> " Do not sever relation with your kindered even if they cut off relations with you . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <p> Imam Muhammad al-Baqir ( a.s. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment has to be borne in this world itself : - <p> The first is injustice , the second is breaking of relationships and the third is false oath . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> Life is Shortened <p> Hazrat ' Ali ( a.s. ) says in one of his sermons : - <p> " I seek refuge from the sins which cause the hastening of death . " <p> Someone asked him , " Maula , Is there any sin by which the death is hastened ? " He replied , <p> " Yes , the breaking up of the family ties . " <p> Families who live with co-operation and care for each other are given increase in sustenance by Allah ( S.w.T. ) and those who remain divided and are aloof from each other , Allah ( S.w.T. ) removes the bounty from their sustenance and their lifespan shortens even if they are all pious ( in other respects ) . <h> Death due to Qat'a ar-Rahm <p> A companion of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) complained about the ill-treatment given to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my paternal cousins are harassing me . They have snatched the house that rightfully belonged to me and have given me only a room to live in . If I complain to the government , I shall be able to recover all my property . <p> Imam ( a.s. ) said , <p> " Be patient , everything will be alright . " <p> The man returned satisfied . In the year 131 A.H . there was a terrible plague . All the relatives of the man perished . Thereafter when he arrived before Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) , he ( Imam a.s. ) asked , <p> " How are your relatives ? " <p> The man said , " By Allah all of them are dead . " The Imam ( a.s. ) said , <p> " Their deaths have been due to their ill-treatment and Qat'a ar-Rahm of relatives like you , not recognizing your right and cutting off relationships . " <h> Bereft of Divine Mercy <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) relates from the Holy Prophet ( S ) that he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not act upon it , when they claim to profess love but harbour malice in their hearts and sever relations , in such a condition Allah removes mercy from them and makes them undiscerning to logic . <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) says : <p> " Among the various sins , injustice and cutting off relationships are such that one who commits these is punished in this world itself . Apart from this the punishment for these sinners has already been prepared in the Hereafter . " <p> " Jibr ? l ( a.s. ) has informed me that even at a distance of a thousand years man will be able to smell the fragrance of Heaven , but one who disobeys his parents , the one who breaks ties with the kith and kin , or the aged adulterer will not be able to smell it . In fact , the fragrance of Paradise will be felt even at a distance of two thousand years , but not by those who disobey their parents and those who break ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam ( S ) has also informed that the invocation of the person who breaks family ties shall not be answered . " In the chapter on the merits of Shab al-Qadr the Prophet ( S ) has stated that in the night of Qadr Allah ( S.w.T. ) forgives the sins of all the people except of those who drink wine , who disobey their parents , and those who break ties with the relatives or harbour enmity towards the believers . " <h> Kindness to Relatives is Obligatory <p> The Almighty Allah ( S.w.T. ) says in the Qur'an : <p> " ... and be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , by Whom you demand one of another ( your rights ) , and ( to ) the ties of relationship ; " <p> ( Surah an-Nis ? ' 4:1 ) <p> According to Imam al-Baqir ( a.s. ) , the notable point in this verse is that the fear of Allah ( S.w.T. ) is mentioned alongwith the fear one should have about breaking relations with kith and kin . <p> In the book al-K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a.s . ) . He says : <p> " The relatives in this Ayat , include all , and not only the nearest ones . Certainly Allah has ordered kindness towards all the relatives . Allah has given so much importance to this deed that he mentions it with his exalted name . " <h> Kindness to Relatives is Commanded in the Same Way as Sal ? t and Zakat <p> It is related from Imam ' Ali-ar-Ri ? a ( a.s . ) : <p> " Allah has ordered Three things along with Three others , in the glorious Qur'an : <p> 1 ) Sal ? t is ordered along with Zakat . If one offers Sal ? t but does not pay Zakat ( when it is due upon him ) then his Sal ? t will not be accepted . <p> 2 ) Allah has ordered thankfulness to Himself along with the thankfulness to one 's parents .

" <h> Rights of the Relatives and the Ease in Reckoning <p> The Creator of the Universe , Almighty Allah remarks in the Holy Qur'an : <p> " Certainly Allah orders equity , kindness ( to people ) and the giving ( of what they need ) to the relatives . " <p> ( Surah an-Nahl 16:90 ) <p> In Surah ar-R ? ' d is the following verse : <p> " And those who join that which Allah has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning . " <p> ( Surah ar-R ? ' d 13:21 ) <p> The expression ' reckoning ' in this Ayat denotes the accounting of one 's deeds with regard to his duty of kindness towards relatives . This Ayat shows that kindness towards the kith and kin shall be an important factor to ease the difficulty of the accounting for one 's deeds . <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) explains as follows : <p> " Kindness to relatives the reckoning ( of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Anw ? r ) <h> The Inimical Relative of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) made a will in his last moments : <p> " Pay seventy Dinars to my paternal cousin Hasan Aftas . " <p> He was asked , " Master you are making a gift to someone who has attacked you with a sword ? " <p> Imam ( a.s. ) replied , <p> " Do you think I should not be included among those concerning whom the Qur'an says : <p> ' And those who join that which Allah has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning ... " <p> ( Surah ar-R ? ' d : 13:21 ) <p> Allah has created Paradise , purified it and made it fragrant . Its fragrance is felt at a distance of two thousand years ( of travel ) . But the one who disobeys his parents or breaks ties with the kin will be so far away from Paradise , that he will not even experience its fragrance . <p> ( Bih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Relatives <p> There are numerous traditions to the fact that Silet ar-Rahm is obligatory . In one of such traditions Imam Baqir ( a.s. ) relates from the Holy Prophet ( S ) that he said : <p> " I will ( command ) all the people of my Umma , whether present or not , and those generations which are to come till the Qiy ? ma , who are still in the loins of their father and wombs of their mothers , that they should be kind to their relatives ( and visit them ) even if they live at a distance of a year 's journey . Because kindness to relatives is one of the commands which is made an integral part of the faith ( Im ? n ) . " <h> One Who is Kind to the Relatives Will be Able to Cross the Bridge of Sir ? t Smoothly <p> ' Sir ? t ( the bridge passing over Hell that everyone has to cross ) will have on each side ( of it ) ' Silet ar-Rahm ' and ' Amanat ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silet ar-Rahm and maintains trusts ( Amanat ) shall be able to cross the ' Sir ? t ' easily and will reach Paradise . <p> None of the good deeds will benefit those who have broken ties with relatives or committed breach of trust . They will slip from the bridge of ' Sir ? t ' and drop into Hell-fire . <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> The Worldly Benefits of Kindness to Relatives <p> Numerous reports ( Raway ? t ) testify that Silet ar-Rahm ( kindness to one 's relatives ) also has worldly benefits . Like , increase in the life-span , postponement of death , increase in the number of descendants etc. , Hazrat Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) related Three traditions from the Holy Prophet ( S ) in the court of Mansur Dawaniqi ( l.a . ) . <p> 1 ) " A man who has only Three years of life remaining , performs an act of kindness to his relatives and Allah increases his life by thirty years . In the same way a man has thirty years of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ( remaining ) life is decreased to Three years . Then the Holy Prophet ( S ) said : Whatever Allah wills He erases and whatever He wills He writes . <p> It means that if Allah wills He can alter ( certain ) due to one 's actions and deeds . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> 2 ) " Fulfilling the rights of kith and kin increases life-span even if the relative is a sinner . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> 3 ) Silet ar-Rahm ( kindness to relatives ) is a cause for the easy accounting of one 's deeds on the day of Qiy ? ma and it ( Silet ar-Rahm ) protects one from sudden death . " <p> Hazrat Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) has told Maysar : <p> ( O ' Maysar ) the time of your death has arrived many times but Allah has postponed ( your death ) due to your kindness to the relatives and good behaviour towards them . <h> ' Silet ar-Rahm ' Prolongs Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that he said to Maysar , <p> " O Maysar , truly your lifespan has increased , what good actions have you been performing ? " <p> Maysar replied , " In my youth I used to earn from my labours an amount of five Dinars a day and I used to give these to my maternal uncle . " <p> Yaq ? b Magribi was once in the presence of Imam Musa al-Kadhim ( a.s . ) . Imam ( a.s. ) said , <p> " You and your brother had an argument over the ownership of a house . So much so that you abused each other and broke up the ties of relationsip . Such a thing is not from my religion , neither is it from the religion of my ancestors . Then fear Allah , the One Who is without any partner . Fear the Divine Punishment . Due to this sin , death shall soon separate you ( two ) . Your brother will die in this journey and you shall regret you actions . " <p> The man asked , " May my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Imam ( a.s. ) replied , <p> " Your death had also arrived but you did an act of kindness to your father 's sister ( your aunt ) and thus your lifespan increased by twenty years ( or months ) . " <p> As Imam ( a.s. ) has predicted , Yaq ? b 's brother died before he could reach home and was buried on the way . <p> ( Safinat'ul-Bih ? r ) <h> The Benefits of Silet ar-Rahm in the Hereafter <p> The practice of Silet ar-Rahm ( kindness to kith and kin ) accrues worldly advantages , spiritual benefits and bounties of the Hereafter . <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq says : <p> " Silet ar-Rahm perfects the morals and encourages charity . When one performs Silet ar-Rahm he has to be benevolent towards his relatives . The continuous practice of Silet ar-Rahm brings refinement in his morals . In the same way repeated acts of kindness inculcate a benign and compassionate feeling in the person , and the soul is purified ( from the sin of jealousy and enmity ) . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Deeds to be Accepted <p> Imam Muhammad al-Baqir ( a.s. ) states : <p> Silet ar-Rahm ( kindness to relatives ) purifies deeds . Purification of deeds means , that the shortcomings in all the good deeds of a person practicing Silet ar-Rahm are naturally compensated and all his good deeds are accepted by Allah . <p> It increases wealth , wards off difficulties and calamities . The accounting of your actions on the day of Qiy ? ma is made easy . Even the ordained time of death is postponed . <p> There are two actions , towards which , a step taken is liked by Allah more than anything else . One is the step taken to join a row formed in the name of Allah ( for Jihad or Sal ? t ) ; the second is the one taken to extend a hand of friendship towards kith and kin who want to break relations . <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) said : <p> " Certainly there is a section in Paradise which can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Imam , second , the one who does Silet ar-Rahm , and third the one who has family ( and children ) but remains patient ( in poverty and diffi-culties ) . <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <h> The Reward of Silet ar-Rahm <p> The reward for Silet ar-Rahm has been described by the Holy Prophet ( S ) in one of his traditions . He says : <p> " When a person goes towards his relatives so that he can fulfill his rights with his life and his wealth , Allah bestows upon him the reward of a martyr at every step he takes . He ( Allah ) writes down forty thousand Hasana ( the unit of Divine rewards ) and He erases forty thousand of his sins and He elevates him by forty thousand grades . The person achieves the position of who has worshipped Allah for a hundred years . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> At another place the Holy Prophet ( S ) says , regarding the rewards for Silet ar-Rahm : <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , whereas the reward for giving a loan is twelve times ( because in giving a loan the dignity of the Loanee is maintained ) . The reward for the good behaviour to the believing brothers is twelve times and reward for Silet ar-Rahm is twenty four times . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <h> The Meaning of Silet ar-Rahm and Qat'a ar-Rahm <p> The Shari'a of Islam has not provided any fixed definition for these two terms . In this case the meaning as judged by common sense and reason must be accepted . We must consider all the relatives from the father 's side and mother 's side , irrespective of whether they are close or distant , to be our kith and kin who have a right on us . In the same way the children of the daughters and their descendant also come in this category as the Qur'an says : <p> ' Those who join together ( do Silet ar-Rahm ) those things which Allah has commanded to be joined . " <p> " You have been commanded to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahram ( in the prohibited category of marriage ) or Non-mahram , ( not in the prohibited category ) whether they are distant relatives or closely related , whether they are immediate relatives or separated by several generations . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> No Discrimination Between the Affluent and the Poor Relatives <p> It is generally observed that people tend to behave graciously towards their wealthy relatives and avoid the poor ones . The faith of Islam does not differentiate or discriminate between the rich and the poor relatives . What is important is the closeness of relationship . The more closely a person is related to you , the more important and necessary it is to fulfill his rights . <h> What is Silet ar-Rahm ? <p> Any behaviour which is generally regarded by people as good , kind , gracious or obligatory , when directed towards your relatives is Silet ar-Rahm . <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) says : <p> " The kindness towards relative and goodness towards the believing brother makes easy your reckoning on the Day of Judgement and protects you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives and be good to your believing brothers even if it is as little as a sincere ' sal ? m ' ( salutation ) or a hearty reply to a sal ? m . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <p> At another place the Sixth Imam ( a.s. ) remarks : <p> " Do Silet ar-Rahm towards your relatives and the near ones even if it is just by offering a glass of water to them . " <p> ( Wasa'il ul-Shia ) <h> The Different Grades of Silet ar-Rahm <p> Shah ? d al-Thani 5 ( r.a. ) describes the grades of Silet ar-Rahm in the following words : <p> It is deduced from the traditions that the highest stage of Silet ar-Rahm is to consider the relatives as our own selves . That is , we should wish for our relations whatever we wish for ourselves . <p> The next stage of Silet ar-Rahm is to help relatives overcome the difficulties and hardships they may be facing . Next , we must earnestly try to benefit our kith and kin as much as possible , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner permitted by religion . This benefit can be either economic or by way of making a person independent , by securing for him a job or initiating him into a trade . It can also be in the form of a sound advice , spiritual guidance and religious teachings . <p> The fourth stage of Silet ar-Rahm is towards those people who are dependents of our relatives . For example , the brother 's wife or the step-mother . <p> The simplest kind of Silet ar-Rahm consists of salutations , a lesser kind is the conveying of Sal ? m ( through someone ) . The smallest kind of Silet ar-Rahm is to pray for relatives in their presence and to encourage them . <h> The Difference Between Breaking Relations With Nearest Kin and With Distant Relatives <p> Qat'a ar-Rahm and Silet ar-Rahm with respect to the close kith and kin could be different from that with the distant relatives . It is possible that a certain action or attitude towards close relative would amount to Qat'a ar-Rahm but the same towards a distant relative may not be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pious relative may be termed as Qat'a ar-Rahm but with respect to other relatives it may not be so . It is best to refrain from every act that could possibly amount to Qat'a ar-Rahm . We must observe extreme precaution in this matter lest we bring upon ourselves the severe punishment of a Greater Sin . <h> Arrogance Towards Poor Relatives is Qat'a ar-Rahm <p> The ones most guilty of Qat'a ar-Rahm are the rich and affluent who do not acknowledge their connections with their poor relatives and deal with them with pride and arrogance , while they are polite and kind to their wealthy relatives . To neglect one 's duty and give importance to material possessions , contradicts the laws of Islam both in the letter and spirit . <h> What is the Least Amount of Silet ar-Rahm That is Wajib <p> Every kind of Silet ar-Rahm , the failure of which is viewed as a sort of Qat'a ar-Rahm , is obligatory for us . For example , if a person is unable to fulfill his needs due to poverty or is unable to get medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he approaches a rich relative for help ; it is obligatory on the rich person to help him . Even if the rich person is not approached directly but comes to know the predicament of his poor relative , it is obligatory on him to help this less fortunate relative . The wealthy man who fails to carry out these obligations will be guilty of Qat'a ar-Rahm . <p> It is however not obligatory for a person to help his poor relative if he himself is not in a sound position to do so and fears that his finances will be constrained or that he himself may become a destitute . Also , Silet ar-Rahm is not obligatory , if by doing so he will violate the laws of Islam . For example one need not pay a visit to a relative , if by doing so one would be in the midst of Na-mahram or may be compelled to hear music . <p> Sometimes we may be in doubt whether a particular action could be considered as Silet ar-Rahm or Qat'a ar-Rahm . In this case the reference point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criteria for deciding that a particular behaviour is Silet ar-Rahm or Qat'a ar-Rahm therefore depends on the general feeling for it . If a small lapse like not saluting or non-compliance with a small request is Qat'a ar-Rahm according to those around us , then it is so . By the same token if observing small niceties are considered as Silet ar-Rahm , then it is so . <h> Silet ar-Rahm With Certain Relatives is Mustahab if Not Wajib <p> At times some obligations towards distant relatives are not considered Silet ar-Rahm and accordingly are not Wajib ( obligatory ) for us . But these obligations are bound to be Mustahab . In any event , it is best to conduct ourselves in a manner that we totally eliminate the risk of committing a Greater Sin . <p> Although one would not be at fault from a worldly point of view , according to Shari'a , breaking ties even with those who want to do so is Har ? m . <p> It is natural for a person who , finding that his relative does not acknowledge him nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonds of kinship to be broken . <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) says : <p> " Do not break ties with your relatives even if they break them with you . " <h> The Order of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) Regarding Qat'a ar-Rahm <p> Abdullah Ibn Sinan says that I pleaded to Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) , " I have a cousin , I do Silet ar-Rahm ( kindness ) towards him and do not wish to break ties with him . But he wants to break ties with me . ( Master ! ) I want to maintain relations but he wishes to sever them . Due to this behaviour of his I am also inclined to cut off ties with him . Can you permit me to do so ? " <p> Imam ( a.s. ) replied : <p> " ( Remember ) If you behave kindly with this relative of yours inspite of his Qat'a ar-Rahm ( then it is possible that one day this will affect him and he too will begin to fulfill his obligations ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you . But if you break ties with this cousin of yours then neither of you shall be eligible for the Mercy of Allah . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> Goodness in Return of Ill-Treatment <p> The Holy Prophet ( S ) says : <p> " If any one betrays trust with you , do not betray trust with him or you will also become like him . Similarly , do not break with your relatives even if they do so . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> It means that if we reciprocate the malice of a relative we shall also be like him ( i.e. sinful ) . In the same way the Holy Prophet ( S ) has invited us to perform kindness in lieu of misdemeanor . He remarks , " Do you wish me to tell you ( about those qualities ) which shall benefit you in this world as well as Hereafter ? " <p> The people said , " O Prophet of Allah ! Please do so . " <p> The Prophet ( S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firstly , to do Silet ar-Rahm with one who does Qat'a ar-Rahm with you . Secondly , fulfill the needs of one who has deprived you . Thirdly , forgive those who have oppressed you . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> Breaking of Ties With the Muslim and the Kafir Relatives <p> The traditions of the Ma 's ? m ? n ( a.s. ) leave no doubt whatsoever that the fulfilling of the rights of one 's relatives is obligatory . Whether the relatives are Shia or Sunni , pious and religious or sinful and transgressors or whether they are Muslims or Kafirs . It is compulsory to perform Silet ar-Rahm with them . Even if a Muslim relative apostises and becomes a kafir , his rights are not invalidated . <p> Inb al-Hamid enquired from Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) : " My relatives are not of my religion . Are any of their rights upon me ? " Imam ( a.s. ) gave the following reply : <p> " Why not ? The rights of the relatives do not become invalid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the relatives are Muslim then their rights are twice as much . One is due to their being relatives and second because of their being Muslim . " <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> Daw ? d Raqqi the Companion of the Sixth Imam ( a.s . ) <p> Daw ? d Raqqi says : " I was sitting in the company of Imam ( a.s. ) when Imam ( a.s. ) himself started speaking and said : <p> " Daw ? d , on Thursday the report of your deeds was presented to me and I saw among your deeds the Silet ar-Rahm which you have performed with your cousin ( brother ) , I was very pleased . However , I know that this Silet ar-Rahm of yours will ( because of his Qat'a ar-Rahm towards ) be the cause of his early death . " <p> ( Bih ? r al-Anw ? r ) <p> Daw ? d , the companion of Imam Sadiq ( a.s. ) says : " My cousin used to bear enmity towards me . He was an evil person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Makkah and gave him some money so that he could manage himself for some time . It was this action of mine about which Imam ( a.s. ) was informed and he told of it on my return to Madinah . " <h> The Behaviour of Imam as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) Towards His Inimical Relatives <p> Certain relatives of the Holy Imam ( a.s. ) not only failed to acknowledge his rights but even bore enmity against him in their hearts . Although the enmity against Imam ( a.s. ) makes him a disbeliever . Yet Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) willed that seventy Dinars be given to Hasan Aftas . Hasan Aftas was an evil person and had such deep malice against Imam ( a.s. ) that he had once tried to attack Imam ( a.s. ) with a sword . The goodly behaviour of Imam ( a.s. ) towards his enemy was due entirely to his relationship . <h> Conversation of Imam as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) With Abdullah Hasani <p> Once Abdullah Hasani , a relative of Imam Sadiq ( a.s. ) met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument with Imam ( a.s. ) and spoke ill of him . Imam ( a.s. ) replied to this misbehavior in the best way . He went to the house of this person the very next day and said , " Yesterday I recited the following Ayat of the Qur'an , <p> " And those who joined that which Allah has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning . <p> ( Surah ar-R ? ' d 13:21 ) <p> I became very fearful because of it . " Abdullah understood that Imam ( a.s. ) was intending to correct him . He began to weep and said , " I have willfully forgotten this verse . After this , Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) and Abdullah embraced each other . <p> ( al-K ? fi ) <h> The Grief of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) on the Oppression upon the Descendants of Imam Hasan ( a.s . ) <p> When Mans ? r Dawaniqi arrested and imprisoned Abdullah Mahej and other Hasani Sad ? ts , Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imam ( a.s. ) , the Imam 's ( a.s. ) distress was such that he was confined to bed for twenty days . He wrote a lengthy letter to them to express his sorrow and to offer comfort and consolation . He sent this letter to the prison of Kufa and was in regular contact with them to know their well-being . Often he wept on their imprisonment . <p> It is simply clear by now that for Sileh-Rahem and Qat'a ar-Rahm , the Shari'a does not distinguish between a Muslim and a Kafir or between a pious and a sinful person . At the same time we also know that Islam exhorts us to shun infidels and to dissociate with them . These contradicting views will cause some confusion in our minds and a word of explanation is in order . <p> Undoubtedly Islam orders us to detest kafirs , hence it is improper to behave well with them . Good behaviour towards a Kafir is an outward act and at a social level . While hating him for being an Kafir is how you feel and think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must behave well with our Kafir relatives , but at no stage should we be oblivious of the fact that they are non-believers and deserve to be hated for being Kafirs . <p> If Silet ar-Rahm towards a Kafir relative , in some way , strengthens his conviction towards his own religious views ; or if Sileh-Rahem towards a sinful relative provides him with opportunity and encouragement in his unlawful ways , then this kind of Silet ar-Rahm is forbidden . In fact , if Qat'a ar-Rahm induces a disbeliever to introspect and reconsider his disbelief , then , Qat'a ar-Rahm is obligatory on us . In the same way Qat'a ar-Rahm is obligatory if it discourages or dissuades a relative in his sinful ways . <h> Dissociating With the Enemies of Islam <p> There is another situation where Qat'a ar-Rahm is Wajib ( obligatory ) . That is when the kafir or sinful relative harbors malice towards the religion of Islam . Allah ( S.w.T. ) says in Surah al-Muj ? dala : <p> " You shall not find people who believe in Allah and the latter day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostle , even though they were their ( own ) fathers , or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk ... " <p> ( Surah al-Muj ? dala 58:22 ) <p> This verse clearly indicates that one must abstain from Silet ar-Rahm towards even the closest of relatives if they are inimical towards Allah ( S.w.T. ) or the Holy Prophet ( S ) or the Islamic faith . <h> Silet ar-Rahm is Wajib if the Relative is not Overtly Inimical <p> A Qur'anic verse from the chapter Mumtahana says : <p> " Allah does not forbid you from respecting those who have not made war against you on account of ( your ) religion , and have not driven you forth from your homes , that you show them kindness and deal with them justly , surely Allah loves the doers of justice . Allah only forbids you from respecting those who made war upon you on account of ( your ) religion , and drove you forth from your homes and backed up others in your expulsion , that you make friendship with them and whoever makes friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Surah Mumtahana 60:8-9 ) <p> Thus it could be concluded from the above two verses that if a relative does not openly oppress us or exhibit enmity , then Silet ar-Rahm is Wajib towards him . <h> Silet ar-Rahm is Wajib Even if One Has to Travel Far to Perform it <p> It is highly recommended to fulfill the duty of Silet ar-Rahm even if one has to travel a long distance to do so . The Holy Prophet ( S ) told ' Ali ( a.s . ) : <p> " O ' Ali ! Even if you have to travel for two years to do good to your parents , do it , even if you have to travel for one year to perform Silet ar-Rahm to your kinsfolk , do so . Even if you have to journey a mile to see a sick person , do it . Even if you have to walk two miles to attend a funeral , do it . Even if you have to travel four to meet a believing brother , do it . " <p> ( Bih ? r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier , that for every step a person takes to visit his relatives , he gets forty thousand rewards , forty thousand of his sins are forgiven and his status is raised by forty thousand grades . <h> Maintain Cordial Relations But Do Not Reside Close to Each Other <p> Amir ul-Mu'min ? n ( a.s. ) writes a letter to one of his officers , <p> " Order the relatives to visit each other but ask them not to reside in the same neighborhood . " <p> The late Scholar , Naraqi , explains in his book , ' Miraj us Sad ? t ' : " Staying next to each other breeds malice and jealousy and results in Qat'a ar-Rahm . " <p> It is much easier for relatives to maintain harmony and goodwill by staying apart from each other . Proximity often results in friction and enmity . <p> There is a Persian proverb that says that distance and friendship are proportionate to each other . <h> Silet ar-Rahm With the Spiritual Father <p> We are indeed indebted to our parents for our physical , mental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , without a spiritual father . The essence of spiritual guidance which consists of rules of conduct as approved by Allah ( S.w.T. ) have come to us only through the Holy Prophet ( S ) and it was the sustained and unsparing effort of the Holy Prophet ( S ) which guided mankind to the path of salvation and eternal happiness . The Holy Prophet ( S ) was the spiritual father of the Muslims in his time and later ' Ali ( a.s. ) took his place . It is only through love and obedience to them that one can hope to achieve spiritual eminence . <p> This is corroborated by the statement of Allah ( S.w.T. ) to the effect that whoever enters the ' fort ' ( protection ) of these exalted personalities , his spiritualism becomes evident in his behaviour . The doors of knowledge and awareness are open . The fountain of sagacity flows in his heart and the reality becomes manifest for him . <h> The Advent of the Holy Prophet ( S ) - A Fabulous Blessing <p> It is not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obedience of a spiritual father . <p> " Certainly Allah conferred a benefit upon the believers when he raised among them an apostle from among themselves , reciting to them His communications and purifying them , and teaching them the book and the wisdom , although before that they were surely in manifest error . " <p> ( Surah ? li- ' Imran 3:164 ) <p> This verse signifies the importance of the advent of the Holy Prophet ( S ) by Allah ( S.w.T. ) for the guidance of mankind . We must acknowledge it as the greatest blessing of Allah ( S.w.T. ) and a favour that He bestowed upon His creatures . <h> The Wil ? yat of Ahl ul-Bayt ( a.s. ) and the Worldly Comforts and Blessings <p> Y ? nus Ibn Abdul Rahm ? n told Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s . ) : <p> " The love and Wil ? yat of Ahl ul-Bayt ( a.s. ) has been prescribed as your right upon us by Allah . I consider this blessing to be much superior to the worldly blessings . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You have made an inappropriate comparison . What are the worldly blessings ? What is it more than eating , drinking and dressing ? And you compare all these transient things with our love which is an everlasting reality ? " <p> We have seen in the discussion on the rights of parents , that we can be ' ? q ' of our spiritual fathers if we fail to fulfill their rights . Not all of us may be capable of fulfilling this duty to the fullest extent . But we should sincerely try our utmost to obey their commands . At the same time we should be fully aware of our deficiencies and failings and continually implore our infallible guides to pardon us . <h> Who Are the Spiritual Fathers ? <p> Silet ar-Rahm is Wajib and Qat'a ar-Rahm is Har ? m towards our spiritual relatives also . Our Holy Prophet ( S ) and our Imams ( a.s. ) are our spiritual fathers . So , the descendants of our Holy Prophet ( S ) and the Imams ( a.s. ) , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the Holy Prophet ( S ) and the Imams ( a.s. ) are the spiritual fathers of all believers and Shias , we all are related to each other , and are like brothers of each other . <p> " Certainly the Believers Are Brothers of Each Other . " <p> ( Surah al-Hujur ? t 49:10 ) <p> The verse clearly indicates that everyone is somehow related to a common spiritual father . <h> Rights of Sad ? t <p> Allama Hilli in his book ' Qawaidul Ahkam ' counsels his son Fakhrul Muhaqqiqain in the following words : <p> " You should practise Silet ar-Rahm with the pure descendants of the Sad ? t also . The Almighty Allah ( S.w.T. ) has emphasized upon this duty so much that he has made the love of relatives of the Holy Prophet ( S ) as a compensation of the prophetic mission . " <p> " ... Say : I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives .... " <p> ( Surah ash-Sh ? r ? 42:23 ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall intercede for four types of people even if they carry the sins of all humanity . " <p> 1 ) A person who has helped my descendants and progeny . <p> 2 ) A person who has spent his wealth upon my descendants when they were in need . <p> 3 ) A person who has loved my Progeny with his tongue and his heart . <p> 4 ) A person who has considered the wants of my descendants when they were surrounded by enemies and were homeless . " <h> Does Anyone Have a Right Upon the Holy Prophet ( S ) ? <p> Hazrat Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) said : <p> " On the day of Qiy ? ma a caller will announce , ' O people , keep silent , because Muhammad ( S ) is to say something to you . ' Then the Messenger will arise and say , ' O people ! If anyone of you has any right or favour upon me , or if there is any obligation upon my neck then he should stand up . I will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' May our parents be sacrificed upon you . What right ? What favour ? And what obligation ? Rather the rights and favours are of Allah and His Prophet upon all the creatures . ' <h> Goodness to Sad ? t and Paradise <p> Then the Holy Prophet ( S ) shall say : <p> " No , they do have a right . Whoever has provided shelter and help to anyone from my Ahlul-Bayt ( a.s. ) or did good to them or gave them clothes in their need or fed them when they were in need , should stand up so that I can recompense him .

He shall not receive any reward from the Almighty . " <p> " What are those seven rights ? " , enquired Mualla . <p> Imam ( a.s. ) said , <p> " I fear that you may fail to act upon them . " <p> Mualla said , " La Quwwata Illa Billah . " There is no power except of Allah . ( He meant , It would n't be so ) . <p> Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) said , <p> " The foremost right is that you wish for the believing brothers whatever you wish for yourself . " <p> Imam ( a.s. ) then related the other six rights , <p> " The second right is that you must refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The third right is that you help him with you life , your wealth , your tongue , and your hands . The fourth right is that you guide him and teach him that which is beneficial for him . The fifth , is that do not eat till satiation when your believing brother is hungry , and do not drink to satiation if he is thirsty , and do not dress nicely if he is deprived of good clothes . The sixth right is that if you have a servant you should send him to do his work . The seventh right is that if the believing brother says something on oath you should believe him , if he invites , you accept his invitation , if he is sick , visit him , if he dies , accompany his bier , if you come to know any of his needs , fulfill them it before he asks .

##955450 <p> Praise be to Allah who is proof of His existence through His creation , of His being external through the newness of His creation , and through their mutual similarities of the fact that nothing is similar to Him . Senses can not touch Him and curtains can not veil Him , because of the difference between the Maker and the made , the Limiter and the limited and the Sustainer and the sustained . <p> He is One but not by the first in counting , is Creator but not through activity or labour , is Hearer but not by means of any physical organ , is Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids , is Witness but not by nearness , is Distinct but not by measurement of distance , is Manifest but not by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety ( of body ) . He is Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over them , while things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him and their turning towards Him . <p> He who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him . He who numbers Him rejects His eternity . He who said " how " sought a description for Him . He who said " where " bounded him . He is the Knower even though there be nothing to be known . He is the Sustainer even though there be nothing to be sustained . He is the Powerful even though there be nothing to be overpowered . <p> A part of the same sermon about the Divine leaders ( Imams ) <p> The riser has risen , the sparkler has sparkled , the appearer has appeared and the curved has been straightened . Allah has replaced one people with another and one day with another . We awaited these changes as the famine-stricken await the rain . Certainly the Imams are the vicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know Allah . No one will enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows Him , and no one will enter Hell except he who denies them and denies Him . <p> Allah the Glorified , has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of safety and the collection of honour . Allah the Glorified , chose its way and disclosed its pleas through open knowledge and secret maxims . Its ( Qur'an ) wonders are not exhausted and its delicacies do not end . It contains blossoming bounties and lamps of darkness . ( The doors of ) virtues can not be opened save with its keys , nor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps . Allah has protected its inaccessible points ( from enemies ) and allowed grazing ( to its followers ) in its pastures . It contains cover ( from the ailment of misguidance ) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of support . <p> ( 1 ) . The first part of this sermon consists of important issues concerning the science of knowledge about Allah , wherein Amir al-mu'minin has thrown light on the matter that Allah is from ever and His attributes are the same as He Himself . When we cast a glance at creation , we see that for every movement there is a mover , from which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect can appear without a cause , so much so , that even an infant a few days old , when his body is touched , feels in the depth of his consciousness that someone has touched him . He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and looking . How then can the creation of the world and the system of all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser ? <p> Once it is necessary to believe in a Creator , then He should exist by Himself , because everything which has a beginning must have a centre of existence from which it should terminate . If that too needed a creator , there would be the question of whether this creator is also the creation of some other creator or exists by itself . Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed in , who should be the cause of all causes , the mind will remain groping in the unending labyrinth of cause and effect , and never attain the idea of the last extremity of the series of creation . It would fall into the fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If the creator were taken to have created himself , then there would be ( one of the two positions , namely ) either he should be non-existent or existent . If he were not existent , then it would not be possible for something non-existent to create any existent being . If he were existent before creating himself , there would be no sense in coming into being again . Therefore it is necessary to believe that the Creator should be a Being not dependent on any other creator for His own existence , and everything else should be dependent on Him . This dependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the Source of all creation is from ever and eternal . And since all beings other than He are subject to change , are dependent on position and place and are similar to one another in qualities and properties , and since similarity leads to plurality whereas unity has no like save itself , therefore nothing can be like Him . <p> Even things called one can not be reckoned after His Unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is free and pure from all those attributes which are found in body or matter because He is neither body , nor colour , nor shape , nor does He lie in any direction , nor is He bounded within some place or locality . Therefore , man can not see or understand Him through his senses or feelings , because senses can know only those things which accord with the limitations of time , place and matter . To believe that He can be seen is to believe that He has body , but since He is not a body , and He does not exist through a body , and He does not lie in any direction or place , there is no question of His being seen . But His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies , due to whose delicacy the eye pierces through them and eyes remain unable to see them ; as for example the wind in the vast firmament . But He is unseen by His very existence . Nevertheless , nothing is unseen for Him . He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments of seeing or hearing , because if He were in need of organs of the body for hearing and seeing He would be in need of external things for His perfection and would not be a perfect Being , whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection should be apart from His Self . <p> To believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that there would be a self and a few attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes would be Allah . But a thing which is compounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist before their composition into the whole . When the parts exist from before , how can the whole be from ever and eternal because its existence is later than that of its parts . But Allah had the attributes of knowledge , power and sustaining even when nothing was existent , because none of His attributes were created in Him from outside , but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His attributes . Consequently , His knowledge does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then His knowledge , because His Self is prior to things coming into existence . Nor is it necessary for His power that there should first exist the object to be over-powered and then alone He would be called Powerful , because Powerful is that who has power equally for doing or abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be over-powered is not necessary . <p> Similarly Sustainer means master . Just as He is the Master of the non-existent after its coming into existence , in the same way He has power to bring it into existence from non-existence , 
##955451 <p> Amir al-mu'minin said in disparagement of the differences of view among the theologians . <p> When ( 1 ) a problem is put before anyone of them he passes judgement on it from his imagination . When exactly the same problem is placed before another of them he passes an opposite verdict . Then these judges go to the chief who had appointed them and he confirms all the verdicts , although their Allah is One ( and the same ) , their Prophet is one ( and the same ) , their Book ( the Qur'an ) is one ( and the same ) . <p> Is it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him ? Or He prohibited them from it but they disobeyed Him ? Or ( is it that ) Allah sent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to complete it ? Or they are His partners in the affairs , so that it is their share of duty to pronounce and He has to agree ? Or is it that Allah the Glorified sent a perfect faith but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ( to the people ) ? The fact is that Allah the Glorified says : <p> And says that one part of the Qur'an verifies another part and that there is no divergence in it as He says : <p> . . . And if it had been from any other than Allah , they would surely have found in it much discrepancy . ( Qur'an , 4 : 82 ) <p> Certainly the outside of the Qur'an is wonderful and its inside is deep ( in meaning ) . Its wonders will never disappear , its amazements will never pass away and its intricacies can not be cleared except through itself . <p> ( 1 ) . It is a disputed problem that where there is no clear argument about a matter in the religious law , whether there does in reality exist an order about it or not . The view adopted by Abu'l-Hasan al-Ashari and his master Abu Ali al-Jubba'i is that in such a case Allah has not ordained any particular course of action but He assigned the task of finding it out and passing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited would be deemed prohibited and whatever they regard permissible would be deemed permissible . And if one has one view and the other another then as many verdicts will exist as there are views and each of them would represent the final order . For example , if one scholar holds that barley malt is prohibited and another jurist 's view is that it is permissible then it would really be both prohibited and permissible . That is , for one who holds it prohibited , its use would be prohibited while for the other its use would be permissible . About this ( theory of ) correctness Muhammad ibn Abdi'l-Karim ash-Shahrastani writes : <p> A group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad ( research ) is applied there is no settled view about permissibility or otherwise and lawfulness and prohibition thereof , but whatever the mujtahid ( the researcher scholar ) holds is the order of Allah , because the ascertainment of the view of Allah depends upon the verdict of the mujtahid . If it is not so there will be no verdict at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his opinion . ( al-Milal wa'l-nihal , p.98 ) <p> In this case , the mujtahid is taken to be above mistake because a mistake can be deemed to occur where a step is taken against reality , but where there is no reality of verdict , mistake has no sense . Besides this , the mujtahid can be considered to be above mistake if it is held that Allah , being aware of all the views that were likely to be adopted has ordained as many final orders as a result of which every view corresponds to some such order , or that Allah has assured that the views adopted by the mujtahids should not go beyond what He has ordained , or that by chance the view of every one of them would , after all , correspond to some ordained order or other . <p> The Imamiyyah sect , however , has different theory , namely that Allah has neither assigned to anyone the right to legislate nor subjected any matter to the view of the mujtahid , nor in case of difference of views has He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mujtahid can not arrive at a real order then whatever view he takes after research and probe , it is enough for him and his followers to act by it . Such an order is the apparent order which is a substitute for the real order . In this case , he is excused for missing the real order , because he did his best for diving in the deep ocean and to explore its bottom , but it is a pity that instead of pearls he got only the sea-shell . He does not say that observers should except it as a pearl or it should sell as such . It is a different matter that Allah who watches the endeavours may price it at half so that the endeavour does not go waste , nor his passion discouraged . <p> If the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict on law and every opinion shall have to be accepted as correct as Maybudhi has written in Fawatih : <p> In this matter the view adopted by al-Ashari is right . It follows that differing opinions should all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about jurists and do not open your tongue to abuse them . <p> When contrary theories and divergent views are accepted as correct it is strange why the action of some conspicuous individuals are explained as mistakes of decision , since mistake of decision by the mujtahid can not be imagined at all . If the theory of correctness is right the action of Muawiyah and A'ishah should be deemed right ; but if their actions can be deemed to be wrong then we should agree that ijtihad can also go wrong , and that the theory of correctness is wrong . It will then remain to be decided in its own context whether feminism did not impede the decision of A'ishah or whether it was a ( wrong ) finding of Muawiyah or something else . However , this theory of correctness was propounded in order to cover mistakes and to give them the garb of Allah 's orders so that there should be no impediment in achieving objectives nor should anyone be able to speak against any misdeeds . <p> In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has referred to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing their eyes to light , grope in the darkness of imagination , make Faith the victim of their views and opinions , pronounce new findings , pass orders by their own imagination and produce divergent results . Then on the basis of the theory of correctness they regard all these divergent and contrary orders as from Allah , as though each of their order represents divine Revelation so that no order of theirs can be wrong nor can they stumble on any occasion . Thus , Amir al-mu'minin says in disproving this view that : <p> 1 ) When Allah is One , Book ( Qur'an ) is one , and Prophet is one then the religion ( that is followed ) should also be one . And when the religion is one how can there be divergent orders about any matter , because there can be divergence in an order only in case he who passed the order has forgotten it , or is oblivious , or senselessness overtakes him , or he wilfully desires entanglement in these labyrinths , while Allah and the Prophet are above these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These divergences are rather the outcome of the thinkings and opinions of people who are bent on twisting the delineations of religion by their own imaginative performances . <p> 2 ) Allah must have either forbidden these divergences or ordered creating them . If He has ordered in their favour , where is that order and at what place ? As for forbidding , the Qur'an says : <p> That is , everything that is not in accordance with the Divine orders is a concoction , and concoction is forbidden and prohibited . For concocters , in the next world , there is neither success or achievement nor prosperity and good . Thus , Allah says : <p> And utter ye not whatever lie describe your tongues ( saying ) : This is lawful and this is forbidden , to forge a lie against Allah ; verily , those who forge a lie against Allah succeed not . ( Qur'an , 16:116 ) <p> 3 ) If Allah has left religion incomplete and the reason for leaving it halfway <p> was that He desired that the people should assist Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of legislating , then this belief is obviously polytheism . If He sent down the religion in complete form the Prophet must have failed in conveying it so that room was left for others to apply imagination and opinion . This , Allah forbid , would mean a weakness of the Prophet and a bad slur on the selection of Allah . <p> 4 ) Allah has said in the Qur'an that He has not left out anything in the Book and has clarified each and every matter . Now , if an order is carved out in conflict with the Qur'an it would be outside the religious code and its basis would not be on knowledge and perception , or Qur'an and sunnah , but it would be personal opinion and one 's personal judgement which can not be deemed to have accord with religion and faith . <p> 5 ) Qur'an is the basis and source of religion and the fountain head of the laws of shariah . If the laws of shariah were divergent there should have been divergence in it also , and if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Divine word . When it is Divine word the laws of shariah can not be divergent , so as to accept all divergent and contrary views 
##955452 <p> About the Oneness of Allah . This sermon contains principles of knowledge which no other sermon contains <p> He who assigns to Him ( different ) conditions does not believe in His oneness , nor does he who likens Him grasp His reality . He who illustrates Him does not signify Him . He who points at Him and imagines Him does not mean Him . Everything that is known through itself has been created , and everything that exists by virtue of other things is the effect ( of a cause ) . He works but not with the help of instruments . He fixes measures but not with the activity of thinking . He is rich but not by acquisition . <p> Times do not keep company with Him , and implements do not help Him . His Being precedes times . His Existence precedes non-existence and His eternity precedes beginning . By His creating the senses it is known that He has no senses . By the contraries in various matters it is known that He has no contrary , and by the similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Him . He has made light the contrary of darkness , brightness that of gloom , dryness that of moisture and heat that of cold . He produces affection among inimical things . <p> He fuses together diverse things , brings near remote things and separates things which are joined together . He is not confined by limits , nor counted by numbers . Material parts can surround things of their own kind , and organs can point out things similar to themselves . The word ( 1 ) " mundhu " ( i.e. since ) disproves their eternity , the word " qad " ( that denotes nearness of time of occurrence ) , disproves their being from ever and the word " lawla " ( if it were not ) keep them remote from perfection . <p> Through them the Creator manifests Himself to the intelligence , and through them He is guarded from the sight of the eyes . <p> Stillness and motion do not occur in Him , and how can that thing occur in Him which He has Himself made to occur , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how can a thing appear in Him which He first brought to appearance . If it had not been so , His Self would have become subject to diversity , His Being would have become divisible ( into parts ) , and His reality would have been prevented from being deemed Eternal . If there was a front to Him there would have been a rear also for Him . He would need completing only if shortage befell Him . In that case signs of the created would appear in Him , and He would become a sign ( leading to other objects ) instead of signs leading to Him . Through the might of His abstention ( from affectedness ) He is far above being affected by things which effect others . <p> He is that which does not change or vanish . The process of setting does not behove Him . He has not begotten any one lest He be regarded as having been born . He has not been begotten otherwise He would be contained within limits . He is too High to have sons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reach Him so as to assign Him quantity . Understanding can not think of Him so as to give him shape . Senses do not perceive Him so as to feel Him . Hands can not touch Him so as to rub against Him . He does not change into any condition . He does not pass from one state to another . Nights and days do not turn Him old . Light and darkness do not alter Him . <p> It can not be said that He has a limit or extremity , or end or termination ; nor do things control Him so as to raise Him or lower Him , nor does anything carry Him so as to bend Him or keep Him erect . He is not inside things nor outside them . He conveys news , but not with the tongue or voice . He listens , but not with the holes of the ears or the organs of hearing . He says , but does not utter words . He remembers , but does not memorise . He determines , but not by exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of heart ) . He hates and feels angry without any painstaking . When He intends to create someone He says " Be " and there he is , but not through a voice that strikes ( the ears ) is that call heard . His speech is an act of His creation . His like never existed before this . If had been eternal it would have been the second god . <p> It can not be said that He came into being after He had not been in existence because in that case the attributes of the created things would be assigned to Him and there would remain no difference between them and Him , and He would have no distinction over them . Thus , the Creator and the created would become equal and the initiator and the initiated would be on the same level . He created ( the whole of ) creation without any example made by someone else , and He did not secure the assistance of any one out of His creation for creating it . <p> He created the earth and suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it stand without legs , raised it without pillars , protected it against bendings and curvings and defended it against crumbling and splitting ( into parts ) . He fixed mountains on it like stumps , solidified its rocks , caused its streams to flow and opened wide its valleys . Whatever He made did not suffer from any flow , and whatever He strengthened did not show any weakness . <p> He manifests Himself over the earth with His authority and greatness . He is aware of its inside through his knowledge and understanding . He has power over every thing in the earth by virtue of His sublimity and dignity . Nothing from the earth that he may ask for defies Him , nor does it oppose Him so as to overpower Him . No swift-footed creature can run away from Him so as to surpass Him . He is not needy towards any possessing person so that he should feed Him . All things bow to Him and are humble before His greatness . They can not flee away from His authority to someone else in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no parallel for Him who may match Him and no one like Him so as to equal Him . <p> He will destroy the earth after its existence , till all that exists on it will become non-existent . But the extinction of the world after its creation is no stranger than its first formation and invention . How could it be ? Even if all the animals of the earth , whether birds or beasts , stabled cattle or pasturing ones , of different origins and species , dull people and sagacious men -- all jointly try to create ( even ) a mosquito they are not able to bring it into being and do not understand what is the way to its creation . Their wits are bewildered and wandering . Their powers fall short and fail , and return disappointed and tired , knowing that they are defeated and admitting their inability to produce it , also realising that they are too weak ( even ) to destroy it . <p> Surely , after the extinction of the world , Allah the Glorified will remain alone with nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction , as He was before its production : without time or place or moment or period . At this moment , period and time will not exist , and years and hours will disappear . There will be nothing except Allah , the One , the All-powerful . To Him is the return of all matters . Its initial creation was not in its power ; and the prevention of its extinction was ( also ) not in its power . If it had the power to prevent it , it would have existed for ever . When He made anything of the world , the making of it did not cause Him any difficulty , and the creation of anything which He created and formed did not fatigue Him . He did not create it to heighten His authority nor for fear of loss or harm , nor to seek its help against an overwhelming foe , nor to guard against any avenging opponent with its help , nor for the extension of His domain by its help , nor for boasting ( over largeness of His possession ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired to seek its company . <p> Then after its creation He will destroy it , but not because any worry has overcome Him in its upkeep and administration , nor for any pleasure that will accrue to Him , nor for the cumbrousness of anything over Him . The length of its life does not weary Him so as to induce Him to its quick destruction . But Allah , the Glorified , has maintained it with His kindness , kept it intact with His command and perfected it with His power . Then after its destruction , He will resuscitate it , but not for any need of His own towards it , nor to seek the assistance of any of its things against it , nor to change over from the condition of loneliness to that of company , nor from the condition of ignorance and blindness to that of knowledge and search , nor from paucity and need towards needlessness and plenty , nor from disgrace and lowliness towards honour and prestige . <p> ( 1 ) . The meaning is that the sense for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawla " have been formed is opposed to the attributes of " Ever " , " Eternal " and " Perfect " . Therefore , their application to anything would prove that they have come into existence from non-existence and are imperfect . For example , " mundhu " is used to denote time as is " qad wujida mundu kadha " ( this thing is found since so-and-so ) . Here a time limit has been stated , and anything for which a limit of time can be described can not exist from ever or for ever . The word " qad " shows ( indicating the present perfect tense ) the immediate past . This sense also can apply to a thing which is limited in time . The word " lawla " is used to denote the negation of something in another thing , as " ma ahsanahu wa akmalahu lawla annahu kadha " ( how handsome and perfect it would be if it were so-and-so ) . Therefore , the thing for which this word is used would be in need of others

##958250 <h> THEFT AND KLEPTOMANIA <p> Several times it happens that a child spreads its hand to take something that is not his . He forcibly tries to take the eatables , fruits or toys of some other child . Stealthily takes away something from the pocket of the father or from the mother 's purse . He takes sweets and other goodies from the pantry without the knowledge of his mother . Picks up things stealthily from the shops visited by the family . Takes pencils , rubber etc of his siblings and school- mates without informing them . Several children do this sort of things in their childhood . Seldom a person can be found who has never done such things in his childhood . Some parents are very upset finding their children doing such things and start imagining of a bleak future for the child . They feel that their child might turn into a thief or burglar when he grows up . With these pangs of remorse they keep worrying themselves . <p> First of all such parents should give their attention to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the small aberration in the child . Lifting insignificantly small things by the child is not the sign that the child will turn into a thief in the future . They should know the child has not yet reached the stage to appreciate the rights of ownership of others , or to differentiate between what belongs to others and what is his own . The child has subtly strong feelings and jumps to grab whatever attracts his attention . The child will not be naughty by nature but this attitude comes to him from outside influences . <p> ( 245 ) <p> These are all passing phenomena in his early life . When he grows up , he might not do such things . There must be many pious , upright persons who might have done some unintentional stealing in their childhood . But the purpose of telling all this is not that the parents totally ignore reacting to the acts of theft of their children . I only wish to dispel their fears that the children might turn into thieves . Instead of lamenting over such incidents , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of two to three years in particular is not able to distinguish between what belongs to him and what is not his . Whatever comes in his reach , he tries to take . Whatever is attractive to him , he wants to have . At this stage shouting at the child and beating him will not be of any use . The best attitude for the parents will be to practically stop the child from doing such a thing if it happens in their presence . If the child tries to snatch something from another child , they should softly intervene . And despite all this , if the child takes the thing from the other child , the parents should restore it to the real owner as soon as they can . The things that they do n't want the child to handle , they should take care to keep them out of his reach . When the children reach a certain level of intelligence , they will start understanding about ownership of things . Now they will not try to grab others things . However , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea about ownership of things . In such a situation the parents should not remain silent spectators . They should not be complacent now , thinking that the child will automatically give up the habit . He might turn into a thief , or at least a kleptomaniac , who picks up things of <p> ( 246 ) <p> others just for the heck of it , not knowing what he is doing . It is not right to ignore even if the child steals something belonging to his own parents Some parents are so protective of their children that if someone reports that the child has stolen their things , they start wrongly defending their child and blaming the other person of false accusation . <p> Such ignorant parents , with their negative attitude , unknowingly encourage the child to blatantly continue his stealing activity . The child will learn to steal and deny having done it . <p> Therefore the parents should not be unconcerned when they face such a situation . They should make efforts to stop the child from stealing and lying about it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his nature and making reform very difficult . <p> Hazrat Ali has said : <p> " Giving up habits is very difficult . " 1 <p> At the first instance the parents should try to remove the causes of the child wanting to steal . If the child needs pencil , paper or eraser ; the parents should fulfill this need . If they neglect this need of the child , it is likely that he will pick the things from his class- mates . He may even take money from the father 's pocket to buy the things . If the child wants a ball to play and the parents refuse to buy one for him , he might forcibly take the ball of a friend forcibly . Or even he might steal a ball from the neighborhood grocer . The parents must take care to <p> 1 Ghurar al-Hikam , Page 181 . <p> ( 247 ) <p> fulfill the child 's needs to the extent possible . If certain things he wants are beyond their means , they should make the child understand by telling him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do n't have so much money that they immediately buy for him the color pencil box required urgently . He may borrow the box today from his friend to do his immediate task and they shall get him one later . Tough attitude with the child might encourage him to steal . If the parents are keeping eatables locked in the pantry , the child will plan somehow to search the key and take out the goodies for eating . This thing can happen in the near impossible situation when the parents want to eat the things themselves and deny to the child . <p> When the parents hide away their money the child might get inclined to search for it . It is better the parents do n't hide their cash from the children very much . They must take the children into their confidence and should not give them a feeling that things are being hidden from them . They should teach the child that life is spent with some discipline . There are times for eating and they should not always keep munching things . Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Films of crime , theft and robbery should not be shown to the children . Storybooks and radio programs on such subjects should also be avoided . There are many instances that youth caught for crimes have confessed that they got the inspiration from movies for such acts . <p> The most important thing is that the parents and other members of the family try that the environment of their <p> ( 248 ) <p> house is one of honesty and probity where others ' ownership of things is respected . No one takes money from the parents ' pockets and the things are not appropriated without the knowledge of the owner . Even the husband should not rummage the wardrobe of the wife without her knowledge . The parents also should respect the right of ownership of the children and should not handle their things without their consent . <p> The parents should not insult the child over his minor misdemeanors . They should not shout at him calling him names like cheat and thief . They should not threaten him that he would go to jail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reform the child . He might , to the contrary , become stubborn and continue with his stealing . Or , perhaps in a revengeful mood he might commit bigger thefts . <p> The best method to save the situation for the parents would be to treat the child with discretion , love and softness . They should explain the grave consequences of stealing . They should convince him to return the stolen things to the owner and never repeat the act again . <p> But even after these attempts of reforming the child fail , then the only alternative will be to talk to him with a strong and forthright manner . Finally if the child proves totally 
##958251 <h> JEALOUSY <p> Jealousy or envy is a negative trait in human beings . A jealous person always envies others who are happy and comfortable . When he finds something good and attractive with others , he wishes that they lost the thing . Generally such a jealous person is neither capable of snatching away the good thing from the other person nor harm him in any way . He continues to sulk and brood . He will be burning in the flames of jealousy day and night . An envious person is devoid of the pleasures and comforts of the world and the feelings of deprivation and the thought of the amenities enjoyed by others makes his own life miserable . <p> Jealousy weakens the roots of the person 's faith and turns him towards sin and disbelief . Lots of murders , fights and other crimes are the result of envy and jealousy . Sometimes the envious person does backbiting of the person he is jealous of and spreads rumors and inappropriate designations about him . He sometimes causes damage to the properties of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Envy destroys faith in the way fire destroys the fuel . " 2 <p> Jealousy is a part of the human nature . There will hardly be any persons who do n't have this instinct . <p> Therefore , this undesirable instinct must be curbed with all the force at the disposal of a person . It should not be allowed to flourish and grow . If the instinct of envy is allowed to persist , since it is a part of the person 's nature , it would grow at leaps and bounds . It will reach such proportions that fighting it out will not be possible . <p> The best time when good manners are cultivated and the bad ones are eliminated is the childhood of a person . The element of jealousy too will be present in a child . The parents , with their own behavior , and proper attention to the child , can definitely cure the child of the rudiments of the malady of jealousy that manifest in his behavior now and then . If the parents treat all their children equitably , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't arise . The raiment , the food and other things in the use of the children should be of the same quality and standard . They should keep in mind equity in the matter of pocket money and general treatment of the children . They should not overtly compare the capabilities of the children in their presence , and even with others , if there is likelihood of the children learning about the comparison being made . Such attitude can curb whatever degree of capability the weaker child has and might render him totally incompetent These well meaning but ignorant parents think that they are training the child . To the contrary they are n't able to fulfill their purpose and are adding fuel to the fire . The innocent child 's heart gets the ideas of jealousy and hate . He may get motivated to commit acts of enmity . There can always be the risk of his taking out spleen on his own siblings . <p> The parents should never compare their children with others ' . They should never praise other children very much particularly in comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents tell to their children , " How well behaved , polite and studious is our neighbor 's son . How obedient he is and also he helps his mother with her work . His parents are really lucky to have a son like him . " <p> ( 252 ) <p> Such parents must understand that this type of comparison might hurt the ego of the child and have harmful implications . The child , instead of mending his ways , may become adamant and revengeful . <p> The parents must strictly avoid comparing children . Some children are always more proficient , better looking or smarter than others . It is possible that the parents may be more attached to one child than the others . There is no harm in this attitude . This is a normal human instinct . But in talk and actions they should not show any discrimination between the children . They must ensure equitable treatment for all the children . If they desire to give any special treatment to a particular child , they should do it while other children are not around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give equitable treatment to all the children , the element of jealousy , which is instinctive in human nature , will still be present in the children to some extent . Every child wishes to be the darling of the parents and none other should have this privilege . When he notices the parents expressing affection to the other siblings , he will feel momentary pang of jealousy . The child will slowly understand that he has to share the affection of the parents with the other brothers and sisters . The others too have a right over the parents . The parents , with discreet handling of the situation , can make the child accept the other brothers and sisters and thus prevent him from continuing with his feeling of envy . <p> If you find that your son is envious of his brother or sister for some reason : he bullies them , pinches them , and uses harsh words with them , tries to deprive them of their shares of fruits and sweets , then he needs more of your <p> ( 253 ) <p> attention . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . You must impress on him that he is growing big and his little brother needs more attention than him . You must tell him that when he was a small kid like his little brother now , he too required and received more attention . Instead of trying to mend his ways strictly , impress on him that the little children are his own brothers and sisters . They too love him . If he did n't love them , who would ? He must protect them if someone else tries to hurt them . Allah has given to him such lovely brothers and sisters , for which he must be thankful . <p> In conclusion it is necessary to mention that maintaining totally equitable treatment to all the children might be Utopian . How can the parents treat the son , the daughter , the elder and the younger the same way ? The elder children can generally be given more freedom . But the younger ones have to be given more care . The elder ones will get more pocket money . The younger ones require more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement than the daughters . Therefore , keeping in mind the need for equity and freedom , the parents have to adopt different approach for the sons and the daughters . This treatment might give to the children some hard feelings . But if the parents properly explain to them that they have the same affection for all the children , but the norms of behavior for people differ according to the gender and age ... <p> Although envy and jealousy are very undesirable traits in the eyes of Islam , and are in fact considered sins , the spirit of competition and rivalry are the components of efforts and struggle for human advancement . The difference between envy and rivalry is that a person <p> ( 254 ) <p> becomes a rival of another person to match his achievements and to go ahead of him ; but an envious person only feels jealous and is unable to compete and come forward . Rivalry in every field of activity is a healthy phenomenon . The human civilization could have become stagnant without rivalry and competition . <p> One person writes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My parents used to love me more than her . Whatever I desired for , they used to give me . At every opportunity they used to praise me and totally neglected mention of my sister . My sister always used to nag me . Whenever she had a chance , she would beat and pinch me , call me names and break my favorite toys . She never wanted me to be happy for a moment . I used to think why my sister is troubling me so much ? What wrong I have done to her ? She was very jealous of me and perhaps the partial behavior of the parents was reason for this rancor in her mind . The parents never realized that because of their partiality . My sister would try to take revenge on me . Now that my parents are no more , my sister is very kind with me . She 
##960052 <p> IF and WHEN were friends . Every week they met and had lunch . Their conversation usually centred on all the things they were going to achieve . They both had many dreams and they loved to talk about them . This particular Saturday when they met , WHEN sensed that IF was not in a great mood . As usual they sat at the table reserved for them and ordered their lunch . Once they placed their order , WHEN questioned IF . " IF what is wrong with you ? You do n't seem your usual cheery self ? " IF looked at WHEN and replied , " I 'm not sure , I just do n't feel like I am making any progress . This last week I saw a course I wanted to take if only I had the time to take it .

I have been thinking about looking for another job also , but I will wait and when the weather gets nicer I will look then .

They both were talking about when this and if that , finally he could n't take it anymore . " Excuse me gentlemen , " the man said . IF and WHEN both looked at the man and wondered what he wanted .

When he realized the challenges they faced there was no way he could solve their problems ! Curious , IF asked the gentleman , " How do you think you can solve our problems ? " The gentleman smiled and said , " You only need listen to yourselves . It reminds me of an old proverb : ' If and When were planted , and Nothing grew ' . " IF and WHEN looked puzzled . The gentleman smiled and said , " Start counting how many times you use the words ' if ' and ' when ' . Rather than thinking ' if and when ' , start doing , take action , stop talking about ' if and when ' .

##964150 Blessings be upon all of you ) <p> One of our brothers/sisters has asked this question : <p> Assalam Alaikum . Dear brother in Islam , I am a dawoodi bohra by birth and in our community we are not encouraged to read translations from the holy quran . I have been reading the translation over the years and even attend dars on islamic teachings given by a muslim scholar . But when i discuss these teachings with my other bohra friends they ask for the authentication of translations of the Holy Quran . They tell me that because i do not know Arabic then how can i be sure if the translations are correct . It could be altered as per the thinking and belief of the translator . Although i have no doubt about the authentication of these translation , but how do i convince my bohra friends . The reason i am writing this is to somehow convince them in reading the holy quran alongwith the translation from questions , comments and statements received from our readers for circulation in confidentiality . ) <p> Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . whoever He allows to fall astray , none can guide them aright . We bear witness that there is no one ( no idol , no person , no grave , no prophet , no imam , no dai , nobody ! ) worthy of worship but Alone , and we bear witness that Muhammad(saws) is His slave-servant and the seal of His Messengers . <p> May Allah Subhanah bless and increase the quest for your learning this Knowledge of Truth ; and may Allah Subhanah bless and increase your love for your brethren and your people , whom you are trying to bring closer to understand and comprehend the Supreme Words of the Lord All Mighty . May Allah Subhanah bestow upon you patience and wisdom and steadfastness in the path you have chosen , to propagate the Truth to your brethren . May Allah Subhanah accept your sincere striving in His Noble Cause , and reward you for your striving with the Highest Grades in the Gardens of Al-Firdaus . Ameen . <p> Your Question : Although i have no doubt about the authentication of these translation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason i am writing this is to somehow convince them in reading the holy quran alongwith the translation . <p> ! endif&gt; ! if&gt; <p> First and foremost , lets accumulate the assumptions and beliefs our beloved brethren have regarding the understanding of the Glorious Quran and Islam : <p> They are made to believe by their High Priests that the Quran can not be understood by everyone ! <p> They are made to believe that everything the High Priest says and does is absolutely in accordance with the guidance of the Holy Quran ! <p> They are made to believe that the unconditional obedience and reverence in their High Priest is a command of the Quran and a path to their salvation in the Hereafter ! <p> They are constantly told to recite the Quran in Arabic ; but are warned at every occasion never to try to understand it lest they get misguided from this Perfect Book of Guidance ! <p> Their High Priest talks and glorifies the people he wants from the History of Islam , and seldom talks about the guidance of the Quran . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoids teaching the guidance directly from the Quran . <p> Their every rite and ritual and occasion starts with the recitation of the Holy Quran in Arabic , but never ever will they encourage the understanding of these Glorious Words of Allah Subhanah . <p> Unconditional obedience of the High Priest and his family is an absolute must for our brethren to remain in the community ; and challenging or even asking them something about the understanding of the Quran is out of the question ! <p> They neither encourage the understanding of the Quran , nor do they ( want to ) have a translation , nor do they endorse any of the thousands of translations available , nor are they in any hurry to make an effort towards getting their followers to understand the Glorious Quran in the past 500 odd years of the existence of their community ! <p> They have been promised and guaranteed by their High Priest himself , time and time again , that he will personally lead them into Paradise for their this blind and unconditional belief and obedience ! <p> They are encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly never ever to discuss their beliefs with anyone outside their community lest they become misguided ! <p> They are born into this belief , they found their forefathers and their surroundings in this belief , and they earnestly believe in their this belief ! <p> Thus my beloved and dear brother , when someone is born into such a belief , and since his birth saw his fathers and forefathers and all his surroundings following this belief ; it is obviously difficult for him to hear or comprehend something which is not endorsed by his belief ! The culture all around him is so overwhelming , the rites and rituals and customs so overpowering , and the absolute and unconditional obedience and reverence of the High Priest and his family so demanding ; that for him to even think about doing or even hearing something not endorsed or encouraged by his High Priest is as good as blasphemy and disbelief ! <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , in our humble opinion the best way to start this process of inviting to the Truth of the Quran is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brothers , whom you are trying to propagate to understand the Words of Allah Subhanah , but to use their intelligence and their common sense when evaluating your arguments ; for this faculty of intelligence , and power of reasoning , and common sense are indeed very strong tools bestowed upon man from their Lord Most Merciful . <p> Sometimes , in the search of knowledge and to derive the best answers , it might be prudent to ask the right questions which challenge their faculties of intelligence and common sense ! It indeed needs a lot of patience and wisdom for the one who Allah Subhanah has blessed with the knowledge from the Quran to argue with the ones who do not believe ( or do not want to believe ) in the Truth of the Quran ! But that is precisely what our Lord has commanded the believers to do when inviting anyone to the ' way of Allah Subhanah ' . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran : Chapter 16 , Surah An-Nahl Ayat 125 : Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Way and who is Rightly guided . <p> It is imperative that you do not challenge their beliefs at the outset , nor say anything about their faith , no matter how much you think they are against the guidance of the Quran ; for that will do nothing but close their hearts , put them in a defensive mode , and they will not want to hear a word of what you have to say ; and worse they will label you a ' muslim ' and try their best to avoid talking anything about Islam to you ! Man has been bestowed with enough intelligence , power of reasoning , and common sense by the All-Wise Creator that when presented with the Truth ; he will easily be able to determine the Truth from the falsehoods , if he indeed wants to . Thus your duty is not to force them or coerce them to believe in what you have to say ; but rather with extreme patience and wisdom present the Very Words of the Lord All-Mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let their intelligence and common sense determine the Truth from the falsehood ! The Truth is a power unto itself , and there is no bigger Truth than the Glorious Quran revealed by none other than the One Who Created everything in existence ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 17 Surah Bani Israel verse 81 : And declare , " The Truth has come and falsehood has vanished . And falsehood is a thing that must by its nature , vanish ! " <p> Thus , if you have tried everything else , maybe its worth a try to get them to answer simple questions like these listed below . Brother , I repeat again , it is very important that you do not belittle or abuse them or their beliefs ; but use the example of the wisdom of Prophet Ibraheem ( a.s. ) from the Quran when he , as a genuine well-wisher and brother of his people , tried to guide them by naming the stars , the moon , and the sun ( which his people used to worship ) and bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quran 6:76-79 ) . <p> Is there any doubt that the Quran is a Book of Guidance from Allah Subhanah ? <p> Is the Quran authentic and verbatim and preserved in the way it was revealed to Prophet Mohamed ( saws ) ? <p> Is there any book other than the Quran , which the Lord All Mighty revealed for the guidance of mankind ? <p> If this is the only Book of Guidance from our Lord and Creator , then are we taking any guidance from it ? How ? <p> Does reciting it day and night in a language we can not understand give us any guidance to the Straight Path ? <p> Does carrying a few verses in our pockets , or wearing a few verses as a ' taweez ' on our necks , or chanting a few verses a million times give us any guidance ? <p> Is not our duty to understand this Message the Lord has revealed for the guidance of all mankind ? <p> Did Allah Subhanah not Know that not everyone in the world speaks and understands the Arabic language ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand the Arabic language ? <p> Will we be judged on the Day of Judgment according to the guidance of the Holy Quran ? <p> Is Allah Subhanah so unjust that He will Judge mankind even though they could not understand His Message ? <p> Will Allah Subhanah accept our excuse for not understanding His Message because it was in a language different other than the one we understood or spoke ? <p> What would one do if one were to receive a letter in a foreign language which he could not understand , from the King or Ruler or President of a Country : <p> Would he keep reciting it again and again without understanding it ? <p> Would he take a copy of the letter from the King and wear it as a ' taweez ' around his neck ? <p> Would he recite the letter at every good and noble occasion , without ever trying to understand a word of it ? <p> Or would he straight away go to a person he trusts and knows who speaks and understands the language the letter is written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may find out what exactly is required by the King ? <p> Is it possible that the Just Lord would send his Message so that no one could understand it ? and then Judge mankind according to this Message ? <p> Is it possible that the Just Lord would reveal a Message which could only be understood by just one family , or just the one High Priest ? <p> If only the High Priest and/or only his family are able to understand the Quran , then it must be mentioned by Allah Subhanah in His Message ? <p> What if the belief we are born into is not the belief propagated by the Quran ? <p> Would it not be wise to confirm even only once , that our belief , on which depends our ever lasting and never ending life of the Hereafter , is accordance with the guidance of the Quran ? <p> Why does our High Priest or his family never ever encourage the understanding of the Quran ? <p> Why does our High Priest or his family never run classes to understand the Quran ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate the Quran for us so that we can understand the Message of his and our Lord and Creator ? <p> They write and translate so many books , and saheefas , and qaidas , and haptis , and munajaats , and marseeyah , etc. in a language we understand . Then why not the Quran ? <p> If they do n't present a translation of the Quran , neither do they teach it , neither do they encourage it , neither do they allow it ; then how are we to understand the Message of our Lord and Creator ? <p> Are all the existing translations , and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them in all possible languages spoken in the world , written with a political or ulterior motive ? <p> Would it not be wise just to compare and see if the translation of even any one Surah from the several existing translations , and determine if the meanings of these translation match or differ ? <p> When people who see movies or read books dubbed or translated from English to Hindi , or Hindi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their meanings ; could we not understand a simple translation of this all-important Message of our Lord and Creator ? <p> Try translating a few phrases from Gujrati and translating them into English and see how many variation one can make in its meanings ! <p> Could ' bethi jaa ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' sit down ' in English ? <p> Could ' maru ghar ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' my home ' in English ? <p> Could ' asmaan ane zameen ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' heaven and earth ' in English ? <p> If translated with the best intentions , could it be possible that each and every one of all the hundreds and thousands of translations of the Glorious Quran were done with ulterior motives ? <p> Is it even remotely a possibility that we are being deprived of the understanding of the Message of our Lord by some people who discourage us from understanding the Message of our Lord ? <p> Is it even remotely a possibility that the beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsed by the Quran ? <p> Is it even remotely possible that the unconditional obedience and reverence of the family of the High Priest is not a requirement of the Quran ? <p> If we try to understand the Quran , even only once , it will at least confirm the beliefs we are born into are true and our High Priest and his family are guiding us to the Straight Path of Truth ! What then is the harm ? <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , if you ask some of these questions with the genuine intention of getting your beloved friends and brethren to understand the Truth of the Quran , maybe , just maybe , you might be able to trigger their conscience , or their sense of intelligence , or their sense of reasoning , or their common sense and they come a step closer to making an effort to understand the Glorious Quran ! <p> Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 5.521 Narrated by Sahl bin Sad <p> On the day of Khaibar Allah 's Messenger ( saws ) said to Hadrat Ali ibn Abi Taalib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you enter their territory , call them to embrace Islam and inform them of Allah 's Rights which they should observe , for by Allah , even if a single man is led on the right path ( of Islam ) by Allah through you , then that will be better for you than the nice red camels . " ( the absolutely best and prized possessions of those times ) <p> Your Statement : The reason i am writing this is to somehow convince them in reading the holy quran alongwith the translation . My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , Allah is my witness , I have been trying for the last 15 years to get some of my closest family members to read the translation of the Quran ; and have had very little or absolutely no success in most cases ! My own beloved and aged mother , my two sisters , and one of my brothers still refuse to accept the Truth of the Glorious Quran and insist in their unconditional belief , and obedience , and worship of their High Priest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that my very own beloved mother refuses to even come to my house , or eat even a morsel of food from my house ; just only because I have left her belief in her High Priest and his family , and aligned myself to the belief of the Glorious Quran ! Had Allah not had mercy on me , helped me , and guided me ; I swear by Allah Subhanah , I would have been absolutely and utterly ruined ! May my life and the life of my children be the ransom of my beloved and aged mother ! If Allah Wills and helps me , I will continue to try to invite her to the guidance of the Quran until the day Allah Wills to recall either her or me back to His Majestic Presence ; for the Quran guides that the doors of Taubah of our Merciful Lord are open till the moment one meets with his appointment of death . <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , it is nothing but the extension of our genuine love for our family and our loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they may take the steps to be guided aright . Allah Subhanah time and again guides us in His Glorious Quran that our duty is only to invite them to the Straight Path with wisdom and with patience , and in the best and most polite manner ; to guide them aright or leave them astray is in the Absolute Will and Power of the Merciful Lord Alone . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 28 Surah Qasas verse 56 : You can not guide whom you love , but Allah guides whomever He Pleases . And He best knows those who would accept guidance . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 16 Surah Nahl verse 82 : But if they turn away , your only responsibility is to convey the plain Message of Truth ! They recognize the blessing of Allah , yet they deny it , for the majority of them are not inclined to accept the Truth ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 18 Surah Kahf verse 29 : Proclaim , " This ( Quran ) is the Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whosoever wills may reject it . " ( As for those who reject it ) We have prepared for such workers of iniquity a fire whose flames have encircled them . There , if they ask for water , they will be given a drink like the dregs of oil , which will burn their mouths ! What an evil drink , and what an evil abode ! <p> My beloved and dear brother in Islam , you continue your striving with extreme wisdom and utmost patience to invite your brethren to come closer to the understanding of the Glorious Quran ; and seek your reward only from Allah Subhanah , the Lord of the Worlds . Never ever let their abuse , or their ridicule , or their anger , or their boycotts scare or shake you from the path of the Quran that you have chosen for yourself .

Take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love disbelief above faith : if any of you do so , they do wrong . <p> 24 Say : ' If it be that your fathers , your sons , your brothers , your mates , your kindred ; the wealth that ye have gained ; the commerce in which ye fear a decline ; or the dwellings in which ye delight , are dearer to you than Allah , His Messenger ( saws ) , or the striving in His Cause ; then wait until Allah brings about His Decision : and Allah guides not the rebellious . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if my reply has become too lengthy ; for the question you asked is indeed one that is closest to my heart !

But few years ago before i can visualise how wrong and disrespectful to my lord i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was me who was protesting againts my father drunkenness.Now the responsibility of our whole family got shouldered on my maternal uncles.They are good people and made me continue with my studies but they are also devout bohras . By swear of Allah inspite of all the sufferings and mental frustrations i once undergone i am peacefully continuing my studies and study of Islam . The thing which is tickling me today is that from where should i start inviting my loved ones to the truth for the truth of Quran has made completely impatient about my beleifs.let me also know What i can do to bring my father back through the islamic ways . please let me know what the Rasool e allah s way of propogating islam so that it will profit me . May Allah help one who belevied and make his trial easy.May Allah forgive our sins and accept prayers .

He has chosen you for His service and has not laid on you any hardship in your deen . Therefore , be steadfast in the religion of your father , Abraham . Allah had called you ' Muslims " before this , and has called you ( by the same name ) in this Quran also , so that the Messenger may be a witness in regard to you , and you may be witnesses in regard to the rest of mankind . Therefore , establish the ' salaat ' and pay the ' zakaat ' , and hold fast to Allah . He ( Allah ) is your ' Maula ' : what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Allah-o-Akbar ! Allah-o-Akbar ! Allah-o-Akbar ! Allah Subhanah is indeed the Greatest ! All Praise is due to Allah Subhanah Alone Who has guided you to understand and comprehend the Truth of the Glorious Quran and showed you the path which leads to the Siraat-e-Mustaqeem . May Allah Subhanah have Mercy upon you , help you , guide you , protect you , and give you the wisdom and the courage to stay steadfast on the Straight Path . Ameen . <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , it is indeed true that the High Priest and his family absolutely do not encourage our Bohra brethren to read the Quran with understanding , nor do they make any effort in guiding them to the Truth from the Glorious Quran . This is the standard ' modus-operandi ' of the unscrupulous and worldly ' priests ' whose only interest is in subjugating their followers to make them their slaves ( Abde-syedna ) rather than guiding them to become ' Abd-Allah ' ( slaves of Allah Subhanah ) . They neither teach the meaning of the Quran themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other source available . And once they have succeeded in keeping the clear guidance of the Merciful Lord away from their followers , they lead them to all kinds of paths of ' shirk ' in the name of their forefathers , or themselves and their families , and even in the name of some of the most pious and obedient slaves of Allah Subhanah . These unscrupulous ' high priests ' promise them direct access to Paradise for the unconditional obedience of their followers , and these poor and misguided souls , in the absence of any knowledge whatsoever from the Glorious Quran believe in their false promises of Paradise and dare not do or say anything not acceptable to their ' high priest ' ! May Allah Subhanah take full retribution from these evil and wicked ' deceivers ' , who have beguiled a multitude of our beloved brethren with their false promises of Paradise ; and may Allah Subhanah open the hearts of our brethren to come to the understanding of the Quran so that they may worship their Merciful Lord Alone without associating any partners with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved Bohra brethren could understand the Truth of the Quran , they would recognize the price they would have to pay on that Inevitable Day of Judgment for their unconditional obedience of their ' high priests ' ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 2 Surah Al-Baqarah verse 174 : Indeed those , who conceal the commands that Allah has sent down in His Book and barter them away for paltry worldly gains , fill their bellies with fire . Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He regard them as pure and there is a painful torment for them ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 2 Surah Baqarah verse 159 : Those who conceal the clear ( Revelations ) and Guidance We have sent down , after We have made it clear for the people in the Book , on them shall be Allah 's ' laanah ' and the ' laanah ' of those who are entitled to curse ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 9 Surah Taubah verses 34-35 : O you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy men who devour the wealth of others by evil means , and debar the people from the Way of Allah .

The Day shall surely come when the same gold and silver shall be heated in the fire of Hell , and with it will be branded their foreheads , their bodies and their backs . ( And it will be said ) : " Here is that treasure you had hoarded up for yourselves ! Taste now the evil of your hoarded treasure ! " <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 22 Surah Hajj verses 13 : Then , instead of Allah , he invokes those who can do him neither harm nor good . This is the last extremity of deviation . He invokes those who are more likely to do him harm , than good !

As for those who have taken other ' auliyas ' ( guardians ) with Allah ( and justify their this conduct by saying ) : " We serve them only that they may bring us closer to Allah . " Allah will surely judge between them concerning all that in which they differ . Allah does not show guidance to any liar and denier of the Truth . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 10 Surah Yunus verse 18 : These people serve beside Allah those which can neither harm nor benefit them , and say , " These are our ' shofa'a ' ( intercessors ) with Allah ! " ( O Mohammed ) , tell them , " Do you wish to inform Allah of that thing which He knows not in the heavens , or in the earth ? " He is absolutely free from , and exalted above the shirk that they commit . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 33 Surah Ahzab verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Fire , they will say , " Would that we had obeyed Allah and His Messenger ! " And they will say , " O our Lord , we obeyed our CHIEFS and our GREAT MEN , and they led us astray from the Right Path . O our Lord , give them a double chastisment and curse them severely " . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 40 Surah Mumin verse 47-48 : Then imagine the time when these people will be disputing with one another in Hell . The weak ones will say to the haughty ones , " We were your followers ! Now , can you save us from some part of our punishment in Hell ? " The haughty ones will say , " We are all in the same state here , and Allah has already passed judgment between His servants .

My beloved and dear brother in Islam , it is a condition of being guided aright that one does not hide this Truth with him , but rather strives his best to invite all who are willing to listen to good caution to the path of the Glorious Quran , starting with his immediate family as is the direct command of the Lord All-Mighty in His Book of Guidance . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 66 Surah Tahreem verse 6 : O you who have believed , save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel shall be men and stones ; over which shall be appointed fierce and stern Angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only do as they are commanded ! <p> Beloved brother , your hatred and your impatience about the beliefs of your forefathers and your loved ones is nothing but a sign of your ' emaan ' and faith in Allah Subhanah and His Revealed Guidance . The Messenger of Allah ( saws ) said in an authentic and beautiful narration that when the one whom Allah has guided him aright hates to revert back to disbelief as much as he hates to be thrown in the Fire , has indeed tasted the ' halaawa til emaan ' or the ' sweetness of faith ' ! <p> Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 1.15 Narrated by Anas <p> The Prophet ( saws ) said , " Whoever possesses the following three qualities will have the ' sweetness of ' eemaan ' ( faith ) : <p> 1 .

How ? <p> Does reciting it day and night in a language we can not understand give us any guidance to the Straight Path ? <p> Does carrying a few verses in our pockets , or wearing a few verses as a ' taweez ' on our necks , or chanting a few verses a million times give us any guidance ? <p> Is not our duty to understand this Message the Lord has revealed for the guidance of all mankind ? <p> Did Allah Subhanah not Know that not everyone in the world does not speak and understood the Arabic language ? <p> Is the Quran a guidance only for those who speak and understand the Arabic language ? <p> Will we be judged on the Day of Judgment according to the guidance of the Holy Quran ? <p> Is Allah Subhanah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand His Message ? <p> Will Allah Subhanah accept our excuse for not understanding His Message because it was in a language different from that we understood or spoke ? <p> What would one do if one were to receive a letter in a foreign language which he could not understand , from the King or Ruler or President of a Country : <p> Would he keep reciting it again and again without understanding it ? <p> Would he take a copy of the letter from the King and wear it as a ' taweez ' around his neck ? <p> Would he recite the letter at every good and noble occasion , without ever trying to understand a word of it ? <p> Or would he straight away go to a person he trusts and knows who speaks and understands the language the letter is written in , and get him to translate the meaning so that he may find out what exactly is required by the King ? <p> Is it possible that the Just Lord would send his Message so that no one could understand it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it possible that the Just Lord would reveal a Message which could only be understood by just one family , or just the one High Priest ? <p> If only the High Priest and/or only his family are able to understand the Quran , then it must be mentioned by Allah Subhanah in His Message ? <p> What if the belief we are born into is not the belief propagated by the Quran ? <p> Would it not be wise to confirm even only once , that our belief , on which depends our ever lasting and never ending life of the Hereafter , is accordance with the guidance of the Quran ? <p> Why do our High Priest or his family never ever encourage the understanding of the Quran ? <p> Why do our High Priest or his family never run classes to understand the Quran ? <p> Why do our High Priest or his family never translate the Quran for us so that we can understand the Message of his and our Lord and Creator ? <p> They write and translate so many books , and saheefas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marseeyah , etc. in a language we understand . Then why not the Quran ? <p> If they do n't present a translation of the Quran , neither do they teach it , neither do they encourage it , neither do they allow it ; then how are we to understand the Message of our Lord and Creator ? <p> Are all the existing translations , and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them in all possible languages spoken in the world , written with a political or ulterior motive ? <p> Would it not be wise just to compare and see if the translation of even any one Surah from the several existing translations , and determine if the meanings of these translation match or differ ? <p> When people who see movies or read books dubbed or translated from English to Hindi , or Hindi to Malyalam , or Telugu to Hindi , etc. can understand their meanings ; could we not understand a simple translation of this all-important Message of our Lord and Creator ? <p> Try translating a few phrases from Gujrati and translating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its meanings ! <p> Could ' bethi jaa ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' sit down ' in English ? <p> Could ' maru ghar ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' my home ' in English ? <p> Could ' asmaan ane zameen ' be translated to mean into anything other than ' heaven and earth ' in English ? <p> If translated with the best intentions , could it be possible that each and every one of all the hundreds and thousands of translations of the Glorious Quran were done with ulterior motives ? <p> Is it even remotely a possibility that we are being deprived of the understanding of the Message of our Lord by some people who discourage us from understanding the Message of our Lord ? <p> Is it even remotely a possibility that the beliefs we are born into are not the ones propagated and endorsed by the Quran ? <p> Is it even remotely possible that the unconditional obedience and reverence of the family of the High Priest is not a requirement of the Quran ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only once , it will at least confirm the beliefs we are born into are true and our High Priest and his family are guiding us to the Straight Path of Truth ! What then is the harm ? <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , if you ask some of these questions with the genuine intention of getting your beloved family and brethren to understand the Truth of the Quran , maybe , just maybe , you might be able to trigger their conscience , or their sense of intelligence , or their sense of reasoning , or their common sense and they come a step closer to making an effort to understand the Glorious Quran ! <p> Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 5.521 Narrated by Sahl bin Sad <p> On the day of Khaibar Allah 's Messenger ( saws ) said to Hadrat Ali ibn Abi Taalib ( r.a . ) " Proceed and do not hurry .

" ( the absolutely best and prized possessions of those times ) <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , Allah is my witness , I have been trying for the last 15 years to get some of my closest family members to read the translation of the Quran ; and have had very little or absolutely no success in most cases ! My own beloved and aged mother , my two sisters , and one of my brothers still refuse to accept the Truth of the Glorious Quran and insist in their unconditional belief , and obedience , and worship of their High Priest and his family ! So strong and unshakable is their belief , that my very own beloved mother refuses to even come to my house , or eat even a morsel of food from my house ; just only because I have left her belief in her High Priest and his family , and aligned myself to the belief of the Glorious Quran ! Had Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided me ; I swear by Allah Subhanah , I would have been absolutely and utterly ruined ! May my life and the life of my children be the ransom of my beloved and aged mother ! If Allah Wills and helps me , I will continue to try to invite her to the guidance of the Quran until the day Allah Wills to recall either her or me back to His Majestic Presence ; for the Quran guides that the doors of Taubah of our Merciful Lord are open till the moment one meets with his appointment of death . <p> My beloved and dear Brother in Islam , it is nothing but the extension of our genuine love for our family and our loved ones that we invite them to understand the Glorious Quran so that they may take the steps to be guided aright . Allah Subhanah time and again guides us in His Glorious Quran that our duty is only to invite them to the Straight Path with wisdom and with patience , and in the best and most polite manner ; to guide them aright or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Merciful Lord Alone . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 28 Surah Qasas verse 56 : You can not guide whom you love , but Allah guides whomever He Pleases . And He best knows those who would accept guidance . <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 16 Surah Nahl verse 82 : But if they turn away , your only responsibility is to convey the plain Message of Truth ! They recognize the blessing of Allah , yet they deny it , for the majority of them are not inclined to accept the Truth ! <p> Allah says in the Holy Quran Chapter 18 Surah Kahf verse 29 : Proclaim , " This ( Quran ) is the Truth from your Lord : now whosoever wills may accept it , and whosoever wills may reject it .

Never ever let their abuse , or their ridicule , or their anger , or their boycotts scare or shake you from the path of the Quran that you have chosen for yourself . Be aware brother , that the path you have chosen from the Quran will demand untold sacrifices ; your own family members might forsake you , your friends will no longer remain your friends , your community might outcast you , the ones you hold closest to your heart might detest and abhor you .... but my beloved and dear Brother in Islam , you stay constant on the Straight Path of the Glorious Quran in these severe trials and tribulations of this one short and transitory life ; for our return is ultimately back to Him Who Created us and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 9 Surah Taubah verses 23-24 : <p> 23 O ye who believe !

##968450 <p> In the 132 years between 1797 and 1929 , there was no effective regulation of U.S. economy . No federal agencies existed to control corruption , fraud and exploitation on the part of the business class . Even during the Civil War , economic management on a national level was minimal and war profiteering common . As a result the country experienced 33 major economic downturns which impacted roughly 60 of the years in question . These included 22 recessions , 4 depressions , and 7 economic " panics " ( bank runs and failures ) . <p> Then came the Great Depression starting with the crash of the New York stock market in 1929 . This soon became a worldwide affair which lasted until the onset of World War II . Millions were thrown out of work , agricultural production partially collapsed , and the fear of rebellion and revolution was palpable both in the U.S. and Europe . <p> It is to be noted that the way capitalism worked over these 132 years was a function of ideology . This was ( and still is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government was kept as small as possible ( basically having responsibility for internal order , external defense , and the enforcement of contracts ) , the citizenry would have to pay very low taxes and be left alone to pursue their own prosperity . Thus , as the ideology goes , everyone would be free to maximize their own wealth and in doing so also maximize the wealth of the community as a whole . <p> The Great Depression was a real moment of truth for the capitalist West because it suggested to the open-minded that the free market ideology was seriously flawed . Free market practices had brought the economic system to the brink of collapse , and Russia 's newly triumphant communists represented serious competition . So the question that had to be answered was how best to modify the capitalist system so as to preserve the position of the ruling elite . <p> It was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who came up with an answer , at least for the United States . Through a series of economic and social experiments he crafted the New Deal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be emphasized that this was not socialism . In essence , the New Deal was capitalism with safety nets and subsidies . It meant that some entrepreneurs in areas such as agriculture , defense , and other businesses , actually got money from the government to produce their products . On the other end of the spectrum , government money was made available to keep the really poor people from starving and the unemployed solvent while they sought new employment . A national pension plan was devised in the form of social security , and bank deposits up to a certain amount were insured . In addition , new agencies were created to monitor business activities , particularly the stock market and the banks , to prevent the sort of activities that had brought on many of the economic downturns of the past . This was a major step away from the ideal of a wholly free market but most of the citizenry , with the Great Depression at their backs , understood the necessity of the New Deal . Of course , taxes would eventually have to go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Quickly We Forget <p> Essentially , Roosevelt and the New Deal saved capitalism from itself . Left to those , such as Herbert Hoover , who could not escape the paradigm of free market ideology , capitalism in the U.S. may well have followed much of Europe in succumbing to the revolutionary movements of the right or the left . <p> It has been 67 years since the end of WWII and during that time there have been 11 recessions impacting only 10 years of that timespan . Most of these recessions have been mild affairs compared to the 33 that came prior to the onset of the Great Depression , and the welfare safety net has helped the hardest hit to survive . However , since the 1980s , the U.S. economy has become more unstable and some of the downturns more severe . <p> What of the steadfast adherents to the free market ideology ? It would have been nice for the world if the Great Depression had put an end to them all -- but that was not to be . For those who can understand things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ideology is what makes sense of an otherwise chaotic world . Ideology is also what defines good and evil for such minds . So it stood to reason that many committed free marketeers would retreat into a temporary silence and wait for a time to reassert their beliefs . <p> It did not take long . In fact , counting from 1939 and the outbreak of the World War II ( the event that finally marked the end of the Great Depression ) , it took only until 1980 or 41 years . That is two generations which is actually just about right . Unless purposefully passed on from one generation to the next , both skills and memories tend to dim and lose their meaning . So it has been with the memories of what unregulated capitalism cost the nation in the years before the New Deal . <p> Why did things change for the worse in 1980 ? That was the year Ronald Reagan , a B grade actor and man of little intelligence , surrounded by neoconservatives and free marketeer ideologues , was elected president . Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on a path toward deregulation and a resurgence of the free market ideology . It is to be noted that the country 's most recent recession ( 2007-2009 ) has been the worst of the post war era and a direct result of prior deregulation . <p> We are still on that path and the living proof of this fact is that the Republican presidential candidate , Mitt Romney has just selected Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate . Ryan is the Chairman of the Budget Committee in the Republican controlled House of Representatives , and author of a proposed federal budget that would slash social spending ( and those safety nets ) by some $3.3 trillion , ditch Medicare and Medicaid , while simultaneously cutting taxes for the wealthy . Ryan is no less than the reincarnation of a free marketeer who wants to recreate the circumstances that brought us all 33 major economic downturns crowned by the Great Depression . How quickly people forget . <p> Part III -- Social Darwinism As Well <p> It was University of California Professor Robert Reich who recently explained what Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More than any other politician today , Paul Ryan exemplifies the Social Darwinism at the core of the today 's Republican Party . " And what is Social Darwinism ? It is a belief in the necessity of a struggle for survival where only the " fittest " survive . Here is how William Graham Sumner , the 19th century 's leading American spokesman for this outlook , put it . " Civilization has a simple choice . It is either liberty , inequality , survival of the fittest or not-liberty , equality , survival of the unfittest . The former carries society forward and favors all its best members ; the latter carries society downwards and favors all its worst members . " This is may well be Paul Ryan 's version of the struggle between good and evil . By the way , liberty here is defined as the freedom of individuals to pursue wealth in an unfettered way . <p> Following this ideology , a Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan presidency would most likely increase the pace of deregulation and destroy what is left of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , greatly increase the ranks of the poor and unemployed , do away with union rights , and reserve prosperity for the upper class alone . All of this will be done in the name of the liberty . And , it will be guided by an ideological paradigm that has already been historically proven to be disastrous . <p> We can speculate about popular reaction to these policies as time goes on . There will probably be eventual protest in the streets . Those in power will respond with red-baiting tactics and repression against the protesting victims of their policies . Also , keep in mind that these ideologues will almost certainly bring us a new set of wars . And , as we already know , in wartime repression comes easier . If the electoral system works , those responsible should be cast out of office in four to eight years . <p> All in all it is a pretty grim picture . It was George Santayana ( 1863 to 1952 ) , a philosopher with both roots who said that " those who can not remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , so thoroughly attached to our local here and now , are certainly candidates for this fate . <p> GD Star Rating loading ... <p> On the Road to Ryan and Ruin , 9.2 out of 10 based on 15 ratings <h> 2 Responses to " On the Road to Ryan and Ruin " <p> John Hepburn <p> 20 .

##968451 <p> The American removal of Saddam had seemingly led to Iranian and Shiite ascendancy in the Middle East , with the Shiite demographic majority being able to dominate Iraq 's national government , though an autonomous Kurdish region was created , and the Sunnis threatened a civil war . A new pro-Iran Shiite crescent emerged extending from Iraq to Lebanon , as Hezbollah gained power in the latter country . It should be noted that Assad 's Syria , Iran 's principal ally , has been something of an outlier here since its alliance with Iran has been based on national interest , not on religion or ideology . For Syria is a secular nationalist state , and while its politically dominant Alawites are an offshoot from Shiism , they are regarded as heretics by the orthodox Shiites because of their non-Muslim belief in the divinity of Ali , Muhammad 's cousin and son-in-law . <p> Sunni rulers in the Gulf , especially the Saudi leadership , viewed the extension of Shiite/Iranian power and influence with much trepidation . This was greatly compounded by the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the oil-rich Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and in neighboring Bahrain , where they constituted demographic majorities , to engage in protests for greater freedom and a more equitable sharing of the wealth . In February 2011 , after weeks of largely Shiite pro-democracy demonstrations against the Bahrain monarchy , Saudi Arabia , at the behest of the Bahraini royal family , intervened militarily , along with troops from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates ( under the aegis of Gulf Cooperation Council ) , to effectively crush the protests . <p> The Saudis also sought to undercut this expanding Iranian influence by aiding the largely Sunni rebels against the Assad pro-Iranian regime . With additional support from the West , Turkey , and , in all likelihood , Israel , this revolt has reached the stage where the fall of the Assad regime has become a real possibility . <p> The fall of Assad would seriously weaken Iran 's ability to inflict harm on Israel in retaliation against an attack by Israel or the United States . And the goal of Likudnik-led Israel and the neocons is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so weaken the country as to make it incapable of opposing Israel in any significant way -- which most probably would entail the elimination of the Islamic regime . But should Iran fall , the Likudnik-neocon war agenda would still not be complete . It is very likely that Saudi Arabia would be the next target , especially since it has already been mentioned in the neocon war agenda . <p> The involvement of Saudi nationals in the 9/11 terror attacks had provided grist for the contention that the Saudi government itself bore responsibility for Islamic terrorism . For example , not long after 9/11 , neocon David Wurmser claimed in his article " The Saudi Connection : Osama bin Laden 's a Lot Closer to the Saudi Royal Family Than You Think " in the neocon " Weekly Standard " ( October 29 , 2001 ) that the Saudi royal family had actually been behind the atrocity . <p> Max Singer , co-founder of the neoconservative Hudson Institute and a senior research associate at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Israel , contended in a May 2002 article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " constituted the major terror threat in the world . ( A dual citizen , Singer has since moved to Israel . He is now Research Director of the Institute for Zionist Strategies in Jerusalem where he resides . ) To counter this supposed danger , he claimed that it was essential for the United States to attack and dismember Saudi Arabia itself , liberating the Eastern Province . " It is well within the power of the U.S. , " Singer contended , " to make it possible for the EP Eastern Province to become independent from the Wahhabis , a new Muslim Republic of East Arabia . " <p> On June 6 , 2002 , the Hudson Institute , which included on its Board of Trustees not only Singer , but also such prominent neoconservatives as Richard Perle and Donald Kagan , sponsored a seminar , " Discourses on Democracy : Saudi Arabia , Friend or Foe ? , " with the strong implication that " foe " was the right answer . Shortly afterwards , on June 19 , 2002 , the Hudson Institute hosted a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supports the New Global Terrorism " by Dore Gold , who had served the government of Israel as ambassador to the United Nations and had been an advisor to Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon . <p> The American born and educated Gold depicted Saudi Arabia as the main force behind Islamic terrorism . It was not enough for the United States to win military victories over Afghanistan and Iraq , he argued : " But unless the ideological motivation for terrorism is addressed and , indeed , extinguished , then the war on terror will not be won . Saudi Arabia is the breeding ground for Wahhabi extremism and consequently the source of the hatred that impels international terrorist organizations . " ( " Hatred 's Kingdom , " 245 ) <p> Gold held that the " incitement and hatred emanating from mosques and featured in textbooks or on national television networks " in Saudi Arabia needed to be " monitored and collected " by the international community " because such incitement leads to horrible violence . " ( " Hatred 's Kingdom , " 247 ) In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , the United States and likeminded nations -- determine what ideas could be promulgated in Saudi Arabia . <p> Neocons within the Bush administration were circumspect about their anti-Saudi program , in recognition of Saudi Arabia 's traditional alliance with the United States revolving around oil and the Bush family 's ties to the Saudi regime , but they risked bringing it out in the open on a few occasions . On July 10 , 2002 , Laurent Murawiec , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , briefed the Defense Policy Board , the advisory panel for the Department of Defense , about Saudi Arabia , at the behest of board chairman Richard Perle . Murawiec described the kingdom as the principal supporter of anti-Americanism . " Saudi Arabia , " Murawiec pontificated , " is central to the self-destruction of the Arab world and the chief vector of the Arab crisis and its outwardly directed aggression . The Saudis are active at every level of the terror chain , from planners to financiers , from cadre to foot soldier , from ideologist to cheerleader . Saudi Arabia supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of virulent hatred against the U.S. from Saudi media , ' educational ' institutions , clerics , officials -- Saudis tell us one thing in private , but they do the contrary in reality . " <p> Murawiec said that the United States should demand that Riyadh stop funding fundamentalist Islamic outlets around the world ; that it prohibit all anti-U.S . and anti-Israeli propaganda in the country ; and that it " prosecute or isolate those involved in the terror chain , including in the Saudi intelligence services . " If the Saudi government refused to comply with that ultimatum , Murawiec held that the United States should invade and occupy the country , including the holy sites of Mecca and Medina , seize its oil fields , and confiscate its financial assets . <p> Although the Bush administration disavowed Murawiec 's scenario as having nothing to do with actual American foreign policy , it was quite apparent that Perle shared Murawiec 's anti-Saudi position . In their " An End to Evil : How to Win the War on Terror , " Perle and his co-author David Frum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Saudis qualify for their own membership in the axis of evil . " Frum and Perle explicitly rejected the traditional American policy of friendship with the Saudi rulers : " For thirty years , U.S. Saudi policy has been guided by the dogma that , problematic as the Saudi monarchy is , it is better than any likely alternative . September 11 should have dispelled that illusion forever . " ( " End to Evil , " 138 ) <p> Frum and Perle were especially concerned about the Saudis ' funding of " terrorism , " with " terrorism " interpreted very broadly . Thus it was essential for the United States to " Demand that the Saudis cease the Wahhabi missionary efforts in the United States and elsewhere abroad . " ( Frum and Perle , " End to Evil , " 139 ) Moreover , Frum and Perle stated that the United States should " Warn the Saudis that anything less than their utmost cooperation in the war on terror will have the severest consequences for the Saudi state . " Implied was American support for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Independence for the Eastern Province would obviously be a catastrophic outcome for the Saudi state , " Frum and Perle opined . " But it might be a very good outcome for the United States . Certainly , it 's an outcome to ponder . " ( " End to Evil , " 139 ) <p> The July/August 2002 issue of " Commentary " contained an article titled " Our Enemies , the Saudis " by historian Victor Davis Hanson , in which he wrote : " Saudi Arabia is the placenta of this frightening phenomenon radical Islam . Its money has financed it ; its native terrorists promote it . . . . Surely it has occurred to more than a few Americans that , without a petroleum-rich Wahhabism , the support for such international killers and the considerable degree of ongoing aid to those who would destroy the West would radically diminish . " To deal with the alleged Saudi menace , Hanson advocated a United States policy " to spark disequilibrium , if not outright chaos " in Saudi Arabia . " Even should fundamental changes go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be much worse than what we have now . " <p> The leading neoconservative expert on Saudi Arabia ( acclaimed an expert even in non-neocon circles , although lacking academic credentials ) was Stephen Schwartz , author of numerous articles and a best-selling book , " The Two Faces of Islam : The House of Sa'ud from Tradition to Terror " ( Doubleday , 2002 ) , in which he posited a Saudi/Wahhabist conspiracy to take over all of Islam and spread terror throughout the entire world . Schwartz , the son of a Jewish father and gentile mother , has a rather bizarre history , being at one time a member of a left-wing revolutionary Trotskyite revolutionary group and using the name Comrade Sandalio , and then converting to Islam ( becoming a student of Sufism and an adherent of the Hanafi school of Islam since 1997 ) , taking the name Suleyman Ahmed and now often going by the name Stephen Suleyman Schwartz . In fact , Schwartz remained attached to Trotsky , writing in the conservative " National Review " ( online , June 11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the Trotsky who alone . . . said no to Soviet coddling of Hitlerism , to the Moscow purges , and to the betrayal of the Spanish Republic , and who had the capacity to admit he had been wrong about the imposition of a single-party state , as well as about the fate of the Jewish people . " <p> Schwartz endeared himself to neoconservatives not for his apologias for Trotsky , though some neocons once had connections with Trotskyism , but by his bashing of Saudi Arabia . Neocon luminary Bill Kristol wrote that " No one has done more to expose the radical , Saudi-Wahhabi face of Islam than Stephen Schwartz . " <p> In his " The Two Faces of Islam , " Schwartz argued that there were essentially two fundamentally different types of Islam . Mainstream Islam was basically benign and tolerant of other religions . The Wahhabism of Saudi Arabia , in contrast , allegedly preached hatred and violence toward other religions , including other versions of Islam , and was thus not authentic Islam at all . " The real source of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perversion of Islamic teachings by the fascistic Wahhabi cult that resides at the heart of the Saudi establishment . " ( " Two Faces of Islam , " xiii ) <p> Schwartz went so far in his polemic against the Saudi government as to claim that Osama bin Laden was not really an enemy of the Saudi regime , but remained " courteous to the Saudi rulers . " ( " Two Faces of Islam , " 117-18 ) Indeed , Schwartz presented Osama as nothing more than a member of the Saudi government 's worldwide Wahhabi terrorist network . In actuality , Osama , in December 2004 , called for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy in a taped message posted on a website , which was followed by a number of terrorist attacks in the kingdom . <p> In an apparent flight from reality , Schwartz equated the global threat of Saudi Arabia to that of the totalitarian military mega-powers of Communist Russia and Nazi Germany . " With the collapse of the Soviet state , " Schwartz wrote , " Wahhabism effectively replaced the Communist movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic West . " ( " Two Faces of Islam , " 175-76 ) And in the Saudi regime 's alleged totalitarian social control , Schwartz saw similarities to Stalinist Russia . " In this respect , " Schwartz opined , " Saudi Arabia resembles the Soviet Union at the height of Stalin 's forced collectivizations and famines in the early 1930s ; outsiders see only what the regime wants them to see . " ( " Two Faces of Islam , " 260 ) <p> In Schwartz 's delusional view , the " Wahhabi-Saudi regime . . . embodies a program for the ruthless conquest of power and a war of extermination against ' the other , ' Islamic as well as Judeo-Christian . " ( " Two Faces of Islam , " 179-180 ) . Saudi Arabia had to be annihilated , Schwartz insisted , just as had been the case with Nazi Germany . " The war against terrorist Wahhabism is therefore a war to the death , as the second world war was a war to the death against fascism . " ( " Two Faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary neocon target for war , Saudi Arabia and its " expert " Stephen Schwartz were relegated to the periphery , even though Schwartz began to equate " political Shiism " as a malevolent danger comparable to Wahhabism . Schwartz , however , has not been forgotten . With neocon Daniel Pipes ( who is the founder of Campus Watch , a group that monitors university professors of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies for alleged anti-American and anti-Zionist views ) , Schwartz founded the Center for Islamic Pluralism ( CIP ) , for which he now serves as Executive Director .

##968452 <h> America and Muslims to THINK of Rational Dialogue <h> Many of you pretend like actors and have no understanding of Islam and its primary values to deal with others . None of you are serious about your own intentions and beliefs . <p> By Mahboob A. Khawaja , PhD . <p> After the 9/11 tragedy , American politics is obsessed with anti-Islamic hatred and Islamophobia has assumed to become an industry to be used by the neoconservatives and continued proponents of the war on terrorism . More recently , the documentary movie reportedly made by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula or Sam Bassile 52 years old real estate developer originally from Israel ( as mentioned by the NYTimes ) available on the You Tube and elsewhere on the internet allegedly portraying false images of Islam and Prophet Mohammad 's life is not rare or the end in itself . Islamophobia is an organized scheme of things -- an industry -- an anti-Islamic institutionalized hatred campaigns and fear-mongering across the US and Western Europe . It is business as usual by entrepreneurs and lobbyists of the Military-Industrial Complex warmongering corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European people fearful of the growing Islamic presence in these parts of the world as if Muslims were the outcome of the eye of the storm to destroy the industrial progress or to halt the planned perpetuated fear of Islam . America and Muslims NEED to rethink about their perceptions and inborn fears toward each other . Perpetuated animosity and attacks on diplomatic missions will not solve any problems but create more and dangerous ones to be unsolvable . A crisis situation requires responsible critical thinking , not hasty actions of jumping into fireballs , killing of diplomats , verbal outbursts and burning of others flags . None of these are the rational strategies to address the problem . America as a global power must realize its moral and political responsibility in an international context . Islamophobia is not the means to deal with morally and intellectual conscientious Muslim people . <p> In early 90 's , Professor Samuel Huntington ( the Clash of the Civilization scenarios ) , characterized the Muslim world as " Islam 's bloody borders . " In our communications , Dr. Huntington indicated that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping the Muslim moral and intellectual fabric . They call the politically active Arabs and Muslims as members of " al-Qaida " ( the organization originally perceived , developed and managed by the CIA and American political leaders to fight the USSR-former Soviet Union occupation o Afghanistan . It is dead long time except its label is used when and if convenient to the warmongers . Richard Chamberlain observed : " Al Qaida " is a CIA fabricated enemy , created as an opponent for the CIA-created " neocon " supermen , intended to embed an invisible terror army amongst the people , in order to perpetually justify waging war upon the people . <p> No doubt politics is a game of pretension and always remains problematic . Politicians need problems to get public attention and to argue being the deliverers . Most often , they are not capable of doing any public good except being treacherous , cynical and deceitful to their ideas and ideals and to the public interests they claim to serve . It is an election year in the US and both presidential candidates desperately need new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the public passion and opinions and gain in number games . Strange as is , Arabs and Muslims of the world are providing that food for thoughts to the US politicians . This is something a planned outcome of the Islamophobia movement in the US . Last year , Terry Jones wanted to burn the copies of the Qura'an- the Divine Book of Islam . It prompted action-reaction responses and people throughout the globe got attentive why such an extreme act of ignorance against Islam , when Muslims believe and respect Judaism and Christianity as part of their indivisible faith . A Danish journalist embarked on folly and carved up a cartoon of Prophet Mohammad . The world-over reaction by Muslims and others consumed enormous time , energies and thoughts but what was the end of it ? Few months earlier , American troops burned the copies of the Qura'an in Kabul . Massive protest but nothing changed on the ground . Obama and his administration cited ignorance about the vitality of the Qura'an . Thomas Jefferson had copies of the Qura'an and used it to devise the moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans that ignorant ? <p> Islamophobia is well organized and flourishing across the Western cultural domains , again investing in " fear-mongering " of Islam and generating sense of insecurity to peace and global harmony . There is a problem with the Arabs and Muslims at large , they are emotional people , unimaginative and often shortsighted when it comes to rational THINKING and steadfastness in situations of volatile circumstances . The Western politicians want Muslims to act like immature actors and bodies on their script originating from the Islamophobia scheme of things . This could be justified to the coming dangers to plan more wars of terrorism or terrorism of wars against the innocent people in the Islamic world . Truth speaks its own language . Islamophobia is intricately linked to the US-Western policies and foreign relations with the Arab and other Muslim countries . <p> Despite having a knowledge-based culture , the Islamophobia organizations generate hatred and fear throughout the global news media . They envisage and project the Muslim people as of draconian age , violent and lacking reason , science , and intellectual foresight . On September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , saying violent Islam lacked it . This contradicts the European history where Islamic civilization flourished for eight hundred years in Spain ( Al-Anduls ) and contributed to knowledge , scientific developments and helped the Europeans to become civilized when they were species of the dark ages . Was Pope Benedict not expected to be knowledgeable of these pertinent facts of the European history ? <p> Rev. Franklin Graham , head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association , November 2001 made it known : " ( Islam ) is a very evil and wicked religion wicked , violent and not of the same god ( as Christianity ) . " " Islam is Evil , Christ is King . " Allegedly written in marker by law enforcement agents on a Muslim prayer calendar in the home of a Muslim being investigated by police in Dearborn , Michigan , July 2002 . ( Gary Leupp , " Challenging Ignorance on Islam " ) . <p> Hillary Clinton called the current battling scenes as " disgusting and reprehensible . " President Obama claims , he has respect for Islam and understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purpose . What if the US administration would move to arrest Sam Basile -- the media described filmmaker of the controversial documentary movie and charge him with insult and injuries to the American public interest . After all America is part of the global moral and intellectual hub of the mankind , it is not out from somewhere from another planet of subhuman beings . The move maker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is reported as a fraudulent person who was convicted in California in 2010 . Several members of the film cast and crew have disavowed the movie , saying Bassile/Nakoula duped them . Actress Cindy Lee Garcia said she thought she was in a film about ancient Egypt called Desert Warriors . <p> " It was going to be a film based on how things were 2,000 years ago , " she told the local newspaper " It was n't based on anything to do with religion , it was just on how things were run in Egypt . There was n't anything about Mohammed or Muslims or anything . <p> Recent developments suggest a breaking point , a transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonization of Muslims . While underscoring the freedom of religion , the Obama administration is " beating the drums " of a broader war against Islam ............. The rising tide of xenophobia , sparked by the proposed Ground Zero mosque and community center , has all the appearances of a PSYOP ( Psychological Operation ) which contributes to fomenting hatred against Muslims throughout the Western World . <p> After the 9/11 and incidentally on the anniversary of the 9/11 on that very day , American politicians are vengeful , paranoid and often appear to be victims of their own obsession and insanity -- that all problems must be solved by power , by military interventions , killings and devastation of other nations and habitats- more so of the Arabs . Rick Maze ( Army Times , April 26 , 2010 ) reports that 18 American veterans commit suicide every day . In the same write-up Dr. Janet Kemp , VA Coordinator is noted to have saved 7,000 veterans from the actual act of suicide . This is appalling and exposes the bogus nature of the US led wars in the Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital issue in the real world affairs . Do the politicians view the people as eggs and chicken to be broken and slaughtered ? Now , the media reports that President Obama is sending warships to Libya because of the killing of its ambassador and three other diplomats . Is it not the same mindset as of George Bush to take military action in haste without rational thinking of the consequences on the US and others ? Nobody has invincible armies and nobody can conquer the world on its own . Only people with monstrous mind can think that way . In the 21 st century of global citizenry and across the globe communication channels , complex problems do not require military actions but diligent and thoughtful moves to diffuse the crises . American scholars and experts in peace and conflict management know it well . But , this is not part of the official American Big Thinking after victimizing the mankind under the false flag of terrorism for over a decade and killing three million Iraqi civilians and million or so killing and displacement of Afghanis and several thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reactionary Muslim people are slipping into violent behavior on problems requiring serious thinking , attitudes and understanding to come up with peaceful and workable remedies . Muslims can not fight the madness of the US-British mindsets . Muslims failed to recognize their moral precepts taught by Islam and political weaknesses and strengths within the global system of political affairs . Burning flags and denouncing the US-Israel would not solve any problems ; it will enlarge the scope to more critical catastrophic incidents beyond human control . <p> Arab rulers have no armies to defend Islam . They pump oil and enjoy living in palaces , not with people -- the illusion of so called economic prosperity soon to be dismantled as is the case of change now in progress . Most Arabs are still living under the powerful shadows of authoritarian rulers who would not allow them to speak openly . People in Libya , Tunisia and Egypt are discovering their newly gained freedom from the past captivity . They need to develop new thinking for change and the essential political capacity-building for democracy , public institutions and encourage educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American policy makers were intelligent enough to envisage the contemporary priorities of global peace and relationships , they could have set-up an advisory body of Muslim scholars and American intellectuals /experts to assist on sensitive US-Muslim relations and problem solving . America having been glued to the pro-Israeli lobbyists lacks freedom of rational thoughts and actions to deal with the global citizens and more so with the Arab-Islamic world . Its captivity to one interest group is the real problem , not the changing landscape of the Arab people . To Muslims , Islam teaches respect and co-existence with other religions and people of the Book . Many could be pretending as if they are doing any good for the cause of Islam or to protect the honor of Prophet Mohammad while they pursue their own ambitions of power . Prophet Mohammad life is a role model for peace and human coexistence . He was always open to communication and took initiatives to have direct communication with his worst foes in Makkah and Madinah . He was commanded by God to invite them to peace and to Islam . Have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamophobia conspiracies considered the teachings , morals and practices of Prophet Mohammad ? Those rushing to hasty conclusions and jumping into fires and burning others national flags and symbols , when did you convey the message of Islam to your enemies ? Are you rational beings and know the short-long terms consequences of your actions ? What would you achieve out of this staged drama and acts of irrational behaviors and utter nuisance ? Your enemies planned this way as the makers of the movie claim that Muslims will react in anger and violent behaviors and disrupt the normal life . They wanted to depict you as reactionary without THINKING as most have not seen the documentary film -- a herd like move to drain out your thinking and positive energies and to make you dumb and dull in real life . You compete in shouting matches , expend your time and precious energies and simply go home to sleep . Simply , you have not encountered the real world issues and how to deal with them . <p> Do you remember the paradoxes of history ? Do you recall what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crusaders from the Muslim lands ? Do you remember how Sultan Salahudeen treated his enemies -- King Richard and others even in the battlefield ? Do you know that for ages the European feared Salahudeen -- the Conqueror of Jerusalem -- the Leader of the Muslim Ummah because Allah 's help was with him . Many of you pretend like actors and have no understanding of Islam and its primary values to deal with others . None of you are serious about your own intentions and beliefs . What if you were organized as morally and intellectually conscientious people and knew the complex nature of global politics and had intelligent leaders and freedom to THINK before you act and communicate with moral strength not weaknesses to the enemies of Islam , do n't you THINK , you would have accomplished something better , something durable in dealing with some of the emotionally charged issues ? In the 21 st century of New World of Hope and Optimism , Men who are universally hated and feared can be approached , communicated and can be imagined to be sitting in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , if you are organized as an intelligent group of people , you are confident of your moral and intellectual strength and have responsible and able leaders to represent your interests and priorities . By the same token , if American leaders were intelligent and responsible , they could have avoided these violent developments and opened communication channels with the Muslim world as President Obama had originally claimed to do so . But he rescinded his promises and deceived the mankind on the war of terrorism , closing of the Guantanmobay and normalization of relationships with the Islamic world . The US leaders are not waging any wars for human freedom , peace and liberty anywhere ; they need to see the mirror for accountability .

##971051 <p> And if any of your slaves ask for Mukatabat , accept it give it to them if you know any good in them and for this give them out of the wealth which Allah has given to you . ( 24:33 ) <p> The above quoted verse of Surah Nur mentions the directive of ? Mukatabat ? . At the time of the revelation of the Qur ? an , the institution of slavery was as essential to the economic and social needs of the society as the institution of interest is considered in present day societies . In markets , slave-men and slave-women were bought and sold , and affluent houses had slave-men and slave-women of all ages . In such circumstances , a sudden directive for their emancipation would have resulted in many evils : for livelihood , men would have been forced to resort to beggary and women to prostitution . For this very reason the Qur ? an adopted a gradual way to eradicate this evil from society and after many gradual measures of eradication , the above quoted verse revealed a directive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it as a term which means that a slave make a contract with his master according to which he would be required to pay a certain sum of money in a specific time period or would carry out a specific service for his master ; once he would successfully fulfill either of these two options , he would stand liberated . In the above quoted verse , the Almighty has directed the Muslims to necessarily accept this contract made by a slave if he wants to make it and has the required ability to become financially independent . It is further stated that a Muslim government should spend money from the public treasury , which here is called the treasury of God , in helping such slaves . It is evident from the words of the verse that just as this right of ? Mukatabat ? was granted to slave-men , it was also granted to slave-women . This , in other words , was in fact a declaration that slaves could now be masters of their destiny and could obtain liberation whenever they wanted . The above stated verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , various other directives were given at various stages because of which it gradually became possible for this evil to be eradicated from the society . These are summarized below : 1 . In the very beginning of its revelation , the Qur ? an regarded emancipation of slaves as a great virtue , and urged people in a very effective way to do so . the words it adopted ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( release the necks ) can be well imagined by a person who has flare for the language . It is evident from the context of such expressions ? wherever they are found in the Qur ? an ? that it has regarded this virtue to be the first as well as the greatest step in pleasing God . 1 In a similar manner , the Prophet ( sws ) also urged Muslims to liberate humanity from the yoke of slavery in the following words : ? Whoever liberated a Muslim slave , the Almighty in return for every limb of that slave would shield every limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People were urged that until they free their slaves they should treat them with kindness . The way their masters had total and unchecked control of them in the age of ignorance was put an end to . They were told that slaves are human beings too , and no one should in any way violate the rights they possess as human beings . Abu Hurayrah ( rta ) narrated from the Prophet ( sws ) : ? Slaves have a right to food and clothing and he shall not be asked to carry out an errand that is beyond him ? 3 . Abu Dharr Ghaffari ( rta ) narrates from the Prophet ( sws ) : ? They are your brothers . The Almighty has made them subservient to you . So whatever you eat , feed them with it , whatever you wear , clothe them with it and never ask them to do something which is beyond them and if there is such a task then help them out with it ? 4 . Ibn ? Umar ( rta ) narrates from the Prophet ( sws ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should atone this sin by liberating him ? 5 . Abu Mas ? ud ( rta ) says : ? Once when I was beating my slave I heard a voice from behind me : ? O Abu Mas ? ud you should know that the Almighty has more power over you ? . When I turned back , I found that it was the Prophet . I immediately remarked : ? O Messenger of God , I release him for the sake of God ? . The Prophet said : ? Had you not done this you would have been given the punishment of the Fire ? . 6 Ibn ? Umar ( rta ) narrates that once a person came to the Prophet ( sws ) and asked : ? How many times should we forgive our servant ? . At this , the Prophet kept quiet . He asked again and the Prophet again kept quiet . Upon being asked the third time , he answered : ? Seventy times in a day ? . 7 3 . In cases of un-intentional murder , Zihar , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atonement and sadqah 8 . 4 . It was directed to marry off slave-men and slave-women who were capable of marriage so that they could become equivalent in status ? both morally and socially ? to other members of society . 9 5 . If some person were to marry a slave-woman of someone , great care was exercised since this could result in a clash between ownership and conjugal rights . However , such people were told that if they did not have the means to marry free-women , they could marry , with the permission of their masters , slave-women who were Muslims and were also kept chaste . In such marriages , they must pay their dowers so that this could bring them gradually equal in status to free-women . The Qur ? an says : <p> If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women , he may wed believing girls from among those whom you own : and Allah has full knowledge about your Faith . You are one from another : wed them with the permission of their owners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the only condition is that they should be kept chaste , neither being lustful , nor taking paramours ? This permission is for those among you who fear sin ; but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint . And Allah is Ever-Forgiving , Most Merciful.

Fornication was regarded as an offence as a result of which prostitution centers that were operated by people on the basis of their slave-women were shut down automatically , and if someone tried to go on secretly running this business , he was given exemplary punishment . 11 8 .

A big source of the institution of slavery at the advent of the last Prophet ( sws ) were the prisoners of war . The Qur ? an rooted this out by legislating that prisoners of war should be freed at all costs ? either by accepting ransom or as a favour by not taking any ransom money .

I want to go back for work not only for raising economic of my family but to get back again my career path and my aim to get scholarship .. <p> Salaam <p> I think it depends on the attitude of people where you live , how much diversity there is , and also what type of job you are applying for . <p> In areas with a reasonable amount of cultural diversity and tolerance , I never felt hijab was a big issue in jobs that did not involve the public ( for instance , computer programming ) , but I did feel it was an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers ( for instance , tutoring ) . <p> Sometime the hijab is not really the issue too . Are you sure you are not sending out any subconscious signals ( for instance , that you 'd really rather not return to the work force with a child , or that work is no longer your #1 priority , or that you are uncomfortable being different as a muhajabah ) ? Some employers do n't like gaps in your work history ( even if you have a good excuse ) or wo n't hire you if they do n't feel you are dedicated to making your job/career a priority ( depending on the job ) . If you have signs of instability in your work history that might also be a factor for some . <p> Can you take your picture off your CV and see if that helps ? <p> Imam Husain ( A ) replied to a man who said , ' Sit down so we can debate about religion ' -- ' I am aware of my religion , and my path is clear for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and seek it .

I do remember the shocked looks on some faces when i went into interviews ie my aussie accent over the phone vs me as hijabi when i enter the room , but you know what , thats ok - they get over it lol. be comfortable with who are , smile and do your best . If they know whats good for them , they 'll want you . Alhamdulillah i have had my short-term contracts extended atleast 8 times and interviewed and been successful in higher positions twice - all being in Hijab . I 'm only saying this as ' encouragement ' not to toot my horn . Allah ( swt ) truly helps - we take one step forward and He will help us with the rest if it ( job etc ) is good for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would suggest you do nt either ( unless it is a requirement for application ) <p> Be yourself , be confident in your abilities and all will be fine - Allah ( swt ) knows what positions and jobs are good for you .

I 'm only saying this as ' encouragement ' not to toot my horn . Allah ( swt ) truly helps - we take one step forward and He will help us with the rest if it ( job etc ) is good for us . <p> I 've never sent my photo with my CV and I would suggest you do nt either ( unless it is a requirement for application ) <p> yeah some crazy we know was thinking including her pic to make sure wasnt faced with prejudiced idiots , remember ? thank god she decided not to in the end . <p> fanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally harder times to find a job , period . there are times when your hijab acts in your favour because it makes people remember you better . ie the standout factor . <p> Al-Mufeed says : man SC is no fun when moderators do their job Al-Mufeed says : its only interesting to read the threads Al-Mufeed says : when every one starts Al-Mufeed says : abusing each other Al-Mufeed says : and saying really stupid things Al-Mufeed says : but then by then they always close Al-Mufeed says : the threads <p> From my experience working as a career counselor for a university , it is definitely not recommended to include a picture with a resume ( at least in the US ) . They may not have even noticed your hijab but instead focused on the fact that you were n't following the standard way of applying for jobs . You also might have someone knowledeable look over your resume to be sure it 's in good shape as well , since sometimes the resume itself serves as a turn off for employers . You want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position applied for , as you want to include the key words and skills that they mentioned they are looking for in the job description . Many companies simply put the resumes into a computer program and scan them for key words . If the key words are n't found , the resume goes in the trash . <p> With that being said , are you not getting interviews , or are you not getting call-backs ? If you are n't getting interviews , the problem is with your resume ( or the content on your resume ) . If you are n't getting call-backs , then the problem is your interviewing . Knowing how to answer questions and give them answers they are looking for is something that requires a bit of research and a lot of practice . It may not have anything to do with your hijab but with these other issues instead . Plus as bint al hoda mentioned , you could be giving off vibes that you are n't aware of . I 'm sure you 've gone through a lot of changes since working last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you interact with others . Even feeling self-conscious about wearing hijab can end up making you just seem really nervous or not very confident in general . <p> I need your share about my question . I found that its difficult for me to find a job after wearing hijab . It 's been a year since im pregnant and have a baby . I 'm wearing hijab this 1,5 year . after resign from my job because of my pregnancy , i want to go back for work again . I always give my CV and photograph in my application .

I want to go back for work not only for raising economic of my family but to get back again my career path and my aim to get scholarship .. <p> ws , what do you mean by status ? from the sounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting any interviews . the problem may not be your hijabi picture ( which you probably want to take out anyway ) , it may be that your CV and cover letter/application has nt been written well enough . You may want to get someone 's help with it . Also you may want to practice answering interview questions , in the event that you get called to an interview . Being relaxed and sounding confident are really essential . <p> Al-Mufeed says : man SC is no fun when moderators do their job Al-Mufeed says : its only interesting to read the threads Al-Mufeed says : when every one starts Al-Mufeed says : abusing each other Al-Mufeed says : and saying really stupid things Al-Mufeed says : but then by then they always close Al-Mufeed says : the threads <p> I do n't think you should submit a photograph with your resume and application . If they like your resume , they will call for an interview . At the interview , you can win them over with your knowledge , skills and positive attitude . <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on where your are ( country/state ) . <p> Thank you for all your response . Yes I think I should upgrade my resume and cover letter . Otherwise , what might make me not confident was once when I got interviewed , the man who interviewed me was never looking at me and was not interest with me from the first time . well i assumed that time because i was pregnant so they think that i 'm not qualified.it 's happened few months after wearing hijab . And the other interview is i guess that company afraid i cant get maximum on work because i have baby and the job need me to travel for some days regularly . Well most of people in my country are moslem . but few of us wearing hijab . Some companies are not alowing the women to wear hijab . That 's what im afraid about . But anyway , thanks for all of ur share and suggestion . I 'll keep trying .. <p> I can say I never really had a problem finding a job with the hijab , infact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US is all about integration and minorities working . It did nt matter that I was white , I had a scarf and was Muslim so I was considered a " minority " and that def. gave me a better advantage . <p> The only real places I think where it 's hard to get a job with a scarf is in the beauty industry ... cosmotology , nails , skincare because those women tend to have to dress up , wear a ton of makeup , have their hair and nails done and with a scarf ... it just does nt work as great , plus you have to touch people and unless ur in a womans only salon , u 're gon na have to touch men . <p> What country r you in and what sort of job are u looking for ? <p> BintAlHoda , on 04 November 2009 - 07:01 AM , said : <p> Salaam <p> I think it depends on the attitude of people where you live , how much diversity there is , and also what type of job you are applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural diversity and tolerance , I never felt hijab was a big issue in jobs that did not involve the public ( for instance , computer programming ) , but I did feel it was an issue in jobs in which I would be personally interacting with the customers ( for instance , tutoring ) . <p> Sometime the hijab is not really the issue too .

You may want to get someone 's help with it . Also you may want to practice answering interview questions , in the event that you get called to an interview . Being relaxed and sounding confident are really essential . <p> bingo ! I interned at a public library during Library School and you would n't believe how many patrons came in and wanted me to review their resume . Normally we would n't do that because there was a career center just 2 blocks away , BUT , if the manager was n't there and it was a very slow and a quiet time , i 'd do a brief scan , tell them what needed fixed and then send them off to the career center . Almost every single resume was really bad and needed a LOT of work . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ive done them enough that I have learnt the basics of what makes a resume good and most often the resumes I saw , well , people had blatant spelling and grammar errors ( if your poor in your grammar skills , have someone else who is better read it over ! ) and if they were a non-native English speaker that usually doubles the errors and add to that , not understanding proper lay out or what needs to go into a resume . Writing a cover letter is a whole other ball of wax . Personally I always found overdoing the information , being very specific without being wordy and ofcourse ... bullEdited Outting when necessary ( like if the job is mundane and does n't require much thought ) tends to get you call backs . <p> Leave out the picture and make sure to dress EXTREMELY professionally for the interview . Unfortunately too many muhajabat sisters dress dowdy or inappropriately for interviews , you need to look professional and approachable . <p> Where I live , finding a job with hijab is VERY difficult . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember what it was like when I was still looking for one . Good luck sis ... I hope things get easier for you <p> It was quite a mission for me to find a job ! I would hand in or email my resume , and when i was called for an interview and met them in person It was awkward ... I was confident in myself , my experience , and my knowledge , however because of the lack of *positive* education out there about Islam and hijab , the employer feels confused and does n't know how to accept you , ... Especially when females in the workplace are *normally* using their bodies , looks , flirty behavior to do business , because ofcourse , sex sells . <p> Hamdillah I have a job now after being drilled to meet ALL head employers ( I recently asked a very attractive non hijabi how long it took her till she got the job ?

And if you feel like you 're not respected because of a simple cloth , then you 're better off not work with such ignorant people ... I 'm considering changing jobs lol maybe pursue some more studying ... Im feeling dumbed down because of work lol <p> It was quite a mission for me to find a job !

The number of the months with All ? h is twelve months by All ? h 's Ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth . Four of them are sacred : that is the right religion . So wrong not yourselves in them ... ( 9:36 ) <p> The specification of these four sacred months is stated in a had ? th narrated by Ab ? Bakrah radhiyall ? hu ' anhu that Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " Verily time has completed its cycle and returned to its original stage as it was on the day All ? h created the heavens and the earth . The year consists of twelve months , four of which are sacred . Three of them occur consecutively ; Dhul Qa'dah , Dhul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mudar ( named after the tribe of Mudar as they used to respect this month ) which occurs between Jam ? di'ul ? khir and Sha'b ? n . " ( Bukh ? r ? ) <p> From out of the four sacred months , Muharram has been blessed with certain specific virtues . The noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " The best of fasts besides the month of Ramad ? n is the fasting of All ? h 's Month of Muharram and the best of sal ? h besides the fard ( compulsory ) sal ? h is the tahajjud sal ? h ( performed after midnight before dawn ) . " ( Muslim ) <p> In another had ? th , Ibn ' Abb ? s radhiyall ? hu ' anhu reports that the Messenger of All ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " He who fasts on the day of ' Araf ? t ( 9th Dhul Hijjah ) , his fast will be a compensation for the sins of two years , and one who keeps a fast in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each fast . " ( Tabr ? n ? , at-Targh ? b wat-Tarh ? b ) <p> THE DAY OF ' ? SH ? R ? ( 10th Muharram ) <p> The tenth day of the month of Muharram is known as ' ? sh ? r ? . It is one of the most important and blessed days in the Islamic calendar . Some ' ulam ? ( scholars ) are of the opinion that before the fasts of Ramad ? n , the fast of the day of ' ? sh ? r ? was compulsory upon the Ummah . This is stated in a had ? th reported by ' ? ' ishah radhiyall ? hu ' anh ? that the noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam ordered the observance of the fast of ' ? sh ? r ? . However , when the fast of Ramad ? n became compulsory , then whosoever wished , kept this fast and whosoever desired did not observe this fast . ( Bukh ? r ? ) <p> But the Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam , nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same . Ibn ' Abb ? s radhiyall ? hu ' anhu says , " I did not see Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam anxiously await the fast of any day , which he gave preference to over other days , but this day , the day of ' ? sh ? r ? . " ( Bukh ? r ? ) <p> Humayd Ibn ' Abdur Rahm ? n radhiyall ? hu ' anhu narrates that he heard Mu ' ? wiyah ibn Ab ? Sufy ? n radhiyall ? hu ' anhum ? on the day of ' ? sh ? r ? , during the year he performed Hajj , saying on the pulpit , " O the people of Mad ? nah ! Where are your ' ulam ? ? I heard Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam saying , ' This is the day of ' ? sh ? r ? . All ? h has not enjoined its fasting on you , but I am fasting it .

Hence the noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam inquired of them , " What is ( the significance of ) this day on which you fast ? " They replied , " This is a great day . On this day All ? h saved M ? s ? ' alayhis sal ? m and his people and drowned Fir'awn and his nation . Thus M ? s ?

" The Messenger of All ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " We are more worthy of M ? s ? and nearer to him than you . " Thereafter , the noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam fasted on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anhum ) that a fast be kept on this day . ( Muslim ) <p> RECOMMENDED DEEDS ON THE DAY OF ' ? SH ? R ? <p> 1 ) The noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam has exhorted and encouraged his Ummah to fast on this day . Ab ? Qat ? dah radhiyall ? hu ' anhu narrates that the noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam was asked regarding the fast of the day of ' ? sh ? r ? . The noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam replied , " It is a compensation for the ( minor ) sins of the past year . " ( Muslim ) <p> NOTE : It must be borne in mind that wherever a promise of forgiveness of sins is made upon the fulfilment of some action , it is only the minor sins that are forgiven . The major sins are not forgiven without true tawbah ( repentance ) . <p> 2 ) One should also observe the fast of the 9th or 11th Muharram to safeguard his deed from resemblance with the non-Muslims who fast only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hu ' anhu said , " When Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam observed the fast of the day of ' ? sh ? r ? and ordered ( his companions radhiyall ? hu ' anhum ) to fast , they said , ' O Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam ! It is a day revered by the Jews and Christians . ' Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , ' The coming year , if All ? h wills , we will fast on the ninth ( also ) . ' " ( Muslim ) <p> Ibn ' Abb ? s radhiyall ? hu ' anhu reports that Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " Should I live until the coming year , I will definitely fast on the ninth ( also ) . " ( Muslim ) The noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " Observe the fast of ' ? sh ? r ? and oppose the Jews . Fast a day before it or a day after . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either fast on the ninth and tenth of Muharram or the tenth and eleventh . To fast only on the day of ' ? sh ? r ? is makr ? h tanz ? h ? as stated by ' All ? mah Ibn ' ? bid ? n Sh ? m ? rahimahull ? h . <p> 3 ) One should be generous to one 's family and dependants and spend more on them than is normally spent . Ab ? Hurayrah radhiyall ? hu ' anhu reports that Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam said , " One who generously spends on his family on the day of ' ? sh ? r ? , All ? h will increase ( his provision ) for the whole year . " ( Bayhaq ? , at-Targh ? b wat-Tarh ? b ) This had ? th is not very authentic according to the science of had ? th . However , scholars of had ? th like Bayhaq ? and Ibn Hibb ? n rahimahumall ? h have accepted it as reliable . These are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACTS TO REFRAIN FROM <p> 1 ) It is absolutely clear that the significance of the day of ' ? sh ? r ? is from the time of the noble Prophet sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam . However , many people regard this day as the day of mourning the martyrdom of Husayn radhiyall ? hu ' anhu . The martyrdom of Husayn radhiyall ? hu ' anhu was indeed a great tragedy , but Islam is not a religion of perpetual mourning . Ab ? Sa ' ? d radhiyall ? hu ' anhu relates that Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam has cursed mourners and those who listen to them . ( Ab ? D ? w ? d ) <p> The pages of Islamic History are filled with the blood of the martyrs . Should we begin to mourn the martyrdom of the Sah ? bah radhiyall ? hu ' anhum alone , every other day would be a day of mourning . Thus , to attribute the significance of ' ? sh ? r ? to the martyrdom of Husayn radhiyall ? hu ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs with regard to his martyrdom -- mourning , lamenting and displaying grief -- must be discarded . If mourning were permissible , then the day of the demise of Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam would have been more worthy for mourning and lamenting . <p> 2 ) The following misconceptions with regard to ' ? sh ? r ? are baseless : This is the day in which ? dam ' alayhis sal ? m was created . This is the day in which Ibr ? h ? m ' alayhis sal ? m was born . This is the day on which Qiy ? mah will take place . Whoever has a bath on the day of ? sh ? r ? will never get ill . <p> 3 ) Some regard the tenth of Muharram as a day of ' ? d . They indulge in adornment , applying surmah ( collyrium ) , wearing new clothes , spending lavishly and cooking a particular type of meal which is not generally prepared . All these actions are regarded as sunnah according to their belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found . <p> 4 ) Another misconception is that the month of Muharram is an unlucky month ; hence marriage ceremonies should be avoided in this month . This concept is again contrary to the teachings of Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam . <p> Let us observe this great day according to the way of Ras ? lull ? h sallallahu ' alayhi wasallam and the Sah ? bah radhiyall ? hu ' anhum and refrain from all innovations which deprive us of the blessings from All ? h ta ' ? l ? . May All ? h ta ' ? l ? guide us all upon the Straight Path and save us from every act which brings His Displeasure . ? m ? n . <p> Isl ? m is a way of life sent by All ? h ta ' ? l ? for the guidance of mankind , and it is the key to success in both worlds . Something that holds such significance holds great importance ; hence , it is of great value and therefore needs to be protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion of Isl ? m , scores of Muslim individuals have contributed through their wealth , their lives , and many other ways and forms , the like of which can not be found in history . Thousands have sacrificed their lives for the protection of this sacred religion . Islamic history is filled with the names of martyrs , and for the irrigation of Islamic values , much blood of Muslims has been shed . <p> From the first generation of Muslims , the great Sah ? bah radhiyall ? hu ' anhum , there are many who put all their possessions , even their lives , on the line for the sake of Isl ? m . Sumayyah , Hamzah , Ja'far , ' Abdull ? h ibn Raw ? hah , ' Abdull ? h ibn Az-Zubayr radhiyall ? hu ' anhum , are just a few of the many famous ones that fall under this category . <p> In the sacred month of Al-Muharram , much is heard about one of the great martyrs of Isl ? m , Husayn ibn ' Al ? radhiyall ? hu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great role to play in fortifying the causes of Isl ? m ; but a mere few days before the tenth of Al-Muharram , on which his martyrdom is mourned with much importance by certain people , the martyrdom of another of Isl ? m 's greats took place . This was , of course , the martyrdom of the second in rank and virtue from all Muslims after Ab ? Bakr radhiyall ? hu ' anhu , the leader of the believers , ' Umar ibn Al-Khatt ? b radhiyall ? hu ' anhum . <p> The incident of his martyrdom is recorded in great detail in the books of ah ? d ? th and history . In the 23rd year after of the Islamic calendar in the month of Dh ? -al-Hijjah , ' Umar radhiyall ? hu ' anhu entered the masjid to lead the Fajr prayer . He made sure the rows were complete and straight , keeping alive the teachings of the Prophet sallall ? hu ' alayhi wasallam in this regard . ' Amr ibn Maym ? n rahimahull ? h , the narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? hu ' anhu had just said the first takb ? r , when suddenly I heard him say , ' A dog has killed ( or eaten ) me ! ' The lout then attempted to flee with his double-edged dagger , and in doing so stabbed everyone in his way , to the right and left . As a result , he wounded 13 people , 7 fatally . ' The narration is lengthy , and many lessons are to be learnt from it . The blow was fatal , and ' Umar radhiyall ? hu ' anhu departed as a martyr just as he had desired . He would continually supplicate , ' O All ? h , grant me martyrdom in your path , and make my death occur in the City of your Prophet . ' ( Al-Bukh ? r ? ) <p> The martyrdom of ' Umar radhiyall ? hu ' anhu was imminent , as the Prophet of All ? h sallall ? hu ' alayhi wasallam had given glad tidings of this bounty . Anas ibn M ? lik radhiyall ? hu ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasallam once climbed Mount Uhud , along with Ab ? Bakr , ' Umar and ' Uthm ? n radhiyall ? hu ' anhum , and it trembled . The Prophet sallall ? hu ' alayhi wasallam said , ' O Uhud ! Be calm , for there is a Nab ? , a Sidd ? q and two martyrs on you . ' ( Al-Bukh ? r ? ) <p> ' Umar radhiyall ? hu ' anhu was an outstanding personality , and the amount he benefited Isl ? m can be gauged from what is narrated about him in the books of ah ? d ? th . <p> ' Abdull ? h ibn Mas ' ? d radhiyall ? hu ' anhu would say , ' We ( Isl ? m and the Muslims ) went from strength to strength since ' Umar accepted Isl ? m ' .

' When asked who this ' door ' was , Hudhayfah radhiyall ? hu ' anhu replied , ' ' Umar .

What Isl ? m does teach is that one should always remain conscious of the sacrifices of these accepted souls , continue praying for them , and make them our role models in that whatever sacrifice is required from us for Isl ? m , at whatever time , we should be ready to offer it . <p> At this time , we are not being asked to offer our lives ; we are only being asked to sacrifice our unlawful desires . How great a difference is there between us and those blessed individuals who gave their lives for Isl ? m , and we can not sacrifice a single transient enjoyment from har ? m sources . It is this lesson that we should learn from the martyrdoms of ' Umar radhiyall ? hu ' anhu , Husayn radhiyall ? hu ' anhu 
##975051 <p> How should societies and nations control force and violence ? This is a perennial question that has confronted mankind . Violence is intrinsic , so it is necessary to exercise control over it . As societies grow and mature , they institutionalise the use of force , and channel it for overall betterment and sustenance . <p> Nations and groups resort to violence for a variety of reasons . Over the course of time , control and use of violence came to be vested in nation-states . One effect of this factor was that it led to order , discipline and freedom for citizens within the constraints of law . The Leviathan of Hobbes envisaged the prevention of disorder and of life becoming " nasty , brutish and short . " <p> At the same time , nation-states started accumulating and amalgamating power in their military and armed forces . Innumerable wars and armed conflicts occurred . When war planning and execution was faulty , bloodshed and stalemates resulted . The prime example of this terrible phenomenon was the First World War -- a war without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gambles , misconceptions or sheer stupidity . Proper planning of military operations and their efficient execution is a difficult and complex matter . In Afghanistan , the US and the Soviet Union , despite all their military might , failed to achieve any success . Their conceptions , aims and goals were foolish and short-sighted . A sledgehammer can not kill a fly . Military force has to be well-thought-out in terms of time , space and relative strengths . It must always be subordinate to political direction . <p> So many senseless wars and wastage of trillions of dollars could have been averted if these elementary precepts had been borne in mind . <p> In our present era , we are witnessing an altogether different phenomenon . This is the dispersion of weapons and use of violence to groups inside a nation instead of their being confined for use by the nation-state itself . This is happening in many troubled countries , especially in Pakistan . Here , the state is fast losing control over legitimate use of force . The state can no longer assure security for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other extremist bodies are openly defying the state of Pakistan . This situation is no longer confined to Fata but has moved to Balochistan and to the Punjab itself , besides the other provinces . As Dr Akmal Hussain has written : " Taliban groups have pre-positioned themselves with arsenals of weapons and trained cadres . They have the capacity to launch simultaneous terrorist attacks aimed at paralysing the main urban centres of the country . " <p> A factor that has led to the weakening of the writ of the state is the dismantling of the Civil Service of Pakistan and the office of the deputy commissioner . This was a steel frame ensuring good governance and neutrality . The fact that the superintendant of police was subordinated to the deputy commissioner meant that use of force in times of trouble was controlled and directed on the basis of independent judgement and reason , and not haphazardly . The last nail in the coffin of this admirable administrative apparatus was driven by Gen Pervez Musharraf . We are now witnessing its disastrous consequences . <p> We have two diametrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern , democratic , free and progressive country ; the other , a bigoted , oppressive , obscurantist and ruthless one . If we are to take our rightful place in the comity of nations , we must see to it that the use of force and monopoly over violence rests exclusively with the protagonists 
##975651 <h> Spirited Zimbabwe stun West Indies in the first ODI <p> Posted by Ibn-e-Umeed on any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 . Both comments and pings are currently closed . <p> Vusi Sibandi make a dogged 95 that earned him the Man-of-the-Match award <p> PROVIDENCE : Shingirai Masakadza held his nerve in the final over to help Zimbabwe earn a two-run victory over West Indies in the first One-day International here on Thursday . <p> Masakada , on his ODI debut , collected three wickets -- two in the final over -- for 36 runs from three overs , as Zimbabwe successfully defended a target score of 255 on a typically slow Guyana National Stadium pitch . <p> The victory gave Zimbabwe a 1-0 lead in the five-match series with the second match set for the same venue on Saturday . <p> Opener Vusimuzi Sibanda had struck five fours and one six in 95 from 162 balls to be the cornerstone of Zimbabwe 's 254 for five from their quota of 50 overs after they decided to bat . <p> But the match came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambled with Masakadza . <p> The 23-year-old fast-medium bowler conceded a six , a four , and a single to Nikita Miller off the first three balls of the final over before he bowled Dwayne Smith for four , and had Sulieman Benn caught at deep mid-wicket off successive balls , as West Indies narrowly failed to get 15 runs from the final over . <p> Zimbabwe 's spinners again choked the West Indies ' top-order batting , despite Shivnarine Chanderpaul hitting the top score of a run-a-ball 70 , home team captain Chris Gayle making 57 from 66 balls , and fellow opener Adrian Barath 50 from 96 balls on debut . <p> Between Zimbabwe 's four frontline spinners -- their captain Prosper Utseya , Ray Price , Graeme Cremer , and Greg Lamb -- they delivered 40 overs at four runs apiece , and removed Gayle and Kieron Pollard , the West Indies two most dangerous hitters . <p> They had been kept at bay , when Gayle shared 99 for the first wicket with Barath before he was lbw to Lamb in the 23rd over . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the run outs of Andre Fletcher and Narsingh Deonarine did not help the cause of the home team . <p> Earlier , Sibanda shared 67 for the first wicket with Hamilton Masakadza , then 100 for the second wicket Tatenda Taibu , and anchored Zimbabwe 's innings before Kemar Roach spectacularly bowled him -- smashing his bat in the process -- in the penultimate over <p> Masakadza smote half-dozen boundaries in 41 from 45 balls , and Taibu struck five fours in 56 from 54 balls . <p> Masakadza was lbw to Nikita Miller sweeping , and Taibu was lbw to Kieron Pollard playing across the line . <p> When Brendan Taylor failed to beat Pollard 's side-footed shot at the striker 's end , and was run out for one in the 38th over , Zimbabwe were 168 for three . <p> Elton Chigumbura joined Sibanda and put on 47 for the fourth wicket before he was caught at long-on for 27 in the 46th over , as Zimbabwe chased quick runs in the closing stages . <p> The two sides also played three ODIs on March 10 , @ @ @ 
##976350 <p> Qad ? ah with regard to Salaat , means to fulfil or perform a Salaat after expiry of the time of that Salaat . <p> If a Fardh Salaat has not been performed and its time has expired , it is obligatory to make Qad ? ah of that Salaat without any delay . To delay in performing the Qad ? ah Salaat is also a sin . <p> It should be remembered that the Shariah ( Law of Allah ) never waives the obligation of the Fardh Salaat . No amount of repentance can secure exemption from Salaat , which have not been performed in the past . Even a lifetime of Fardh Salaat not performed must be fulfilled by means of Qad ? ah . <p> It is not necessary to wait for any particular time to perform Qad ? ah Salaat . For example , if Zuhr Salaat was missed , it is not necessary to wait for another Zuhr time in order to make Qad ? ah of the missed Zuhr Salaat . Several Qad ? ah Salaat can be performed all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah during Makruh times . <p> It is not permissible for him to perform an Adaa Salaat before performing the Five Qad ? ah Salaat for which he is liable . However , if the time remaining for the Adaa Salaat is so little that if he engages in fulfilling the Qad ? ah Salaat his Adaa Salaat will also become Qad ? ah , then in such a case he should perform his Adaa Salaat , and thereafter engage in the performance of the Qad ? ah . <p> If one is liable for six or more Fardh Salaat , i.e. six or more Salaat were not performed in their due times , then one ? s Adaa Salaat may be performed before performing the Qad ? ah Salaat . <p> When the number of Qad ? ah Salaat exceeds five , then the observance of Tarteeb is not Wajib or necessary . In this case one may perform Qad ? ah of the Salaat in any order . <p> Witr Salaat is an obligatory Salaat , hence , if it is missed its Qad ? ah must be performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah of both the Fardh and Witr will have to be performed before engaging in the performance of Fajar Salaat . <p> Only Qad ? ah of Fardh and Witr Salaat is made . Besides the two Raka ? ats Sunnat of Fajap , Qad ? ah of Sunnat and Nafil Salaat is not necessary . If the Qad ? ah of Fajar is being performed before Zawal ( mid-day ) then Qad ? ah of the Fardh , as well as the Sunnat , should be performed : However , if the Qad ? ah of Fajar Salaat is being made after Zawal , only the Qad ? ah of the Fardh should be made . <p> If so little of Fajar time remains that only two Raka ? ats could be performed in that time , then in such a case only the Fardh of Fajar should be performed , and about twenty minutes after sunrise , Qad ? ah of the two Fajar Sunnats should be performed . <p> If one is liable for several Qad ? ah Salaat one should stipulate in the Intention when making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . For example , if Fajar , Zuhr and Asr Salaat have been missed , then when making Qad ? ah it should be intended : <p> " I am making Qad ? ah of Fajar Salaat - or Zuhr Salaat " as the case may be . <p> If it is not stipulated in the Intention which Qad ? ah is being performed , the Qad ? ah will not be valid . <p> If one did not perform Salaat for a number of years , then too , Qad ? ah of all the missed Salaat must be performed . If it can not be remembered how many years or months , Salaat were not performed , one should continue making Qad ? ah Salaat ( making Qad ? ah of Fajar , Zuhr , Asr , Maghrib and Ishaa - Fardh and Witr ) until one is fully satisfied that all the Qad ? ah Salaat have been discharged . <p> A Musaafir ( traveller ) in the terminology of the Shariah is one who undertakes a journey of forty-eight miles ( 80km ) with the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Musaafir , and with regard to Salaat . These concessions are : <p> Instead of Four Raka ? ats Fardh he offers only two Raka ? ats . <p> He may not perform all the Sunnat Salaat if he so desires . <p> A Musaafir performs two Raka ? ats Fardh Salaat instead of four Raka ? ats . The reduction of two Raka ? ats from a Four-Raka ? at Fardh Salaat is compulsory . It is , therefore , not permissible for him to perform four Raka ? ats Fardh Salaat . <p> As regards Maghrib Salaat , three Fardh Raka'ats must be performed by the traveller . <p> As long as one enjoys sufficient health or strength , the Salaat shall be performed standing . However , if due to illness the Namazi finds that he is not able to stand and perform Salaat then he must sit and perform it . If he is unable to even sit and perform his Salaat , he may lie down and discharge the obligation of Salaat . <p> The way of making Ruku whilst performing Salaat in the sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knees . <p> If the Namazi , due to illness , is unable to make Ruku and Sajda he should make the Ruku and Sajda by means of signs of the head , viz. , bending the head for Ruku and lowering it a bit more for Sajda . <p> If the illness is so serious that one does not have sufficient strength to even sit , and perform Salaat , one may in such a case lie down and perform it . Pillows should be placed under the head or back enabling the head to be raised . The legs should be outstretched towards the Qiblah , but if possible , the legs should be drawn up . Salaat should then be performed in this position making Ruku and Sajda by the indications of the head . <p> If the illness is such that it is not possible to perform Salaat by even signs of the head , then in this case Salaat can not be performed . Should the condition of the sick person remain in this state for more than twenty-four hours , the obligation of Salaat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah is to be performed for missing any Salaat under such extreme conditions of illness . <p> Unconsciousness for more than twenty-four hours is a factor , which waives the obligation of Salaat . In this case , even after regaining consciousness , no Qad ? ah is to be offered for the Salaat missed in the state of unconsciousness . If , however , the state of unconsciousness lasted less than twenty-four hours , Qad ? ah of the missed Salaat will have to be made upon regaining consciousness . <p> While performing Salaat , if the Namazi becomes sick and can not continue the Salaat in standing position , he may sit down and complete the Salaat or he may even lie down , if unable to sit . <p> Tahyatul Wudu consists of two Raka ? ats and is performed after the Wudu has been made . The Hadith has stated much significance of this Salaat . However , one should be careful that this Salaat is not performed at a Makrooh time , as no Salaat is permissible in the Makrooh ( un-desirable time ) timings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honour Allah upon entering His House , viz. , the Mosque . Tahyatul Masjid consists of two Raka ? ats , which is usually performed upon entering Mosque and before sitting down . The Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) ordered that two Raka ? ats Salaat be performed upon entering the Mosque and before sitting down . This Salaat is thus Sunnat . <p> This Salaat should not be performed at a Makrooh time . <p> If one enters the Mosque and it happens to be a Makrooh time then recite only the following ( 4 times ) : <p> Allah is great . Allah is great . There is no one worthy of worship besides Allah and Allah is Greatest and all praises is for Allah . <p> After having recited this , recite Durood . <p> Intention for this Salaat is to intend the performance of Tahyatul Masjid . As has been mentioned before , Intention is the intention of the heart . <p> Tahyatul Masjid is not restricted to two Raka ? ats . One may perform four Raka ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Juma Khutba has commenced or is about to commence , then one must not perform Tahyatul Masjid . <p> If one enters the Mosque and the Fardh Jama ? at is in progress , then one should not perform Tahyatul Masjid ; the Fardh Salaat in which one will join in will take the place of Tahyatul Masjid as well . One will obtain the Reward of Tahyatul Masjid in this case even if Intention was not made . <p> If , after entering the Mosque , one sat down and there after performed Tahyatul Masjid , the Tahyatul Masjid will be valid although it is best to perform it before sitting . <p> If one visits the Mosque several times during the day , it will suffice if one performs Tahyatul Masjid once only . <p> Salaat Ishraaq is performed about fifteen minutes . Regarding this Salaat , the Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) said : <p> " He who performs Fajar Salaat with jama ? at and remains seated in the same place engaged in Dhikr until after sunrise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain the Reward of one Hajj and one Umrah " . <p> Although the best way to perform Ishraaq is as described in the above-mentioned Hadith , nevertheless , the Ishraaq Salaat will also be discharged if one did not remain in continuous Ibaadat after Fajar Salaat . Where the Ishraaq is performed after having engaged in some other activity , the Reward , however , will be less . <p> The Hadith ( sayings of the Holy Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) explains great significance of Salaat ul Dhuha . The time for this Salaat commences after one-third of the day has passed . Its time remains until Zawal . Salaat ul Dhuha consists of up to twelve Raka ? ats . One may perform two , four , six , eight , ten or twelve Raka ? ats . <p> AyeshaR.A ( wife of the Holy Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) used to perform eight Raka ? ats Salaat ul Dhuha . She said that even if her parents arose from the grave , she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this emphasis the importance of this Salaat is evident . <p> The Nafil Salaat performed after Maghrib Salaat is called " Salaat ul Awaabeen " . The minimum number of Raka ? ats of this Salaat is six Raka ? ats and the maximum number is twenty Raka ? ats . It is better to perform it Raka ? at units . The Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) said that whoever performs six Raka ? ats after Maghrib will have his/her sins forgiven even if such sins are as much as the foam on the ocean . <p> Of all the Nafil Salaats , the greatest in rank is the " Salaat ul Tahajjud " . The Hadith speak much about the great significance of this Salaat . The time of Tahajjud is greatly efficacious for the acceptance of Dua . This Salaat is commended in the Holy Qur'an . <p> Salaat ul Tahajjud is performed in the latter part of the night . After having gone to bed one should rise late in the night and engage in this wonderful Dhikr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious people . The minimum number of Raka ? ats in Tahajjud is four and the maximum is twelve Raka ? ats . This Salaat can also be performed in two Raka ? at or four Raka ? at units . The Intention for this Salaat is simply to intend that one is performing Tahajjud . <p> If one lacks the courage to get up late in the night then one should at least make an effort to perform four Raka ? ats with the Intention of Tahajjud after the two Sunnatul Muaq Qad ? ah of Ishaa . Although the Reward will not be same as Tahajjud being its proper time . <p> The Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) said that Tahajjud Salaat is a medium ( i.e. a very great and efficacious medium ) of gaining nearness to Allah . At the same time it is expiation for sins while it strengthens one ? s will power in the fight against the lowly nafs . Every Muslim should , therefore , make the greatest of effort , combat the laxity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Salaat . Tahajjud is the time when the servant is closest to Allah . <p> There are no specific Surahs to be recited in this Salaat . Any Surah may be recited in any Raka ? at . The practice of fixing Surah Ikhlas for the Tahajjud Salaat is contrary to the Sunnah and should not be adhered to . <p> Salaat ul Tauba consists of two Raka ? ats , which should be performed after one has committed a sin . After performing these two Raka ? ats one should raise one ? s hands sincerely and humbly in Dua and repent abundantly . <p> This Salaat is performed when one need or in difficulty . The Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) said that whoever is in need of something should make a perfect Wudu ( i.e. observing all the rules of Ablution ) and perform two Raka ? ats Salaat . After the Salaat recite the praises of Allah and recite Durood . One may recite any amount and any formula of praises - Tahmeed and Tasbeeh - as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fulfilment of the need . This Salaat is called ul Hajaat " . <p> The Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) said to his uncle , Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib : <p> " O Abbas ! O my uncle ! Should I present to you a gift ? Should I bestow something to you ? Should I inform you of something greatly beneficial ? Should I show you such an act which , if you render it , Allah will forgive all your sins - old and new , those committed in error and those committed deliberately , sins committed publicly or privately ? That act is to perform four Raka ? ats ( Salaat ) . <p> After this , the Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) taught him the way of performing this Salaat , he said : <p> " If possible , perform this Salaat daily ; if you are unable then perform it once a week ! If you are unable then perform it once a month ; if you are unable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to do even this , then perform it at least once in your whole lifetime . " <p> This Salaat consists of four Raka ? ats . It is called " Salaat ul Tasbeeh " because the following Tasbeeh is recited repeatedly in this Salaat : <p> Glory to be Thee my Allah , and Praise to Thee my Allah , and there is no god same Allah and Allah is great . There is no strength or power except from Allah , the High , the Majestic . <p> The above Tasbeeh is recited three hundred times in Salaat ul Tasbeeh . <p> There are two ways in which this Salaat may be performed . <p> The First Method <p> First Raka ? at : After reciting Surah Fatiha and a Surah , remain standing and recite the Tasbeeh 15 times . Make Ruku . After the normal Ruku Tasbeeh ( i.e. Subhaana-Rabbiyal-Azeem 3 times ) recite the above Tasbeeh 10 times . After Ruku , recite the Tasbeeh 10 times in Qauma ( i.e. the standing position after Ruku ) . In Sajda recite the Tasbeeh 10 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In jalsah ( i.e. the sitting position between two Sajdas ) recite the Tasbeeh 10 times . In the second Sajda recite the Tasbeeh 10 times after the normal Sajda Tasbeeh . After the second Sajda do not stand up immediately . Sit and recite the Tasbeeh 10 times . Thereafter commence the second Raka ? at . <p> The Tasbeeh is recited 75 times in one Raka ? at as outlined above . The same procedure will be followed in every Raka ? at . The total Tasbeeh recited will thus be 300 . <p> The Second Method <p> In this method also 300 Tasbeeh are recited . The only difference is that the Tasbeeh will be recited 15 times after Sana but before Surah Fatiha . After having recited a Surah , the Tasbeeh will be recited 10 times . After the second Sajda of every Raka ? at the Tasbeeh will not be recited 10 times as is the case in the first method . <p> The following table will assist you in grasping the occasions when the Tasbeeh has to be recited . <p> FIRST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qiraa ? at but before Ruku <p> In Ruku <p> In Qauma <p> In first Sajda <p> In Jalsah <p> In Second Sajda <p> After Second Sajda while sitting <p> 15 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> After Sana , but before Qiraa ? at <p> After Qiraa ? at <p> In Ruku <p> In Qauma <p> In first Sajda <p> In Jalsah <p> In second Sajda <p> After Second Sajda Tasbeeh is not recited in sitting position <p> 15 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> Total <p> 75 <p> Total <p> 75 <p> In the first method the Tasbeeh will be recited 10 times before Tashah-hud in the second and fourth Raka ? at . <p> In the second method the Tasbeeh will not be recited before Tashah-hud in the second and fourth Raka ? at . <p> Intention for this Salaat is to merely make the intention that one is performing Salaat Tasbeeh . <p> There is no specific Surah to be recited in Salaat ul Tasbeeh . <p> In counting the number of Tasbeehs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counting is done verbally the Salaat will be nullified . The Tasbeeh should be counted by pressing the fingers in the position in which they are . After the Tasbeeh has been recited once , one finger should be lightly pressed . In this way , the number will be remembered . <p> If the Tasbeehs of a particular occasion in this Salaat are omitted in error , then recite the missed Tasbeehs in the next Ruku or part of the Salaat . For example if the Tasbeehs before Surah Fatiha were omitted , recite these after the Qiraa ? at if the Tasbeehs between the two Sajda ( Jalsah ) were omitted , then recite these in the second Sajda : if the Tasbeehs of Qauma were omitted , recite these in Sajda . However , do not recite omitted Tasbeehs in Qauma , Jalsah and after the second Sajda in the first and third Raka ? at . Hence , if you forgot to recite the Tasbeehs in Ruku then do not recite these in Qauma . In Qauma recite only the Tasbeehs of Qauma . The Tasbeehs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sajda . <p> If for some reason Sajda-us-Sahw became necessary and if some Tasbeehs were omitted at some stage , and not as yet fulfilled , then recite the omitted Tasbeehs in the Sajda-us-Sahw . However , remember that Sajda-us-Sahw has not Tasbeehs of its own ; hence do not recite additional Tasbeehs when making Sajda-us-Sahw . The number of Tasbeehs for the four Raka ? ats of Salaat ul Tasbeeh is 300 . Therefore , it is possible to recite only such Tasbeehs in Sajda-us-Sahw , as were missed out earlier and not fulfilled . <p> " Istikhaarah " means to seek goodness . Here it means the way of seeking advice and goodness from Allah . Salaat ul Istikhaarah consists of two Raka ? ats . When one intends to embark on any project , e.g. trade , journey , marriage , etc. then one should seek the advice of Allah , and make Dua for protection and . According to the Hadith of our Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) it is only an unfortunate person who fails to seek the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon something . The Hadith has exhorted much the observance of Salaat ul Istikhaarah . Insha ? Allah , you will not regret if you make this Salaat and only thereafter decide whether to proceed with the intended project or cancel it . <p> Salaat ul Istikhaarah consists of two Raka ? ats . This Salaat is performed at night just before going to bed . Once the Salaat has been performed , go to bed immediately . Do not indulge in any activity after Salaat ul Istikhaarah . Recite any Surah in these Raka ? ats . It is performed as any other Nafil Salaat . After the Salaat make a fervent Dua , with much concentration . The Dua , which should be recited after this Salaat , is as follows : <p> O Allah ! Behold I ask You the good through Your Knowledge , and ability through Your Power , and beg ( Your favour ) our of Your infinite Bounty . For surely You have Power : I have none . You know all ; I know not . You are the Great Knower of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge this matter be good for my faith , for my livelihood , and for the consequences of my affairs , then ordain it for me , and make it easy for me , and bless me therein . <p> But if in Your Knowledge this matter be bad for my faith , for my livelihood , and for the consequences of my affairs , then turn it away from me , and turn me away therefrom , and ordain for me the good wherever it be , and cause me to be pleased therewith . <p> Two Raka ? ats will be performed in Jama ? at . Salaat ul Istisqaa has neither Azan nor Iqaamat . The Imam will recite the Qiraa ? at audibly ( jahr ) . The Imam will thereafter recite two Khutbas as on the Day of Eid . After the Khutbas the Imam will stand and face the Qiblah . He will raise his hands and petition Allah for rain . All those present should also make Dua for rain . <p> This procedure of Salaat should be repeated for three consecutive days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days . <p> If after having performed Salaat ul Istisqaa on the first day , it rains , then too , complete the three days . <p> It is best ( Mustahab ) to fast on these three days . <p> Drought is the effect of sin committed in abundance . It is a form of Allah ? s punishment . Hence , during a drought , everyone should resort to istighfaar and Tauba in abundance and discharge whatever rights are unfulfilled or usurped , be such rights in regard to Allah , e.g. Salaat not performed , Zakat not paid , or be these rights in respect to people , e.g. debt deliberately not paid , wealth of others usurped or taken in a Haraam way etc . <p> It is Sunnat for the Imam to invert his outer sheet which he wears i.e. he should turn the inside out . This is to be done while making the Dua for the rain after the two Khutbas have been recited . <p> Taraaweeh is the special Salaat , which the Shariah has ordained for the month of Ramadan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance is Sunnatul Muaq Qad ? ah . It has to be performed each night during the month of Ramadan . Deliberate omission of Taraaweeh Salaat is sinful . <p> Traditionally the whole of Holy Qur ? an is recited by Hafiz of Holy Qur ? an . <p> Taraaweeh Salaat commences on the first night of Ramadan and ends on the last night of Ramadan . <p> The most preferable method is to perform Taraaweeh in units of two Raka ? ats . Taraaweeh Salaat is performed in Jama ? at for males after the Ishaa Fardh and Sunnatul Muaq Qad ? ah , but before the Witr Salaat ( with females in segregated sections or behind the male congregation ) . <p> There is no specific intention formula to recite . The intention may be made by uttering it verbally or merely making the intention in the heart . <p> After every four Raka ? ats there will follow a pause which should preferably last as long as it would take to perform four Raka ? ats Salaat . However , it is permissible to shorten the pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , everyone should engage in some form of Dhikr , e.g. Dhikr , Tasbeeh , Istighfaar , Durood , etc . The Dhikr during the Taraweehah ( the pause after every four Raka ? ats ) is to be made individually and silently . The Shariah has not ordered any specific and collective form of Dhikr for the Taraweehah ( pause ) . <p> After the twenty Raka ? ats Taraaweeh Salaat have been completed , a collective Dua will be made silently . After the Dua , the Witr Salaat will be made in Jama ? at . <p> It is Sunnatul Muaq Qad ? ah to complete the recitation of the whole Qur ? an once during Taraaweeh of the whole month of Ramadan . If a Hafiz of Qur ? an is not available , the Taraaweeh could be performed by reciting any Surah or verses of the Qur ? an . <p> Questions Pertaining to Taraaweeh Salaat <p> Although it is best to perform the Witr Salaat after Taraaweeh , it is permissible to perform it before Taraaweeh . <p> It is Mustahab for the pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the duration of four Raka ? ats Salaat . <p> During the recitation of the Qur ? an in the Taraaweeh , the Verse : <p> ( Bis-Millah-Hir Rahmanir-Raheem ) <p> In the Name of Allah , the most Beneficent , the most Merciful <p> should be recited once aloud in the beginning of some Surah so that the Qur ? an is properly completed . If this is not done , the recitation will not be complete , but will be one verse less . <p> The Shariah does not require that the recitation of the Qur ? an be completed on the 27th Night or any particular night . The Qur ? an in Taraaweeh Salaat can be completed on any night . <p> The custom of making collective Dua after every four Raka ? ats Taraaweeh as well as the custom of reciting aloud in unison some forms of Tasbeeh and Dhikr after every two Raka ? ats and/or four Raka ? ats Taraaweeh are contrary to the Sunnah . Such innovatory practices should be shunned . <p> If after having performed Taraaweeh Salaat it transpires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. Ishaa was inadvertently performed without Ablution , then both the Ishaa and the Taraaweeh will have to be repeated . <p> If a group of people did not perform the Ishaa Fardh in Jama ? at for some reason , but performed it individually , then Taraaweeh too must be performed individually . This group can not on its own perform Taraaweeh in Jama ? at . However , if they join a Taraaweeh Jama ? at in which there are people who had made the Ishaa Fardh in Jama ? at then their ( i.e. those who did not perform Ishaa in Jama ? at ) Taraaweeh will be valid . <p> If someone arrives in the Mosque after the Ishaa Fardh has been completed and Taraaweeh commenced , then he should first perform his Ishaa Fardh and then join the Jama ? at in Taraaweeh . He should perform the Taraaweeh Raka ? ats which he had missed , after the Witr . This person shall perform the Witr in Jama ? at . <p> If the Imam erroneously omitted Qad ? ah ( sitting ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? at , the muqtadees should call his attention by exclaiming " Subhan Allah ! " However , if for some reason the Imam continues , he can and should return to the Qad ? ah of the second Raka ? at as long as he has not entered the Sajda of the third Raka ? at . If before making the Sajda of the third Raka ? at the Imam realises his error , he should return to the Qad ? ah , make Sajda-us-Sahw as usual and complete the Salaat . But , if he completes the third Raka ? at ( the third Raka ? at will be considered completed with the first Sajda ) then he should add a fourth Raka ? at as well , and make Sajda-us-Sahw and complete the Salaat . In this case , the four Raka ? ats will be considered as only two Raka ? ats for Taraaweeh purposes . <p> It is not permissible to appoint a naa-baaligh ( a child who has not attained puberty ) to lead the Taraaweeh even if he happens to be Hafiz of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not valid . <p> It is Makrooh Tehrimi ( forbidden act ) for women to perform Taraaweeh in Jama ? at . They should perform it individually and at home : not in the Mosque . <p> In some places Surah Ikhlas ( Qulhuwallaah ) is recited thrice in every Raka ? at of Taraaweeh . This is contrary to the Sunnah . This method is Makrooh Tehrimi . <p> A collective Dua ( Dua by the whole Jama ? at ) will be made after the twenty Raka ? ats Taraaweeh . <p> Intention for the twenty Raka ? ats Taraaweeh could be made only once in the beginning when commencing the Taraaweeh . It is not obligatory to renew the Intention after every two Raka ? ats although it is best to do so ( to renew the Intention ) . <p> The time of Taraaweeh Salaat commences after Ishaa Fardh and lasts until the expiry of Ishaa times , viz. until just before Fajar . <p> Takbeer-e-Tashreek <p> This Takbeer is known as Takbeer-e-Tashreek . It is Wajib to recite this Takbeer aloud once after every Fardh Salaat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 9th Zil-hajj ) and ending after the Fardh Salaat of Asr on the 13th Zil-hajj . <p> Women must recite this Takbeer silently , although its recitation is not Wajib for them . <p> The reciting of this Takbeer aloud after every Fardh Salaat as mentioned is Wajib only if the Salaat is performed in Jama ? at . <p> It is not Wajib upon the Musaafir to recite this Takbeer . <p> Those upon whom this Takbeer is not Wajib ( viz. women and traveller ) if they happen to be the Namazi of one upon whom the Takbeer is Wajib then its recitation will be compulsory upon them as well , but the women shall recite it silently . <p> If the Imam forgets to recite the Takbeer the Namazi should immediately recite it and not wait for the Imam to commence . <p> After Intention the Imam will proclaim " Allaho-Akbar " . Reciting " Allaho-Akbar " silently the Namazi raises his hands to the ears and folds them as usual . Recite Sana in this position . <p> After Sana , the Imam will proclaim " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears and then releasing them along the sides . Reciting " Allaho-Akbar " silently each time , the Namazi follows the Imam and raises his hands with each Takbeer to the ears and then releases them on the sides . <p> After the third Takbeer the hands are folded as is usual in Qiyaam , and the Imam will now commence the Qiraat - i.e. Surah Fatiha and some verses of the Qur ? an . <p> After Qiraat , the Raka ? at will be completed as usual with Ruku and two Sajdas . <p> In the second Raka ? at after the Qiraat , the Imam will proclaim " Allaho-Akbar " and raise his hands to the ears and release them . The Imam will recite altogether three Takbeers after the Qiraat in the second Raka ? at . When the Imam says " Allaho-Akbar " the fourth time , ( in the second Raka ? at ) then do not raise the hands , but go immediately into Ruku . The rest of the Raka ? at is completed as usual . <p> What to do When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If one joins the Eid Salaat after the Imam has already recited the Eid Takbeers of the first Raka ? at , then <p> If one has confidence that after reciting the Takbeers one will be able to unite with the Imam in Ruku , then make the Intention for the Salaat and recite the Takbeers in Qiyaam . <p> If one fears that by reciting the Takbeers in Qiyaam one will not be able to unite with the Imam in Ruku then immediately after Intention , join the Imam in Ruku and recite the Takbeers ( silently ) in Ruku instead of the normal Ruku Tasbeeh , but do not raise the hands ( in Ruku ) while reciting the Takbeers . <p> If the Imam emerges from Ruku before you could complete the Takbeers , join him . The balance of the Takbeers are waived . <p> If one has missed a complete Raka ? at of the Eid Salaat , it should be fulfilled as follows : <p> After the Imam makes the Salaams , rise and recite Qiraat . After the Qiraat recite the Takbeers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my Sunnah at the time of the corruption of my Ummah , will obtain the reward of a hundred martyrs " <p> The above Hadith of the Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) as well as many others inform us of the great Reward and merit in reviving the Sunnah practices of Islam . It is obligatory upon Muslims to accord special attention to the restoration and lost , practices of our Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) . One such lost and forgotten practice of Islam is the performance of the Eid Salaat in the Eid Gah . <p> The Shariah commands that the Eid Salaat be performed in an open field near the outskirts of the town . The regular practiae of the Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) , the Companions and all the great learned men of Islam as well as of the Ummah down the corridor of the centuries of Islamic history was to perform Eid Salaat in a open field . In the books of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) used to perform the Salaat of both Eids at a place in the open plain outside Madinah " . ( Ibn Hajar ) <p> " The basis and proof this is that , verily , the Holy Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) would go out to the Musallaa . He did not perform the Eid Salaat in his Mosque ( i.e. Masjid-e-Nabawee ) despite the elevated rank of his Mosque , excepting on one occasion because of rain " . <p> The Funeral Salaat is in fact a Dua ( Salaat and supplication ) on behalf of the dead . <p> The conditions of other Salaat are applicable to Funeral Salaat as well . <p> The Mayyit ( the dead ) should be placed in front of those performing the Funeral Salaat . The Imam should stand in line with the breast of the Mayyit . <p> Two things are Fardh in Salaat ul Janaazah , viz. <p> To recite " Allaho-Akbar " four times . <p> Qiyaam - to perform Funeral Salaat standing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ul Janaazah . <p> Three things are Sunnat in Salaat ul Janaazah , viz. <p> Hamd - to recite of Allah . <p> Durood upon Prophet Muhammad ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) . <p> Dua for the Mayyit . <p> Jama ? at ( congregation ) is not a condition for the validity of Salaat ul Janaazah . Hence , if even one person - man or woman - performs it , the Fardh obligation is discharged . But , the need to perform this Salaat in Jama ? at is of overriding importance since it is a Dua for the Mayyit . <p> How to Perform Salaat ul Janaazah ? <p> The Mayyit should be placed in front with head on right and legs on left side the Imam standing in line with the Mayyit ? s breast . It is Mustahab to form three rows behind the Imam . If there are only seven people - one of them being the Imam - three should stand in the first row , two in the second row and one in the third row . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made in the mind ) : <p> I make Intention for performing Salaat-e-Janaazah for Allah , for Durood upon Prophet ( may Allah bless him and grant him peace ) and for Dua for the Mayyit , behind Imam and facing the Qiblah . <p> Oh Allah ! Shower Thy mercy on Muhammad and on his seeds as Thou hast sent Thy mercy on Ibrahim and his seeds . No doubt ! Thou art Great and Praiseworthy ! Oh Allah ! Send Thy blessings on Muhammad and on his seeds as Thou hast blessed Ibrahim and his seeds . No doubt ! Thou art Great and Praiseworthy . <p> After Durood-e-Ibrahim recite " Allaho-Akbar " again once ( but do not raise the hands ) , and recite a Dua for the Mayyit . If the Mayyit is a baaligh ( of age ) male or female recite the following Dua : <p> Oh Allah , forgive our living and dead , present and absent , big and small , men and women . Oh Allah whoever among us , is kept alive , by Thee , be kept alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die let them die as believers . <p> Oh Allah , make this child a source of our salvation and the pain of his parting a source of reward and benefits for us . Make him a recommendation for us and the recommendation , which Thou hast accepted . <p> If a Na-baaligh girl ; recite the same Dua as for a Na-baaligh boy but recite on all the three places " Aj-Alhu Lana " <p> ( Sha-fi-atau Wa Mushaf-fa-ath ) <p> Instead of <p> ( Sha-fi-au Wa Mushaf-fa-a ) <p> After the Dua , recite again once " Allaho-Akbar " . Again do not raise the hands . After this fourth Takbeer make the Salaams as is done in other Salaats by looking at each shoulder and saying Assalamo-alaikum wa rahmatullah . <p> The Imam recites the four

The defect or fault must have been committed by error - by mistake , not intentionally . If the defect was caused intentionally , Sajda-us-Sahw can be performed . <p> If one or more of the Wajib constituent parts of Namazi were not fulfilled or carried out by error , Sajda-us-Sahw must be performed . <p> After making this one Salaam perform two Sajdas as usual , sit in Qad ? ah and complete the Salaat as usual , i.e. recite Tashah-hud , Durood , and Dua and make Tasleem ( Salaam ) . <p> If the Namazi , in error , performs the two Sajdas of Sahw before making the one required Salaam , the obligation of Sajda-us-Sahw is discharged and the Salaat is in order . <p> If , in error , the Namazi performed two Ruku or three Sajdas , he must then perform Sajda-us-Sahw . <p> If during the process of Salaat , the Namazi pauses to think about what should be recited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds he must perform Sajda-us-Sahw . <p> In Qad ? ah Ula ( first sitting posture ) of a four Raka ? at or three Raka ? at Fardh Salaat , the Namazi by error recited Tashah-hud twice , he must perform Sajda-us-Sahw . <p> After Tashah-hud in Qad ? ah Ula of a three or four Raka ? at Fardh Salaat the Namazi , by mistake started to recite the Durood , if he recited the Durood as much as part one or more , the performance of Sajda-us-Sahw is compulsory . <p> However , if he recited less than the first part of Durood then it occurred to him that this is the Qad ? ah Ula , Sajda-us-Sahw is not to be performed in this case . <p> If Tashah-hud is recited twice by error in any Salaat , Sajda-us-Sahw has to be performed . <p> If the Namazi forgets to sit in Qad ? ah Ula of a three or four Raka ? at Fardh Salaat , and remembers so before raising his knees , he should immediately return to the Qad ? ah position .

If he is able to conclude that he had performed two , three or four Raka ? ats , he should accept this conclusion . No Sajda-us-Sahw is necessary in this case . <p> If the Namazi is unable to arrive at any decision , then in such a case he should opt for the lesser number i.e. , if the doubt is between two and three Raka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two Raka ? ats : if the doubt is between three and four , three shall be considered as the number already performed ; if the doubt is between one and two Raka ? ats , one Raka ? at shall be considered .
