A good open source solution is an important member of the playing field for microfinance MIS . I hope that COSM will do well carrying forward Mifos ! ! <p> I decided to write the Arusha Times today because after months of working with Airtel to fix a serious issue that affects prepaid internet users , I was finally told the truth today . That truth ? " NO . Now go away " <p> I am a very experienced network engineer &; security auditor from the US with 26 years of IT work under my belt . After moving here to do volunteer flight medical work , I bought an Airtel modem and subscribed to the 3GB/Week plan . Being a computer geek , I use A LOT of bandwidth . So I finish 3GB quickly , and then recharge and do it again . I quickly realized however , that it was cutting out before using the full 3GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional grade network monitoring software to see what was happening . I did this on several computers , with several SIM cards . What I found was that the service would cut off after only 1.5GB of usage , or 2.3GB , or only 1GB .. etc , randomly . I would check my account balance and Airtel would respond that I had used 3GB of data . <p> I brought this to the representatives at the Clock tower office . It did n't take them long to get a response from their technical staff that yes , they could see this happening , and that I was n't the only one to report it recently . By the time of writing this article , I have lost ( pro-rated ) 130,000 TSH from this . All the while being assured that I would be refunded and that this issue would be fixed . For FOUR months I was strung along , always being told it would happen soon . Finally today , I demanded that the refund be issued , and that I be given contact information for someone up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are n't authorized to give this information . That was it . Not only were months after months of my time wasted , but even worse , who knows how many other customers are being defrauded because they are n't as technically proficient as I am ? Now , I want to take a second and mention that while Airtel has failed miserably in both honesty and customer service , the representatives I worked with here in Arusha , despite being unable to accomplish anything for me , were very friendly and understanding . I hold no animosity in their direction . <p> So in the end , the fact remains that Airtel is taking money for a service and giving less than what is being advertised . They have decided to acknowledge this while at the same time refusing to do anything about it . Why should they ? They are getting free money from us ! Beyond that however , is the blind greedy arrogance to deny us the ability to resolve our issues with them civilly . Support emails go unanswered , repeated trips to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat denial .. access to those who have the power to do WHAT 'S RIGHT is blocked . <p> So here I am . Thank you Airtel for giving me incentive to be proactive and fight back . " <h> e-learning for the GRE <p> I took the GRE in December , 2011 and had to prepare myself while living in Arusha . Because the GRE test service , ETS , had recently revised the test , all of the print GRE study materials that I saw in Tanzania ( very few ) related only to the old GRE . To study for the revised test I decided to use only internet resources . This was one of my first full circle user experiences with e-learning : almost all study on a computer and the GRE test itself was a computerized exam . <p> For the sake of future GRE test takers who happen to come across this blog , here are my brief reviews of my study materials . They are listed in order of importance to the test . <p> Magoosh.com/gre - $99 - was an awesome online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and video explanations for each answer . There is a video library that covers all question types and a wealth of questions for each test section with dashboard to set your own study sessions . The Magoosh study materials are spot on for GRE difficulty , especially the Math . If you can master the Magoosh math , you will do really well on the GRE Math . <p> GRE Vocab iPhone App by Brainscape - $4.99 - was my ' crack the GRE Vocab ' tool . This iPhone/web app helped me to get through memorizing thousands of arcane vocabulary . It is a very basic flash card study system with card sets of 100 words . The flash card system has a built in word rating function , where you rate your level of knowledge on a specific word . The lower rated words would appear more often and give you more chance to view them before moving on to new words . The vocabulary set was highly relevant to the GRE . One big area where this app could be improved would be a quiz functionality for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good and inexpensive website with a revised GRE practice exams , plenty of practice questions , and clear question explanations ( written only ) . The material was a little bit on the easy side , so this resource might be good for someone just starting to study for the GRE . The best part about this website was that it made a good amount of study material available for a reasonable price . <p> ETS Practice GRE - free - is a full length practice GRE using the test day software . This got me used to the test format and the test taking software . It also gives an estimated score for the verbal and quantitative sections ( but not the essays ) . I highly recommend this practice test to get used to the GRE format and to give a baseline for studying . <p> BenchPrep.com - $149 - was my least favorite web app for GRE studying . I purchased the BenchPrep membership when I was just beginning to study for the GRE in July . When ETS announced their introduction of the revised GRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRE section would be updated with new materials for the revised test . I was assured that it would be done within a few weeks . It is now March , 2012 , and as I am writing this , BenchPrep has still not updated my account with study materials for the revised GRE . For such an expensive resource , this is hugely disappointing . Additionally , the BenchPrep flash card application ( web ) is terrible . They also built in chat functionality to the site , but it seems glitchy and always displays the same messages . I did not try BenchPrep 's iPhone app or Android app and for budding GRE scholars I would not recommend purchasing BenchPrep 's GRE materials . <p> Overall , this was a great experience to expose myself to an end to end e-learning experience . All of my studying was done online or iPhone ( with the exception to writing some of my study notes ! ! ) and the revised GRE is a computerized exam . I really liked getting immediate ' tutor like ' video or written feedback on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This helped me to focus on the question areas where I needed extra practice . I also found that my performance on practice quizes , getting 50% correct answers for example , fueled my motivation to improve my results . Also , the online materials helped me to prepare for the computerized exam , as I was very used to answering questions on a computer screen before taking the GRE . This could be especially useful for someone who has not yet taken a computerized exam . <p> E-learning is a technology branch that holds much promise for making education more accessible , fun , and engaging . This experience confirmed for me that e-learning is a viable channel for education and especially test prep , where there is a big 
##1311150 <p> In the summer of 2004 , while already well into my African adventures , I was still struggling to retrieve three crates with personal effects that I send from The Netherlands one entire year earlier , late summer of 2003 , with estimate arrival end of September 2003 . Here 's the sad , genuinely African story . I had put the three big crates with personal effects on transport by Maersk , from Rotterdam to Kampala . Everybody , Kenya customs , Maersk and Kampala customs tried to use time as a weapon to milk me . The transport , scheduled to last one month , took more than a year because I refused to pay bribes . The grand final was at Kampala customs ( all offices exclusively for Banyankole Bahima , the tribe of the president ) : Somehow Maersk , my clearing agent ! , decided to give them my crates . Customs put them in a Vietnam rice store full of rats , opened them , and waited for me to come and offer my bribe . They had bad luck : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the goods quickly . So , Uganda customs failed to get any money from me , and finallly satisfied itself by stealing a good suit from my crates . During all that time , my " customs clearing agent " Maersk just waited for what was to come . <p> Late summer of 2003 I still was in the Netherlands , a country well known for its elaborate red tape and associated corruption . I planned to leave to a decent country and could finally destroy the paper mess one needs in Netherlands to defend oneself against the Dutch government 's official robbers and blackmailers , called euphemistically : " civil servants " . <p> The transport price was 1600 euro . That may seem a lot of money , but what do you spend when you have to buy it all on arrival ? And how about the shopping and searching time that involves ? And what is the cost if something in the end turns out to be sent from Europe anyway ? The ETA of my crates at Kampala ( " Estimated Time of Arrival " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what subcontractor Maersk told my transporter Combitainer to write on my freight papers . A truck arrives with the container to be used for overseas transport . My crates , I see , share it with blue vessels containing chemicals for Kampala . My crates neatly fill up the rest of the container . <p> Two months later ( one month after ETA of my crates ) I am going to Uganda . I call Maersk . It is early November 2003 . My crates ? Nobody knows . Maersk will check and call me . But nobody calls . MY CRATES ? ? Not arrived . They are lost . We started an inquiry . We will call you back . But nobody calls , etc . <p> I keep calling Maersk and tell them they have until the end of December to find them . After that I have to return to the Netherlands until July 2004 . I came now , among other purposes , to collect those crates . For storage cost after an arrival later than my leave I can not be held liable . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Mombassa . They wait in a container that is not yet full . That story must be false , I explain , because when the container was filled in my presence in the Netherlands , the crates were the last items to fit in , the rest of the container was filled with blue liquid vessels , also for Kampala , so the container 20 FT MSKU 275492/0 , sealed for Kampala can not have been discharged in Mombassa . Why do n't you honestly explain me what happened ? I ask my Mearsk agent . But he sticks to his story . <p> Weeks pass , no phone from Maersk . I call . They are coming , Sir , they are coming , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow we will know more . End of December 2003 . On the day of my departure MAERSK CALLS . I do not take the phone . This is too accidental . They know when I leave . It looks like an orchestrated " loss " , and the expectation that I could bring some money to " find " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet had gotten cold , and a discussion about half a year of storage was feared . But the fear came too late . I could do nothing on my very day of departure . Neither was I ready to take someone in Uganda for the job of checking and collecting the crates . The situation was far too suspect . Though there is a packing list , in case of mixed personal effects a representative can not know exactly what had been transported in the crates and in what condition it had been loaded in the container . <p> Half a year later , on July 20th 2004 , I am back in Uganda and go to Maersk Kampala to collect the crates . This turns out not to be possible immediately because Maersk had decided to store the crates at subcontractor Interfreight , in another part of town . Custom clearing will be done there . For one week later , July 28 , 2004 , the Ugandan Customs Authority has decided to make a " full , complete , detailed inspection " of my crates . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maersk would also do my clearing ) . On my arrival , my crates were in the bond already ( nobody knew why ) , and broken open . <p> Those brown colored top plates are just as white as the others . The color is from the dust . the Uganda Customs Authority had chosen a store house for unwashed Vietnam Rice for my clearing ( an amusing term in the circumstances ) . This is illegal , this breaking of my crates , I tell the customs officer whose name I can remember less well than how I always call him : Mr. Lazy . According to the Maersk representative Geoffrey , the Uganda Customs Authority had opened the crates . " They have the power " . Mr. Lazy claimed to have had my permission . Show me that permission , I ask him . Mr. Lazy carried quite a load of papers but did not start to search . After this , all my crates were dismantled . <p> Photo right : al my old stuff is administrated by Mr. Lazy ( left ) item by item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Monkey-in-Chief , Mr. Lazy employs some underchimps for the breaking job . Sometimes he makes a symbolic quasi shrewd policelike gesture himself : for instance , he tries carefully where the keys of my electric piano can not be lifted instead of pushed . " I would take another piano teacher " . The crown around the rice store has by now grown to considerable numbers and has , it seems , some sense of humor , but not so Mr. Lazy . Suddenly , Mr. Lazy gets really excited . A box with video tapes . He orders the opening of the box , and then , for the first time , he personally checks . All individual tapes go through his own fingers . My fucking tapes have no factory labels and are dryly numbered F1 , F2 , F3 , ... etc. , so I say : down there between those rice bags we could put my video recorder , if you bring a monitor you can check all tapes . Is there power here ? I ask the crowd . There is some enthusiastic nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lazy forced himself laboriously back in upright position . Now he sees a traditional Ugandan hunting bow . What are you going to shoot with that ? Customs officers , I say , looking him deep into the eyes . That is illegal , says Mr. Lazy . What is in that box ? Books . Open please . Mr. Lazy looks : Dostoevsky , the Diesel Engine Repair Book , Warfare in the Late Middle Ages , Xenophon 's Anabasis . " OK " . Solemnly he writes something on his paper . And this one . Also books . This box contains Penguin Classics . The have color pictures on the cover . Again Mr. Lazy gets excited . There his fingers go again ! Pictures , pictures , pictures . Are you looking for something special ? Can I help you ? It is my task to check that no heuh ... material comes into Uganda that should not be there . Mr. Lazy did not encounter even one lady , not even dressed , on any of the covers , but I yet clearly see a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Leave it , says Mr. Lazy to his underchimps with a deep sigh . Another five boxes with books follow . They can stay sealed . Seeing some cheap 12 V spotlights Mr. Lazy makes a small attempt to catch me : where are they on the packing list ? Illumination articles . Disappointed , Mr. Lazy closes his papers . Inspection finished . No , he would not be able to write my clearing papers today , Mr. Lazy says . I can call Maersk tomorrow . <p> The next day I call Maersk . No , they did not have news from the Customs , they would call me . But they did not . The Customs also waited for a week , as I was explained later , to see whether I would come down to offer some money . In vain . After that week they demanded a " complete itemized specification " of the value of my crates . Leave that to me ! Quickly I import the packing list in Excel . My transporter Combitainer had advised to specify 1900 euro as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . Combitainer estimated that the 1900 valuation would get my crates cleared smoothly . Since that now clearly was not the case , my Excel sheet in no time adds up to 600 euro value on the Ugandan market , and zero on the European market , where used things like the ones in my crate will not find customers . I add that 600 euro is actually a bit large as a figure , the Customs can keep the crates if it is willing to pay me that money . <p> Two weeks later - as people told me later , the customs probably tried again to let me come for a bribe - MAERSK CALLED ! ! The crates were cleared by the Uganda Customs Authority . <p> In sum , the Uganda Customs Authority tried for more than a month to get some money out of the Muzungu immigrant . Maersk is the biggest clearing agent of Kampala . It has contacts everywhere in the Customs Authority , the government and the influential embassies . How can it be explained that Maersk lets this happen ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought more profitable by Maersk ? <p> The answer to another interesting question requires a longer story . This question is : what is clearing ? Here goes the story : On September 6 I go to Kampala to collect the crates . Maersk shows me a bill , which in euros runs as follows : <p> euros <p> 1 : <p> Agency fee <p> 41.46 <p> 2 : <p> Handling <p> 21.95 <p> 3 : <p> Storage charges for ICD <p> 88.08 <p> 4 : <p> Shipping line charges <p> 52.68 <p> ex VAT <p> 204.18 <p> 5 : <p> VAT 17% <p> 25.75 <p> Total <p> 229.94 <p> To begin with , I ask the storage tariff and calculate that I pay for 412 days . Mr. Musingusi has no answer . VAT is wrong . Mr. Musingusi , to cut I long story short , let me do a proposal . In whatever curious way you have calculated storage , let us take the figure for granted and share it . Musingusi disappears to consult Bent Anderson , the Danish manager of Maersk Kampala , told to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with very low transport and duty cost . Musingusi come back with <p> njet . Whether I wish to speak Mr. Anderson himself . I wish . Enter Mr. Anderson who makes the following points : <p> the bill is for external storage . Maersk has to pay that bill . Had it been stored on the Maersk premises the cases could have been different , but as it is , there is nothing he can do . <p> he did not know who had decided to move the crates from the Maersk storage to the Interfreight storage <p> it was not his fault , he also did not know why the crates had been brought in the Interfreight customs bond , and why they had been opened there without authorization . <p> he also did not know how they could have been lost in Mombassa for two months , such events were beyond his power <p> and now there were costs , storage costs , and there was one thing he knew : those were for me because " you are the customer " <p> After my offer to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that I would consult transporter Combitainer Rotterdam whom I paid for the transport and of whom Maersk acts as a subcontractor . <p> Thus after this day , my crates still stood in the bond between the dirty rice bags in Kampala . To have a chance of avoiding to have to do another detailed inspection to assess theft , missed items and damage , I had put a lot of tape around the crates and had marked it on many places where it met the wood of the crates . But that was against knowing better : the crowd curiously watching the " full detailed inspection " had been big and their had been no care for security at all . Moreover , the customs officers themselves clearly where the primary danger . <p> I mail Combitainer and claim that my financial clearing with Maersk should strictly be corrected as follows : <p> Deduction <p> euro <p> 6 : <p> Storage <p> 88.08 <p> 7 : <p> Cleaning Cost <p> 300.00 <p> 8 : <p> Theft , loss , damage <p> PM <p> Total deduction : <p> 388.08 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me euro 158.15 plus possible theft , missing items and damage , all still to be assessed . Plus 10 euro for every day after September 15 the crates have not been handed over to me . Combitainer reacts : our general manager has written to Maersk Kampala that they should be more lenient with the bill and we contribute $ 90 . Maersk adduces a new bill without storage cost . These costs were $94.10 . Since they get $90 from Combitainer , Maersk wants to contribute $4 and 10 dollar cents to the damage . Cleaning cost are for me because they had resulted from bad packing . <p> I give up . At eight o'clock in the morning on September 24 in the year of the Lord 2004 I take my motorbike , drive to Kampala to find myself a truck driver and get those crates . Meanwhile I had met Hadj , who was willing to take them on his truck to Jinja for 100 euro . But I was careful enough not to call Hadj too soon and first to see what would happen at Maersk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office with my money and papers . He will be right back . But he is n't . Used to it now and without the slightest irritation I go to the receptionist and say : please call Mr. Musingusi and tell him to come with my change , I have no time left for him . Enter Musingusi with his fists full of papers and my change . Well , that was it , I say . We shared a year of our lives . I am going to miss you . Musingusi thinks I am serious and is moved . He shakes my hand . <p> I call Hadj and haste myself to Interfreight . Though I am quite fast with my motorcycle , Hadj is already there when I arrive . He had been near . I enter the Interfreight premises and I am referred to a gentleman whom I will call three hours later , when we are still there , for myself Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One . He asks whether I have this or that paper . I throw the whole bunch before him , which is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail to the floor . Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One finds what he needs and disappears . He will be right back . But he is n't . He turns out to sit and the financial manger 's desk . They are writing a bill for me . Thank God I printed Maersk 's email where they claim their bill can not be reduced because the have paid the entire bill of Interfreight . Disappointment . To my satisfaction Maersk is invoiced for the remaining days in which the Uganda Customs Authority managed to keep my crates hostage . Then I get the clearance document . Clearance document ? I thought I had it already . No , this is the clearance document . Hadj is piloted to the Vietnam rice bond storage . The custom officer in charge , Mr. Lazy , is in another storage , says Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One . Formally , I should come back tomorrow . But Mr. Lazy will sacrifice himself and come at three o'clock . It is twelve . I exchange glances of understanding with Hadj and his helpers . The rest of that day Hadj and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? SACRIFICE HIMSELF ? ? ? Yes , Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One says . You should have announced you were coming . With your kind there is little to predict Absolutely-The-Last-One , you know that . And the Customs cleared that stuff one week ago , why was it not removed from the bond as they should ? We had no such orders . Three o'clock . Three o'clock . That is not four o'clock ? Absolutely not . Not half past three ? No , really . Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One decides to go . They are not serious , Hadj says , as a result of which I took him for a moment to be a McEnroe fan . I am going to do some shopping and have a lunch . <p> A three o'clock at Interfreight nothing has changed . Mr. Lazy , I was told , would be there in twenty minutes . I drive 40 in first gear through the dust to the office of Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One . He is not there , I say . He is coming , Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One says friendly . After a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say menacingly . At a quarter past three I put myself in the middle of the Interfreight premises and shout : if Mr. Lazy is not here within thirty seconds I beat him into the hospital ! ! Mr. Lazy is wise enough not to appear but lets himself be represented within thirty seconds by a carrier with a key . <p> AND THEN THE BOND STORE DOORS WERE OPENED ! <p> My crates stand two meters from the door . on these two meters pallets highly piled up with broken bags of rice are now put . I climb over them . My seals seem intact , but rat droppings all over and the triplex is chewed of by the rats . We have a discussion about how to clear the way for loading my crates . There is a fork lifter but in an unfortunate act of a crane driver it got stuck between two high piles of containers . So the bags are removed one by one , on the shoulders of carriers . The rat holes up as much as possible , otherwise the rice grains stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried with additional men left and right , holding their hands on the lower holes to stop the flow of rice on the ground . Those rats eat fair amounts of raw rice . In Japan that is a recognized method to commit suicide . Once eaten , the grain extends by absorbing water , your stomach bursts and your blood vessels empty themselves in a few seconds in your belly . The carpet remains clean . But those rats will know how to keep measure . Though rat corpses abound . Inconspicuously , Mr. Lazy approaches . That speed ! I shout . Uganda should send you to the Olympic games next time . It would finally earn a medal ! But you can go , we do n't need you anymore . No , Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One says , he has to make your clearance document . Clearance document ? I thought I had it already . No , Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One says , he is making the clearance document . Absolutely the last one ? Absolutely the last one , says Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One . Has he this or that form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One the whole bunch of papers again . Mr. Lazy signs the clearance document and Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One takes this to his office . He will be right back . But he is n't . I go and find him . Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One sits with his boss . The boss signs something . What is that ? The clearance document . Absolutely the last one ? Absolutely the last one , says Mr. Absolutely-The-Last-One . <p> In the meantime my dear Hadj had found elsewhere I guy with a fork lifter and had taken him to the bond . The crates go on Hadj 's truck , with my motorcycle . I enter the truck cabin with Hadj and the driver . Another helper stays on the truck . I give him my wind jack . Happiness is in a small corner with a 70 km trip ahead . Hadj and I do the high five , I contribute a bottle of mineral water to the party and we drive to the exit . <p> STOP ! do you have this or that paper ? Yes , sure ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The guard disappears in his office . He 'll be right back . But he is n't . I go inside . The counter document is lacking . In rage I turn around to sprint to Mr. **25;5046;TOOLONG office . But he is coming out before I reach him . Make it for him , he says to a girl . The girl strolls to an office . We are waiting . We are waiting . Then , she comes with a paper . What is this ? The clearance document . O , yes , we did not have that yet . Hadj en I shake hands . We drive ! But just before the main road is a small office . Whether I have this or that paper . With some effort , I manage to push the entire bunch out of the window . The man disappears in his office and stays there . I enter . Now I have to register the number plate of the car , the name and date of birth of the driver , and some other things of that nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns my paper bunch with a new rose colored paper on top . The clearance document ? Yes Sir . Thank you . <p> Photo right to left : Hadj , author , porter <p> In Jinja I break open the crates . A rat flies to Kiira Road . Dried and half dried dead rats stick to the pallets everywhere . We unload at sunset . I absolutely want on a picture with Hadj , the man who helped me through . You were my only friends today , I say . The rest are thugs . I give Hadj out of my crates a walking stick with a long knife inside . He can also take the wood of the crates . <p> The Uganda Customs Authorities turned out to have stolen , apparently even before I saw my opened crates for the first time , but I realized it only at home , one quite elegant European suit . That is , given the circumstances , a very good result . <p> In my room , I make a picture impression of the documents before I throw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe these papers are all meant to guarantee a good procedure . To make sure nothing gets lost , everything arrives on time , attempts to corruption are blocked and things like that . I ended up with 35 . Some carry the title " quadruplicate " . Let us carefully estimate that on average of every paper in my bunch two copies find themselves elsewhere in archives , just in case later on some checks are needed ( one should anticipate every possibility is n't it ? ? ) . Then we surely have more than one hundred papers . Those one hundred papers are not meant to guarantee a good procedure and actually achieve the contrary . The thing is that everybody who succeeds in making himself a necessary step in a procedure thus gains the possibility to receive a little something from those to whom he made himself indispensable . In Uganda , this is called " eating " . Africa is the most racist of continents : members of the tribe who has the president will be almost the only ones eligible for the official jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customs Authority officials are almost exclusively Bahima Banyankole , the presidents tribe . If you want to help poor people in Uganda by starting an NGO , procedures in Uganda have now become so baroque that one looses at least 5000 euro to official thugs before you are allowed to give something to someone who is ill or hungry . Is that a shame ? The important thing to realize is that those tribes with ill and hungry people would immediately start doing the same once they would have supplied the president . In the end of t he analysis the wealth difference between an African country and a western one is not the scale of corruption . In Europe , corruption involves much more money than in Africa , if it were only simply because there is more money going around . The thing is that corruption in Europe is better organized .

The one-day event centered on the theme of Youth Talent : Leadership and Innovation in Asia Pacific . <p> Business and AIESEC youth leaders from Asia Pacific were brought together through this Symposium . Corporations such as the Royal Bank of Scotland , Merrill Lynch , Singapore Exchange were amongst the 92 attendees at the occasion . <p> Ms. Gathoni Wang'ombe , SEAA Leadership Development Director of Unilever , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door that opened up exchange of opinions between corporates and youth . Students want to be heard and their views need to be taken seriously . They have provided insight that there is a reason behind job-hopping : nowadays , people want to move to other companies to seek personal development . " <p> During the focus group sessions , corporate leaders gained insight into how youth from various parts of the Asia Pacific perceive their career , ambitions and expectations . Topics covered include the methods of attracting youth during information sessions to final year students in universities . One suggestion included having company representatives at information talks share their personal work experiences ; thereby outlining the company 's values and cultures for the youth . <p> With Asia Pacific becoming one of the fastest growing regions , companies are seeking to attract and retain talent from this part of the world . Increasingly , companies are finding it difficult to compete for skilled talent -- people who have the technical skills coupled with soft skills like leadership and communication and the ability to work with diversity . High turnover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent and many youths in Asia typically spend two to three years in a company . <p> AIESEC previously held successful Symposiums in the Netherlands in 2006 and Egypt in 2007 .

My style is called ' Motswako ' ; it 's Tswana for ' mixture ' , which is exactly what my music is . It involves rapping in your own language on an unconventional beat . But I ca n't lay claim to the style as there were many who used it before I did including Bongo Maffin , Bafikile and HHP . <p> Tell us briefly about your musical journey My rap career started off with talent shows in the late 90 's when I used to perform with friends in our neighbourhood . It was not until 2009 that my group decided to let me go solo and I became Khuli Chana . <p> Why did you desert your group ? On the contrary , it was never my decision to leave the group - it was theirs . They asked me to go solo . <p> Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm currently one of the top acts in South Africa and each of the tracks on my album was a number one song as a single . Even today , I 'm still feeding from the proceeds of the album , which was released in 2009 . <p> As a hip hop MC , do you agree that the genre is dying ? Totally disagree . You see , as you travel , your perspective of things changes . What I believe is that it 's turning a new page with the present generation . If anything , there 's a lot more exciting music coming from the continent , and even the rest of the world is starting to recognise that Africa is the next big thing . <p> What lessons do you think we can learn from South Africa ? It has taken a lot of time for our industry to get to where it is and we 're not even there yet . We 've 
##1322552 <p> Tanzanite is a unique gemstone discovered as recently as 1967 that is found in only one place in the world - the small mining town of Arutia situated at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania . <p> This vibrant gemstone is 1000 times more rare than diamond and displays exquisite hues of vibrant blue . With a limited supply of gemstones , likely to last just a single generation , Tanzanite has captured the imagination of the world and earned its rightful place next to diamonds as a must-have gemstone . <p> Mined in a tiny 5 x 1-mile area in Arutia , Tanzanite is trichoric . This means it has three axis of colour and displays shades of colour when seen from different angles - shades of blue , violet and bronze are dominant in most stones . It is , however , the vibrant and intense blue tones for which the stone is best known for and sought after . <p> Tanzanite crystals were formed in the Great Rift Valley when massive tectonic plates shifted and magma , forced to the earths surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vanadium . Although these minerals can be found all over the globe , something unique took place in Tanzania when Vanadium bonded with Zoisite . As it was brought to the surface it was heated at the same time as crystallisation took place ? this heating is what causes Zoisite to turn blue . Lots of natural Tanzanite crystals are already blue when they are found as heating took place years ago ; but some are naturally brown and heat treated to ? fix ? the colour . <p> African culture sees Tanzanite as a gift from the gods - the legend goes that Tanzanite crystals were discovered after lightning struck the plains and fire swept through the brush . Local Maasai herdsmen discovered striking blue gemstones sparkling in the ashes once the flames had died down . These blue Zoisite gemstones , originally brown in colour , had been heated to a shimmering new shade by the intensity of the fire . <p> The actual discovery of Tanzanite remains something of a mystery - it is not known for certain who found the first crystal , but the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali Juuyawatu , a local Masai herdsman , found a piece of blue-violet crystal near the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro . Fascinated by its intense colour , he shared his find with Manuel D'Souza , a tailor by profession and prospector by passion , who was looking for rubies in the region . D'Souza had no idea he ? d stumbled upon an entirely new specimen , he believed the find to be a vibrant sapphire however , gemmological tests revealed that the crystal had a composition more complex than sapphire , and that its colour was more intriguing , more alluring , and more exotic than any other gemstone . <p> Word about the remarkable new discovery soon reached celebrated New York jewellers , Tiffany &; Co . Awed by the stone 's exquisite beauty they renamed Zoisite ' Tanzanite ' after its country of origin , and launched it at Tiffany 's in October 1968 , remarking that it was undoubtedly ' the most beautiful blue stone discovered in over 2 000 years . <p> Tiffany 's initiated the first tanzanite advertising campaign , declaring that Tanzanite could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany 's . Interestingly , there are many more Tanzanite consumers in the US than anywhere else in the world - up to 70% of global consumers . <p> **28;1264;TOOLONG <p> DIAMONDS <p> Diamonds are found in many parts of the world , but South Africa has produced some of the largest , best quality , and most famous diamonds in the world such as The Cullinan , Eureka , Star of South Africa , Niarchos , Taylor-Burton , Tiffany and De Beers Millenium Star to name but a few .

##1323051 <h> Africa : The Next Century is Ours ! <p> By Graca Simbine Machel <p> At the time this speech was delivered , Graca Simbine Machel was president of the Foundation for Community Development in Mozambique and chancellor of the University of Cape Town in South Africa . She is also the former First Lady and former Minister of Education of Mozambique , the former First Lady of South Africa and director of the groundbreaking 1994-96 United Nations Study on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children . The following speech was delivered by Machel upon her acceptance of the Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award , presented by Africare at the Africare Bishop Walker Dinner on Sept. 27 , 1999 , in Washington , D.C. <p> After all that has been said tonight I should n't be speaking now . But I will speak , and the reason is that tonight we celebrate women -- all the women of the world , but especially we celebrate the women of Africa . <p> Tonight I have been entrusted to give them visibility , to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because it 's not " me " -- it is us . <p> So , yes , we are proud to take the platform . <p> I feel extremely humbled at having to represent millions , literally millions , of African women in our townships and in our rural areas : those who , often , we believe to be anonymous but who really sustain our universe . That we are still here , we owe to them . It is a tremendous responsibility for me to give that face and that voice to those women . <p> We have a solid and stable family life in Africa . We owe it to our women . <p> We bring together communities . We manage diversity in our communities . We end up building harmony . We owe it to our women . <p> We are caring people . We care for the young ; we care for the elderly ; we care for the sick . We care for each one of us as one extended family . And who instills those values , this chain of solidarity across generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa , and especially the success of Africans , please applaud the women of Africa ! <p> On a more personal note , I would like to pay tribute to three women who played a tremendous role in my life : my mother , my eldest sister and an American missionary from Pennsylvania without whom I would have never entered university . <p> It still makes me sad to say this , but I was born 20 days after my father died . I am the youngest child in my family . My mother was left with a family of six of us . She brought us what she could manage from her work . But all of us were able to go to school , and we gained a strong sense of the importance of sharing in our family and in our community . <p> My eldest sister took me from my mother at the age of six , far away to where she was teaching , because it was the only way I could start school at the right age . Literally , she is my second mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as my mentor . She managed to make me feel secure emotionally although I was very far from my mother . She also opened my eyes to knowledge , to science . She is typical of those women who take charge of their siblings as their own child . <p> So , I would n't be what I am and I would n't have learned the lessons I have learned of caring for others , without the examples of my mother and my siblings . Whatever in life I have learned to do and am trying to do , they are my main point of reference and inspiration . <p> And when I speak of " millions of African women , " it is because my mother 's story and my sister 's story are replicated millions and millions of times on our continent . <p> The American lady was a missionary from Pennsylvania . She has since passed away but she remains for me a tangible example of solidarity between Africa and America . She trusted me . She knew that I had some potential and she advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to Portugal . <p> At a time when the United States government was not supporting our struggle , I had in my own life this example of what American people can do , caring for other people on our continent . And like me , hundreds of thousands of Africans can tell these kinds of stories . So when we say we are united and we are one , it is not mere political rhetoric . It is something that has directly touched our lives . We shake hands , we embrace and we feel , " Yes , we are one ! " That is why I feel very much at home tonight . <p> From those days of my poor upbringing in my village , I now stand here . I could say that many things have changed since then . Indeed they have . But at the same time , I also feel that much is unchanged . Many of the girls of my village with whom I grew up , did not achieve adulthood . They died of various diseases . Some did not reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me , but they look as if they were in their seventies , drained by all sorts of suffering . There is still tremendous work to do in our country . <p> And we are here to say this . We are at the end of the century , at the end of the millennium . We are proud of the tremendous progress the human race has achieved . But we are a human society full of contradictions . We have tremendous wealth in our hands , concentrated in a few people , a few corporations , a few nations . Yet the majority , billions of people not only in the developing world but also here , go hungry and without a home . Many children can not reach school . <p> We say : Why do we have this wealth , if it does n't serve human beings ? We have knowledge , and as human society we made tremendous progress in science and technology . We can research and investigate almost every single issue if we so wish . We have the resources and the knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knowledge . There is a revolution in information technology which could bring us together . But we run the serious risk that , instead of building a common village , we might develop two different worlds : those who can have access to these resources and knowledge , and those who can not . <p> And we must ask ourselves : How many young girls , as in my village , are still living like that ? Are we prepared to accept it ? Is this the legacy we want to carry with us to the new century ? <p> We have developed sophisticated systems to promote democracy . But the reality , if you will bear with me , is that in many instances , even where national , regional and global institutions are elected , people are distant from those institutions and even from the people they have elected . We do have formal democracy . But at least on my continent , our institutions are very much urban , middle class , middle-aged and male dominated . They exclude rural people , who are the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half of our population . And they exclude the young , who in many cases on our continent can be as much as sixty percent of the population . What kind of democracy is this , which excludes majorities ? <p> We have what we call judicial systems . Ask the ordinary citizens of my country and my region whether they know how to get the courts to help them get their rights respected and to help get the law to protect them . In the seventies when we were in the liberation struggle , we talked about people 's participation and we talked about people-centered development . But now , if we consider carefully , it seems as if power is not centered in people , and that wealth is not centered in people . What went wrong ? <p> We all agree that this is man made . We did it , so we can undo it . We must undo it . <p> I want you to come with us on a beautiful journey in which the next century is Africa 's century . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our ancient civilizations -- from Monomutapa to Benin to Ghana to Egypt ( Remember ? That is our Africa , too ) . We are determined to vindicate the fact that scientific knowledge is something that was once a shining example of African creativity . Yes , we developed math , physics , medical knowledge , astrology -- from African soil . That is what we are . <p> Then came the nightmare of slavery , of colonialism , neocolonialism , the effects of the Cold War , mistakes we have made -- all of this rendered Africa what it is today . <p> But I tell you , we came to understand : " Enough is enough ! " <p> We are going to change the face of our continent and we are going to bear our children to live , not to die . <p> We are going to put our house in order . <p> We are putting our house in order now . <p> Yes , we do still have problems of conflict . But we -- our leaders together with our civil society organizations -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Lakes and to settle the problems in West Africa , in the Horn of Africa , in Rwanda , everywhere . We are in charge and we are going to bring this conflict to an end . <p> We are still very poor , and we are counted only as representing " Third World " trade . But we want to say : In the next century we are going to transform our continent . In the first place , we are not going to accept being counted only as a market . We want to affirm ourselves with the dignity of the human beings that we are , prepared to interact with the rest of the world , to give and to receive for the benefit of the human beings on our continent . <p> Yes , we do have serious problems with the AIDS pandemic . There is no need to talk about statistics , nor about particular countries . We all acknowledge and recognize that this is a problem . But we are taking serious measures , which means that behavior , attitudes and people are changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Messages have to be communicated to inform everyone , and we need you to help us get the messages across . But it is our responsibility to educate our women , our men and especially our young people , and to say , " Yes , you can protect yourselves , you can live . " We will not allow Africa to continue to be the worst point of reference for AIDS . We have to reverse it , and there are good examples : Uganda , Malawi and others . We have started . We will get there . <p> Yes , we also do have some shining examples of economic growth . There are countries on our continent which have had sustained growth for the last decade -- modest , it is true , but a test . It shows that we can do it , and that builds our self-esteem , our self-confidence to be once again in charge as we have been before . <p> As we say , the next century is Africa 's century . <p> But I want also to share it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's century , and I challenge every one of you . We no longer want to walk behind a man . We want to walk side by side . <p> We do n't want to continue saying , " We play an important role in the informal sector of the economy . " Why only the informal sector and not the formal sector ? We also want to be in the formal economy . <p> We want our seats and our place in our parliament , in our government , in our judiciary , in all decision-making bodies . We want to be there . South Africa is an example and Mozambique is an example . Yes , we are starting to get there . South Africa has one of the highest rates of women in parliament and women in government . Probably the only countries better than us are the Scandinavian countries . We are determined . We are serious about it and we will make it . <p> We do n't want to be absent any longer from our regional organizations , such as SADC and ECOWAS . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially for that . If we are very good at managing diversity in our families , where we manage the differences between the elderly and the young and we keep our families harmonious ; if we are good at the grassroots and community levels , then why not at the national , at the regional and at the global levels ? <p> Yes , we know how to do it . We just need that greater visibility and that broader platform that I spoke of at the beginning . We want to be visible . We want to speak loud . We want to be assertive . Especially , we want to be very proud of ourselves . And we can , because we have done it before . <p> But I want to conclude , in the next century , we Africans have a special gift to humankind , some of those beautiful and good things that so-called development and progress have lost : our sense of humanity ; our sense of sharing and caring very profoundly about each one of us ; that way of organizing our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we want more knowledge , we want economic development . But we also want to preserve those values . We do n't want to break up our families . And that is the gift we have to bring to you . We want more capital flow in the form of investment , but we will give back to you the best of ourselves , the best in human beings , to help you to go back and develop those networks and support systems that progress and development do sometimes break . <p> Now , I know that I am talking to converted people in this room . The things I am saying are not necessarily directed at you . That is why you are here : You love Africa and Africans and you are committed to Africa . ( But when I talk about women , I 'm not so sure -- probably not ! ) <p> But the challenge as we leave this room tonight and reflect , is this : " Yes , we have been in partnership with Africa , but is that enough ? Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because there is a sense of urgency . We can not postpone it any more . We can not accept that we have 5,000 Africans dying every day and find it normal . They are not mere statistics -- they have a face like any one of us here . They are our children . I have children around the age of 16 . I do not know whether I will be able to spare them in the next 10 years . <p> What we are talking about must be done today , and be done better , and be done more . If each one of us says , " Yes , " side by side , everywhere at all levels then it will definitely change our society . We will not be able to continue to be cool to the suffering of others . We wo n't be able to accept violence as a way of solving conflict . We will 
##1324151 <p> It seems long ago now since we got on the plane in Dublin , Ireland to make our journey here to Arusha and to start our volunteer work with LOHAD . Now that we are here just over a month and have experienced so much we know now that we would have come here a lot sooner . Fortunately for us , back in Ireland in June of this year we had a chance meeting with a previous volunteer who told us about LOHADA and the wonderful work that this organization is doing for the disadvantaged kids and the elderly in Arusha and Shinyanga . After hearing from him we immediately started making plans for our trip and here we are . <p> LOHADA stands for Loving Hand for the Disadvantaged and Aged and from what we 've experienced , seen and felt it certainly lives up to its meaning . From the very start , LOHADA and all its dedicated staff , sponsors and volunteers has helped to prevent young kids from growing up on the streets . It provides a safe and secure environment where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time supporting and helping their families . LOHADA 's work is supported by contributions from many local individuals and businesses and volunteers . <p> For us it has been a wonderful experience to work with LOHADA and to get involved in the ongoing projects in order to keep their vision alive . Coming to Camp Moses every day and seeing the kids with their smiling faces and experiencing first hand the love , care and education they receive is truly fantastic . <p> We also had the opportunity to spend some of our days in Camp Joshua Christian School . This school opened earlier this year and provides further education for the older children from Camp Moses and also for kids in the surrounding area . This school was purposely built in the area of Unga Ltd. in order to allow kids from very poor families to walk to school in order to get a decent education . The children who come here get both a breakfast and a lunch , something that may not happen if they did n't attend school . The teachers and staff are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the most memorable days we had here was when we went with the social worker to visit the support group . This group consists of women whose children are under the care of LOHADA . They meet every Wednesday and Friday afternoon to make handmade products such as small bags , table mats and beads . The aim of the group is to earn money and a regular income in order for the women to be able to be reunited with their children and be able to provide for themselves . When we met with the group we got a warm welcome and each one kindly told us a little bit about their lives and the circumstances that had led them to form the group . It was both sad and encouraging to listen to what they had to say and both of us found it inspiring to know that they are coming together as a group to help themselves and improve their life . This group needs as much help , support and encouragement as possible in order for them to continue with the wonderful work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being formed in 1997 by Mama Wambura , has grown and developed into a wonderful organization . It has already helped hundreds of children , their families and the elderly , but the organization wo n't stop there . They will continue to help and support those under their care while widening the door to any other child , individual or their family who might need their help . <p> Working with LOHADA has been an amazing experience for us , and one we will never forget . Once our time here reaches an end and we have to go back home to Ireland , we will be passing on our experiences , memories and what LOHADA stands for to as many people as possible , and when we return next year we hopefully will have brought with us more volunteers . <p> If this article in any way has helped you to understand the work that LOHADA does and if you would like to help or contribute with food , medicine , clothes , school books , stationery or funds , please contact info@lohada.org or visit www.lohada.org . All contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children . <p> Finally , we would also like to say " Asante Sana " to Mama Wambura , Anthony Muthunga ( Camp Manager ) , Afesso Wilson Ogenga ( Social Worker ) , LOHADA , the children 
##1324251 <h> Archive of our Alaska Trip - <h> Nome <p> We arrived in Alaska on June 17th . As of June 29th , here 's where we 've been : <p> Nome ! <p> Like Barrow , there are no roads leading to Nome . To get here you fly , take a ship or mush in behind a dogsled . Yet the character of this town is completely different from Barrow . <p> Nome is a gold rush town . This is the town where gold was found on the beach . In fact even today there are gritty old prospectors who live in tents on the beach through the summer with their sluice boxes panning for gold ! We kicked around some sand , but found only rocks and a starfish . Camping on the beach is free , although the facilities are poor ( okay , nonexistent - Yannis was not up for the adventure ) . <p> Welcome to Nome ! <p> The people of Nome want to have fun . The people are all so friendly , and so happy to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting you to have a good time . We had been in Nome 10 minutes when a fellow tried to buy us our first beer . When we said we did n't think the kids were up for a beer , he paid our cab fare instead ! <p> The weather remained unseasonably warm , so much so that the kids thought a dip in the Bering Sea was in order . <p> Cooling off in the Bering Sea ( 40 F ) <p> Although their favorite all time activity was climbing on the boulders that make up the sea wall . <p> Nome Sea Wall <p> But Nome is also famous for being the inspiration for the Iditarod sled dog race , the longest such race in the world at 1049 miles , which ends on Front Street here in Nome every March . In fact they drag this sign out into the middle of the street and it is the official finish line ! <p> Iditarod Finish Line <p> These are the trail markers , which run along side the Nome Council Road . <p> Iditarod trail marker <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for a snack . The place we stopped turned out to be the last mandatory stop for all mushers on the Iditarod - it is the Safety Sound Roadhouse . And Tom , the barkeeper , was full of stories of mushing and racing . He showed us photos and even gave Anika a dog booty from his collection for show and tell next year ! It is likely that we were about the only visitors Tom had all day and that he was really glad to have company , but we sure enjoyed our visit ! <p> Safety Sound Roadhouse <p> You will all be happy to hear that in Nome we were not at the ends of any runways , we had blackout curtains , there were no mosquitoes in our room , we did not have to get up at the crack of dawn , the temperature in our room was well below 85 and there were no fire alarms going off in the 
##1325050 <p> I teamed up with Eric and Sara again to do The Lesson for the SCDA one-act festival but that was the only show I did in 94 . <p> After the show I was dispatched to Liverpool with side trips to Leeds which made rehearsing for the next round a bit of a pain . <p> Come Easter weekend I was committed to hill-walking in Perthshire and performing in Edinburgh , all from a Liverpool starting point . I got back to Edinburgh in time to pack for a Good Friday departure to Killin with friends . Alan had come up from Manchester and joined us . <p> I used to go to Liverpool quite a bit when I was a kid because I had an aunt there . Since Ewan went to Liverpool University I 'd been a couple of times in the 80s as well . It was good to see it again . There was a lot of less than beautiful urban landscape but it was not all squalor and I found plenty entertainment in the evenings . I looked up my old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and even enjoyed the travelling most of the time . Such a pleasant life clearly could not continue . <p> In May I agreed to take on a project in Aberdeen . I said I 'd do it for 6 months while someone based in Aberdeen was brought up to speed . ( I eventually did 9 ) . Aberdeen is a handsome , well equipped town conveniently close to splendid countryside but the work was hard and I had insufficient free time to build up much of a social life there and being away from home all week limited my Edinburgh activities - plenty of theatre going but no participation . <p> While in Aberdeen I had a long-range battle with a pair of squirrels who were living in the roof of my Edinburgh home . Most of our white hunters did n't want to know . " Difficult to get rid of squirrels " was the optimist 's comment . " Could lend you some traps but never had much success with them . " offered another . After failing to shift them myself by either reasoned argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found a man who claimed to be the answer to the squirrel-infested maiden 's prayer . Significant amounts of money changed hands over time and various access points were blocked up with squirrel repellent and eventually I was free of them . <p> I had two good holidays . Siobhan and I spent a week driving through western France and central Spain wining and dining as we went , then about a week with my friends Hernan and Mary Harboe near Malaga with more wining and dining . We rounded the holiday off with a week wining and dining our way eastwards along the Mediterranean shore and northwards through France . Strenuous it was not . Some souvenir pictures here . <p> At Christmas I went out to Oman to visit Ewan and had a splendid time in the desert and other parts of the back of beyond .. <p> Finally for 94 a titbit from the Christmas letter I sent to various friends and which has , unlike practically every other , survived . <p> I quote - " I have not tried this Internet yet but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely wee laptop and no longer have to

##1330251 <p> I flew from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza , on the south end of the lake , changed planes and then flew from Mwanza to Bukoba . There is one plane that flies to Bukoba . It goes back and forth between Mwanza and Bukoba two times a day . When I occasionally see it coming in for a landing I swear I can hear somebody yelling " The plane boss , the plane ! " . Below is a picture of them unloading the plane at the Bukoba airport ( terminal 1 ) the day I arrived . The dirt runway ends where the lake begins and in the distance is Musilla island . During the rainy season , sometimes flights to Bukoba are cancelled because the runway gets too muddy . <p> There are two of us working at the same hospital . Sarah , the lab tech from Uganda and myself . We were met at the airport by our boss from the hospital , where we received a warm welcome . He apologized that our houses would n't be ready for two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel close to the hospital . He took us to the ' Upendo Lodge ' to check in and unpack . The room had a toilet , hot water and even a TV with cable . I figured " OK , this wo n't be bad for two weeks " . I looked up the word ' upendo ' in my trusty Kiswahili dictionary and learned the translation was ' love ' . Hmmm , the ' Love Lodge ' . I figured , " ok this could be an interesting two weeks " . Fortunately the hotel turned out to be a quiet place where a lot of government and hospital people stayed while in town . The doctor wasted no time beginning to show us around the town and helping us get what we would need . The next day he picked us up at the hotel and took us to see where we would be working . <p> The Kagera Regional Hospital HIV Care and Treatment Center <p> I was given an office in the HIV Care and Treatment Center . Sarah 's working in the laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab tests for the HIV clinic . The CTC is an outpatient clinic where people are tested and treated for HIV . HIV positive patients visit once per month for a check up and a prescription for Anti-Retroviral Treatments . They also receive counseling at the center . Pregnant women and mothers receive special counseling from PMTCT ( Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission ) counselling staff . Every six months a blood sample is taken and a CD4 cell count is done which shows the patient 's level of immunity and tells the doctors if the treatments are working or if the prescription needs to be changed . The clinic is small and very busy , handling patient 's from up to about a 60 km vicinity . The clinic is crowded with people every weekday morning , putting through from 60 to 110 patients with ususally two doctors prescribing . There were 1472 patients registered at the beginning of March and there are over 100 new patients enrolling every month . The actual number of active patients is hard to know because we do n't have accurate records right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center at the Kagera Regional Hospital is the only one in the region to store patient records electronically . When I arrived I found one stand alone computer , running XP , in the file room with an Access database that had been implemented by Medicine du Monde , a French NGO working at the center . The patients ' visits are recorded on paper cards and then entered into the database on a daily basis . There is one data entry clerk , Azza , working full time on maintaining the database . A second computer had been purchased for me . I had a brand new Dell and two new HP printers ( one color ) waiting in my office . <p> I began my job by becoming familiar with the database . I 've done a couple spreadsheets and a little maintenance but the main part of my work has been focused on the database . I took the initiative to start writing queries to get statistics from the database for the doctors . Though they had gotten the records entered into the database , they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors were very impressed by the information that could be extracted from it and very excited about the amount of time previously spent on manual counts that could be saved . I was a hit ! They 've also started tracking patients in ways they could n't before . For example , I produced a report of patients which have not visited within two months , showing details of their condition up to their last visit . We need to track the ones who have died or transferred to another center so the NACP can keep accurate records of active patients on ARV . It was n't long before I found some inconsistencies in the data , so I began writing queries looking for errors . A lot of the errors I found required referring to the paper records , which put an extra load on both Azza and myself . Between the increasing number and complexity of the reports the doctors wanted and the ongoing job of fixing problems , it did n't take long for me to become very busy . <p> I met two representatives from Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , Dr. Gail , is based in Dar es Salaam . Columbia U is doing a study on the treatment of HIV . They are funding CTC centers through Tanzania and MDM in Kagera with a grant from the American government . I found out that they were working in conjuction with the National AIDS Control Program ( NACP ) in Tanzania to improve the treatment of the disease and to collect data . A new database had been designed and was to be implemented in CTC 's all through the country . Because Kagera was already using a database and had an IT person , we were to be one of the first to implement it . I got a copy of the program to start working with and comparing to the old one . Both were designed in MS Access but the designs were quite different . The programmers from Columbia and myself would transfer the records to the new database . After meeting with Dr. Katole , the director of the CTC , we decided to make the transition at the end of March . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into service but several differences in the designs of the database as well as changes in drug codes used by the NACP and clinical staging codes put out by the WHO made for complications . During April ( and possibly May ) I will be busy finishing converting parts of records to the new system and rewriting reports I had created in the old database . I will continue working with Columbia testing the new database and giving feedback . It has many reports built into the front end already but several more specific reports will need to be written for Kagera . I expect to be doing a lot of SQL and Visual Basic to create standard reports that the health care staff can run from the front end . Perhaps the NACP and Columbia will be able to make use of some of the code I write in the future . <p> I 've written a proposal to build a LAN to connect the 2 computers in the CTC and the ones in the MDM office to make the database more accessible . Columbia is going to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more computers . I want to add a computer at the registration office of the CTC and start training more people to use the new database , gradually . I 'm sure that it can help with patient flow and I know that it can save the nurses hours every day producing reports they currently do manually . Then , the laboratory will get a computer and be connected to the network , so that we can order , retrieve and store the CD4 counts electronically . Finally , the pharmacy will be connected and this will allow better tracking of the ARV drugs . As a development worker , my goal is to facilitate the growing use of technology at the center so that when I leave , there will be staff there that can keep it running without me . I need to find counterparts to begin working with me right from the initial stages so that we have as much time as possible for training . I wanted a challenge when I came here and I have it . Looking now at all that has to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> I 'm also looking at possibilities for an Internet connection in the CTC . MDM and four other offices on the hospital grounds have connections now through the local ISP but they 're painfully slow and expensive . Perhaps , in the long term a satellite dish at the hospitlal will be the way to go . As other CTC centers get the databases going and the NACP starts to depend more on elecronic gathering of statistics , I think an Internet connection will be a must . I need to explore all of the options , including the cost of installing a dish , and try to get the ball rolling to put something in place . There are volunteers at a small mission hospital not far from Bukoba who have organized the installation of a Satellite dish there . They do n't have any Internet now . I said I would go out there and help them set up an Internet cafe after the dish is set up . I may use their experience if I decide to push for a dish here . <p> BUDAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to visit BUDAP . BUDAP is the Bukoba Disabled Assistance Project . It 's a licensed charity which employs local people with disabilities . It was started by Bart , a VSO volunteer from Holland , and is run by Raymond , a local man known in town as ' Teacha ' . The people working at BUDAP make various things like drums , shakers and items woven from bark cloth , such as bags and hats . Most of the products are sold locally but some are also exported . My nephew , Boyd is definitely going to get one of those drums and my neice , Kelsey is getting the nicest bark cloth bag I can find . Maybe they 'll make one to order with her name on it . <p> A Bit Of Trivia <p> The next picture is of the Lake Hotel . Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn lived here while they were making the classic film " African Queen " . I think it was the first hotel in Bukoba and it 's certainly the most well known . I 'm told many important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking a little run down but in its day it was apparently very nice . It 's a landmark and not something people are willing to let go of , so 
##1330252 <p> April has been an interesting month . Work at the CTC has been very , very busy . The transition to the new database and the creation of new reports has really kept me going . It has n't all been work , though . I 've met some new people and had the opportunity to see a couple of places outside of the town . <p> My House <p> It 's the end of the April and I 'm still living in the ' Love Lodge ' . The hospital did n't come through with finding houses for us but with the help of Bart and Mr. Majid , a teacher at the secondary school and all ' round entrepeneur , Sarah and I found houses and the hospital leased them for us . I picked one a little ways out of town up the hill . It was a neat little house beside a cliff overlooking Bukoba and the lake . I figured it would be about a twenty minute bike ride . The hospital would n't go for it though because it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth by myself that far . I got my second choice which is a great big house near the airport , about a 20 minute walk to the hospital . It has a massive yard with a huge garden , and a chicken coupe . <p> I 'm going to need to get someone to help with the lawn . They cut grass by hand here . Even on the hospital grounds , where are boys out slashing the grass with a kind of custom blade . At home , anything less than a riding mower would be absurd for that much grass . It 's funny how the gaps in technology make for a mix of old and new . The boys taking care of the lawn are using hand held blades but everyone of them has a cell phone . There are very few land lines here but more cell phones than at home . They just kind of skipped a generation and went right to the mobile network . It 's the same with computers . All the computers I 've seen are PIV 's running XP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DOS/X86 generation . <p> I have the keys to the house now and I bought a mattress and pillows this week . The house came with a bed frame and a few other misc. pieces of furniture . I 'm getting some bedding and cutlery donated by another volunteer , Valerie . She 's a nurse trainer in Ndolage who 's been here for 8 years . She 's collected quite a bit of stuff and has been great about helping out . I 'll still have to get the rest of the furniture that is in my contract and get reimbursed for the cost of the mattress . The last time I talked the hospital about a matress they suggested I take an old matress from the hospital . The hospital beds are 3x6 and mine is 5x6 so they figured I should be able to fit 2 together and make that work . I did n't like that idea much so I decided to get myself a new matress and worry about getting the money back later . Once I get the bedding I 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week . I 've applied for a post office box too and should have that next week . I 'm getting settled , little by little . <p> Someone suggested I get a goat to help with the lawn . I 've been considering chickens too . Fresh eggs and the occasional home made chicken dinner would n't be bad . I 'll see how busy I 'm going to be before I become farmer Wayne . <p> Bukoba Overtaken By Edmontonians <p> One of the VSO volunteers in Tanzania , Elly , is from Edmonton . She 's been working in Zanzibar for two years and has just extended for another year . She came this way on her vacation this month with a couple of friends from Edmonton , Nathon and Meaghan . They 've been living in Japan teaching English and were doing some tavelling on their way home to Canada . The three of them were on their way to Uganda to go rafting on the Nile and I met up with them and Sarah for dinner while they were in town , just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Lake Victoria and talk about life in Edmonton . The rest of them had n't been there for years but it did n't seem like a whole lot had changed . They were leaving on Friday morning and Sarah was going home to Campala for the weekend so she rode on the bus with them to Uganda . I did n't think of it at the time but I should have gotten a picture of us . That 's probably the most Edmontonians that have ever been in Bukoba at the same time . <p> My New Position <p> I 've now met all of the VSO volunteers in the Kagera region . There are 12 of us in total and we were all in Bukoba on the weekend of the 29th for a regional meeting with Prudence , our program advisor from Dar es Salaam . Ruari , the regional volunteer representative convened the meeting and one of the things on the agenda was his replacement . He 's going home to Ireland in May . I volunteered for the job and they decided to let me be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main office and passing it on to the volunteers in the region , organizing meetings , meeting new volunteers and flying to Dar es Salaam three times a year to represent the region in the country meetings . I think it will be interesting , I just hope I 'm going to have time for everything . The country meetings are scheduled to coincide with the arrival of new volunteers , three times per year . My first trip to Dar , as the rep , will be in June when the next intake of volunteers arrives . <p> The VSO volunteerso of the Kagera Region <p> Ndolage <p> I visited Ndolage on the Easter long weekend . There is n't much there , a mission hospital , a nursing school and a tiny village . Three VSO volunteers are stationed there . Valerie is an instructor at the nursing school , Kate is a physiotherapist at the hospital and Nichola is a pediatrician at the hospital . Valerie and Nichola are British and Kate is Canadian . They invited myself and two volunteers from another hospital in Rubya for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubya to Ndolage ( about 25 kms ) . Ruari is an occupational therapist from Ireland and Cobi is a nursing instructor from the Netherlands . Ruari ran in a marathon near Mt Kilimanjaro in Feb . He finished in 2:55 and was the first mzungu ( white person ) across the line . <p> I 'd been planning to go to Ndolage for awhile . There is currently no Internet access at the hospital and Bart and Majid had been helping the hospital arrange to setup a satellite dish and Internet caf . I agreed shortly after I arrived to help any way I could and I was interested to learn what I could about putting in a dish . As it turned out , there was noone around on the weekend to show me what they were setting up but it was nice to get out of the hotel room for a couple of days and I got a couple of really good meals . I took the dala dala to Ndolage on Saturday and hitched a ride with one of the hospital vehicles that was coming into Bukoba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boonies but they 're in a beautiful spot . By car it 's about 45 min ; on the dala dala took me about 1.5 hours . The hospital is on a hill overlooking a huge valley with Lake Victoria off in the distance . On Sunday , we hiked along rocky cliffs to the waterfall that provides part of the electricity for the hospital . <p> While we were there , Cobi and I took a tour of the hospital and went with Nichola on her rounds through the children 's ward . <p> VSO wants to get pictures of volunteers at work for newsletters and such , so I had a good excuse to take along my camera on the round . I wanted to be careful to get the guardians permission before taking any childrens pictures so I was going through in my mind how to ask politely in Kiswahili . I was n't sure what people might think of me wanting to take pictures of their suffering children . As it turned out they all quite liked having their kids pictures taken . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to get a picture of them all . <p> The hospital is laid out much like the government hospital in Bukoba . Single story buildings spread around a large compound . The buildings are connected by a covered outdoor walkway . Each ward is a separate building . Hospitals here work a little different than at home . At a government hospital , such as the one I 'm working at in Bukoba , the care and medication is provided at no cost . These hospitals tend to be backed up and crowded . At a mission hospital , such as Ndolage , patients get care and medication for a daily fee . I get the impression , better care can be gotten by those who can afford it at the mission hospitals . Neither type of hospital provides food to the patients . It 's up to the families to bring patients meals and , in the children 's ward , a parent or guardian must stay with the child . It 's usually the mother that shares one of four beds in a room with her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing the children 's ward at Ndolage was an experience I wo n't soon forget . <p> Most of the kids in the ward had malaria . Malaria is the biggest killer in Tanzania -- mostly children . Everybody here gets malaria and when children get it they get very sick . If they survive it through their childhoods , then , as they keep getting bitten , they eventually build up some amount of resistance . Adults get sick with it too but not usually fatally . M alaria is definitely a major cause of death but the actual numbers are hard to know , as malaria is over diagnosed . Most of the people admitted to hospitals do have malaria in their blood and it 's usually blamed as the cause of illness by marginally trained clinical officers . It 's not always the actual cause of the illness though . I saw a chart that showed the deaths by malaria far above any other cause at 98 for one year . That 's just in the children 's ward at one little rural hospital . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in Tanzania . <p> Seeing children dying from something preventable and treatable like malaria is sad . It seems to be a sore spot with health care people in the country that while malaria is the biggest killer , as far as diseases go , the funds to combat it are small . Funding for HIV research and treatment is massive . That 's why I 'm here . Certainly the fight against HIV is important but if malaria kills more people than HIV , is n't it just as important ? I have asked the reason for the discrepancy and gotten some ideas from different people but no definitive answer . I wonder if it 's because HIV is a potential threat to industrialized nations while malaria is not ? <p> The kids that were n't suffering with malaria were there because of HIV or malnutrition . The malnourished ones are given milk by the hospital as part of their treatment . There was one little guy I saw , only a few months old , who was brought in suffering from malnutrition . In his stay there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put on some weight but he and his mother had both just tested positive for HIV . Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission ( PMTCT ) is a big part of the education and counseling done in the fight against HIV . Transmission from a HIV positive pregnant women or mother to the child can be avoided with drugs and by not breastfeeding but for the unlucky ones , like the little boy in the hospital , there 's no going back . The stages of his illness will progress and his immunity will decrease . He 'll be put on a monthly prescription of ARV drugs , which he 'll need to stay alive for the rest of his life . He 'll be a victim of the stigma associated with the disease and he 'll never be able to have a normal sexual relationship or safely father children . Thinking of him and his mother , I wonder how she will explain all this to him when he 's old enough to understand . I 'm not sure who I feel worse for . Fortunately PMTCT education is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure such a life . <p> The child that I will remember the best from my visit to the Ndologe children 's ward was ' Baby Daniel ' . Daniel 's mother died of gangrene in their remote village when he was two months old and still breastfeeding . His twelve year old sister ( below ) took on the role as his caregiver and started feeding him porridge . He was n't growing though and the family did n't expect him to live . Two VSO volunteers , Russ and Annette , a husband and wife doctor team from the UK , were out in the area doing community care and came across Daniel , severely malnourished . They brought him to the hospital at Ndolage and the hospital offered free care for him and to feed his sister while she stayed with him . He and his sister had been living in the hospital for several weeks when I saw them . He 'd been drinking milk but had n't gained any weight or grown . They were going to start him on TB treatments next . Daniel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance because of volunteers like Russ , Annette and Nichola . Nichola said to me that she saw him smile for the first time that day and she was n't giving up on him yet . <p> Thankfully , for every child I saw lying in a hospital bed , I saw three playing outside with huge smiles stuck on their faces , delighted by the opportunity to try out their English on me . The poverty here causes kids to go without some of the basics but not without all of them . Love and attention do n't cost money and from what I 've seen so far , most kids get plenty of those . The sense of community and of family in this society is strong and I believe the majority of kids here are secure and happy even though they learn very young the realities of sickness and hunger . <p> Musila Island <p> There are many inhabited islands in Lake Victoria . One of them is just off the Bukoba shore . It has a little fishing village of between 300 and 500 people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on one of them on a Friday afternoon . It was about a 20 minute ride on a wooden fishing boat with an outboard motor . The people here fish for a living . The fisherman catch enough to feed the people of the village and to sell some on the beach on the mainland . Others have chickens or grow fruits and vegetables and trade them in small kiosks . <p> They seem to be pretty much self sufficient . They even make their own banana wine at the local pub ( below ) . <p> The biggest building on the island is the church ( below ) and there 's also a smaller mosque . <p> Their shelters are basically a collection of shacks and grass huts . <p> I met a man from Finland , named Ari , on the trip to the island and got to know him a little since . He 's a photographer , journalist and humanitarian who 's been working in Tanzania on and off for the last 20 years and has a lot of stories to tell . He initiates small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding for them . One of the projects he 's interested in right now is helping the people of the island improve their fishing practice . He wants to help them learn better fishing techniques and to open up a fish store in Bukoba . He 's teamed up with Raymond and Bart to make the project an extension of BUDAP . Another thing that I 'd like to see come of the project is the kids here starting to get an education . Right now they do n't attend school , so their futures are pretty much limited to the way of life they learn on the island . Being so close to shore , it would n't be hard to get teachers out there on a daily basis . I hope to be able to visit the island occasionally and get to know the people a bit . Maybe there will be some way I can contribute to the fisheries project and I 'm going 
##1331652 <h> Login <p> The financial crisis that originated in the United States a year ago has become a global financial crisis unprecedented since the Great Depression . Since mid-September financial markets have collapsed and the world is entering into possibly the worst recession of the post-Second World War period . The credit freeze has severely hit developing countries through increasing risk premia and a severe cut in financing , even of short-term commercial lending .

From the beginning in his life , Jesus dedicated himself for health and salvation of the people . It was a central theme of his ministry . At the moment when Jesus healed people , the being of God , his concern and friendship were visible in Jesus . Healing was a sign that expressed that with the coming of Jesus people could live in the area that is under God 's effective work .

##1336750 <h> Sighting of Kilimanjaro . <p> It was 13 years before Rebman ? s sighting of Kilimanjaro in 1848 was confirmed by the German Officer Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken and the young British geologist Richard Thornton . Von de Decken climbed to about 14,000 feet and experienced a fall of snow . Thornton made many observations of the mountain and estimated accurately that it stood about 20,000 feet above sea level . Six years later the missionary Charles New managed to reach the snowline . Then in 1884 the naturalist Henry Hamilton Johnston made an intensive study of the flora and fauna . <h> The Old Man of Mt . Kilimanjaro <p> The Honeyguide Newsletter <p> The words ' Mt . Kilimanjaro ' conjure up romantic images of personal growth , challenge , defeat , and success . We have seen pictures and heard stories . The climbers of the first Mt . Kilimanjaro climb in 1889 had only their courage , passion and naivet ? pushing them on . When asked , ' Who was the first to climb Mt . Kilimanjaro ? ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans Meyer is credited with the vision behind the expedition , but who was his guide ? <p> Yohani Kinyala Lauwo was only eighteen years old when he led Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller to the highest point of Africa on October 5th , 1889 . His selection by the Mangi ( Chagga chief ) to be Hans Meyer ' s guide was accidental , but it forever changed his life . Kinyala ( as he was called ) was born and lived his entire life in the village of Marangu , nestled on the slopes of Mt . Kilimanjaro . Before Europeans came to East Africa , many of the Lauwo clan of the Chagga tribe hunted the forest elephants for ivory and sold it to the Swahili traders from the coast . The forest also supplied them with honey , timber , medicine and Colobus monkey hides . By the time Hans Meyer arrived in Chaggaland , Kinyala Lauwo was a tall teenager who knew the forest like the back of his hand . By then , colonialism had started in Kinyala 's homeland and young men were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' draft ' , but was caught . As a result , he was summoned for trial at Mangi Marealli 's palace . Coincidentally , Hans Meyer had just arrived at the palace asking for permission to climb the mountain and guides and porters . The Mangi 's wachili ( advisors ) spotted Kinyala , knew that he was of the Lauwo clan , and asked him to guide the expedition . <p> The event led Kinyala ( later called Mzee Lauwo ) to guide Mt . Kilimanjaro climbs for more than seventy years ! For his first climb , he was only wrapped in blankets . Over the years , he obtained appropriate clothing and hiking gear . When Mzee Lauwo turned one-hundred years old , the Tanzania National Parks gave him a beautiful , modern style house painted in light purple and pink pastels . Here he lived with his two wives until his death on May 10th , 1996 , after a grand life of a one-hundred twenty-five years ! <h> This first conquest of Kibo <p> In the following years several Missionaries and sportsmen visited various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its flora and fauna . But not until 1887 was any serious attempt made to reach the top . In this year Count Teleki climbed to a height of 15,800 feet , and in August of the same year Dr. Hans Meyer , following the route taken by Count Teleki , attained the altitude of 18,000 feet . Here he came on an unscalable glacier wall , and was compelled to turn back . Renewing his attempt Meyer finally reached the summit in 1889 in company with Ludwig Purtscheller . <p> This first conquest of Kibo was the severest under-taking that has been , or is likely to be , required of anyone ascending the mountain . Meyer had then not discovered the notch in the ice wall of the crater rim , which by reason of the diminishing ice makes the ascent easier year by year . His ascent was therefore made over the Ratzel glacier which could only be scaled with ice axes . Every step required some twenty strokes of the axe , and the labour entailed for this purpose at such an altitude and whilst climbing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to this Meyer and his companion were in imminent danger , especially as Meyer himself had no climbing irons , and any step must inevitably have buried them down into the 3,000 feet abyss which yawns below the Western side of the glacier . A former traveller , Ehlers , who had alleged that he reached the North-western summit , reported that there was no trace of a crater . Meyer may have doubted this statement , but there could be no certainty on the point until he topped the rim and suddenly saw before him the huge crater with its frozen floor 600 feet below . It must have been a thrilling moment , and the consciousness that he and his companion stood there , the first men to behold this wonder and to reveal the secret Kilimanjaro had kept concealed through ages , must have been an inspiring thought . <h> Hans Meyer family plans homage expedition <p> The German professor was the first European to scale Kilimanjaro <p> The descendant family of Professor Hans Meyer , from Leipzig Germany , the first European to scale Mount Kilimanjaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late explorer at the peak of the highest mountain in Africa . <p> The news is widely circulating around the Kilimanjaro area where tour guides , porters and Mountain climbers are looking forward to the German family expedition . No exact dates have been mentioned for the expedition . <p> The expedition news has also reached the management of the historical Kibo Hotel , in West Marangu , where Prof. Hans Meyer and his crew stayed during their Pre-historic Mountain climbing expedition , which took place on the 6th of October 1889 . Kibo Hotel is one of the oldest Hotels in the Northern Zone . <p> Julita McNeese , the current Kibo Hotel Manager , admits to have heard of the Hans Meyer ' s planned family expedition , adding that it was likely to take place very soon . She however said the entourage has n't made any reservations at the Hotel yet . <p> A large black and white portrait of Hans Meyer hangs at the Kibo Hotel lobby , together with that of Yohana Lauwo , his first guide . The Hotel with 35 rooms , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a German family in Association with the powerful charismatic Chagga leader , Chief ( Mangi ) Marealle . <p> Although huge mountains had been known to exist in Northern Tanzania , no one had actually traveled inland to account for it until the 1800 's . Mount Kilimanjaro had been thought to be the source of River Nile and a Mountain of mystery - the mystery being a snow capped Mountain in Africa . <p> Africa was by then thought to be a continent of savages , thus stories about the continent were often down played . With colonization , came European missionaries , who traveled inland to preach their religion . <p> In 1846 , Dr. Ludwig Krapf and Johann Rebmann landed at the coast of Kenya and set up a mission at Rabai , close to the town of Mombasa . In 1849 , both Krapf and Rebmann confirmed their sightings of the great Mountain on their trip inland . Reports about the Mountain were received by the Royal Geographical Society , which prompted a great debate about the accuracy , about the height and possibility of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornton attempted the first climb . The Mountain was new to him and thus had a difficult time penetrating through the second zone . Also the weather did not cooperate , which eventually forced him down . <p> In 1862 , Otto Kersten and Baron Von der Decken attempted the climb . They climbed over 15,000 feet but were forced down because of what was described to be the effect of bad weather . <p> In 1887 , a German Geologist Professor and explorer , Hans Meyer attempted the climb and was successful in reaching the Kibo peak . <p> In 1889 , Hans Meyer again , this time with an Austrian alpinist , Ludwig Purtscheller arranged an expedition to reach the summit of Kibo . It is stated that there were over 60 people in total including porters . <p> Meyer and Purtscheller were successful in their climb . They named the summit Kaiser Wilhem Spitze , a record that is still displayed in many maps found in Tanzania . The country is a former German colony . <h> The early Chagga have left their mark <p> More recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trenches which were dug between the early kingdoms are difficult to discern but remains of the forts which some chiefs constructed can still be seen at Marangu and Kibosho ( see an article H A. Fosbrooke " Chagga Forts and Boltholes , " TNR No 37 , p116 ; and also pictures facing pp. 72 and 92 in Sir Charles Dundas ' Kilimajaro and its People ) . <p> A more interesting but less apparent relic of the days of inter tribal warfare is to be found in the bolt holes or underground shelters . ( See Bishop Wynn Jones , " African Dugouts " TNR , No. 11 ; and article in No. 37 above . ) <p> In the thickly populated and cultivated area of Marangu there are some engraved rocks which are associated with the Chagga initiation ceremonies . One of these rocks , at Longoro , is a large block of lava about 9 feet long , projecting six inches above ground-level ; at its.broadest point it is 6 feet 9 inches wide . The rock is covered with long , meandering incised lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also two small kidney-shaped depressions which are clearly man-made . The rock also bears numerous pock-marks which look natural , but which , according to recent oral tradition , are man-made . <p> Chief Petro Marealle first drew attention to this engraved rock . In his book ( 1951 ) he describes how , until about 1900 , Chagga youths used to be introduced to the mysteries of manhood . As part of his ceremony twelve youths , selected from the age set under instruction , were taught the meanings of the engravings on the rock and how to incise them . This was done , on completion of the lessons , by the instructor using a small axe ' ; the length of the line cut depended on the number of youths in the age-set . The instructor also bored the pock-marks into which the youths had to spit to seal their oath not to reveal the secrets they had been taught . <p> Within twenty yards of the rock of Longoro , described here , there are two other engraved rocks ; and there is another two miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been described by Fosbrooke and Marealle in their two papers in Man , 1952 , 244 and 263 . <h> Kilimanjaro Cattle <p> The absence of any cattle here was surprising , until one day I saw some Natives going along very gingerly with a cow . The animal seemed to be blind and its hoofs were very peculiar , having grown out to a great length at the front . I found that all cattle were kept in huts on the mountain , and I remembered seeing the Natives cutting grass at the foot of the mountain and carrying it up the heights . As these shelters were quite dark inside , the cattle became blind in time . This strange practice may be perhaps accounted for by the fact that in the early days the cattle were confined to prevent them being raided by the Masai , and the custom had remained ; or it may have been a safeguard against the Tsetse Fly . <p> The rainy season had now started in earnest , and we had downpours every day . It was impossible to shift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition everybody was suffering from fever ; and , to add to our misfortunes , the donkeys were beginning to die . With no prospect of making a move , I paid off all the porters , keeping only the cook and our personal servants . The rain came down incessantly , and at times we were nearly washed out of our tents . My brother got sick of the whole thing and decided to clear out , so I sent him back to the coast . At intervals we had a few hours fine weather , and I then went out with my gun and did some shooting , and took a few photographs . This photography led to a rather unpleasant incident . Not having a dark room , I had had a hut built of wood and thatched with grass , in which I did my developing at night . While at work in it one night I put my hand down to reach a chemical bottle . Instead of the bottle my hand closed on a huge snake . There was no more developing that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly ! <p> Seeing we were likely to stay there some time , a temporary house was put up and all my belongings shifted into it . On examining the trade goods I found that nearly all the cloth had already been eaten through by white ants . It is extraordinary the amount of damage these tiny insects can do , We were obliged to go through our things every day and clean them out . In one day they would eat right through a box and destroy everything in it . The Natives put ashes down to keep them away . <h> Kilimanjaro <p> Continuing our march on the caravan route , we sighted Kilimanjaro . The grey mist which enveloped the mountain melted beneath the burning rays of the sun as they gradually crept upwards until they reached the summit of Kibo , the topmost peak , and encircled it with a halo of gold . This was the first opportunity I had of seeing the true form of the mountain , and as I gazed from its base , clothed in a green mantle of forest upward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , I stood awed and fascinated by the grandeur and beauty of the scene . Hitherto the mountain had been shrouded in gloom and presented rather a depressing appearance . <p> We were all in good spirits , for we had returned safe and sound after a most successful trip . Not one of the two hundred head of cattle had been lost on the way , and there was a prospect of netting a good round sum as profit on the expedition . But it is not wise in Africa to count your chickens before they are hatched , and my apparent good luck was soon to be turned into dire misfortune . <h> Selling Up <p> At Kilimanjaro I reported my arrival , and presented the skin of the lioness , which was returned to me with a bonus of ten rupees . This covered the cost of my hunting license , and I had two hundred head of cattle to show for my trading . Considering I had bought these at about ? I per head and they should be worth ? 6 or ? 7 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the outlook was very promising . <p> I paid a visit to my old friend Boenemisa , who gave me a very cordial greeting and was pleased to see me back . But the rosy aspect of things very quickly changed . We had only been there two days when X got into some quarrel with the men , and the old feeling against him returned . The tragedy in the bush had passed from my mind with the departure of the wounded man , and I had been so much occupied with other things on our arrival , I had neglected to report the occurrence at the Government station . It was something of a shock , therefore , when I received a peremptory summons to attend with X at the boma to give an explanation as to how this man had been shot . Of course I gave all the facts of the case : that it had been an accident , and that the man and his companions had been sent home after being given their full pay . The commandant was satisfied , and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving any day for Nairobi with my cattle , as there was no market at Kilimanjaro and better prices were current for them in British East Africa . Going down to the cattle boma one morning to see how they were getting on , I was astonished to find that seven of them had died during the night . The death roll had doubled the next day , and I at once reported the matter at the Government station . They examined the cattle and stated that they were affected with a disease which was prevalent in the country , and which we had gone so far out of our way to avoid at Mbugwe and Arusha . The officials acted very fairly towards us , and gave orders that no one should kill any meat in Kilimanjaro until my cattle were consumed . They had a butcher 's shop to supply meat for their own station and soldiers , and this was handed over to me . All the cattle that were required to supply the place with meat each day were killed there , and the money handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , but those of the cattle which did not show signs of being affected were fit for consumption , and were killed as required . But the disease spread very rapidly , and many of the cattle died every day . I was only getting about . ? 2 per head for those killed , so that my loss was very great . <p> The change from good to bad fortune and vice versa is such an every-day occurrence in Africa that I did not let it trouble me too much . I had had the same fickle luck in Africa before , so I treated the matter philosophically and quietly sat down to fill my new role of butcher . <p> After a month the disease died out , and I found myself left with five head of cattle out of the two hundred I had brought into Kilimanjaro . Practically all the money I had received from the butchering business had gone to pay the porters ' wages . I had sold some of my camp outfit and my finances were at a very low ebb . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1909 she made her way to Central Africa and , after arrival in Broken Hill ( now Kabwe in Zambia ) , walked 900 kilometres to Abercorn ( = Mbala ) near the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika .

En route she climbed some ' volcanoes in German East Africa ' . <h> Benham ? s ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro <p> Note : Benham ? s ascent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record books , but none of the histories of Kilimanjaro mention her name . That she could have completed the ascent is beyond doubt , her skill as a mountaineer exceeding that of many of her male counterparts . <p> It is generally assumed that a certain Frau ( Clara ? ) von Ruckteschell was the first woman to reach the summit in February 1914 , in the company of Lieutenant Walter von Ruckteschell ( 1882-1941 ) , the St Petersburg-born army officer and artist . <p> The first British woman to achieve this distinction , in 1927 , is recorded as the twenty-two-year-old Londoner , Sheila Macdonald . Unfortunately , when Benham first saw the report of Macdonald ' s ascent in The Times , Benham was in the West Indies and the newspaper was already several weeks old . By that time Benham could not be troubled to contradict the report , leaving it to a friend to write to The Times regarding her ascent eighteen years earlier . <p> The first British male to complete the ascent , despite numerous earlier failed attempts , appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillman possibly made his first assault on the mountain as early as 1909 , the same date as Benham , but he is better known for his successful ascent of 1921 . <h> Benham 's ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro ( 1 ) <p> From Nairobi in October 1909 , Benham took the train to Voi , and at the mission house at Dabida waited three days while collecting porters for the westward trek across the Serengeti . After two day ? s march , in intense heat and red dust , the porters drinking all their water by midday and becoming so exhausted that Benham had to walk behind to chivvy them along , they reached Boma and entered German territory . <p> From here Benham could see the two great peaks of the mountain ? Kibo , the higher at 5895 metres , glistening with snow . She stopped the night at the Moravian mission at Mamba , where she was advised to proceed to the German-occupied hill town of Moshi where she would find a guide capable of leading her up the slopes of Kilimanjaro . Climbing through dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening at Moshi , where the officer in charge of a small contingent of German soldiers confirmed that Kilimanjaro ? had never been climbed by any Britisher , man or woman , and very seldom by anyone else ? . <p> Benham started out from Moshi at 6.30 the next morning with five porters , two guides and a cook boy , hacking a path through dense forest . No precise dates are provided in the various accounts of the journey , which must have taken place October or early November 1909 . The first camp was pitched at 10,000 feet ( 3050 metres ) , just beyond the limit of the forest , and provided splendid views across the plains below . Leaving most of the luggage in a single tent , the party headed up the mountain , the porters carrying firewood and blankets , until two hours later they came across two skeletons of members of a previous expedition who had died from cold and exposure . <p> This discovery seriously unnerved the porters , who regarded it as confirmation for their belief that the mountain was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing , threatening and bribing would convince the porters to go a step further , Benham shouldered the bags herself and started out alone . This action immediately shamed the cook boy and two of the more intrepid porters into following her , the remainder electing to stay behind and guard the camp . The snow line was reached 1200 metres below the summit , and an ice cave discovered where a previous expedition had made its camp . One of the boys collected some drifting snow , intending to take it home to show his friends and family , but when the snow began to melt in the heat of the camp fire , the guides thought it bewitched and resolutely refused to go any further . <h> Benham 's ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro ( 2 ) <p> Overnight camp was established in the ice cave , then on the next day , after one of the guides had pointed out the best route to the summit , Benham pressed on alone , passing 16,000 feet ( 4880 metres ) and a short time later coming to glacier ice covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climbing alternately on rock and snow , she reached the rim of the crater at 2 pm , looking inside and taking care to step on rocks rather than snow that might be overhanging the cavity . <p> She reported : ? My first feeling up there was that of being absolutely on top of the world ? . The highest point seemed to be some distance ? to the left ? , but as there was ? not much difference in height ? , and ? since the snow slope was steep ? , she decided not to make for the higher peak but instead begin her descent . Navigating by compass through thick mist , and following the marks made by her ice axe on the way up , she managed to locate the camp in the ice cave , although only after glimpsing the bright red garments worn by the cook boy . <p> By now her men had burned all the wood they had brought up , so a chilly night was spent in the ice cave . The early morning brought a fall of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mounts Kibo and Meru , Lake Jipe to the southeast , and beyond it the Ugweno Range . The descent brought the party back to the first camp at 11 am , and on the next day Benham ? s porters arrived with food and provisions from the Moravian mission , together with a note of congratulation from the missionaries themselves . <p> Benham dismissed her porters so as to remain alone at the camp for a further four days , sketching the magnificent views before descending to Moshi . After settling her accounts and paying off the guides , Benham returned via Taveta , from where the resident German commander , recorded only as ? Captain L. ? took her on a tour to Lake Chala , a crater lake surrounded by sheer cliffs . Making her way back across the Serengeti , she arrived at Mwatate , packed her tent and such things she did not require , then walked to the railway station at Voi , from where a train brought her to Mombasa in November 1909 . <p> On 27 November she despatched a brief letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kilimanjaro , then at Mombasa boarded a cargo steamer which would take her to Madagascar and Mauritius . <h> Benham 's ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro ( 3 ) <p> Benham ? s ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro should alone have written her into the record books , but few of the histories of the mountain even mention her name . <p> Attempts to climb the mountain by all-male parties had started back in the 1860s , but it was not until 6 October 1889 that a team under the direction of Hans Meyer reached the summit of what was called ? Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze ? , now known as Kibo . <p> Climate change has rendered the mountain far more accessible to modern climbers than it was in the early 1900s , when snow lay thickly on its peaks and climbers could quite easily sacrifice their lives to the sudden blizzards that could sweep without warning across the notorious higher slopes . <p> It is generally assumed that a certain Frau ( Clara ? ) von Ruckteschell was the first woman on the mountain when , in February 1914 , she accompanied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruckteschell ( 1882-1941 ) . It appears that the Von Rukteschells failed to reach the Kibo summit . <p> The first British woman generally recognised as having achieved this distinction was the twenty-two-year-old Londoner , Sheila Macdonald ( later Mrs Sheila Combe ) , who on 31 July 1927 reached the summit of Kibo in the company of William C. West , a member of the Alpine Club . <p> The first British male to complete the ascent , despite numerous earlier failed attempts , appears to have been the celebrated geographer Clement Gillman ( 1882-1946 ) . Gillman possibly made his first assault on the mountain as early as 1909 , about the same time as Benham , but apparently did not reach the summit until 1921 . <p> Unfortunately , when Benham first saw the report of Macdonald ? s ascent in The Times , she was in the West Indies and the newspaper was already several weeks old . By that time she could hardly be troubled to contradict the report , leaving it to a friend to inform the newspaper of her ascent eighteen years earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1913 and was possibly the colonial officer Selwyn Grier , wrote to The Times under the pseudonym ? West African ? , reporting Benham ? s ascent and commenting briefly on her 1913 crossing of Africa . A somewhat belated account of Benham ? s ascent of Kilimanjaro was carried by a brief article in the Daily Mail in February 1928 . <p> However , in 1931 a certain Colonel E.L . Strutt wrote to The Times supporting Sheila Macdonald ? s claim to have been the first woman to conquer the peak , stating : ? Miss Gertrude Benham , about 1911 sic , reached the rim of the crater ? some two-three hours below the summit ? and never claimed to have gone any higher ? . In fact Strutt was perfectly justified in passing the accolade to Macdonald . <p> Benham had reached the edge of the crater now known as Mawenzi ( 5149 metres or 16,890 feet ) , which is the second highest of Kilimanjaro ? s three peaks . Rather than being , as Benham put it , ? not much difference in height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5895 metres or 19,340 feet , and nowadays involves a challenging ascent over lose open scree . Benham might have accomplished this , given another day , but modern climbers prefer to make the final assault at night or in the early morning when the scree is frozen together . <h> Kilimanjaro challenges <p> The cynical could look upon the large numbers of trekkers climbing Kili as evidence that this is a relatively easy mountain to scale . For further proof , they could also point to those for whom the challenge of climbing Kilimanjaro simply wasn ? t , well , challenging enough , and who deliberately went out of their way to make the ascent more difficult for themselves , just for the hell of it . Men such as the Brazilian who jogged right up to the summit in just 24 hours . Or the Crane brothers from England who cycled up , surviving on Mars Bars strapped to their handlebars . And the anonymous Spaniard who , in the 1970s , drove up to the summit by motorbike . Nor must we forget Douglas Adams , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in 1994 reached the summit for charity while wearing an eight-foot rubber rhinoceros costume ; and finally there ? s the ( possibly apocryphal ) story of the man who walked backwards the entire way in order to get into the Guinness Book of Records ? only to find out , on his return to the bottom , that he had been beaten by somebody who had done exactly the same thing just a few days previously . <p> And that ? s just the ascent ; for coming back down again the mountain has witnessed skiing , a method first practised by Walter Furtwangler way back in 1912 ; snowboarding , an activity pioneered on Kili by Stephen Koch in 1997 ; and even hang-gliding , for which there was something of a fad a few years ago . <p> Cyclists to skiers , heroes to half-wits , bikers to boarders to backward walkers : it ? s no wonder , given the sheer number of people who have climbed Kili over the past century , and the ways in which they ? ve done so , that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you ? d be forgiven for thinking the same . <p> You ? d be forgiven ? but you ? d also be wrong . Whilst these stories of successful expeditions tend to receive a lot of coverage , they serve to obscure the tales of suffering and tragedy that often go with them . You don ? t , for example , hear much about the hang-glider who leapt off Kili a few years ago and was never seen again . Or the fact that the Brazilian who jogged up spent the next week in hospital recovering from severe high-altitude pulmonary oedema . And for all the coverage of the Millennium celebrations , when over 7000 people stood on the slopes of Kilimanjaro during New Year ? s week ? with a 1000 on New Year ? s Eve alone ? little mention was made of the fact that three people died on Kilimanjaro in those seven days . Or that another 33 had to be rescued . Or that well over a third of all the people who took part in those festivities failed to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? inclusivity ? <p> It is this ? inclusivity ? that undoubtedly goes some way to explaining Kilimanjaro ? s popularity , a popularity that saw 20,351 foreign tourists and 674 local trekkers visit in 2000 , thereby confirming Kili ? s status as the most popular of the so-called ? Big Seven ? , the highest peaks on each of the seven continents . The sheer size of it must be another factor behind its appeal . This is the Roof of Africa , a massive massif 60km long by 80km wide with an altitude that reaches to a fraction under 6km above sea level . The renowned anthropologist , Charles Dundas , writing in 1924 claimed that he once saw Kilimanjaro from a point over 120 miles away . It is even big enough to have its own weather systems ( note the plural ) and , furthermore , to influence the climates of the countries that surround it . <p> " The aspect presented by this prodigious mountain is one of unparalleled grandeur , sublimity , majesty , and glory . It is doubtful if there be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New , the first European to reach the snow-line on Kilimanjaro , from his book Life , Wanderings , and Labours in Eastern Africa <p> But size , as they say , isn ? t everything , and by themselves these bald figures fail to fully explain the allure of Kilimanjaro . So instead we must look to attributes that can not be measured by theodolites or yardsticks if we are to understand the appeal of Kilimanjaro . <h> The Swiss airman Mittelholzer <p> I depart from Mkomazi and head West towards the tiny town of Moshi . I fly right up to the mountain , but I ca n't see it . She is like a shy lady with her clouds wrapped around her . I land at the deserted little airstrip near her base and push the plane off into the grass . I pull out my chair and sit alone beneath the wing . In the late afternoon light , the mountain begins to take off her clothes . The clouds disappear , and I look upon one of the loveliest sights in Africa - the white crested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and photographed this mountain in 1930 . I think the difference in elevation from Moshi at 2,800 feet to the summit at 19,340 feet must make this one of the highest free-standing mountains in the world . It is beautiful to look at . In the hazy air around it 's base , you can almost forget that it is a mountain . Instead , you look only above the haze and see a shining white dome high in the sky . It could be mistaken for a cloud it is so far off and aloof . The Wachagga have a story about this mountain . They say that the two peaks Mawenzi and Kibo are brothers . Kibo is the bigger , but younger brother . One day , while smoking their pipes , Mawenzi 's fire went out . He asked his brother , Kibo , if he could borrow some fire . He then fell asleep , and his fire went out again . Kibo became angry with him and beat him so badly that even today , one can see his battered and torn face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers himself with clouds . It is rare to see Mawenzi without clouds . <h> Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain <p> Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high , and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa . Its western summit is called the Masai ' Ngaje Ngai ' , the House of God . Close to the western summit there is a dried and frozen carcas of a leopard . No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude . <h> And then instead of going on to Arusha they turned . . . <p> And then instead of going on to Arusha they turned left , he evidently figured that they had the gas , and looking down he saw a pink sifting cloud , moving over the ground , and in the air , like the first snow in a blizzard , that comes from nowhere , and he knew the locusts were coming from the South . Then they began to climb and they were going to the East it seemed , and then it darkened and they were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a waterfall , and they were out and Compie turned his head and grinned and pointed and there , ahead , all he could see , as wide as all the world , great , high , and unbelievably white in the sun , was the top of Kilimanjaro . And then he knew that that was where he was going . <h> Kilimanjaro Road <p> Five miles of road cover 2,500 vertical feet to the lower forest limit . This road was built by the Chagga tribe , to the facilitate the marketing of their coffee . They did the whole thing unaided , estimating the gradients entirely by eye . The result is an excellent motor road . <h> First ascent of Heim Glacier <p> My father ( Anton Nelson , right ) as president of the Kilimanjaro Mountain Club , with John Cooke ( left ) and Dave Goodall , of Kenya , with porters , on historic traverse of Kilimanjaro and first ascent of the Heim Glacier - note the ice axe . <h> Ascent of Kilimanjaro and Heim Glacier <p> My plans for Kilimanjaro had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole massif had been reached by mountaineers , geologists and surveyors , and the main summit of Kibo had been reached by thousands of people by the normal trade route of ascent from Marangu , which poses no technical problems . However , I could find no record of a complete , continuous traverse of the whole mountain , taking in all the main peaks of Shira , Kibo and Mawenzi . This I planned to do . A second aim was to attempt a first ascent of one of the unclimbed glaciers on the south face of Kibo . The west and south faces of Kibo are separated by a massive breach in the crater rim and wall , whichis very spectacular . The glaciers to the north-west of the breach , namely the Penck and the Credner , offer no great problems , and had been climbed . Those to the east , the Kersten and the Heim are formidable ice-walls and had not been climbed . I proposed to tackle the Heim as a route to the summit area of Kibo as part of the traverse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it was to prove . <p> The first problem to be overcome was finding companions for the venture . They would have to be experienced and competent mountaineers , for the Heim would be no place for tyros . By enormous good fortune two excellent men turned up . They were Ax Nelson and David Goodall . In background , character and temperament they were totally different . Ax was an American who was at that time working as an adviser with the Meru Cooperative Union based in Arusha . He was a man of deep religious convictions with a driving urge in life to champion the cause of those he considered to be downtrodden and exploited . He had got involved with the Meru land case when he met Kirilo Japhet , the Meru spokesman in New York at the United Nations . The Wameru were petitioning against the Tanganyika government 's alienation of a part of their land to European farmers . Ax espoused the Meru cause and came out to Tanganyika to work with them , ending up as an adviser to their co-operative which organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book about his experiences , entitled The Freemen of Meru , published by Oxford in 1967 . He had considerable climbing experience , and amongst other things had been actively involved in the early ascents of the immense vertical rock faces in the Yosemite region of the Sierra Nevadas in the western United States . Ax was a great talker and very articulate , so that by the end of our expedition David and I knew just about everything about him and his philosophy of life . David Goodall was British , northcountry like myself . Although we lived in very close contact for two exacting weeks on the mountain , where we were totally interdependent ( in fact , he saved my life ) , he remains an enigma . He was working as an agricultural officer in Kenya , and before that had done his National Service in the Parachute Regiment . He was very tough , totally dependable , and excellent company , but he exemplified the Yorkshireman 's motto " Hear all , see all , say nowt . " <h> We got together and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Late September was agreed on as the time and we all obtained leave from our work . We had all the necessary equipment except ice pitons , long narrow steel spikes to drive into hard ice as safe anchor points when climbing . These we ordered from the UK . I had a small Black 's mountain tent big enough for two men , but as weight was going to be a critical factor , we decided to make do with it . Since we were going to be on the mountain for two weeks all our food would have to be carried , so that it would have to be carefully chosen and finely calculated . Tins were out of the question . Our basic bulk food were porridge oats with dried milk and sugar , plus hard biscuits . For protein and fat we took bacon and biltong , and instant coffee was our beverage . In the absence of fresh fruit and vegetables we took Vitamin C tablets , and for quick energy dried fruit and glucose tablets . We calculated precise amounts of everything , weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sylvia made up for us . My old well-tried Primus stove and a supply of paraffin provided for our cooking . Even with food and equipment pared to a minimum we were still going to have very heavy loads to carry , with tent and sleeping bags , ice axes , crampons , pitons and hammers , slings and clips , rope , minimal spare clothing , food and fuel for two weeks . We decided there was no point in lugging this lot unaided through the forest , and so I asked the Mangi of Machame from where we planned to start , if he could find us a few porters to help us carry our gear up onto the Shira Plateau . This he very kindly did for us . <p> The route we planned would go from west to east . We would ascend to the Shira plateau first , and climb all the Shira peaks . The 12,000 feet altitude ( about 4000 m ) would enable us toacclimatise quickly before tackling the major problem of the Heim Glacier . The route onto the Shira from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-consuming . A start from Machame would yield a more direct route , and we trusted to the porters knowing a way through the forest . Once on the Shira the porters would leave us and go back down , leaving us with a weighty transport problem . We would tick off all the peaks there , namely the Shira ridge , Shira dome , and the Platzkegel . The Heim was our great unknown , and we did not know the nature of the problems we would encounter . Ax had persuaded someone with a small plane to fly him past the glaciers and ice-walls , and he managed to get a good photograph of the Heim from fairly close quarters , which was to prove of great assistance to us . Once up the Heim , assuming we succeeded there , we would go over the summit of Kibo , and then down to the saddle between Kibo and Mawenzi . From a last camp below the latter we would make our last ascent ? of Mawenzi , and then get down to Marangu . <h> We eventually left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th September with five porters who knew the forest trails . We felt light-hearted and unburdened . We were glad of the latter for our route made no concessions and went up very steeply , following a ridge between two deeply entrenched river valleys . The forest was very beautiful , and since we had guides , we could relax and appreciate our surroundings , without having to concentrate on route-finding , and hacking our way forward . In the forest in 1953 I had been too concerned with route finding to bother much about aesthetics , while in the Ruwenzori forests , the overpowering wetness and mud could only offer pleasure to a sheer masochist . There is much wildlife in the Kilimanjaro forests , but one hears more than one sees . On our first night out we slept in the forest , always an intriguing experience with all sorts of strange noises , rustlings , scuffles , thuds , grunts , whistles and the odd trumpeting of a distant elephant . We were charmed by the very beautiful black and white , long haired colobus monkeys , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity as to who and what we were . Late on our second day out we were surprised and pleased to emerge from the forest , and to see before us the final slopes leading up onto the plateau . This was the point where the porters were to leave us , but very sadly our parting was less than amicable . <p> When I came to pay the porters , they claimed we had pushed them too hard so that they had done in two days what they would normally consider three days ' work . In consequence of this they wanted three days ' pay . I pointed out that there were flaws in their argument , because Europeans did not come this way , and therefore they had no precedent on which to base their claim . I had no strong feelings however , and was prepared to come to some compromise or even to pay them what they wanted . A haggle was normal procedure and we settled down to it . However , Ax who spoke but little Swahili , asked what was going on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its formidable head . " Like hell , " said Ax , " tell them they get two days ' pay for two days ' work , period . " I had to communicate this dour message to the men , and it immediately put their backs up . Haggling does not involve or welcome bald statements or firm positions . I was caught in a fix . I sympathised with the men , but I did not want to antagonise my friend with whom I was to spend the next two weeks in very close contact . The porters would not give an inch and eventually went down empty-handed . Some weeks later however , I was able to arrange payment for them . I found this little contretemps rather ironic ? the radical American being less accommodating than the imperialist Briton . <h> From this point we took it fairly easily for a day <p> From this point we took it fairly easily for a day , carrying our loads to a point high on the eastern side of the plateau , where we camped . We were acclimatising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit of the Shira , climbing all the peaks . We were not carrying any loads , but it was a long , exhausting day , though very exhilarating . From our camp in the evening we had a fantastic view out over an immense sea of clouds , through which in the distance Mount Meru thrust its sharp summit like an island in a vast ocean . Behind us reared the imposing rock and ice slopes of this side of Kibo , which slowly turned from gold to deep red , and finally a forbidding grey as the sun went down . We shivered and crawled into our cramped tent . <p> Our next objective was to get to the foot of the Heim Glacier . This involved a long upward traverse over masses of broken rock and scree , followed by a descent into and climb out of the barranco , or deeply glaciated trough , which runs out below the Great Breach Wall . This was another long hard day , but we were now fully acclimatised , in good fettle , and moving well . We reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of our expedition . About 3,000 feet ( 1,000 m ) of steep ice reared upwards and curved out of sight far above us . It looked forbidding . The whizz and hum of flying ice and rock debris from above quickly drove us against the ice front below a protecting rock-wall , where we bivouacked . I felt butterflies in my stomach as one always does before a challenging venture . <p> Next morning we were up and off before dawn . We knew where we had to go . From Ax 's photograph we had seen that the major defences of the Heim were two lines of ice cliffs about a third of the way up , and come what may , we had to find a way through these . We moved up steadily , and soon noticed without much enthusiasm , that there was no snow on the ice . We were on bare , hard ice , and very soon we had to don our crampons ( steel spikes which are strapped to the sole of one 's boots ) , and rope up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left across a very steep slope , aiming for the top of a small projecting rock buttress which split the wall . Here catastrophe almost overtook us . David was leading , cutting steps in the ice as he went . I was in the middle , with Ax bringing up the rear . We moved singly , of course . David had reached the rock buttress and was well belayed , or anchored to the rock with the rope . I was moving towards him when I caught a crampon spike in my sock and pitched forward and down . I was brought up sharply by a taut rope , and found myself dangling half upside down , with a fine vertiginous view downwards . A cool , steady , and very reassuring voice came from above , " Do n't worry lad , I 've got you . " David had whipped in my rope and held me before the other rope had tightened up on Ax who was still very precariously perched on the wall . At the same time Ax had sensibly let go his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of perfect co-ordination that only experience can produce . I sorted myself out and climbed up to David . Very unfortunately I had lost my ice-axe , and felt very rattled , feeling I had let the others down badly . There were no recriminations , however . We climbed to the top of the buttress and held a council of war . A formidable ice climb towered above us , and we now had only two axes between the three of us . But we did have a good supply of ice-pitons , and decided to go on . This was perhaps a foolhardy decision , but since in the event we succeeded , it was the right one . <p> That night we bivouacked on the top of the buttress which was just big enough to take our tent once we had built up a platform with lumps of ice and rock . It was a cramped and uncomfortable spot , but we seemed to be out of the main trajectory of the flying debris of late afternoon . For the most part it whizzed harmlessly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we faced another crisis <p> The following day we faced another crisis . David was snow-blind through not wearing his dark glasses . He could not go out , so Ax and I reconnoitred the route ahead . We found a good line on steep but sound ice , to the top of another buttress which was slightly more commodious than the first . We then climbed down back to the tent , to find that in our absence a flying piece of ice had ripped a hole in the tent wall . After a second night on our cramped site , we followed the route we had worked out on the previous day . David ' s eyes were much better but we could only move slowly . With only two axes we had to adopt a special mode of progress . Whoever was leading went ahead . After about thirty feet he drove in a piton and belayed to it . He then tied his axe to the rope and lowered it to the second man , who then ascended to join number one . The third man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sequence was then repeated . We handled the axe with the utmost care , for we knew that if we lost it we would really be in trouble . To have attempted to move more quickly would have been sheer lunacy . <p> The next ice-wall looked impressive as we studied it in clear weather in the late afternoon from our second camp . We worked out what appeared to be a feasible route . Next morning , however , we were enveloped in thick mist . We moved off nevertheless , climbing steeply and hoping we would not meet any impossible obstacle . Halfway up the wall we landed in a very beautiful ice-cave where we could rest . Further progress seemed problematic , as the roof of the cave overhung , and the walls to left and right were vertical . Ax solved this problem in splendid fashion . Leaving his heavy pack in the cave , he hacked out steps to the left and upwards , and climbed out of sight over an ice bulge . His rope inched out and fragments of ice flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated down to us . The slope had eased off and he had been able to drive in a piton and belay to it . He hauled up his pack and we followed . We still could not see anything , but we presumed we had mastered the wall . We just went on climbing upwards , pitch after wearisome pitch . As the day drew to a close we were literally nowhere , or so it seemed , on a vast ice-slope in poor visibility . All we could do was to go on climbing in the hope of reaching some place suitable for a bivouac , before nightfall . It was with some relief that we found a place of sorts . The slope began to ease off slightly , and on its convex bend a lurking crevasse appeared . We hacked at the lower lip to form a narrow platform just big enough to take the tent . We could only guy it fore and aft , and hammered in pitons with safety lines to ourselves , and crept into the tent . The two outer men hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void of the open slope , on the other the dark unknown depths of the crevasse . We fervently hoped that the stitching of canvas wall to groundsheet was sound . A wind got up , and we could not risk lighting the primus as the tent was flapping wildly . We went hungry and drinkless . Sucking ice did n't help much , and with dry mouths we could not eat dry biscuit . We consoled ourselves with the thought that if we had been forced to spend the night out on the ice , that wind in sub-zero temperatures would have been very trying . <h> Next morning our troubles lifted miraculously <p> Next morning our troubles lifted miraculously . It was a brilliantly clear morning , the slope eased off , and there was firm snow on the ice at last . We could move together . We were on a vast slope which curved out of sight below us whence we had come . In the clear air we had a breathtaking view directly out over the immense plains of northern Tanganyika . These huge isolated East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper slopes there are no rivals to encumber and clutter the free surrounding space . We felt that we were literally on the roof of the world , and as success seemed within our grasp we felt a tremendous sense of elation . More mundane matters were also on our minds , or rather our stomachs , and we halted at the first convenient place , a lonely rock outcrop , and cooked a big feast of bacon , and pints of hot coffee . Life was good ! We finally camped that night amongst broken seracs or ice pinnacles at the top of the Heim , and next morning we moved easily up to the highest point of the mountain , Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze or Uhuru Peak as it is now called , at 19,340 feet ( just under 6,000 m ) . We felt the whole of Africa was spread out at our feet , rolling away into infinite distance . <p> Reluctantly we continued our trek , and shot down the abominable screen of the tourist route of ascent , to reach the Kibo hut . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food sent up with a porter , and left at the hut to await our arrival . This we found and eagerly broached . There were tins of meat and vegetables , fruit and chocolate , which we quickly organised into a minor feast . After eleven days on hard tack and using vast amounts of energy we were ravenous . At the hut were four Young British army officers on leave from Kenya . Being young and enormously enthusiastic they had come up too quickly and were suffering badly from mountain sickness . They turned two shades greener as they watched us wolfing our food . We felt sorry for them , but some time later we were equally sorry for ourselves , as gluttony took its toll . Our innards rebelled against the untoward loads we had suddenly plied them with . Nonetheless we crossed the saddle , and made our last camp below Mawenzi more or less recovered from our excesses . <p> After our success on the Heim , tension eased off a little , and we felt a sense of anti-climax . Our muscles began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required a stern mental effort , and we had to really drive ourselves up to the summit and back to our camp . A final sense of achievement was our reward . <h> All that remained was to get down off the mountain <p> All that remained was to get down off the mountain . I had told Sylvia the probable day of our descent , but the Heim had delayed us a little . Imagine our great joy , when after jogging down for hour after weary hour , our legs like lead and our minds in neutral , we came round a bend and saw my landrover standing waiting with Sylvia sitting in it . She had driven up the appalling track as far as she dared , and had waited all day , just hoping we would appear . She earned our undying gratitude . That night we got cleaned up , had a wonderful meal , and slept like babies . Next day we went our separate ways .

Ethiopian Mount Olympus ? still fresh in my memory , I feel how inadequate are my powers of description to do justice to the grand and imposing aspects of Nature with which I shall have to deal . " <p> Hans Meyer , the first man to climb Kilimanjaro , in his book Across East African Glaciers ? an Account of the First Ascent of Kilimanjaro . <p> Nor is it just tourists that are entranced by Kilimanjaro ; the mountain looms large in the Tanzanian psyche too . Look at their supermarket shelves . The nation ? s second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kibo Gold , is named after the higher of Kilimanjaro ? s two summits . Even the nation ? s best selling lager , Safari , has something distinctly white and pointy looming in the background of its label . Nor can teetotallers entirely escape Kili ? s presence . There ? s Kilimanjaro coffee ( grown on the mountain ? s fertile southern slopes ) and Kilimanjaro mineral water ( bottled on its western side ) . On billboards lining the country ? s highways Tanzanian models smoke their cigarettes in its shadow , while cheerful roly-poly housewives compare the whiteness of their laundry with the mountain ? s glistening snows . And to pay for all of these things you can use a Tanzanian Ts5000 note ? which just happens to have , on the back of it , a herd of giraffe lolloping along in front of the distinctive silhouette of Africa ? s highest mountain . <p> It is perhaps no surprise to find , therefore , that when Tanganyika won its independence from Britain in 1961 , one of the first things they did was plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first president , Julius Nyerere , hoped would ? ? shine beyond our borders , giving hope where there was despair , love where there was hate , and dignity where before there was only humiliation. ? <p> To the Tanzanians , Kilimanjaro is clearly much more than just a very large mountain separating them from Kenya . It ? s a symbol of their freedom , and a potent emblem of their country . <p> And given the tribulations and hardships willingly suffered by thousands of trekkers on Kili each year ? not to mention the money they spend for the privilege of doing so ? the mountain obviously arouses some pretty strong emotions in non-Tanzanians as well . Whatever the emotions provoked in you by this wonderful mountain , and however you plan to climb it , we wish you well . Because even if you choose to leave the bicycle at home , forego the pleasures of wearing a latex rhino outfit and walk in the direction that nature intended you to , climbing up Kilimanjaro will still be one of the hardest things you ever do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly supplied by the French Embassy , Dar es Salaam . ) <p> On 11th March , 1962 , three French parachutists , Jean-Claude Dubois , Bernard Couture , and Jean-Claude Camus , all aged 25 , beat the record for the highest parachute drop by landing in the crater of Kilimanjaro , less than 50 yards from the Dropping Zone . Although their attempt was delayed by technical difficulties ( finding a plane capable of flying high enough , waiting for the ground rescue team , etc. ) the dump itself went without incident . B. Couture and J. C. Camus , who are both medical doctors , studied the repercussions on the human organism of the abrupt change in altitude . Having landed in the crater about midday , the three parachutists immediately began the descent and arrived at Marangu Hotel at one o'clock in the morning . <h> Contents Page <h> Momella <p> On certain rare mornings at Momella , Mt .

Kilima Njaro , the White Mountain , has ascended into the sky , a place of religious resonance for tribes all around its horizons . <p> The glaciers glisten . A distant snow peak scours the mind , but a snow peak in the tropics draws the heart to a fine shimmering painful point of joy . <h> Balloon Safari over Kilimanjaro <p> Looming above the business enterprise was an even greater challenge . Kilimanjaro , at 19,340 feet , was the highest point in Africa ; ergo , ballooning over the peak would represent the highest physical achievement in Africa , the ultimate seduction . Most people could have tossed aside this challenge but Alan presumably was taunted every time he saw the silver dome floating above late-afternoon clouds . By now he was a living reminder of other such dares . The index finger on his right hand was missing because of an indiscretion with a puff adder . A portion of his right buttock had been deeded to a leopard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right knee was missing because he had once tried to set a Kenya record for motorcycle jumps . Now whenever he entered the Nairobi Hospital he was greeted as an old friend . <p> None of Alan ' s friends was terribly surprised to hear that he was preparing to be the first to balloon over the top of Kilimanjaro . Now that the wildebeest film was finished Alan had given himself four months before his next production . He gathered together some friends who were eager to serve as the ground crew and readied his balloon , Lengai , for the assault . From the lower slopes of the mountain , Alan calculated he would have to head away from the peak because of the winds , and then at about 24,000 feet , hope to catch an alternating wind that would carry him over the top . There the winds would be treacherous and the air nearly one-quarter its density at sea level . <p> The " shakedown " was spent test-flying the equipment , purchasing special gear and dickering with the meteorological service . One day the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in speculating whether or not the madman would make it . In a society that warmly takes heart from others ' misfortunes and rarely admits to heroes . Alan ' s apparent death wish had captured the imagination . <p> On the morning of March 25 , 1976 , the ground crew inflated the balloon on a farm to the west of the mountain . The clouds were down to the ground and nobody was laughing . Until the last moment there had been a question whether or not Joan could accompany Alan . It was generally agreed because of the load factor only one passenger could make the ascent . Joan had not said a word but it was clear that she would gladly have amputated an arm to meet the required weight . By now Alan was inside the basket firing the burner . He looked out at her . " You ready ? " he asked , seconds before the balloon lifted off . <p> For the first half-hour of the flight Alan and Joan flew through dense cloud , never certain where they were bound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew out and for a frightening second Alan fumbled with matches to relight it . <p> Alan has coined an expression , " The Root Effect , " to describe the illusion of the sides of the basket lowering , the higher the balloon climbs . At five thousand feet the basket 's walls are at waist level , but at twenty thousand feet they seem little higher than one 's ankles . Now as the balloon drifted over the top of Mawenzi Joan was behaving strangely . For a second Alan considered " The Root Effect . " She was uncharacteristically snappy and clumsy . " What 's the matter ? " Alan asked . " Nothing , " she shouted back . Suddenly he noticed the tube from her oxygen supply had gotten fouled . As fast as he could he reconnected it and soon she was her placid self . <p> Borne by a friendly monsoon , and with hardly a ripple , the basket sailed across the roof of Africa , its two occupants Phineas Foggs of a new sort . The altimeter registered 24,000 feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers and the remains of last season 's snows lay in pockets along the rims . Alan looked for climbers , but at nine on a March morning the mountain was deserted . The mountain and the sky made the balloon seem very small . When he and Joan had successfully flown over Kilimanjaro , they were forced to make a landing in then hostile Tanzania . Minutes after their moment of triumph , both Roots were arrested as " astronaut spies . " <p> Of all Alan ' s films , the one-hour special about his balloon exploits seems the most flawed , possibly because he was dealing with humans ( particularly himself ) instead of animals . The humor that abounds in his life seemed out of context in the film , and at times the commentary runs to unmitigated conceit : " Flying a balloon takes a bit of getting used to - but Alan Root is one of those naturally well-coordinated people who gets the hang of this sort of thing very quickly . . . . " On television ? Balloon Safari ? seemed an uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lake Naivasha it is colorful and very funny . It seems to be an indulgence , an amusement for his friends .

The photograph above was taken in November 1990 by the Space Shuttle mission STS-38 crew ( STS038-91-78 ) . <p> By 2001 , the glaciers had receded alarmingly , as shown by another photograph of Kilimanjaro taken by the crew of Space Shuttle mission STS-97 on December 2 , 2000 <p> Mountain glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change , and those at tropical latitudes are particularly responsive . Mid-latitude and tropical glaciers have significantly decreased in area and volume over century .

According to some projections , if recession continues at the present rate , the majority of the glaciers on Kilimanjaro could vanish in the next 15 years . <h> Johannes Kinyala Lauwo <p> Kinyala Lauwo ( 1871-1996 ) was my inlaw and I interviewed him on video in 1993 . <p> He said he climbed Kilimanjaro many times before he guided Hans Meyer . He said he had ascended nine times before he realised there was an inner crater . He also found the dead leopard but when I told him of Hemingway 's book about it , he said he 'd never heard of it . <p> The West German government built the house in 1989 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Meyer ' s ascent . <p> 2008 08 16 <p> Here is Kinyala Lauwo ' s family tree : <p> Lauwo <p> Kimonge <p> Aisere ( brother was Kimemia ) <p> Mramba <p> Mwiwere <p> Rawia ( brother was Mkawo ) <p> Kinyala <p> Kimemia 's descendants were <p> Kiwere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paolo <p> Many children including Yakobo , my wife 's father . <p> I have n't yet found the name of any of Kinyala 's siblings .

I have a more detailed family tree somewhere but have n't managed to find it . <h> Kilimanjaro International Airport <p> I take off and fly along the slopes of Kilimanjaro before the clouds appear . Beneath me is the mine where all the Tanzanite comes from . If I ever find a wife , I will design her a ring with Tanzanite . I do n't think there is a more beautiful stone in the world . It is sometimes referred to as a ' blue diamond ' and the liquid blue stone reflects three different colors - purple , blue , and gray - as the light passes through it . It is much brighter than a sapphire , and it is only found here . <p> I descend low and follow the lush green forests past Kilimanjaro International Airport . This is one of the places where they could get me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me to Kilimanjaro to pick up his plane some years ago . He handed me a fist-full of $100 bills and said in his normal understated way , ' Here , you may need these . ' I was deposited at Kilimanjaro Airport and walked over to collect his recently repaired Cessna 180 . The men in the office laughed at me . It appeared , I was about $400 short of what was owed . I spent a very long night inside of the plane being eaten by large mosquitoes . When that became too unbearable , I crawled out and lay on the tarmac beneath the plane . Then large rhinoceros shaped beetles would hit me full force in the face as they tried to fly in ground effect towards the bright lights illuminating the apron . The next morning , I was a wreck . It was time for my captors and me to make a deal . I suggested that if we reduced the number of days that the plane had been parked here on the receipt , there would be several hundred dollars left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal like this can raise some interest in a land where $2 a day is a good salary . I was soon on my way . <h> the 8th Wonder of the World <p> Ahead of me now is what some people consider to be the 8th Wonder of the World - the Ngorongoro Crater . The volcanic crater is a perfectly shaped bowl 19 kilometers across and it is teeming with wildlife . This crater used to be a mountain even higher than Kilimanjaro . When it erupted , it distributed its porphyritic ash far to the West . This is now the Serengeti - a treeless sea of grass with the largest ungulate ( hoofed animal ) migration on earth . I juggle my film cameras and follow the crater 's rim around as my little plane struggles in the thin air . The crater is too big to fit into my lens . There seems to be no way to capture such a vast and enveloping place . I turn on my video camera mounted on the wing and start to dance along the edge . I play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the sudden chilling emptiness as we spring from the edge and seem suspended above the crater floor . I am loving this moment , and for a while , I can imagine no better way to appreciate the grandness nor beauty of such a place . <h> Tanzania To Celebrate Millennium Atop Mount Kilimanjaro <p> About 1,000 tourists plan to usher in their Millennium atop Mount Kilimanjaro , the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism has confirmed . <p> Zakia Meghji said Monday the event will fetch the country some 1.5 million US Dollars ( about 1.2 billion Tsh ) in foreign currency . <p> Ten locals are also expected to go up the mountain during the ' Mount Kilimanjaro Top 2000 Expedition ' . <p> The first batch of mountain climbers is to be flagged off next Monday and they will be awarded certificates as they descend 2 January , 2000 .

Its western summit is called the Masai ' Ngaje Ngai ' , the House of God . Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard . No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude . <p> This is the riddle that Ernest Hemingway poses at the start of his strangely prophetic and almost autobiographical story , The Snows of Kilimanjaro . <p> Hemingway was the first great American literary celebrity of the 20th century . By the time of his death in 1961 he was a legend . The white-bearded visage of " Papa " could be recognised all over the world . Countless magazine articles chronicled the adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet there is relatively little discussion of Hemingway ' s love of Africa ? a continent that was an obsession for him all his life . As a boy , he longed to follow in the footsteps of his childhood hero , Theodore Roosevelt , who made a famous safari expedition in Tanganyika now Tanzania in 1910 . On frequent trips to Chicago 's Field Museum of Natural History , young Ernest was entranced by the stuffed elephants brought back from expeditions in Africa by the hunter and photographer Carl Akeley , a man said to have killed a wounded leopard with his bare hands . <h> White peak on Kilimanjaro to disappear <p> The beautiful ice fields on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in East Africa could completely melt away in the next 20 years if the Earth continues to warm at the rate many scientists now claim . <p> The calculation comes from Professor Lonnie Thompson , of Ohio State University , who has made an aerial survey of the famous Tanzanian peak . <p> He said comparisons with previous mapping showed 33% of Mt Kilimanjaro ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone since 1912 .

Twenty thousand tourists go there every year because one of the attractions is to see ice at three degrees south of the equator . But I think there is a real possibility that that ice will be gone by 2015 .

Moreover , the melting of these smaller ice caps and glaciers leads to sea level rise .

Indeed , the filmmaker said in a recent interview with a US television network that he intended to make Kilimanjaro seem far less forbidding than the highest Himalayan peak . <p> " I wanted to make a film that appealed to a much broader audience , a film that when people saw it , they could actually leave the theatre and say , ' Yes , I can go climb Kilimanjaro . ' " <p> The diversity of the climbing crew featured in the film reinforces the impression that ordinary mortals are capable of reaching Africa 's zenith . Among those in the trekking team are a 64-year-old writer , a 12-year-old Boston schoolgirl , and a 13-year-old boy from Arusha , Hansi Mmari , who had never before seen snow , let alone climbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyungai , 50 , who has reached the top of Kilimanjaro more than 250 times . <p> Although conditions on Kilimanjaro may not be nearly as harsh as those on Everest ( which is 10,000 feet higher ) , Breashears says he actually found it harder to film on Kili , owing to the sharp contrasts in its ecosystems . As the movie explains , climbers must pass through five different climate zones as they ascend Kilimanjaro , beginning in a tropical rainforest and ending in an Arctic environment at a height of 5,896 metres . <p> The images Breashears recorded along the way are unforgettable . " Sublimely photographed , it 's almost a religious experience , " wrote a reviewer for The Dallas Morning News . <p> Kilimanjaro : To the Roof of Africa premiered last week in Texas at the Houston Science Museum and will be shown at several Imax theatres around the United States and Canada in the coming months . <p> In addition to inspiring viewers , perhaps even enticing some to visit Tanzania , the film may raise awareness regarding the looming loss of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the mountain 's glacier has melted since it was first mapped in 1912 . If the current pace of warming continues , it is feared that Kili 's summit will be snowless by 2020 . <p> Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in Northern Tanzania on the border with Kenya . It has two summits . Kibo , which measures 5,896 metres high at Uhuru Peak , is the highest point . Kibo 's top is always covered by snow and ice even though it is near the Equator . The other summit , Mawenzi , stands 5,148 metres high and has no snow or ice . <p> However , according to a German-Tanzania expedition that scaled the Kibo summit in 1999 , the mountain is four metres lower than previously calculated . <p> Experts from Karsruhe University in Germany and Dar es Salaam University say the mountain measures 5,892 metres above sea level . <p> Kilimanjaro is a dormant volcano , one of the string of volcanic cones formed at the same time as the Rift Valleys of East Africa . <h> Its beauty <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed from the plains of Tanzania , Kilimanjaro conforms to our childhood notions of what a mountain should look like : high , wide and handsome , a vast triangle rising out of the flat earth , its sides sloping exponentially upwards to the satisfyingly symmetrical summit of Kibo ; a summit that rises imperiously above a thick beard of clouds and is adorned with a glistening bonnet of snow . Kilimanjaro is not located in the crumpled mountain terrain of the Himalayas or the Andes . Where the mightiest mountain of them all , Everest , just edges above its neighbours ? and look less impressive because of it ? Kilimanjaro stands proudly alone on the plains of Africa . The only thing in the neighbourhood that can even come close to looking it in the eye is Mount Meru , a fair way off to the south-west and a good 1420m smaller too . The fact that it ? s located smack bang in the heart of the sweltering East African plains , just a few degrees and 330km south of the equator , with lions , giraffes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around its base , only adds to its charisma . <p> And then there ? s the scenery on the mountain itself . So massive is Kilimanjaro , that to climb it is to pass through four seasons in four days , from the sultry rainforests of the lower reaches through to the windswept heather and moorland of the upper slopes , and on to the arctic wastes of the summit . <p> There may be 15 higher points on the globe ; there can ? t be many that are more beautiful , or more tantalizing . <h> Balloon flight over Mt . Kilimanjaro <p> In February 19th 2003 , a Dutch balloon team attempted the flight over Mt . Kilimanjaro with a normal hot air balloon . The flight was done by the pilots Karel Abbenes and Willem Hijink , at an altitude of over 23,000 feet ( 6,900m ) . <p> In search of a Tanzanian partner who could take care of all logistics , Karel contacted JMT African Heart Expeditions in November 2002 . It took us only 5 minutes to agree getting involved in this extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basket were flown over by KLM , the necessary permits were obtained , gas and a charter plane ( for photgraphing and filming the balloon flight ) were arranged . Karel and Hein Brunings arrived mid-February , one week before the rest of the team members , to collect the balloon at Kilimanjaro airport customs . KLM pilots kindly agreed to measure wind speed and direction at different altitude levels and communicate these every evening during their descent to Kilimanjaro airport via radio . <p> The other team members arrived and on February 17th the expedition left Arusha . The location from where the balloon would take off , on the north-east side of Mt . Kilimanjaro , was reached the next day . Now the expedition members had to put up camp and wait until weather conditions would be OK for the flight . <p> The morning of February 19th , all equipment , as well as inboard and outboard cameras , were made ready for the flight . One hour before sunrize the last weather balloons were inflated and the final checks carried out . Oxygen for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 07.05 am . One vehicle immediately returned to the other side of the mountain , where the balloon would be retrieved after the flight . <p> The balloon took off heading south and gradually gaining height . During the climb to over 7 kms radio contact was established with Kilimanjaro airport tower . With increasing altitude the winds changed to east and brought them towards the first goal : Mawenzi peak . The wind the KLM crew had given the pilots was exactly the same as they found near the peak . From Mawenzi the winds took them to Kibo with Uhuru peak as the main goal . Temperature dropped to minus 15 ? C. Uhuru peak came into view and the pilots climbed a bit to get even better winds . The winds took them right over the center of the crater . The mission was a 100% success . The remainder of the flight was enjoying the view . Mt . Kenya could be seen to the north-west , to the south-east Kilimanjaro airport with Arusha just south of mount Meru was clearly visible . <p> After a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that a landing should be made south of Tinga Tinga . The Masai , who have several villages in that landing area , came out from the plains to welcome the aeronauts back to earth . They were amazed that we had flown across the mountain and were but only too pleased to assist with the packing of the balloon . The safety airplane with Hein Brunings , who filmed the flight , had no problem finding the landing site of the balloon and passed the landing location coordinates on to the chase team on the ground . Willem and Karel had to wait for more than 6 hours before the chase team with Erik van Halsema and Marco Hijink had taken the cars around Mount Kilimanjaro . Everything was loaded on the trailers , for return back to Arusha . The expedition was a success . <h> Dutch balloon team flies over Kilimanjaro on hot air balloon <p> This week , a Dutch balloon team has claimed its share of the legend by flying over Kilimanjaro with a hot air balloon . <p> Speaking in Arusha last weekend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also going to raise money for Mount Kilimanjaro cleaning campaign . <p> The money to be invested in cleaning up the giant land feature has been donated by a Dutch company named , Afvalverwerking Reijnmond ( AVR ) which specializes in ecological waste assimilation . <p> Abbenes and his co-pilot Willem Hijink have used the latest technological , stealth burner to pump hot air into their balloon as it is noiseless and thus can ? t scare animals . <p> Nobody has ever attempted this undertaking before and the two balloon pilots weren ? t just about to take any chances on that , so they employed two separate unit burners each with its three containers of gas . <p> The Royal Dutch Airline ( KLM ) supplied the team with regular weather reports from its KIA bound , Amsterdam flights and Dar es salaam bound KIA flights . <p> The fly over was done from the east side of the mountain towards the Moshi direction with a team of a Dutch Television camera crew filming the adventure . <p> At Moshi , the balloon team presented the cheque of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KINAPA ) authorities . <h> Drape the cliffs in white polypropylene fabric <p> Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company <p> Reading about this the melting snows , Euan Nisbet , a Zimbabwean greenhouse gas specialist at the Royal Holloway College , University of London , was struck by a fairly simple solution : drape the cliffs in white polypropylene fabric .

' <p> The historical cave is located in the Komakundi village , of the Mamba ward at Vunjo location , an area located at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro , within the Rural- Moshi District .

Cattle , goats , sheep and other animals were also hidden in the underground sheds . <p> This particular cave , according to the villagers , belonged to the Kwalaka clan . The other caves in the area , were reported to have caved in with time , but the Kwalaka cave , apparently , has been able to withstand the test of time . <p> Mrs. Stella Goodluck Makundi aged around 40 years , is the widowed wife of one of the clan descendants .

According to British topographers engaged on the boundary Commission the height was determined at 19,318 , but as Meyer points out , they were never able to see the topmost peak which is invisible from below ; German members of the Commission , however , arrived at an altitude of a little less than that . Meyer ' s own aneroid readings gave an altitude of 60 ms. more than the height observed of the British topographers . So far as I am aware the altitude was never ascertained by boiling point observations until 1921 when Mr. C. Gillman scaled the crater rim , and though I have not his figures , I believe that he found the correct measurement to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s computation gave . Whatever the exact altitude may be , the highest point is over 19,000 feet above sea-level , and is thus the highest in Africa . <h> Meaning <h> Origin of the name ' Kilimanjaro ' <p> There are many unsatisfactory explanations for how the mountain got its name and no one can quite agree which is the truth . " Mountain of Greatness " , Mountain of Whiteness " , " Mountain of Caravans " , " Small Mountain of Caravans " are all names derived from the Swahili , Chagga and Machame dialects . <p> From what little we know on the subject , we think it might have something to do with the swahili word ' kilima ' , which means ' top of the hill ' . The second portion ' njaro ' presumably refers to the snow in some way . We did discover that a similar word ' ngare ' means water in the Meru language . <p> There is also a claim that the word " kilemakyaro " exists in the Chagga language , Meaning " impossible journey " , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as a precidence . <p> Of course everyone knows that in truth the mountain was named after the legendary Tanzanian beer . <h> The Meaning of Kilimanjaro <p> From the time of the earliest explorers , visitors have been intrigued by the name Kilimanjaro . The visitor who enquires today will probably receive from most Wachagga the same answer which was given to the early explorers : - It is not a Chagga name . The Wachagga themselves have no name for the whole mountain . They have , however , names for the two peaks , commonly known as Kibo and Mawenzi . These are more properly written , in Kichagga , Kipoo and Kimawenze and the meanings can be explained . Kipoo means " spotted " ; a reference to the black rock which stands out here and there against the snowfield ; Kimawenze means " having a broken top , notched " ; describing the jagged appearance of this peak . The very well-known Chagga story of how Mawenzi acquired this appearance is retold in the extracts from Bruno Gutmann 's work , translated elsewhere in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Kilimanjaro is a foreign importation , even they accept that this is now the name by which the mountain is internationally known . They listen with , I think , some private amusement , to the innumerable theories advanced to explain the name , and will discuss the merits and demerits of these theories . At the same time , the older generation at least , regard any attempts to derive the name from Kichagga roots as decidedly suspect and as inventions made long after the event by enthusiastic youngsters . <p> This is not therefore an attempt to find the long-sought answer and to offer a definitive or authoritative explanation . It may however , be of interest to summarise some of the theories so far advanced . <p> All the early attempts at explanation are based on breaking down Kilimanjaro into two elements : kilima and njaro , on the assumption that kilima at least is the Swahili for mountain ' . The Wachagga themselves find this difficult and confusing , since in Swahili mountain ' is properly mlima , and kilima is a diminutive Meaning hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to indicate affection , though it is difficult to understand why a stranger should wish to express such affection . <p> It is also possible to postulate that an early European visitor , whose knowledge of Swahili was not extensive , changed mlima to kilima by analogy with the two Chagga names ; Kibo and Kimawenzi . <p> The first attempt at explanation comes from the missionary Krapf , who saw the mountain from a distance but left his co-worker , Rebmann , to visit Chaggaland . In his Missionary Labours ( 1860 ) , Krapf writes ( p.255 ) , " The Swahili of the coast call the snow-mountain Kilimanjaro , " mountain of greatness . " It may also mean " mountain of caravans " ( kilima - mountain ; jaro caravans ) , a landmark for caravans seen everywhere from afar , but the inhabitants of Jagga call it Kibo , snow . " He makes no attempt to explain in what way Kilimanjaro can be interpreted mountain of greatness ' in Swahili , nor how he combines , kilima , Swahili , hill ' , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been stated , Kibo in Kichagga does not mean snow ' , which is kora . On p. 544 , he says that Kivoi , a chief of the Kamba tribe , whom he visited in 1850. . . . " had been to Jagga and had seen the Kima jaJeu , mountain of whiteness , the name given by the Wakamba to Kilimanjaro in contra-distinction to the Kegnia ( Kenya ) . " More correctly in the Kamba dialect , this would be kiima kyeu , and this possible derivation has been popular with several investigators . <p> Joseph Thompson , in his Through Masailand ( 1885 ) writes , ( p.207 ) , " The term Kilimanjaro has generally been understood to mean the mountain ( kilima ) of greatness ( njaro ) . This is probably as good a derivation as any other , though not improbably it may mean the white mountain , as I believe the term njaro has in former times been used to denote whiteness , and though this application of the word is now obsolete on the coast , it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thompson does not substantiate this claim , or make any attempt to explain the use of kilima for mlima . <p> A. G. Fischer , in his " Report of a Journey in the Masai Country " in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society , Vol . VI . 1884 , will have none of this . <p> He writes ( pp.70-83 ) , " The word ( Kilimanjaro ) does not mean either mountain ' or " greatness " , but signifies Njaro Mountain , by which among the inhabitants of the coast , an evil spirit is meant . " Sir Harry Johnston , in his Kilimanjaro Expedition , 1886 , ( p.ln.l. ) likewise explains the name as being from kilima , mountain ' , and njaro , the name of a demon , supposed to cause cold : This name , he says , is known only to the people of the coast and is unrecognised in the interior . <p> Hans Meyer , the first known European to reach the summit of the mountain , also subscribes to the idea of a spirit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( p.152 ) , he says , " We awoke in capital trim for our climb to the summit , and this time , Njaro , the spirit of the mountain , was propitious. . . . we succeeded in reaching our goal . " Again on p.154 , " Njaro , the guardian spirit of the mountain , seemed to take his conquest with a good grace , for neither snow nor tempest marred our triumphal invasion of his sanctuary . " <p> In Chagga folklore , there is ample evidence of their belief in spirits which dwell in or on the mountain , but , for the Wachagga , these were usually kindly and well-intentioned . There is , admittedly , also mention of a guardian spirit who would destroy anybody who presumed to climb beyond a certain limit . But there is no evidence of a spirit called Njaro , either by the Wachagga themselves , or by the coastal tribes . Wachagga to whom I have spoken , are willing to presuppose the existence of a man , possibly a chief , called Njaro , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> once again , the compound with the difficult Swahili kilima , would be unexplained . ( The Kichagga for mountain ' is fumvu ) . <p> An explanation which has been widely accepted is based on the introduction of the Masai word njaro , Meaning springs ' , or possibly water ' . Monseigneur A.Le Roy , in his book Au Kilimanjaro , ( 1893 ) after discussing other theories , relates the following story : " At Taveta , walking one day with some native children , we were asked by one of them if we intended to stay long on Kilima-ngaro . . . . " What did did you say : kilima-ngaro ? " " Yes " . " But what is ngaro ? " " Ngaro , ngare , in the language of the Masai and even in our own , means water ' . And we call the big mountain over there , The Mountain of Water ' , because it is there that all the rivers here and round about rise . " We concluded that we had found the true meaning <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous mountain the traders from the coast will have heard kilima-ngaro , and rebated with a slight modification . . <p> but still leaves the kilima element unexplained , and perpetuates the somewhat unlikely compound , part Swahili , part Masai . <p> the idea that the name is of non-Chagga origin and was , therefore , very probably , invented by porters from the coast . But it leaves unexplained how Kilimanjaro means a little white hill " even in Swahili , although the diminutive aspect is here satisfactorily explained . Unfortunately I have been unable to ascertain from Mr. Nelson the date of the chart on which he claims to have seen the name used . If this chart , in fact , ante-dates any mention of the name Kilimanjaro as the name of the mountain , then the investigation of its Meaning among the coastal peoples might be fruitful . In this context , it has been pointed out to me ( by a Mchagga ! ) that there is also a mountain in the Uluguru range called- Kilimanjaro ! Which Kilimanjaro came first ? <p> Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pp.77-79 ) , accepts the derivation , Swahili , kilima njaro , the shining mountain ' , though without explaining the njaro element . Mr. H. A. Fosbrooke , whose considerable help in the preparation of this paper is gratefully acknowledged , concludes , after examining all the theories , that the name is of Kamba origin . He says that in the Kamba language the word ki-ima , is used for both hill ' and mountain ' . thus overcoming the difficulty of the diminutive . <p> From Johnston 's Comparative Study of the Bantu and Semi-Bantu Languages ( 1919 ) , he takes the Kamba root for white to be -au or -eu , related to Taveta -ewa , Sambaa -zelu , Zaramu , -zeru . He therefore concludes that Thompson was right when he said that in former times the term njaro had been used to denote whiteness , but not all linguists agree that this is a logical conclusion . This brings us back to the kima ja jeu of Krapf 's Kamba informant . <p> A completely new line of approach can be obtained if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swahili , little hill ' , or somehow , mountain ' , which inevitably produce the difficulty of explaining njaro . The Kamba theory apart , the great demerit of all the other theories is that they explain njaro from languages other than Swahili , thus producing a rather unlikely hybrid . The term kilema in Kichagga , means which defeats ' ; kilelema which has become difficult or impossible ' , i.e. which has defeated . Njaro can then be derived from njaare , a bird , or , according to other informants , a leopard , or , possibly from jyaro a caravan . <p> According to one Chagga informant , the old men tell the story that long ago the Wachagga , having seen the snowy dome , decided to go up to investigate ; naturally , they did not get very far . Hence the name : kilemanjaare , or kilemanyaro , or possibly kilelemanjaare etc. - which defeats , ' or which is impossible for , the bird , the leopard , or the caravan . ' This is attractive as being entirely made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains that the name Kilimanjaro is not , and apparently never has been , current among the Wachagga as the name of the mountain . Is this then only , as other Wachagga suggest , a latter-day attempt to find a Chagga explanation when pressed to do so by a foreign enquirer ? Is it perhaps arguable that the early porters from the coast hearing the Wachagga say kilemanjaare or kilemajyaro , Meaning simply that it was impossible to climb the mountain , imagined this to be the name of the mountain , and associated it with their own kilima ? Did they then report to the European leaders of the expedition that the name of the mountain was , their version of the Kichagga , which , further assimilated by the European hearer , finally became standardised as Kilimanjaro ? <h> Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain <p> Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high , and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa .

Krapf had a dream to link the West and East coasts of Africa with a chain of Christian missionaries , but it was n't long before he discovered his high ambitions conceived in the parlours of Europe were not going to be so easy to realize in the field . In March of that year they moved to Mombasa , where Krapf was to suffer a major test of his faith when his wife died of malaria within days of giving birth . The child died also . Krapf was plunged into depression and suffered alone for two years until the arrival of Swiss missionary , Johann Rebmann , whose fresh enthusiasm was finally able to re-kindled Krapf ' s ambition desire to link the two coasts . <h> The first Europeans to discover Kilimanjaro <p> The first Europeans to discover Kilimanjaro the legendary burial place of King Solomon , were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1848 . Their tales of a snow-covered peak near the equator , however , were not initially believed . <h> First exploration into Tanganyika <p> What can be considered as the first exploration into Tanganyika took place in 1846 by German missionaries Ludwig Krapf and Johannes Rebmann who , exploring the Pangani Valley for two years , were the first to report sighting Kilimanjaro in 1848 . Their report that the mountain was snow-capped met with disbelief from the scientific world . <h> The first Europeans to discover Kilimanjaro <p> The first Europeans to discover Kilimanjaro , the legendary burial place of King Solomon , were two German missionaries , Johannes Rebmann and Ludwig Krapf , in 1848 . Their tales of a snow-covered peak near the equator , however , were not initially believed . Later two other Germans were the first to reach ( 1889 ) the Kibo summit . <h> The Church Missionary Intelligencer <p> The news of the sighting of snow capped mountains near the equator burst on the Western world when Rebmann published an account of his first journey to Chaggaland in 1848 in The Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May 1849 . This stirred up a heated argument in which numerous learned gentlemen argued that it was impossible for snow clad mountains to exist in the tropics . <p> For examples of the arguments and counter-arguments used see a letter in the Athenaeum dated 19th May 1849 and many further letters and articles in that Journal and the The Church Missionary Intelligencer . One of the most ardent opponents of Rebmann was one Cooley who in 1852 published his book Inner Africa laid Open . For a summary of the arguments and also somewhat abreviated accounts of Rebmann ' s three journeys to Chaggaland see Dr. Krapf ' s Travels , Researches and Missionary Labours ( 1860 ) . <h> Dr. Ludwig Krapf a German by birth <p> Dr. Ludwig Krapf a German by birth , was a British Missionary . In 1854 , he challenged the Church Misisonary Society to make the grave of his wife and child , near Mombasa , the starting point for the conversion of E. Africa , a challenge which the Society at once accepted . <h> The Slug Map <p> Paper IX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive endeavour by the missionaries Krapf and Erhardt to depict large areas of East and Central Africa including the Great Lakes . From the information at their disposal it appeared that one huge lake lay at the centre of the area . Their representation of this lake , depicted in Map 2A , suggested a slug , hence the popular name of the map . <p> The map itself has never been published but is in the possession of the Royal Geographical Society , London . The Map Curator of the R.G.S. has kindly provided a photo copy of the relevant portion of the map , exhibited as map 2B , stating that this is the best that can be made . <p> To bring out the salient points , the Survey and Mapping Division of the Ministry of Lands , Housing and Urban Development undertook an enlargement ( times 2 ) which accurately reproduces the features which are of particular concern to this story , but omits many others . <p> Ngorongoro and the Serengeti do not yet appear , but the whole of the country from north of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ILMASAI . <p> Oldonyo Lengai is shown as " Snow Mt . ( rain Mt . ) Gods Mt . " . " Kignea " and " Kilimanjaro " are also shown as snow mountains . The reason for including Lengai in this category is because mineral deposits which appear on the upper slopes of the volcano show upwith such brilliant whiteness as to give to the early observers the impression of snow . <p> It is of interest to note that the trade in soda from Lake Natron ( though not named as such ) was in existance at the time : " From where the Magad soda is bought . " <p> Another point of interest depicted in the extreme north east corner of the map is a reference to a stream flowing into " the Ukerewa " I.e. Lake Victoria . It is noted that " This water tho ' sweet is said to turn peoples teeth yellow " . This is probably the first recorded reference to the fact , particularly noticeable around Mount Meru , that a high flourine sic content in the drinking water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be removed . <p> The Map was presented to the Royal Geographical Society on 10th November 1855 by the missionary Erhardt . Its official title is as follows : <p> " Sketch of a Map from 1 &; deg ; N. to 15 &; deg ; S. Latitude and from 23 &; deg ; to 43 &; deg ; E. Longitude delineating the probably position and extent of the Sea of Uniamesi as being the continuation of the Lake Niasa and exhibiting the numerous heathen-tribes situated to the East and West of that great Inland-sea together with the Caravan routes leading to it and into the interior in general .
