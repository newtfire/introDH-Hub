It would be the first game week after the latest international break and Arsenal would be looking to get three points at Carrow Road . Last time these two sides met a breathtaking 3-3 draw was played at the Emirates on the second least game week of last season . Last time the Gunners traveled to Carrow road , they emerged 2-1 convincing winners over the Canaries . <p> Arsenal have had a good start to the league , winning three , drawing three and losing one , a run which finds them sitting seventh in the table with 12 points , seven points behind league leaders Chelsea . Arsenal go into this game winning their last match on the road at Upton Park where Giroud opened his account and Arsenal had a impressive game . <p> Possible starting XI <p> Mannone would keep his place in goal as Szczesny wo n't be ready for Saturday . His performances so far have made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would probably be finding himself on the bench . <p> The back four have looked strong as well as shaky this season , keeping three clean sheets but allowing a total of five goals . Though it is probably the best in the league but the goals Arsenal have conceded have been due to poor defending . Considering the opposition the Gunners play , Wenger might put up Mertesacker along with Vermaelen in the heart of the defence with Jenkinson and Gibbs as full backs . Mertesacker managed to score against Sweden in their disappointing 4-4 draw . <p> In midfield , perhaps return game for Jack Wilshere ? Not really . Jack Wilshere on the bench ? Maybe . Chamberlain might play in midfield alongside Arteta and Cazorla due to the fact that Diaby wo n't be ready till yet . The OX displayed a brilliant performance for England in their friendlies which might give him a start on Saturday . <p> Up front , Giroud would look to build on his goal against West Ham alongside Podolski ( who will take his place on the left ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giroud also scored a last gasp equaliser against Spain in their qualifiers after coming on as a substitute on the 88 ? minute . <p> It should be simple three points

##1277650 <h> Posts Tagged ' middle ' <p> When we are in need of money , we check our resources for possible ways of getting what we need ( which is money ) . I always tell myself to look for option that does nt cost much . My first option is always ask for family member or close friends first . The reason for this is because they wont charge me interest rate and if they do , its just a few dollars until I experienced it myself . <p> Its in the middle of the month and my son got sick , hospital bills is pain in the ass . Ive used my savings for his medication and to pay bills and mortgage . On top of that I have to pay my credit card too and serve food on our table . My next paycheck will arrive in 2 weeks time and I know Ill run out of cash before having it . Ill have the amount I need when I get my pay I just know for now I need help immediately . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend me the amount I need and charged me %5 of the amount I borrowed which is okay and I told her I can pay it right after I get my paycheck which is after 2 weeks I thought Im safe now . <p> One week later , Im still waiting for my pay when I received a phone call from my cousin . She said she needs the money back immediately , something came up and she needs it badly . I do nt know where to get money , I said Ill try to get it paid immediately and she said When you needed it , I gave it to you without second thought . You have to pay it back . I am very much thankful she gave me money when I need it , I know she just need the money and Ill pay it . Thats when I realize its better to use payday loan . Here are the reasons why : <p> Payday loans has specific due dates , while family/ friends does nt have With Payday loan , once you paid the borrowed amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always owe them something . ( in some cases , this does nt apply ) Last is in some cases , it affects the relationship . I applied for payday loan . I always use Responsible loan , they provide great service , they have higher interest rate than the usual lending company because this is Short term loan and its high risk . Most important is they tell you the amount you have to pay in detail . I applied there and have the money the same day , paid back my cousin then I was relieved . <p> I asked for help from a family member to save money , but it turned out its not that good option for me . I am still thankful though but I have learned that its better to use Payday loan than the other option . Payday loan is a short term type of loan that has to be paid within 30 days . They send reminders the day before the due date so you wont 
##1279751 <p> I should not be writing to you at this time because I am stealing into my office hours . I am risking losing my job with every key I punch ... My love for you is vast ... Colossal ... astronomical ... boundless and capacious ! Comprehensive , detailed and endless ... Measureless ... Not a single word that I have just googled can express these feelings Doris ... Ca n't you see ? <p> I know what went through your mind immediately you read that title ... Sex ! Right ? Which is not a sin ... If you look at it critically , we owe this tiny segment of the house a lot . Considering you were probably made in one and you probably made your children in one or trying to the cycle is vicious ! ! <p> Ok . I do not know what I wanted to achieve when I started this post like that ! <p> The bedroom can be used for a number of things ... A quiet and private place to rest ... A place to sleep ... A place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... A place to coit ! I am thinking if coitus is a noun , then coit must be its verb ! <p> Moving on ! <p> I have a theory on making babies who you want them to be before even you decide to start making them ! I am straying from what I wanted to write about but this is important ! <p> I highly believe in orientation : Setting the chill 's mind to a particular career ... I am not making sense ... Even I do n't understand what I am going on about ! <p> For example ... I believe that if you want your child to be a teacher ... Try coiting on a teacher 's table ! ! ! ( I will be using coit &; coiting a lot so it is better you get used to is now ) . <p> If you want your child to grow up to be a chef ... TRY THE KITCHEN COUNTER . Are you seeing where I am going with this ? Probably not ! ! If you want a wrestler or weight lifter or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... As in , give this baby a future right from the beginning ! <p> If you want an astronaut , I suggest you try IT in a space ship , which explains extensively why there are such few astronauts in the world ... Not all of us have access to NASA right ? <p> If you want a surgeon , try an operating bed ... I could go on and on ! <p> So if your child is doing terribly at school or is just plain annoying as shit ... Go back into time .... waaaayyyyy back .... was it in a toilet booth ? That man you met at the club who sent your juices rushing so fast you could not wait to get home and decided to coit in the toilet ? ? I want you to think hard ! <p> I do n't even want to start thinking how pathologists are made ... And do you know why we have so many Business students graduating from our universities ? Office romance ! Coit in a prison cell and chances are you will be working your ass off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life ... <p> Normally when I walk into my bedroom , the first thing I see is the full length mirror ... The first thing I see is literally myself walking into the room ... This normally triggers a tiny jester in my mind ... I burst into dance .... Normally no the dance you are comfortable doing anywhere else ... This is supposed to be a private room ... So you do a dance that is never supposed to be seen .. EVER ! <p> Most of the time I make my own beat ... I then start shaking my body to my own beat .... If it gets deep into my head ... I remove my shirt and throw it on the floor .. You know ... like a stripper ... I HAVE NO CLUE WHY I AM TELLING YOU ALL THIS BY THE WAY ! <p> Then I remove my belt ... and swing it violently round my head ... Then I stop and change into my pjs ... I do n't go too far because someone might be watching ... I am extremely sure God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up until the other day ... My normal routine ... Take off the jacket ... Then the shirt dancing vigorously forcing my eyes to see a six-pack that 's barely a pack ! <p> Then I see something move outside the window ... <p> My curtains were wide open ... My house is directly opposite a few houses ... You could read the book I am reading from across the court and here I was dirty dancing in front of a mirror being watched by hell knows who ! ! <p> So I quickly turn off my lights and draw the curtains , leaving a little space to spy on the spy ! <p> I notice the shadow of a woman ... I can tell its a woman because of the hair ... It was either a woman or a man in a wig ! <p> This person must have been watching me for years ! <p> My heart was on my lips ! I start going through the media files in my brain ... How intense have I ever gotten ... Did this person have recordings of me doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press one day when I become president ? ? ? SO MUCH TO PROCESS ! ! ! <p> That was all the evidence I had . A female shadow or a man in a wig ..... So basically I had nothing ! It could have been anyone ! <p> From that day on , I look at my neighbors straight in the eyes ! Without blinking or looking away ! ! The first one who will burst out into laughter is the pervert who has been watching me dance ... <p> Just before I leave ... I had a whole post on how Kikuyus nickname themselves . I have sat and thought in length about whether to post it ... I would look and sound extremely tribalistic which is not the case ! So I have decided to shorten that post and add it on to this post . Having a whole post on Kikuyus will not look good ... I am no tribalist and I keep on saying it ... I apologize if anyone thinks so after this : <p> THE POST : <p> Before I go any further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a tribalist and whatever I am about to write should not be termed as tribalistic . I am a Luo man and I am about to write about a few things Kikuyus do ... You know too well that these two communities are in constant quarrels ... Worse yet , now that elections are coming up and Luos are calling Kikuyus names and Kikuyus calling Luos names ceteris paribus ( spelt it right this time ) . I am not going to call Kikuyus names ... I am going to call Kikuyu them names that they call themselves ... <p> I am going to get into so much shit seeing how many Kikuyu women I know *cough* *hiccup* <p> I like padded yelo yelo women ! In my part of the world , Kikuyu women have that covered ! Please refer to this as many times as you can as you read this . <p> I have never understood the science behind how Kikuyus shorten their names ! ! You all get a new name all together ! Like for example , Muthoni .... The normal way to shorten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? How in the blazes does Muthoni become Soni ? ? ? I totally get the ' ONI part of it but where did the ' S ' come from ? ? ? This would totally put the dichotomous key in problems ! <p> One of my biggest fans is called Soni and she will kill me ! <p> I also have another friend called Wangari ... In fact , she helped me with this post ! So you Kikuyu who wants to yank my tongue out ... Yank Wangari 's out first ... She is the disloyal one ! <p> Wangari becomes Kare ... Surely ! ! ! Again another letter from absolutely nowhere near the name itself ... Totally ignoring that maybe it could be ' Ngare ' or ' Wanga ' ... Wait , I have a feeling ' Wanga ' means something in Sheng ' . No ? <p> Wanjiku . I do not know any Wanjikus . If you are a Wanjiku and we know each other you should not worry , I will probably remember in the morning ! So Wanjiku becomes Shiko ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is everywhere ! ! ! If I was the one shortening this name , I would have put it as , ' Njiko ' or ' Wanji ' but the latter sounds like ' Manji ' Which is not so bad considering your name will sound like a famous biscuit brand ! <p> You are the only people in the world who will see Wanjiru as Shiro . Again with the ' S ' ! <p> Wamboi becomes Foi and Gathoni Noni ... <p> I do n't know any more names ... I smell a witch hunt after this ... So if you want to kill me , my weak spot is my left pinky toe . Shoot it with an arrow and I will die instantly ! <p> I have improved my flower ... Not a week has passed since my last letter . Thoughts of you would not let another second pass . I have just read the last letter I wrote to you . I want to apologise for my stupidity . I was not serious about the threats . I made fool out of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology finds your heart like you found mine ! <p> I have a head ache . It is not like any headache I have had before . It has been going on for 3 days straight now . It is not strong , so it is very easy to ignore it . My love , I might be dying . <p> My fuel light has been on since Thursday last week . I am yearning for drama . The thing just wo n't stall ! <p> I left the house early today for work ... My alarm went off after when I was having breakfast ... <p> On my way to work i meet about 6 traffic cops . It 's a very short distance to work , so 6 is on the higher ide . A random cop is always walking around the Kileleshwa Police station . Most of the time he is buying maize or just dizzily walking around thinking of all his problems ... 2 are always at the Chiromo bus stop ! These are the trickiest ones . I am coming back to these ones , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always at the Westlands roundabout , one of them , more often than not , a woman ... Spending your day in jail , as you can see , can be arranged with no effort ... Lets go back to the two niggas at Chiromo cops stop . <p> These cops have piki pikis so there is no escaping these ones ! <p> Scene 1 Act 1 <p> I am listening to a gospel CD I just got . Something has always told me nothing goes wrong when you are driving and jamming to some praise and worship jams . That something has been right ... Until today ! <p> I get to Chiromo and I am pulled over ! Normally when this happens , you quickly go through a list of what might get you into shit* before the cop gets to your window ! <p> I go through my list ... I was on the phone , I have no ' life savers ' , I have no idea where my spare wheel is , I have no clue where my driving licence is ... I have never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't remember when my insurance is supposed to be expiring so it might have even expired ! And my fuel light is on ... I am not sure if that is a crime or not ! <p> As is , I deserve a life sentence ... <p> The man walks straight to my insurance sticker ... He looks at it for a little while then walks to my window ! My heart is now on the back seat ... I am so lifeless ! <p> " Fungua boot kijana , " he spits ... I oblige ! <p> I was in the shitter for sure ! <p> The boot slams shut ! <p> Then he comes to my window ! I was waiting for him to read me my rights ! <p> " Unafika Westlands hapo roundabout ? " the uniform asks with no shame ! I am currently in a state that does not allow me to be a bitch ... " Ndio boss ! " I answer ... Praising him ! <p> I had graduated from fear to anger ! I was about to hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chini kidogo ! " He orders ... I oblige ! <p> My leather bag was placed at his feet ... He takes it and places it on the back seat ... I was going to ram into the truck in front of us and kill us both ! He had reached the nerve that comes after the last one ! <p> I ca n't speed because some stupid truck in front of me and I ca n't overtake because of ... because ... Wait , why did n't I think of this ? ! <p> We get to Westlands roundabout and I am pulling over ... <p> " Unafika Sarit ? " he asks just before I stopped ... <p> " Yezz ! " I respond ... " Haiya , tuendelee ... " He mutters ! <p> Just before we get to Sarit he spits , " HAPO ! " I styop right in the middle of the road as the man ordered ... <p> " Kijana , nani alikufundisha kuendesha ? ? ? " He asks , disgusted ... <p> I almost answered , " Your mother ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my car ... He smelt of bananas and spat like a platypus with every word he said ! <p> I was right in the middle of the road and I was not going to move until this man came out ! I had had enough ! <p> The Platz behind me is hooting senseless ! Which was more annoying ! <p> The cop is rooted on his seat waiting for me to drive to the side of the road ! ! ! <p> " Shuka ! " I say ! I have no idea how it came out ... I thought I had said it in my head ! The Platz behind me was stroking my last nerve ! <p> The cop is now looking at me bewildered ! <p> " Ebu nipe lizens ! " he says sticking out his hand ! ! ! <p> He had played a winning card ! ! I was screwed ! <p> " Toka nikupe ! " I was now seducing trouble ! I was fuched either way ! <p> The fool comes out ! I do n't understand human beings ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> " Sina hapa ! " I answer ! <p> " Nimechelewa . Niende ? " I continue ! <p> There was a tiny demon that was just going on and on ! ! ! ! I was being an idiot but I could not stop myself ! It scared me ! I was still in the middle of the road ! The Platz behind me had managed to go round me ... It stopped next to me and its windows rolled down to reveal an extremely unattractive woman . I could n't see her face but her silhouette was just irregular ! She drove off ... <p> " Bahati yako ... ENda ! " the cop spits ! ! I did not understand this one bit . I was being an idiot and he let me get away with it ! Something was not right ... There was a warp on the law ... <p> I am growing old ... I hope it has hit you that you will lose me one day ! The letters will stop coming in and the phone will never burst out in song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saying , " You never know how much you have until it is all gone " ? or something close to that ... My Doris , you will miss me when I am gone ... You will weep on my grave and wish me back ... But with all that earth smack on my chest , there is no turning back ... This is not a threat ... Pick up that pen and reply all these letters ... For if I pass on without your letters , I will come back to haunt you , and my dear , you shall write 10 letters on the daily until I am convinced I have read enough ... I love you ! <p> The other day at the dinner table I caught my mother looking at me eat with her mouth open , dumbfounded ! You know that face your parents wear when you tell them you are pregnant ? And you just cleared kindergarten ? Yeah , me neither ... But this was pretty close ! <p> " What Mama ? " I ask ... <p> " You are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered in a concerned voice , pointing at the ugali I was holding with her eyes ! <p> I looked at the ugali I was holding ... <p> When the food is cooked there is no need to wait before eating it . Kikuyu Proverb <p> It wasnt that big ... Ok maybe it was ... I have to admit , I was perplexed by the size of that ugali too ... It has never hit me before ! It was a quantum from a basketball ... Ok maybe I am exaggerating a little bit ... It was just under the size of a base-ball ( this just means it filled my clasped palm ) . <p> " If you continue like that your girlfriend will leave you ! " My dad says ... He too had been watching ! <p> " Look , compare it to this ! " He added and pinched a bit of his ugali ! His could fit into mine 8 times very comfortably ! <p> I was embarrassed ! <p> " But I do n't put the whole ugali in my mouth ! I bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ! Which is true ! I HONESTLY bite it like 3 times ! <p> " That 's a sign ! " My mother says and gets up . She was done eating ! She is walking slowly to the kitchen ! <p> " A sign ? ! " I ask .. " Yes ... That something is wrong with the size of the ugali you are holding ! " She says . She is in the kitchen I can only hear her voice . <p> " We have to talk about it ! " She adds ... <p> Felt like I was in trouble ! ! <p> But you see , I can explain where this BEHAVIOR arose from ! Let me explain ! <p> Apart from being a man , I have more detailed reasons ! <p> I went to Barding Secondary School ... The only thing in this school were students ... You had to imagine everything else ... <p> Let me not hate , I love that school ... I mean loved ! I hear nowadays it has showers and a new laboratory ! <p> Anyhow ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything of the sort ! We ate under trees sitting on logs ... If you all the logs were taken , there were stones ... If you did not like sitting on stones , you would eat standing ... <p> Being a school in the middle of nowhere , the food ratio depicted the same ... A huge chunk of ugali with a slight idea of skuma wiki with loads of skuma wiki soup ! thats on days we had ugali , which will be my point of reference . We also had 2 pieces of meat twice a week ... But that is not for today ! <p> Our lunch break or dinner break was just below 15 minutes ... Which is just bullshit compared to the amount of ugali you had to deal with ( STANDING ) . <p> Are you seeing where I am going with this ? <p> In Form one you eat last . Meaning you have even less time to finish your ugali ! I know you must be asking yourself why I am stressing on finishing the ugali ... Well , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish it ... Anything can happen ! So you better have a full stomach so if anything does happen , you have enough strength to walk 15 kms to the main road ! Was it 15 or 30 ... no clue ! <p> So , my point is , under these situations , the ugali you pinch out of the mother ugali should be at least an eighth of it . You save time . Do this for four years and it sticks ... continue doing it after the four years and , well , there is no hope ! <p> There is a day my parents came home from shagz -- arriving in the dead of the night . Normally , there is food on the table for them -- that day , I had finished all the ugali ! <p> As I type this my mother is shouting my name to go down stairs for devotion ... This is not normal because it is 9:30pm ... You know too well this is a dawn affair ! I am going to go down stairs and find out what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Just came back up after like an hour .. Nothing serious ! Asante Mungu ! <p> Moving right along ! <p> I am running out of things to write to you about ! I have been staring at the blinking cursor for almost 10 minutes now ! My days were full of drama ... Intense drama ... At some point in my life I was almost killed by a mob in the middle of town ... At another point my brother and I towed a scooter half-way across town ... At another point I was running away from the City Council askaris ... I have since figured why this is so ... I bought a car ! All the drama was in the matatus cetaris pharibas . I am sure I spelt that wrong ! Its not even supposed to be there ! <p> Please be advised that I am going to milk that point until there is absolutely nothing left ... That is me buying a car ! I love the way that statement plays on my tongue ... That one and , ' when I was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and a half years later ! EVERYONE who asks me where I have been gets the line smack on their faces ! I make it sound like I have just come from the airport ... The other day I met one of my childhood friends at the Westlands Oil Libya mini mart ! She was buying cigarettes ! I was buying gum ... The traffic was insane and I was tired of balancing pedals ... <p> " Hi Patricia* " I said with absolute uncertainty because the ass she wielded was not the ass she had 15 years ago ... And her mammary glands were , well , mammary glands ! These were completely new ! <p> " Ian ? " she responded and quickly put her cigarettes in her hand bag like she was hiding them ... Clearly forgetting we were not 10 anymore ! I smiled ! <p> " Yup ! " I answer ! <p> I was wearing my best shirt and shoes so I was sure I was on top of my game ! <p> " Happy new year ! " I continue ! My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally ! <p> She laughs <p> " You are still funny ! " She makes a pass at me ... <p> 15 years ago she would'nt have looked at me once let alone make a pass at me ... I was the tall skinny kid with shorts that barely covered my thighs while she was that rich spoilt child whose dad and mum lived in Nairobi ... We were in Kisumu , so Nairobi was a big deal ! Yeah ... I said it ! <p> " haha ! " I laugh with absolutely nothing to tell this woman ! <p> " So where have you been all this while ? " She asks ... She woke up the monster ! I have this conversation all planned out ! ! ! AL PLANNED FUCKIN ' OUT ! <p> " Nowhere interesting ! Been working in the UK . Just came back ! Where have you been ? " I answer like I was there from 1997 ! Be advised that I was there for less than 2 months ! <p> Did you notice what I did with my answer ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working in the UK ' was not that big ! HAHAHAHA ! <p> " Wow ! What do you do ? " She asks ... Here is where I was sure I had her by the balls ... I am this middle aged , attractive young man who is doing well ... Trust me ... That is evident from my shirt ! <p> To her question , ' what do you do ? ' I normally answer , " I am a graphic designer ! " But when I notice the awe in your eyes by how well you think I am doing ... I go like , " I am an artist ! " hahahahah ! Which I am ! I just looking like I earn loads of money from not doing much ... I do not by the way ... So wipe that look off your face ! <p> ' Ongoro ' -- Here I showered for four years straight ... I am not in the picture so stop trying to find me ! <p> We are now walking out of the mini mart ... Talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to stop her ... <p> " I am parked the other side ! " BAZINGA ! The little things that excite me ... <p> " Oh , ok ! " She answers ... <p> " Where are you headed ? Maybe I can ... " I start ... She does nt let me finish ... <p> " Town ! " She says ... " You ? " She asks ... <p> " Kileleshwa ! " I answer like I own a house in that area ... <p> " You live in Kile ? " She asks . <p> " Yup " , I answer ! Intentionally forgetting to mention that I live in my parents house ... <p> We part ways ... I leave this woman with such skewed information ... I feel bad inside for a little bit ... Then it hits me I did not tell a single lie ... I put on my aviators and speed off ... IN MY CAR ! <h> Like this : <p> My lovely , How was your weekend my sweet ? I already know it was better than mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I. That and a flu from lucifer ... and a cough not so far from the same place . <p> It is just about midnight and I am just from the bathroom ... it is necessary for me to go into details just this once ... I went to piss . Like I said , I have a cough , so I have been taking benylyn . Thing is , I was not concentrating on the measurements on the lid that 's supposed to be guiding you on how much to take . I just filled up the whole thing twice and took em ... needless to say I am extremely wasted as I type this . On to my lesson : This is for men . I do not know how women Do wee wee so I will not get into it . Men : you know when you are so sleepy but you just need to take a leak ? You drag your feet , eyes closed ... you get to the bathroom but you do n't switch on the lights for fear of losing that sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid is n't up ... you direct the relevant projectiles ... and let it go . Maybe it is just me ... maybe ! No man is perfect ... so sometimes you will get it right ... and sometimes ... well ... you end up weeing all over the place . Leaving the place nothing less than a crime scene ... Here is how to get it right . <p> Step one : patience Most of the mistakes a man makes is always because of not being patient ... i do not have an example to qualify that but it is true . Wait ... look at all the children born out of wedlock ... why not just be patient until you get married to have sex ... ok ok ... do not kill me ... ok ! but being patient in this assignment is quite key . Do not rush . Get to the toilet ... lift the lead ... and the seat ... <p> Step two : positioning For you to piss right in the dark , very many things need to be in the right place . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Two being where you stand -- you have to look your enemy ( toilet ) in.the face . This just means you have to stand right in front of the thing . Three , unlike the stereotypical thoughts that you have to aim directly into the toilet ... aim on the side ... this being the inner walls ... and aim on your perfect side ... if you are left-handed , aim right ... the inverse applies . <p> Step three : the release Now that you have the bull by the horn , I advise you not to lose vision ( i know its dark and there was no vision in the first place ) slow but sure works miracles . I advise you to do a short sample run first ... you know what I am talking about ... start .... the hold ... if you got it right ... proceed ... if not ... re position . <p> Step four : listen Do not forget you are in the dark and the only senses you can use are touch and hearing ... the others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely familiar with . One:the sound of piss hitting the floor . It 's a flat noise . Like water hitting the floor . Cut the flow and re position . Two : the sound of piss hitting the lid . Its like pissing on a drum . You will know . Cut the flow , open lid and try again . Three : the sound of piss hitting the centre console . This is liquid on liquid . It 's the right place but extremely loud . If you live alone , go right ahead ... or else you will wake everyone up . Four : the sound of piss hitting the inner walls ... this is what you should be hearing . It is the sound of victory . Its stealth . Its lie a secret affair ... no one should know ... <p> Step five : re positioning with dying force . You know that science experiment in primary school with a bottle with holes in a line the water is filled and you can see the difference in pressure ?

##1283652 <p> Overseas companies are positioning themselves to grab a slice of the pie in the rapidly expanding market for solar panels in Kenya . German and Chinese manufacturers of solar panels have expressed willingness to enter the Kenyan market as demand for cleaner sources of energy surges . Market watchers say East Africa 's largest economy is both a frontier market and strategic gateway for overseas manufacturers of solar panels willing to explore the nascent market renewable energy technologies . Macro-economic stability combined with policy and regulatory incentives from the government has created a conducive environment for foreign investors to penetrate an expanding market niche for solar panels . <p> Innovative engineering and design is turning a 30-year-old flood storage dam into a hydroelectric power producer at Jordan Dam . The 4.4-MW Jordan Hydroelectric Project , installed on the discharge tower of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood storage dam , is truly the first of its kind . The project involves the installation of two conventional vertical Kaplan turbine-generators located on the upstream side of the discharge tower . Each turbine-generator is installed in an enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the tower 's intake . While the two turbines have a total discharge capacity of 1,100 cubic feet per second ( cfs ) , the hydroelectric project controls flow releases of up to 3,100 cfs through project equipment . Above 3,100 cfs , the units are raised to allow flows to pass underneath while continuing to generate power . <p> The African Union ( AU ) this week called on the member states to prioritise energy in their development strategies as Africa 's increasingly strong economic performance needs enough energy . The remarks were made during an experts meeting that convened at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa ahead of the 2nd Conference of Energy Ministers of Africa ( CEMA ) , to deliberate on pressing issue of energy on the continent . The ministers are due to meet on Friday in Addis Ababa . According to the AU , most African countries have set ambitious development targets and availability of reliable , affordable and low cost power supply is vital . <p> Kennedy Renewables will bring the Little Raith Wind Farm online in Scotland with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nine advanced technology GE 2.75-MW wind turbines will power Little Raith , generating electricity to power 15,000 UK homes . The project marks the debut installation of GE 's 2.75-MW platform in the United Kingdom and offers the flexibility in generator size and overall physical parameters required by permitting in the UK and Ireland . <p> EAST African Community member States are looking at establishing standardized regulations for bio-energy activities in the region by 2014 . Setting standards for the bio-energy industry becomes important as the Region has embarked on various bio-fuel projects which have emerged as an alternative source of energy with potential to replace finite fossil fuel resources . Experts from standards bodies in Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi are meeting in Dar es Salaam ahead of the move as part of the project inception stage focusing on enhancing capacity on standard setting . <p> Ethiopia is known by some as " the land of 13 months of sunshine , " a reference both to its climate and to its unique calendar of 12 months of 30 days and an additional month of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand renewable energy production seem to disregard all those months of sunny weather , focusing instead on wind energy and hydroelectric power . The country 's ambitious five-year Growth and Transformation Plan ( GTP ) , which began in 2010 , aims to increase the power generating capacity at least fourfold from the current level of 2,179 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity . However , solar power is expected to contribute a mere 30 MW to the goal . No one disputes the need for expanded electricity access in Ethiopia . <p> Countries are attempting to balance global warming with the continued use of fossil fuels , by developing clean coal technologies , says energy expert Global Data . While coal is the most commonly used source of energy for electricity generation globally , it is also the least clean energy source in the world , releasing a number of pollutants such as mercury , sulphur , nitrogen , and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) when burnt . The damage caused to human health and the environment by these pollutants has driven nations to demand cleaner power generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in developing countries , is driving up the demand for electricity , and since coal is an economical source of power generation with abundant resources , it has remained a prominent energy source globally . <p> The Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation ( RSSC ) is to invest some R400 million in energy projects . The rationale is that the Swaziland Electricity Company ( SEC ) sources 80% of its electricity from Eskom in South Africa and the price increases by the supplier have been passed on to consumers and businesses in Swaziland . As a result RSSC designed an energy strategy in 2009 to increase the capacity for internally generated power within each mill through the purchase of new electricity generators . The strategy also seeks to identify techniques of increasing the use of bagasse as a supplementary fuel source and in so doing , reduce costs of electricity usage and eliminate production downtime at the distillery due to power failures from SEC . <p> The International Renewable Energy Agency 's ( IRENA ) director general and Kenyan native , Adnan Z. Amin , has kept his promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 2 that it would partner with the Economic Community of West African States ( Ecowas ) to help the member nations reach their renewable energy potential . IRENA deputy director general Frank Wouters said at the International Off-Grid Renewable Energy Conference , " Gone are the days when the technology and high prices of solar and other biomass technology was prohibitive . " <p> In a stunning turnaround , US and international manufacturers are building new plants in the US due to America 's low energy costs and near-limitless domestic reserves , says Elliott Gue in Energy &; Income Advisor . Since China must import much of its energy , manufacturing costs there continue to escalate . Meanwhile , the US looks cheap to manufacturers that are building energy-efficient plants fired by that country 's low-cost natural gas . Recent shale oil and gas discoveries in the US have sent natural gas prices to the floor , while natural gas costs in countries around the globe are up to three times higher . Manufacturers are waking up to the fact that US energy production costs are now lower than anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of Congo has increased significantly recently , according to Afribiz . The 350MW twin gas-fired plants in Cote Mateve , inaugurated inDecember 2011 and the 120MW hydroelectric plant , which commenced operations in June 2012 at Imboulou , have lifted installed capacity in the country to 660MW . Although capacity utilisation remains acutely short of the estimated national power need of 600MW , it represents a sizeable improvement on the approximately 200MW the country had previously . Congo still has the potential to expand its hydroelectric power output to 1,100 MW via a proposed 800MW hydropower station at Chollet and upgrading the Imboulou dam to its full capacity of 300MW . <p> Globeleq Generation , an emerging markets power company , has announced the signature of financing for the 139 MW expansion of its existing 288 MW Azito gas-to-power plant near Abidjan , Cte d'Ivoire . Construction is expected to commence shortly , and to be completed in just over two years . The project was financed on a limited recourse basis with 80% of the funding provided by lenders including the International Finance Corporation , European development finance institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . The majority of the equity funds will be contributed by Globeleq and the remainder by its partner in the project , IPS ( West Africa ) , a company majority owned by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development . <p> Growing government support , combined with significant untapped potential , could see the UK 's renewable energy installed capacity almost match that of the traditionally dominant thermal sector by 2025 , says research by energy expert GlobalData . It predicts that the cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy plants will reach 79,000 MW by 2025 -- just 2,000 MW less than the predicted thermal installed capacity for the same year . The renewable energy industry is the fastest growing segment in the UK 's power mix , and is set to grow from the 11,000 MW installed capacity recorded for 2011 . <p> Kenya is ranked first out of nine African countries in the implementation of the bio gas programme after farmers embraced the energy generating technology , according to the Kenya National Farmers Federation.About 300 farmers are taking up the technology every month and close to 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three years . The chief executive of the Kenya National Farmers Federation -- the implementing agency - John Mutunga said out of the nine countries Kenya is leading with a production of 2,557 units this year alone followed by Uganda with 1,511 units . Other countries in the programme include Ethiopia , Rwanda , Tanzania , Burkina Faso , Senegal , Benin and Cameroun . " <p> Masdar announced today the development of a 15-megawatt solar power project in Nouakchott , the capital city of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania . The plant will deliver 10 per cent of electricity capacity in Mauritania . Masdar is a renewable energy company based in Abu Dhabi , UAE , which has large and small-scale power projects around the world . The project is the first utility-scale solar power installation in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania . " Mauritania has some of the highest levels of solar radiation in the world , making it an ideal place for solar power installations , " said Mauritania 's Minister of Petroleum , Energy and Mines H.E . Taleb Ould Abdivall . " We are pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and remain committed to harnessing our abundant renewable energy resources . <p> A new power export plan could give new life to the Democratic Republic of Congo 's 4,300-MW Inga 3 hydropower project , HydroWorld.com has learned . The Inga 3 hydroelectric plant , which was stalled in February after mining company CHP Billiton abandoned its plan for an aluminum smelting complex that would have used much of Inga 3 's output , might now provide power for South Africa , Botswana and Nambia . Congo 's government will host a meeting next month to discuss bids from China 's Sinohydro Corporation and South Korea 's Posco Engineering and Construction to builds the US$9 billion project . <p> Consistent with its technique to boost power national infrastructure in order to speed up Africa 's development , the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) Group authorized over US dollar One billion within energy projects across the region during the last couple weeks of 2010 . The projects are situated in Ethiopia , the DRC , Kenya Egypt , as well as Tanzania . Egypt received the biggest quantity having a US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project in the country . The objective of the task is to boost the generation capacity with a view to enhancing socio-economic development . It calls for the making of a 650-MW ( megawatt ) steam phase energy plant in a location in the locality of Suez town , around 150 kilometers eastern associated with Cairo . <p> Focusing on renewable energy initiatives would not only make South Africa more energy secure , it would create more jobs than alternative coal dependent scenarios and save hundreds of billions of rands over the long term . Developing renewable energy would also reduce carbon emissions , as the use of coal -- which the country currently relies on for 93 percent of its electricity generation -- would be phased out . Reducing our reliance on coal would also , besides having a " huge " impact on reducing emissions contributing to climate change , also reduce the " devastating " impacts coal mining , combustion and waste disposal has on many communities , says Greenpeace Africa climate campaigner Melita Steele . Steele was speaking at the Reporting Science Conference 2010 held at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Britain has reached several major milestones in its development of renewables during the past year . It established a national Green Investment Bank and confirmed a reduction from one tradable Renewable Obligation Certificate ( ROC ) to 0.9 ROC/MWh for onshore wind -- ending speculation over much deeper cuts , which had eroded industry confidence . This 10 percent cut was originally proposed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) , but rumors that further cuts -- up to 25 percent -- were under consideration had driven leading wind turbine manufacturers to write to the energy minister , warning that continuing uncertainty was a risk to investment in the UK . Despite this uncertainty , the UK crossed the 6-GW wind capacity milestone , and Marianne McCaffery , chief executive of RenewableUK , the trade association for the nation 's wind , wave and tidal industry , predicts that it will reach 8 GW by end 2012 . According to reports , the British public supports renewables despite some political opposition driven by a desire to protect the countryside from wind farm development , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which wind turbines were publicly demonized . <p> Brazil 's 362-MW Maua hydroelectric plant has been granted permission to operate more than a decade after a permit application was first submitted . The Maua hydropower project , owned by Brazilian consortium Energetico Cruzeiro do Sul , will be located on the Tibagi River in Parana state . Permitting of the US$600 million project was delayed due to requests from the Institute of the Environment and Natural Resources ( IBAMA ) , the federal public prosecutor 's office and the Instituto do Patrimonio Historico e Artistico Nacional ( Iphan ) for further impact studies.Parana 's environmental regulator , Environmental Institution of Parana ( IAP ) , says Energetico Cruzeiro do Sul must still complete a number of conditions to maintain the license , including monthly operational reports , analyses of wetland restoration efforts and a clear definition of the reservoir 's legal boundaries . <p> Private electricity producer Tower Power is scheduled to break new ground in Kenya next month when it starts construction of the country 's first commercial biomass power plant . Tower Power is owned by Industrial Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comcraft Group and Power gas International , a UK-based energy conglomerate . The new plant will be fed by the Prosopis Juliflora tree , popularly known as ' Mathenge , ' as the country moves towards adopting green and renewable energy solutions . The project is set to transform the tree from a noxious weed to a cash crop when about 2,000 households begin supplying the company with the tree stems . " Prosopis Juliflora produces good quality fuel of one of the highest recorded calorific values of about 500kcal/kg , which burns well even when freshly cut , " said , Tower Power agronomist Damaris Akoth . The firm intends to put up an 11.5 megawatts ( MW ) bio-fuel plant in Marigat , in Baringo County at a cost of US$21 million . The project has been sanctioned by the National Environment Management Authority . <p> As Romney and his Republican colleagues continue to push for fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy , even the Middle East is moving along on the latter . This week , Iraq announced it will invest in 400 megawatts of solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1.6 billion , according to Bloomberg . The government has invited 25 solar , wind and transmission developers to build projects there , including Japan 's Toyota Tsusho Corp , Swiss engineering group ABB and Egypt 's Orascom Construction . " It is true that we are an oil country but we should save oil for the coming generation not only sell it or burn it , " Laith al-Mamury , of Iraq 's Ministry of Electricity told Bloomberg . Still ravaged from the war , Iraq 's power grid desperately needs re-building . It has daily black-outs , only able to supply power for a few hours each day . <p> Iberdrola and Neoenergia , in which the Spanish group has a 39% stake , now have 10 wind farms in the construction phase in Brazil , with a total of 288MW of capacity . Calango consists of five wind farms of 30MW each , and is expected to become operational in late 2013 . The other five wind farms -- Mel 2 ( 20 MW ) and Arizona 1 ( 28 MW ) and the three-wind-farm Caetit complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced stage " of development , Iberdrola says . The turbines for all the wind farms are being supplied by Gamesa , which Iberdrola calls its " reference company in the world when it comes to supplying its renewable projects " . The machines are being built in Gamesa 's factory in Camaar , Baha state . <p> Hydropower in the Ivory Coast is getting a $556 million boost from China 's Export-Import Bank in the form of a 2 percent low interest loan towards the 275 megawatt Soubre hydro power station . Following years of political turmoil , the Ivory Coast is renewing long-neglected infrastructure and has plans to increase the country 's production capacity by 150 MW per year over the next decade . The government has promised to spend $500 million to renew the sector and is seeking additional financing . Despite the state of parts of its power system , the country still has reliable power supply and exports electricity to Ghana , Burkina Faso , Benin , Togo and Mali . <p> Generating electricity is a priority for many African governments , but the Royal Swaziland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an energy generating company by 2018 . The firm plans to first start by introducing a 30-MW power generation facility for the sugar mill which will help decrease imported power from 20 MW to 10 MW . RSSC Managing Director Nick Jackson said that these changes could make Swaziland could be the first country to generate power from renewable energy sources . <p> The State Grid Corp . of China ( SGCC ) and Nigerian partner Amperion Power Distribution Co . Ltd. won the bid for Geregu Power Generating Co. in Kogi State amid Nigeria trying to privatize its power sector . The companies won the 414 MW Geregu power station for $128.3 million although the actual bid falls below the reserve price of $132 million . SGCC is a 10-year old company which began as a pilot operation by China 's State Council . The firm 's focus is on building and operating power grids -- which is exactly what Nigeria needs ; however , underbidding could pose a problem down the line if operating costs exceed the allotted amount . <p> The lesser the infrastructure and the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African country will switch to renewable energy , and that is more the case in sub-Saharan Africa than in the north , according to a report released on Wednesday by the Joint Research Center , the EU 's scientific and technical research lab . While north African countries such as Algeria , Mauritania and Morocco have wind and solar energy potential , these ca n't compete with the particularly low fossil fuel prices there , according to the report , titled ' Renewable Energies in Africa . ' ' ' North Africa wo n't switch to renewable energies based on free market reliance alone , ' ' said report author Fabio Monforti-Ferrario . ' ' It 's cheaper for a north African rural community to use a diesel generator than it is for one in sub-Saharan Africa where traditional infrastructure is lacking and fuel prices are higher .

The study debunks previous assessments that suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's grid due to environmental and power output concerns . According to the University of Delaware 's Cristina Archer , about 4 million turbines could provide the world with 7.5 terawatts of energy annually , about half of the estimated power necessary to run earth 's power grids in 2030 . " We 've seen some papers out there that have been somewhat annoying or confusing because they had very low estimates of the total potential of wind energy , " Archer says . " We decided to run our own model and we found wind is very abundant -- we feel very strong these previous studies were incorrect . " <p> South Sudan 's electricity and dams minister David Deng Athorbe says the country is going ahead with some generation capacity projects , such as the US$100 million Fula dam in Nimule near the Ugandan border that will generate about 40 MW .

Energy harvesting can provide an emissions-free renewable power supply , harnessing solar , wind and thermal power to produce green energy . Ambient energy harvesting is primarily used when the installation and maintenance of application systems is problematic , due to the potential cost or practical difficulty of providing power or communication through the use of cables . Energy harvesting can be used almost anywhere , as , unlike batteries , no space is required , and there are no accessibility issues related to maintenance . <p> The Nyasa Times of Malawi reports that the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out any possibility that power supply will be normalised after the modernisation works of machine number 5 at Nkula B power station . Escom made clear that the upgrading of Nkula B station had nothing to do with reducing power blackouts across the country , as upgrading of the machine did not entail uprating it . Escom will still have a shortfall of 100 MW , and the country will continue to experience power rationing . Escom is currently supplying 286 MW countrywide which is 100 MW less than what is required to cater for both domestic and industrial purposes throughout the country . <p> It was an intriguing journey back to the physics class I left over ten years ago , as I embarked on making my solar lamp .

##1284350 <p> Despite growing up with hardships , Nantongo always reminds her children to be thankful for the gift of life and to have hope in the future . Johnson Mayamba NATION MEDIA GROUP <p> My name is Prossie Natongo , 40 years old , I stay in Upper Nabuuti , Central Division in Mukono Municipality of Uganda . I am self employed and have five children . I have six pigs and some chicken , which I rear to earn a living and raise my children . I have been a single mother since 2004 when my husband passed on . <p> In 2002 , my husband started falling sick often . It all started with a fever . Then , there was cough and loss of weight . It was late 2003 when a doctor suggested an HIV/Aids test . He did not want to take one neither I. After counselling , he tested . The results were positive . He was immediately put on ARVs . <p> From that time on , everyone who got to know that my husband was sick deserted him including his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run it because I was looking after my husband . When we ran out of money , we started using the things that were in our shop until nothing was left . We were forced to close it . <p> We started surviving on handouts from good Samaritans up to March 2004 when my husband died . Throughout this time , I was the only one who took care of him . I used to take him to the hospital where he used to get his medicine . <p> The day he died is still fresh in my memory . That day , I thought he was feeling better . We had a long chat and I went out of the house . I left him with our youngest child . When I came back , I called him but he did not respond . <p> Without saying any word , he then took a deep breath and collapsed as he tried to talk . I got closer to check if he was alive but it was too late . <p> Life after my husband 's death <p> I closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My little boy kept saying " My dad is going to play with me when he gets well " . Little did he know that his father was dead . I had no way to explain it to him . <p> With the little strength I had , I organised everything in the house before calling people to help me . I can not explain where I got the courage but I did it . The stigma we had gone through had brought us together that we did not mind what the world thought about us . When I wailed , it alerted neighbours who came to help me until the day of burial . <p> Life after the death of my husband was not easy . Our shop was no more and there were five children to take care of . The only pig that was there then was attacked by a disease and died . We survived on water because there was nothing for us to feed on . <p> In the second month , there were sympathisers who brought us food but this run out and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not easy to find . Almost every door I knocked on , was closed on me . <p> Tested positive <p> At Mukono Town Council , where they knew that my husband had died and I was unemployed , I was offered a job as a cleaner . Life was not a bed of roses for me . I was being paid Shs70,000 ( $27 ) per month . With that money , I had to feed the family , pay school fees and also complete the house that was incomplete by the time my husband fell sick . <p> The working conditions were difficult . There was no protection and yet where I was working was unhygienic . Some days I had to use my bare hands in trenches where there was sewage . I could not handle such a situation for long . I quit as I planned to look for something else to do . <p> As I looked for another job , I came across Mukono Aids Support Association ( Masa ) . One of the nurses asked whether I had tested for HIV . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . I refused because I did not want that to stress me . After counselling , I tested and was positive . <p> I was confused and depressed ; I even thought of committing suicide because I saw no future ahead . What helped me was that the counsellor kept in touch with me . As time went by , I changed my mind . I imagined leaving my children suffering without me . I took courage and accepted it . I joined the Masa choir which sensitises people about disease . Through that , my fear went and I took it as normal . <p> Getting pregnant <p> Masa supported me and the children with food until I was transferred to IDC at Mulago Hospital in 2009 where I go for treatment . I have been taking Septrin since I tested . Recently I was put on ARVs after the doctors realised I was pregnant . <p> After taking long without getting involved with another man , I decided to look out for someone who was ready to be with me . When I got him and explained my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not intended though it occurred . I wanted to abort but then I asked myself that what if I aborted and died in the process , who would be there for my children ? <p> I left it to grow and ensure that the baby is not infected . My other children were tested and they are all HIV negative . <p> There are some of the jobs I would have done to earn a living , but there is a lot of stigmatisation now that I am open with my status . I now concentrate on rearing pigs and chicken to get money to pay fees and feed the family . <p> When I fail to get the money , they stay at home and sometimes we go for days without eating . I can not steal to bring food on the table or get my children school fees . The man I got can not take care of everything . He is also struggling like we are . <p> Lessons for life <p> Sometimes when we really starve , we go to Uganda Christian University where we collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pigs . It is not easy to get that food but I do so through continuous pleas to the kitchen staff . I no longer buy pens and pencils . <p> My children usually pass through the university compound and collect pens and pencils that have been dropped . They also go to the dust bins where they pick whatever they can find . The process continues from term to term . The good thing is that they are all willing to study even with the very little support I give them . <p> I can not provide all the necessities they need but the little I get , I give them . I usually talk to them to give them hope . What is more important is that we have life . One thing that I have learnt over the years is that when you have HIV/Aids , it is not the end of the world . When you over think about it , you wear out quickly because it stresses you . <p> That is one thing that has kept me moving all this time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the doctors tell me , I follow . I have also kept myself in the company of people in the same situation which has given me hope to live on . When you find me in public , you can never tell that I am positive unless I or other people tell you . The best way to live on 
##1285652 <h> KENYA IS NOT DOING THAT BADLY IN CONSERVING WILDLIFE <p> If we are to go by the recent wildlife-related news headlines , we might easily conclude that Kenya 's fabled wildlife resource is being rapidly depleted . And from this it would be tempting to extrapolate that very soon we will read of the death of the last rhino or the last elephant living in the wild . <p> As it happens , nothing could be further from the truth . Kenya 's wild game populations may have suffered a catastrophic decline over the past 30 years or so : but that was more or less inevitable , given the steep rise in our human population , leading to a widespread human-wildlife conflict , which the wild animals were bound to lose . <p> And although it is quite common to see the nation 's wildlife written about in grandiose poetic terms ( " our priceless heritage " etc. ) if you want to understand what is happening to the wildlife populations , you have to abandon poetry and consider the issues in a cold , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alternative land use " to small scale farming or ranching ; the wild animals must be seen as a " natural resource " ; and the whole setup of wild animals and panoramic landscapes have to be considered as " environmental assets " . <p> Without such a perspective , it is impossible to have a serious discussion on the science and the economics underlying the existence of Kenya 's wildlife and game parks . <p> Now in Kenya , the continued survival of our wildlife is threatened by three factors , none of which yield to easy solutions : First is the rapid human population increase . It is true that our current average is about four children for every adult woman ( down from seven children per woman just two decades ) . But , for a country in which most people are still reliant on small-scale agriculture for their income , we are still too many people living on too little land . <p> The second threat is the general poverty of the rural population . And given that it is these rural places that the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually quite amazing that the levels of poaching are not higher than they presently are . Why would a poor man , whose family has a pretty good chance of going hungry on any given night , restrain himself from killing an antelope which would be , effectively , a week 's supply of free meat ? And why would not a group of villagers , if approached by a middle-man , not seek to bring down an elephant if they knew that this animal 's tusks would fetch them more money than their small farms can make them in a year ? <p> But the third , and comparatively new factor , is one which has proved to be the catalyst which combined with the other two , has led to the recent increase in poaching , specifically targeting rhinos and elephants . <p> This factor is the explosive increase in legitimate trade as well as travel , between Africa and the Far East , which is the key market for the illegal trade in rhino horns and elephant tusks . <p> Thus this increase in smuggling opportunities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this increase in trade and travel . Kenya Airways has long had flights to China , and a while back even introduced a large aeroplane dedicated to airfreight services on this very route . Korean Airlines has also recently made a grand entry into the market . <p> This illegal trade has thus effectively " piggybacked " on a positive economic development . <p> It 's in much the same way that you will find Kenyan students in jails all over the Far East , where they were arrested for drug trafficking . This followed directly from the realization by Kenyan parents that a first-class college education could be obtained in the Far East ( Malaysia , Singapore , etc. ) at far less cost than in the US or the UK , leading to an exponential increase in the number of Kenyans enrolling for studies in that part of the world . <p> In most cases , these were actually just ordinary Kenyans seeking an education . Many were not even from poor families by Kenyan standards . But then they yielded to the temptations posed by drug dealers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the day when they were arrested . <p> These factors combine to produce a situation in which the insatiable demand for illegal game trophies in the Far East creates an immense pressure on local poaching operators to supply this demand . <p> But the problem is not limited to East and Central Africa . <p> For many years , Kenyan tourism stakeholders , as much as Kenyan environmental conservationists , have used South Africa as a benchmark for their best practices . <p> There is good reason for this . While Kenya is only now heading towards 1.5 million visitors a year , South Africa , post-apartheid , has averaged 5 million tourists annually . <p> And those who are attentive to news about the latest happenings in wildlife circles will know that South Africa has donated dozens of rhinos to Kenya over the past several years , to help restore our massively depleted population of rhinos . <p> So it might come as a surprise to many readers to learn that South Africa is currently losing at least two rhinos every day to poachers -- and this , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa , the Kruger National Park , the South African Army has now been brought in to help fight the rampant poaching . <p> This year alone , South Africa has lost 250 rhinos to poaching . In 2011 , they lost 448 rhino to poachers . In comparison , Kenya lost 23 rhino last year , and has thus far only lost four rhino to poachers this year . <p> Bear it in mind that South Africa effectively accounts for half the wealth in sub-Saharan Africa . <p> What our Kenya Wildlife Service ( KWS ) has available by way of resources , is mere peanuts , compared to what South Africa National Parks ( SAN-Parks ) can mobilise . <p> And despite this , and even with the extreme measure of calling in the army , South Africa still continues to lose its rhinos at a devastating rate . <p> These figures put into perspective the pan-African nature of the illegal trade in game trophies , specifically the rhino horn and the elephant tusks which are greatly prized in the Far East . <p> With rhino horn having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per kilo ; and an adult rhino carrying roughly 7 kilos of horn on its head ; you could say that each adult rhino carries anything from Ksh30-40 million on its head . <p> This is far more than even the most audacious gangs of bank robbers manage to make off with , in a heist involving many people both inside and outside the bank . <p> Ivory is not quite as valuable ; but at a current historical high of $2,000 ( Ksh170,000 approx. ) a kilo , ivory poaching is an extremely lucrative business , if you can get your illegal store of ivory to the Far East . <p> So if we consider the comparative success in limiting the number of rhinos killed every year in Kenya ; and the fact that Kenya 's elephant population actually grows by about 1,000 elephants every year ( despite poaching ) ; we have to concede that KWS is actually doing a pretty good job in preserving Kenyan wildlife . <p> The question bound to arise then is , " What about all that ivory that was found a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mombasa ? And what about the equally big haul of ivory discovered in Sri Lanka , which had already escaped the surveillance of the KWS teams at the port of Mombasa ? " <p> Well , while undoubtedly some of that ivory has to be from Kenya . But by far the greater quantity of those ivory-bearing freight containers are actually from the Congo DRC , coming to Kenya via Uganda . <p> Unlike in Kenya where elephant populations are monitored by satellite tracking , the comparative lawlessness of eastern Congo DRC is the perfect environment for industrial-scale poaching . <p> It should be borne in mind that a lot of cargo to be moving through Kilindini port in Mombasa at any one time , is actually from Uganda , Rwanda and the Congo DRC , all of whom rely on the Kenyan port for their exports . <p> So whereas the casual newspaper reader might easily form an impression that Kenya 's elephant population is being decimated , the fact is that it is the Congo DRC -- which by some accounts has more elephants in its forests than all @ @ @ @ @ @

##1288650 <p> North Africa 's Security and Economic Co-operation Structure : A Review of the Maghreb Region <p> Senzo Ngubane <p> T his article offers a review and a critical appraisal of the economic and security apparatus created in North Africa as a way of collectively dealing with common challenges . Accordingly , the article looks at the Maghreb Region as one vehicle that was set up in 1989 by five North African states as a means to drive their efforts towards greater co-operation and unity . <p> Beginning with a short background to the region as a way of examining the reasons and the need for such a regional body , the article then provides an analysis of the functioning of the structure and the extent to which various challenges that emerged have prevented it from operating as a regional body . The article would make use of the contested territory of Western Sahara between Morocco and Polisario Front , as a case that has contributed to the challenges faced by the region . <p> North Africa and Regional Unity <p> The strategic relevance of the region lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphate , oil , and gas and it is a transit center to southern Europe.2 For instance , in 2001 Algeria 's oil production was estimated to have been 827,000 barrels per day and its key trading partners are most of the Western European countries.3 Economic prospects for the region are high and this is indicated , for instance , by the construction of a gas pipeline between the region and Europe . <p> The five African countries that are situated north of the Sahara , namely Algeria , Libya , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia , have for a very long time attempted to forge regional integration and co-operation . The attempts to forge regional unity dates back to the 1960s during the height of anti-colonial struggles and independence in Africa . From these early stages the first signs of an interest to forge regional integration occurred when the ministers of finance from Algeria , Morocco , Libya and Tunisia.4 The ministers met at a conference in which they endorsed the formation of the Conseil Permanent Consultativ du Maghreb ( CPCM ) that will incorporate the four states . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Draft plans for the region 's interaction with the rest of the world , especially the European Community.5 <p> The aforementioned attempt , however , did not manage to move beyond the conceptualisation stage as a result of , inter alia , the different political challenges that the each state was faced with at the time.6 The idea , however , did not perish and it was later on revived in the mid-1980s . It was during this time that the Heads of State from these countries gathered in 1988 where they mandated a commission to draft protocols and a treaty that would govern the functioning of a North African regional entity . Thus , in February 1989 , a co-operation treaty was signed during a summit held in Marrakech , Morocco , giving birth to the Maghreb Union made up of Morocco , Mauritania , Libya , Algeria and Tunisia . <p> The Arab Maghreb Union ( UMA ) <p> The Arab Maghreb Union ( UMA ) came into being during the time when the world was undergoing significant socio-political and economic changes . One of these was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere : the fall of communism . These transformations signified the alterations that were to take place in the world , especially when it comes to economic interactions and security co-operation among various countries . <p> The UMA enshrined within its objectives the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of its member states and its primary objectives were the following : <p> The establishment of common defence issues and security co-operation . <p> The promotion of trade through free movement of people , goods and services . <p> The establishment of a free-trade area for the region.7 <p> Since its inception the UMA has taken steps towards forging regional unity . For instance , several countries have entered into a number of bilateral agreements aimed at greater economic co-operation . Furthermore , since 1989 the regional structure came up with about fifteen various conventions covering issues of economic co-operation ; however , no meaningful attempts have been made to ensure that such conventions are implemented . <p> The inability to implement any of these agreements prompted the Ministers of Foreign Affairs from the five member countries to call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater regional unity . In reaching such a decision the ministers had hoped that the focus of the region would be on attempting to start to implement the already existing protocols that had been previously entered into . However , such a decision did not result in more co-ordinated efforts towards regional integration because within two years after it was made UMA ceased to function . <p> Challenges of Regional Integration <p> That regional economic integration is a process filled with a number of challenges and that issues of political differences have a bearing on how states relates to one another is reflected by the failure of UMA to achieve its objectives . <p> The last summit of this regional organisation was in 1995 ; it has failed to hold any summits since then . One of the main reasons why the union has failed to function relates to the political differences that have surfaced , mainly between Morocco and Algeria . Specifically , the differences relate to the varying approaches that both countries have chosen to adopt regarding the dispute over the territory of Western Sahara . At the roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Polisario Front over who between the two should assume rightful sovereignty of the Western Sahara territory , Morocco and Algeria stand on either side of the divide . <p> Morocco has been locked in a bitter small scale , albeit destructive , war with the Polisario Front over the control of Western Sahara . Since the resumption of hostilities in the 1970s , Algeria has always supported the Polisario Front and Algiers has offered all sort of assistance to the movement . For instance , the Sahrawi People Democratic Republic ( SADR ) government in exile is based in Algeria . Furthermore , Algeria is host to thousands of Western Saharan refugees based in Tindouf and most of whom have been in Algeria for almost two decades . <p> The conflicting views and the approach that both countries have regarding this conflict played themselves out at a regional level resulting in the failure of the Union to forge ahead with its plans for regional unity . At the last gathering of the Union , Morocco voiced its concerns over the continued support that Algeria has been giving to the Polisario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former called for the suspension of UMA activities . On the other hand , besides maintaining its support to the Polisario Front , Algiers has alleged that Morocco is harbouring radical Islamic rebels who are fighting against Algeria . <p> That the tension between the two countries had reached boiling point was reflected by a decision taken by Algeria to close down its border with Morocco.8 As the tension within the Union builds up , other issues started to emerge , driving the region further apart . For instance , when Morocco entered into bilateral agreements with the European Union ( EU ) , Algeria criticised the move on the basis that it was only going to benefit Morocco and not the whole region . This free trade agreement came into effect in December 1999 and , among other things , covers the free movement of goods over a period of twelve years . <p> As a result of this simmering tension , for a period of about five years there was no formal interaction among North Africa states at a regional level . An attempt was made to revive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met to try and iron out the existing differences within the Union and thereby revive it . The meeting , however , did not amount to anything since the differences between Morocco and Algeria soon re-surfaced and it had to be adjourned . <p> Historically , the question of Western Sahara has always appeared as one of the thorny issues that if resolved might lead to greater regional integration and , if not , is sure to result in tensions such as the one that currently exists . To be sure , this article is not arguing that this is the one and only problem facing the Union , but it is the main issue that has stalled its progress . The fact that Morocco ceased its membership to the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) in 1984 in protest against a decision by the other member states to recognise the SADR is an indication that the Union was faced with a complex problem . Therefore , the resolution of the tension between Algeria and Morocco at a regional level could have served as the building blocks for an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Conclusion <p> The above discussion somehow makes it difficult to reach any optimistic observations about the future of the UMA . That is , there has not been any signs that either of the parties ( Morocco and Algeria ) are interested ( at least not yet ) in shifting their positions when it comes to the issue of Western Sahara . An attempt was made in 1996 to search for common ground between these two states when Libya and Tunisia pledged to play role of " mediator " between the Morocco and Algeria.9 Libyan and Tunisian authorities saw the dispute over the territory of Western Sahara as the " direct cause " of the crisis within the Union and therefore addressing it was seen as going to yield positive result for the region.10 Such a situation deserves a cautious approach that could start with the intensification of regional efforts within North Africa to bridge the gap between these two countries , thus laying the basis for finding proper solutions to the Western Sahara situation . <p> Notes <p> 1 The author works for African Centre for the Constructive Resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed here are those of the author

##1289450 <p> Even as millions of hectares of tropical forest are lost each year and large numbers of reforestation efforts have failed , there are smallholder farmers in the world who , for years , have grown and managed their own trees on a sustainable basis . For those involved in community forestry , why farmers plant trees is every bit as important as why they do not . <p> This study by natural resource economist Peter A. Dewees of the Food Studies Group of Queen Elizabeth House , Oxford University , is the result of research which was undertaken to explore the rationale for smallholder tree growing in its historical and socio-cultural context in Kenya . Although much of the study focuses on tree-growing activities in Murang'a District in the Central Province in that country , many of the observations and conclusions are relevant to other parts of Kenya , and there are certainly parallels to other parts of Africa as well . <p> Both casual observation and land use inventories provide strong evidence that trees continue to have an important role as one smallholder land use option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , farmers grow trees to meet the demand for construction poles , charcoal and fuelwood , and in response to other market forces . Trees are also cultivated to demarcate boundaries or to shade crops such as tea or coffee . Tree cultivation , it would seem , which requires less labour and less capital investment than other types of crops , has emerged as an important income-producing land use option for the smallholder . <p> Still , there remains the question of why farmers maintain trees on land that could be used for the cultivation of other crops which could potentially generate a substantially higher income . Central to this discussion of tree planting in Kenya is the interlinkage of issues such as land tenure , capital accumulation and labour use . Several of the most common tree cultivation and management practices are the long-term outcome of these three closely related issues . Other practices have been adopted either as a result of relatively recent interventions , such as the introduction of black wattle during the first half of this century , or are due to the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study by examining some of the issues of relevance to planners and developers in their efforts to encourage farmers to grow more trees . First , he suggests that tree planting innovations must be placed in a context which takes into account local farmer ability and traditional knowledge . Second , it is important to recognize that tree growing is a viable option especially when labour and capital constraints limit agricultural development . And third , existing controls on tree cultivation and management must involve the local population and be more consistent . If farm production of trees is to be encouraged , farmers must be assured that they - rather than the Government or local administration - will reap the benefits . <p> The research for this study was supported with funds provided primarily by the Rockefeller Foundation through the Oxford Forestry Institute 's Smallholder Incentives for Tree Growing Research Project .

##1293650 <p> After having heard or read some 50 papers ( including 14 regional and sectorial reports ) the participants reached the following conclusions and recommendations . <h> 1 . Analysis of the present situation <p> Browse species play an important role in the extensive animal production systems of Mediterranean and inter-tropical Africa . The role varies from one ecological zone to the next , becoming greater as the zone becomes more arid . Likewise the fragility of browse ecosystems increases with the degree of aridity . <p> For several decades browse has been disappearing at an ever increasing pace , thus jeopardizing the future of animal production under the extensive systems of the arid , semi-arid and montane zones which contain over 60% of African livestock . <p> On the other hand , encroachment of undesirable woody plants sometimes constitutes a break on the animal production systems in the sub-humid and humid zones . <p> Regeneration of trees and shrubs thus appears to be a prerequisite to improving animal production systems in the arid , semi-arid and montane zones and to controlling erosion and expanding desert encroachment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camels , goats and many wild herbivores and it plays a vital role as a complementary source of proteins , minerals and vitamins for cattle and sheep during the dry seasons . <p> Furthermore , browse plays a specific role in the dynamics of African rangeland ecosystems because of its phenology and perenniality . It is also important in efforts to control erosion , maintain soil fertility , provide fuelwood , various craft items , pharmacopoeia and food for people . <p> Since time immemorial , herders , nomads and sedentarised farmers , as users of browse , have recognised its importance . Rural populations make great use of woody plants in their strategies of subsistence or market production , but in some cases overexploiting them to the point of destruction . Conversely , until recently , both scientists and technicians have underestimated the role of browse in animal production , as a result of difficulties in quantifying the primary production of browse and its use by livestock and wild animals . <p> Animal production specialists have , in the past , found it more important to study and improve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers ( goats and camels ) . <p> In the last century , traditional extensive animal production systems maintained an equilibrium with the environment , in keeping with the low human and animal population densities . <p> Progress in medical and veterinary skills during the last few decades , however , has led to a considerable increase in human and animal populations , thus upsetting the balance between supply and demand , and causing environmental degradation ( desertization ) . <p> This imbalance grows worse by the day and constitutes a very serious threat to extensive animal production systems in Africa . <p> It seems necessary to find a new equilibrium which , in many cases , requires regeneration of tree/shrub populations through appropriate management methods and the intensification of browse production , especially through plantation operations wherever they are technically possible , economically viable and socially acceptable . <p> Extensive animal production development projects generally have to cope with socio-economic constraints which are the result of the disruption of traditional socio-economic structures . This disruption causes situations of conflict among groups of herders on the one hand and between herders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong detrimental effect on resources management . It is often triggered by interventions ? of laudable intent ? but based on studies that do not give sufficient attention to socio-economic considerations . These interventions often seek to settle herders in unsuitable areas and integrate them into a trade economy . Moreover , traditional adaptive mechanisms are not tailored to cope with the demand resulting from the heavy population increase . The present situation will only improve if the socio-economic system is restructured for the purpose of improving the present management systems and imparting greater responsibility to the herders by having them participate more intimate in managing their lands . This entails developing management models that are better adapted to the new situation created by the pressure of population and the expectations of a higher standard of living . <h> 2 . Conclusions <p> On the basis of the above considerations , the symposium stressed : <p> The importance of implementing pastoral zone development strategies in the various African countries , based on an integrated ecological approach and aimed at ensuring rational use of natural resources and improving the standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmes that meet the socio-economic development requirements of the countries concerned and that are designed to overcome gaps in knowledge of the main fields related to the exploitation methods for the rational use of grazing lands especially those in which browse species are prevalent . <p> In order to achieve these objectives , the symposium participants concluded : <p> that it is necessary to identify a number of rangelands or pastoral ecosystems where browse is an integrated part of the system and to monitor the utilization of browse within these systems and to further study the structures and functioning of " grazed ecosystems " , stressing browse . <p> thorough analyses of animal production systems based on grazing lands which comprise various proportions of browse should be conducted ; these analyses should focus on technical , as well as institutional , legal and socio-economic aspects ; <p> it is proposed that management models of these rangelands or pastoral ecosystems should be constructed so that new techniques may be introduced in order to increase productivity thereby improving the living conditions for pastoralists , while conserving natural resources . <p> It is concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common and representative browse species found in the major ecological zones ; which are or might be , important in livestock and wildlife diets , with particular emphasis on : <p> the biology and physiology of these species ; <p> breeding and genetic improvement to prepare productive material , which are adapted to the climatic conditions in the main ecological zones ; <p> the dynamic relationships between browse and grasses ; <p> the demography and dynamics of browse ecosystems in the main ecological zones and under various exploitation systems ; <p> Comparing the performance of different domestic and wild herbivores that consume browse with a view to adapting herd structure and composition according to the type of vegetation available . Amongst the domestic animals , special attention should be given to camels and goats , which have been neglected in the past ; <p> Describing the influence of wild herbivores on various ecosystems and the role these animals can play in optimizing the use of available browse by diversifying the consumer resource base for animal protein production . <p> Studying the effects on agro-pastoral systems of integrating browse species and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encouraging research on methods to evaluate primary and secondary production and to monitor pastoral browse ecosystems ; <p> Assisting in defining and designing administrative measures and regulations for enforcing laws on rational rangeland management and protection with particular reference to non-destructive methods of chopping branches of browse trees . These methods should be included in pastoral and forestry codes . <p> More important emphasis should be put on curricula and training programmes in African countries for the management of grazing ecosystems including the role of browse in the equilibrium of those systems . <h> 3 . Recommendations <p> In order to ensure efficient implementation of the above conclusions the participants felt it was necessary to promote international cooperation in the field of browse and it uses . This cooperation should be channeled through a programme that brings together various national , bilateral and international development and research organizations . The following recommendations are therefore presented : <p> ILCA should play a leading role in ensuring the implementation of such a programme which should include : <p> early publication of the report of this symposium which should be broadly disseminated to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system open to all research and development organizations in Africa ; <p> publication of a periodical newsletter containing information on scheduled or ongoing development projects and research and rapid dissemination of the main results obtained. ; <p> establishment of a seed bank and exchange of genetic materials ; <p> production of browse-related research and development projects ; <p> introduction of a coordination mechanism designed to ensure rational distribution of research on improving the use of resources and to avoid duplication ; <p> ILCA serving as a catalyst by working with other national , bilateral and international research and development organisations such as FAO , UNESCO , CTFT , IBRD , IBAR , ICRAF , IEMVT , ODM , ORSTOM , USAID , IDRC , SIDA , CILSS , UNDP and others . <p> convening , on the initiative of ILCA , a meeting as early as 
##1294450 <h> SYRIA : Ten things to watch out for <p> Displaced people are living in schools and public buildings , like this training institute in Homs <p> DUBAI , 11 September 2012 ( IRIN ) - As the world focuses on daily fighting in Syria and the flight of refugees to neighbouring countries , the humanitarian situation inside Syria continues to be under-reported . Here are 10 pressing issues you may have missed : <p> School year at risk <p> About one million internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) are living in public buildings , mostly schools , meaning that thousands of children could be denied access to education when the school year starts . ( Classes were scheduled to start next week , but are likely to be delayed ) . An alternative solution for these IDPs has yet to be formalized , but options include moving the displaced to other public facilities such as sports venues or youth camps , or adopting double-shifts in schools such that some schools can continue to serve as shelters . A ministerial committee has recently been formed to follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be voluntary . <p> Shortage of medicines <p> Syria is experiencing severe shortages of medicines and pharmaceutical products . It used to be nearly self-sufficient in medicine production , but the destruction of pharmaceutical plants and storage facilities , particularly in Aleppo , has left gaps . Patients with hepatitis , diabetes and cancer who need drugs on a daily basis are in particular need . Meanwhile , the number of people severely injured and in need of medical care is increasing as the death toll mounts . Access to health facilities has become difficult or impossible in some areas due to violence , checkpoints and fuel shortages . Opposition supporters often do not trust government hospitals for fear of being picked up by police ; and many health staff are not reporting for work . <p> Amid rising food insecurity , bread queues are being targeted , according to rights groups . An early September bulletin by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says civilians appear to have been targeted while seeking food and other essentials or trying to evacuate the wounded . Human Rights Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 10 bakeries in Aleppo in recent weeks . Overall , food insecurity in Syria has worsened to the extent that three million people need food assistance , according to the UN and the Syrian government . <p> Winter approaching A further deterioration of the humanitarian situation is looming as winter approaches . Syrian winters can bring near-zero temperatures and cold winds , and aid workers are concerned the displaced will not be able to cope without adequate preparations . But with few resources and constant new waves of violence , many aid agencies can not afford to think that far ahead . " Winter could be quite severe in Syria , " UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator Radhouane Nouicer told IRIN . " With the crisis in terms of fuel , and the lack of sanitation and water and heating systems , the winter might become a bit of a tragedy for many Syrians , unfortunately . " <p> Unemployment skyrocketing <p> In some parts of the country , unemployment has more than quadrupled , according to government statistics from last December . The national unemployment rate rose from 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit was the northeast of the country : in Ar-Raqqah Governorate , unemployment rose from 7 to 22 percent , an increase of 222 percent ; in Hassakah , from 15 to 39 percent ; in Deir-ez-Zor from 13 to 24 percent ; and in Homs from 7 to 17 percent . Aid workers say the numbers are likely to increase further as economic sanctions bite and violence disrupts normal life . <p> Funding neglects key sectors <p> While funding for the humanitarian response in Syria is low overall , certain sectors have been almost entirely neglected . For example , while coordination costs are more than 100 percent funded , and food costs are nearly half funded ; water and sanitation costs have received only 12 percent of requested funding . " There 's a big concern within the UN about the problems that might come from lack of clean or adequate water , " Paul Stromberg , deputy representative of the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) in Syria , told IRIN in July . " In summer , in many areas , it is 37-40 degrees . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate sanitation , that 's an issue that will create a number of knock-on problems in the heat . " Already , Aleppo has seen cases of scabies and lice ; while cases of diarrhoea have been reported in Homs and Rural Damascus . <p> As violence and chaos spread , extortionist kidnappings are on the rise . Sectarian and politically motivated kidnappings have been well-documented , but according to residents of different Syrian cities , kidnappings increasingly appear to be carried out solely for the purpose of extorting ransom or settling personal scores , with for-profit criminal behaviour becoming pervasive in some badly policed areas . Often , financial , political and private motivations for kidnapping intersect . " These days , everybody is at the risk of being kidnapped on the streets , " Rami , a resident of Damascus , told IRIN . <p> Non-Arab refugees <p> Syria has long hosted more than one million Iraqi refugees and half a million Palestinian refugees . Lesser known are thousands of non-Arab refugees who have sought refuge there . In Damascus , refugees from Afghanistan , Sudan and Somalia who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other locations by the end of August , according to UNHCR . These refugees have limited resources to find alternative shelter , and are particularly vulnerable , although UNHCR has distributed some grants for rental accommodation . <p> Fewer places of refuge <p> The worsening conditions and deepening violence in Syria are making it increasingly difficult for displaced civilians to find refuge . More and more villages are empty or destroyed ; space in public buildings is becoming limited ; and host communities have less capacity to take in guests . Syrian activists also accuse the government of punitive house demolitions or arson . As frontlines multiply , displacement has become more chaotic : families often have to flee violence for the second or the third time , and compete for shelter . <p> Kidnappings of Iraqi refugees <p> Instability in Syria has allowed Iraqis to try to settle old scores with fellow nationals that had taken refuge next door in Syria , with a series of kidnappings occurring in recent months , according to a UNHCR official , particularly in Sayeda Zeinab District of 
##1294451 <h> LEBANON : Refugee hosts feeling the pinch <p> BEIRUT , 12 September 2012 ( IRIN ) - Fewer tourists , lower levels of investment by Gulf states and reduced opportunities for cross-border trade with Syria are adversely affecting Lebanon 's most vulnerable people , including the hosts of many of the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees . <p> Most of the refugees in Lebanon are hosted by private families in areas near the Syrian border in the north and in the Beqa'a Valley . <p> An as yet unpublished study by the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) seen by IRIN , says this is putting a considerable economic strain on Lebanese hosts in areas which were among the country 's poorest even before the refugee influx . <p> According to the study , 69 percent of 300 surveyed households in the north , and 66 percent in the Beqa'a Valley , said they were hosting refugees . <p> While in the north many hosted relatives for no rent , in the Beqa'a 82 percent of households received at least some rental income . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( five in the Beqa'a ) ; 33 percent of the respondents in the north have provided refuge for over a year now . Many of the refugees are women and children and economically dependent on their hosts . <p> The study also said 96.5 percent of the hosting families in the north said they felt burdened having to host refugees . The same applied to 43 percent of hosts in the Beqa'a where most refugees arrived four months ago . While some of the refugees have sufficient resources to rent their own apartments in cities , many poorer people have no choice but to stay in the border communities . <p> More than half of the surveyed households in the north told UNDP that their expenses had risen over 30 percent in the last year . <p> The influx of foreign money might have made things worse . With many aid organizations active in the border communities and some of them providing cash hand-outs to refugees , local inflation has increased , said the UNDP study . In the north , medicine prices have risen by 34 percent and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Beqa'a food prices rose by 18 percent , education by 35 percent , and transport by 40 percent . <p> In the border areas , the Lebanese and the Syrian economy used to be highly interconnected . Many services that were cheaper on the Syrian side of the border , such as medical treatment and education , are no longer accessible to the Lebanese . <p> Smuggling restricted <p> The conflict in Syria has also affected cross-border trade . Smuggling , which used to be a major source of income for many , has become almost impossible . On the Syrian side the formerly porous border is now mined and more carefully guarded and even if people manage to cross , things like petrol and diesel , which used to be much cheaper in Syria , are now in short supply . <p> Hassan a former smuggler whom IRIN met at a refugee registration site in Wadi Khaled , near the border in the north , said : " We can not go over the border any more , it 's too dangerous . I used to smuggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ninety-one percent of all respondents in the UNDP study in the Beqa'a reported a cut in income since the border became difficult to cross after March 2011 . The same was true for 89 percent in the north . <p> Finding work has also become more difficult , with stiff competition for low paid jobs from Syrian workers , who have been coming to Lebanon for decades to find employment . <p> Exports of farm produce , which many of Lebanon 's poor farmers relied on for an income , have also been hit . Mirna Sabbagh from the UNDP Crisis Prevention Unit told IRIN : " Many of the agricultural exports went through Syria to Iraq or Jordan . The situation is now heavily influencing the agricultural sector 
##1294452 <p> " The absence of refugee law in Thailand unfairly exposes refugees and asylum seekers to abuses including exploitation , extortion , arrest , and detention , " said Bill Frelick , Human Rights Watch 's ( HRW ) refugee programme director and author of a new report released on 13 September . <p> While 85,977 verified refugees and 966 asylum seekers currently reside in the country , according to the latest estimates from the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) , Thai legislation does not include any protection provisions for refugees . <p> " Refugees are seen as illegal migrants outside of the camps , and inside the camps they are vulnerable to social problems arising from lack of employment . Neither model is adequate , " said Oliver White , communications and advocacy officer for the Jesuit Refugee Service , an international Catholic NGO . <p> Burmese refugees are legally permitted to stay in the kingdom only if they stay in the nine camps along the 1,800km Thai-Burmese border . <p> But lack of access to livelihoods often forces breadwinners to leave settlements during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deportation , activists say . <p> Urban refugees <p> The estimated 2,000 urban refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok can be detained by police and returned to their country of origin at any moment , even if they are UNHCR recognized refugees and scheduled for resettlement . <p> " All groups are vulnerable to deportation , but particularly those from neighbouring countries , " said Michael Timmins , a lawyer from Asylum Access Thailand . <p> Currently there are 68 refugees and asylum seekers at Bangkok 's Immigration Detention Centre , including 22 verified refugees and 15 children under the age of 18 , according to HRW and JRS . <p> " We continue to advocate with the government to end its policy of detaining refugees and asylum seekers , especially children , " Vivian Tan , spokesperson for the UNHCR in Bangkok , told IRIN . <p> Additionally , it is believed many ethnic groups are denied refugee status for political reasons , including the Lao Hmong , the Rohingya from Myanmar 's northern Rakhine state , North Koreans , and the Shan people from southern Myanmar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal obligations , but by political motives , " says Phil Robertson , deputy director of HRW 's Asia division . <p> Taking responsibility for refugees has , until now , been considered the responsibility of the international community , according to Veerawit Tianchainan , the executive director of the Thai Committee for Refugees , a national NGO supporting refugees . <p> " Advocacy needs to change the premise that refugee issues are an international issue , " said Tianchainan , who added that national security trumps human rights principles in the case of refugees . <p> Thailand has not created a framework to protect refugees because " policymakers never expected refugee situations to last this long , " Tianchainan explained . <p> " We are in no hurry " - Thai government <p> Meanwhile , despite reform efforts inside Myanmar , the Thai government continues to respect the stay of encamped Burmese refugees inside the country until they are ready for return . <p> " We are in no hurry to rush this matter , " said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an open letter to HRW . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration for encamped Burmese babies - " an important step to prevent statelessness among a new generation of refugees , " said Tan . <p> Fast-track processing of encamped refugees initiated earlier this year has also allowed several thousand to re-unite with their resettled families in countries such as Canada , the USA , and Australia . <p> However , this is just " a small slice compared to the more than 50,000 unregistered who remain in the camps , " said Frelick . <p> It also does little to help refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok . <p> " Even if Thailand is not ready to sign the 1951 Refugee Convention , the government should consider steps that will enable it to 
##1299151 <p> Tarabu Music is a fusion of Swahili tunes sung in rhythmic poem spiced with Arabic or at times Indian melodies. wherever the Swahili speaking people travelled . Tarabu culture moved with them . No wonder it has penetrated to as far as Uganda . Rwanda and Burundi in the interior of East Africa . In the Persian Gulf , Dubai and Muscat play host to many groups of Tarabu who perform in these capitals frequently . <p> Traditionally , Tarabu used to be performed at weddings and social gatherings like circumcision rites for infant boys or during the attainment of maiden hood for girls or during Eid celebrations . In recent times , politicians have taken advantage of Tarabu 's popularity among the masses to effectively use it as a tool for political campaigning . <p> The Swahili language which is a medium for Tarabu poetic singing has two equally important roots , Arabic and Eastern Bantu Langauge . The Swahilis have made a strongly individual culture out of other people . Tarabu reflects the cosmopolitan qualities of a multiracial people . It is different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stage , its melody lines are long and the vocal style is like Arab or at times Indian singing . An American Tarabu researcher , John S. Roberts in his commentary on original music summed up this way " Like most complex and living things , in fact , Tarabu refuses to be thrust into neat bags . It is an extremely lively art form springs from a classical culture , still immensely popular drawing all the time from old and new sources , a major part of social life of the Swahili people " . <p> In the Nineteen Thirties and Forties , the instruments mainly used , were Arab oud or Udi in Swahili , which is a form of lute , the Darbuk , a pottery drum with a leather head , Gannon , a Middle Eastern Zither , Fiddle , Tambourine and Rattle . Nowadays although the basic singing style is still the same , there is much more flexibility and variety than there ever was . New instruments have been introduced , Violin , Guitar , Accordion , keyboard and drums . <p> Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mainland Tanzania has taken the lead in Tarab organisational skills and presentation closely followed by Dares-salaam and Mombasa on the Kenyan Coast respectively . <p> The most dynamic and famous Tarabu singer of our time this century , was the late Sitti Bint Saad of Zanzibar who traversed the length and width of East Africa in thirties and forties entertaining dignitaries and ordinary folks alike . She even visited Bombay the then capital of India for recording as such facilities were non-existent in Africa South of the Sahara . Her voice has come to symbolize the very essence of Swahili Music . Her voice has enriched people 's lives ennobled them with the truth and beauty.During her time , Sitti was compared to the legendary Egyptian singer the late Ummu Kulthoum or Lata mangeshkar of India . <p> In the late fifties another singer who went on to capture the hearts of coastal people in East Africa and beyond was Ustadh Bakari Abeid a Zanzibar and Ustadh Ali Mkali of Mombasa , Kenya .

He leads a high ly cultured and reputable orchestra lkhwan Saffa established in 1905 in Zanzibar <p> International Connection Local artists who had acquired international recognition and made in roads in Tarabu Music in the Arabian Gulf in recent years and made a great impact there , among others , is the sensational Tanzania singer Asya EI-kindy based in Oman a bilingual who is eloquent in both Kiswahili and Arabic singing . There was also Ustadh Ali-Wa-Leila the gifted Oud guitarist who left Mombasa for the United Arab Emirates in the early sixties after an invitation . It should also be noted that Ustadh Zein-EI- Abideen , currently , arguably the best oud player in East Africa and respected even beyond African shores , acquired his skills through Wa-Leila 's tutelage .

##1299152 <p> This story goes back to the days of Mombasa Polytechnic . As I was watching the NFL -American football- I saw some of those mascots running from one direction to the other , either entertaining the audience or basically putting some spells to the effect that the supporters of the other team will end up supporting theirs . You may be wondering how come it never worked . Well , maybe they go to the same mganga or the prescription to make the uganga effective was the same ; hence we never saw the effect of the uganga . Most of the time- so I was told- the prescription runs to the effect of possessing a red chicken that needs to be sacrificed and then its blood is to be massaged on every players ' shoes . In case the team needs the win so badly , then they may need to go to the next level , and that is rub down the chicken 's blood on some ' clean player ' . The ' clean player ' may then be advised to sleep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow beard , ( here in North America , it could be with the cows rather than the goats ) . Mind you a " clean player ' would mean someone who is well behaved , cultured and does not go around throwing his seeds on every land he comes across . I am sure you get my grip . Now back to Mombasa . <p> The Mombasa Polytechnic had , traditionally , had an annual soccer competition among the different departments . Our department was known as The Department of Mathematics and Applied Sciences . It had the youngest students , ( We came to loose this privilege to the Business Department when many students from the island who finished O or A level started to take courses in Accounting and DBA Diploma in Business Administration , among other things . Anyway that is beside the point . In the year that we were in form six , we were told that the tournament had started and we had to form a team to play the second best team in the Polytechnic , and that would be ; The Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was totally put on the shoulders of the A-level players , as the students from other Diploma courses were either old or did not know how to kick the ball . They did promise one thing though ; that they would give us their full support . They promised that they would scream , shout , shriek , screech , howl , bowl and yell as loud as their lungs and throats could allow . As , to whose benefit , that was never mentioned . I was worried about this as some of them were chain smokers and I was wondering how would they do it . Nevertheless , we formed a team . The team was formed while we were having our afternoon tea in the cafeteria , few minutes before the game was to start . Among the players , from the coast were me , Fayadh , Ali Albaity , Suleiman Lenzo and Abdulbasit Hadi . Do n't be fooled into thinking that " Wow ! , this must have been the best team ever in the history of the department " , because that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth of the matter was , apart from Fayadh , and I who had been practicing with Ngome and Dudu Baya Football Clubs respectfully , the others hardly had time to kick the ball around . We never despaired , we believed that , the so-called players physical presence , and the fact that people feared to confront Albaity verbally , not to mention the fearful look of some of the players in our team , was enough to be to our advantage . Ooh Lord ! How wrong were we proved ? We did not know what was coming . <p> When the game started we realized that we did not have a goalkeeper . We therefore pulled one student from the audience ( from our department of course ) and told him to keep the goal . He must have misunderstood the meaning of keeping the goal , for he did not stop even one kick . He must have thought , and this I was convinced , keeping the goal was to make sure that the ball hits the net . This made Lenzo very angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the goalkeeper . He chased the designated buffoon and therefore decided to stay as the goalkeeper . " Toka nyangau wewe " he said , " Si afadhali basi uletewe chai na keki ukae vizuri hapa. ' he continued . <p> When the opposing team decided to kick the ball towards the goal , they were surprised , for once , to face some resistance from the likes of Lenzo . Unfortunately for us but fortunately for the opposing team , Lenzo forgot to remove his jersey , hence his holding the ball with his hand led to penalty , which we lost . Mind you at this time Fayadh and I were totally exhausted , for we had been running up and down . I turned to the right to see Albaity , and asked , ' Vipi ? ! ' ' Mimi nnae huyu ng'ombe , hanibanduki hata kwa nini . Mimi na yeye mpaka mwisho. ' replied Albaity , whose name had been baptized in class to read " I 'LL BUY TEA " while mine became " NEW WAY SIR " Nevertheless we were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> Prrr , the whistle was heard . We had to make some alterations . Some of our players had voluntarily decided to hang their boots , before the end of the game . Albaity was one of them . I do n't blame him anyway . He was totally roasted . We decided to play with less than eleven players despite the fact that we were seven down .

##1827250 <h> Search <p> Yesterday I was talking to babe and I told him that before we decide on a vendor , we both have to sit down with them , ask them questions and if we are satisfied with them , then we go with them . <p> This will be my motto . Granted , it will take a longer time to decide on vendors but I just do not want to accept mediocrity . Being online has taught me one thing , as a country , we are BEHIND when it comes to wedding services . If you look at something that has been done in the states , words such as " elegant " and " classy " come to mind . If you look at the FEW vendors who have websites you start thinking " overdone " and " tacky " especially flowers ... its like a disease ! . <p> Take photographers for example . We keep seeing POORLY done pictures . TOO much editing . A wedding is not the same as doing studio/portrait pictures and someone needs to tell this people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed pictures but for the most part , wedding photography will have to be spontaneous and quick . NO time for people to stop so you can click ! Its all about the " moments " and not poses . And that 's why I will continue to give props to Emmanuel Jambo . Granted , I have seen better photography than his online mostly American photographers but I have yet to see a Kenyan Photographer who captures moments like he does . Too bad I ca n't afford him . <p> This is why I keep telling babes that our search for a photographer will be the hardest work we will have to do because we will need someone whose prices are reasonable while at the same time someone who is flexible and ready to listen to instructions . Also , we will keep away from those who ca n't seem to stay away from photoshop . We do understand the need for editing pictures but some of what is being done now , it just a tad bit ridiculous ! Truth be told , in my viewing of wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will show the photographer . He/She better BRING IT ! <p> To add onto this , I got a list of questions to ask the photographer . You may call me a bridezilla but 10 years from now when I am showing my daughter these pictures , I do not want to have bile in my throat at the way some photographer did an abysmal job ! <p> In other news , I have secured ONE vendor ! Entertainment and Public Address System . DONE ! And below the budget we had for it ! Yay ! <p> Ok , so I went flower shopping this past Saturday . I visited " Sixth Sense " at Capital Center/Centre , Mombasa Road . <p> Let me tell you something , the internet is a LIAR ! I had the basic idea of the bouquets the bridesmaids and I would carry . I even had the names of the particular flowers . I landed there , and no one knew what a spider mum was . AS IN , how disappointed was I ? Granted its the first florist I have visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REAL . And then , having flowers that are in season . <p> I do not want Roses to feature in my wedding unless I reach the point where I do not care and just want to get over and done with it ! <p> I am tired of planning this wedding already . LOL . Maybe because I am already sorted with church and therefore the only thing left is the reception . I am not a fan of receptions , my own included . I think church is just what makes the wedding . MY OPINION again . So now , we do not have a reception venue , photographer , videographer , florist , tents and decor , cards and other stationery and I do not have a dress . <p> I 'm not worried though . Although the whole **25;2615;TOOLONG thing is really a thorn in my side . <p> I ca n't even being to explain how its hard to find a photography who does decent work at a decent price . I had emailed and talked to one , whose work I liked based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me LAST WEEK but nothing yet . I just ca n't deal with that . Lack of professionalism if I was asked . <p> We are currently looking at other photographers and in the process , we have learnt something about MANY of the photographers in this land of ours . They love OVER EDITING pictures . Honestly , by the time they have done their photoshop , the pictures just look fake . As my friend said , <p> " I will pay for great artistic shots not some kid with an overgrown point-and-shoot camera and a Macbook on steroids " <p> This is basically our motto when it comes to pictures . Lets keep it natural and stop with the blurring and the other unnecessary edits . <p> You ca n't force art and photography is an art ! -- in case you had forgotten . <p> I really should have done this post earlier . Well , its never too late to help . <p> We honestly believed that a budget was one of the things to do right in the beginning before beginning the planning because let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find yourself spending ridiculous amounts of money on 6 hours of your life 1 &; 1/2 for the church and 4 hours for the reception . <p> There was an edition of Raspberry Weddings where Hope Mwinzi discussed how to allocate your budget and we found it quite helpful . For sure , the largest expense will be on the food . <p> Before reality hit me , I wanted to have the wedding in a hotel ballroom . We visited Intercontinental , Crowne Plaza , Safari Park , Grand Regency and Panafric . Working with a guest list of 300 people , the least to be spent was going to be Kshs 1,850 per plate . That is already half a million people ! Well , the folks were n't feeling that whole 300 people so the guest list increased to 500 and we moved to garden weddings . FYI : The Ball Rooms in this country are SMALL . On average they can hold 400 guests seated restaurant style like you would have it any other way . <p> Anywho , back to the matter at hand . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend . Then we decided on how to allocate of course giving the most towards food . There are things such as transport which I refuse to spend money on . Kshs 30,000 a day to rent out the Chryslers from Tribe Hotel ? We think not . Let that money go to my honeymoon . Or even those limos or the vintage cars . Really , we do not care about the cars . Whatever we can get from family and friends will suffice . <p> Flowers -- Maybe I have not mentioned this but I am not a fan of flowers as decor . In all honesty , I just think they are a waste of money in a wedding . THIS IS JUST MY OPINION PEOPLE ! Anyway , I have heard people paying over Kshs 100,000 for flowers which have wilted before the reception has even started . Especially roses . And the florists ? Just thieves . A rose is like 10 bob . You will see them doing a bridal bouquet with 12 roses and charging Kshs 3,000 for it . Honestly ! Vendors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why though .... How come vendors have been able to get away with this day light robbery and at the same time do such substandard work ? I honestly do n't get it truth be told . This is a post for another day . <p> All in all , budgets are very important and helpful . We are trying to stick to the budget but are not planning to sacrifice quality to achieve this . <p> For those who were not aware , Raspberry Weddings was having " The Weddings Great Gown Sale " at the Hilton Hotel Ballroom where various vendors were having gowns on Sale . These gowns were going for as low as Kshs 15,000 . I must say however that there was nothing " great " about the sale since there were very few vendors with little variety but I must say it really helped me visualise the dress I would finally buy . <p> When I began shopping online for dresses , I wanted a Mediterranean style wedding dress . I was totally against any other style of dress . Let me just tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't work for me AT ALL . What I ended up looking nice in was not something I had ever remotely envisioned myself wearing . <p> I also visited " House of Brides " - CBD on Standard Street and " Malaika Brides " -- Yaya Center and I must say that although Malaika Brides had a very nice and comfortable dressing room , I preferred the selection at House of Brides . <p> I have yet to find THE DRESS but I now know that this is indeed possible . <p> For those who do not know PMCC is Pre Marital Counselling Class as acronymed by Nairobi Chapel . <p> We are not doing our PMC classes at Chapel . As I have stated before , I am too Presybyterian to do it any other way . So our classes shall be facilitated by the pastor officiating our wedding . <p> When I had first gone to see the moderator of my church earlier in the year , he told me the PMC classes would start in January 2011 . I felt that was too far off . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We confirmed that the wedding will be at 10 am . He told us that we would have to do our PMCC with our pastor -- who does nt reside at my church . I was very happy about this because this at least meant we could negotiate with the pastor to start earlier than the January that we had first thought . <p> We still do n't know when the classes will start ( hopefully soon ) and I 'm actually excited about them . <p> I wonder , how many brides out there would consider not using a vendor because someone close to you had a bad experience with them ? ? <p> Personally , I believe in the " good word " . If I decide to use a vendor , I have to poll people who have used their services before making my final decision . <p> Like House in Bloom for example . My aunt told me that they did a very shoddy job for her . That right there , removed them in the running to provide tents and decor for our wedding . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just for bargaining purposes . <p> I have received quotes from the following vendors as well : <p> 1 . Reenaul Events -- I liked their quote I must say and they seem professional . I still need to visit them and see their book and maybe go for a wedding that they have done tents for . <p> 2 . Events by Kui -- She did the tents for the wedding that I spoke about in the previous post . Her quote was also reasonable so she is still in the running . <p> 3 . Goldwings -- I am not a fan of theirs since I went for a wedding in August which they did and I just was not feeling their work at all . However , their quote is the cheapest that I have gotten so far . <p> Does anyone know someone else I can get a quote from ? ? ? I am not going to use Chairmania just because I think they are ridiculously pricey . <p> Another thing to note is that these tent providers also do the decor for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my flowers from the same person doing my decor . Reason being : 1 . I am not a fan of roses and all they do is roses . 2 . They are not professional florists and therefore prone to subpar work from experience . Honestly speaking , I would rather just go with a florists . I am a big believer in " Do n't put all your eggs in one basket " . <p> Something else to note is the contract that you sign with these vendors . All the quotes I have received have some form of " terms and conditions " as follows : <p> 50% for booking , full payment before delivery . <p> The client agrees to safe guard the equipment and be solely responsible for any loss or damage of the same that may occur at the client 's premises . <p> The clients by signature of this agreement indemnifies providers name it 's successors , heirs or assigns from all and any claim arising out of ; loss , injury , damage or any claim arising out of the use of this equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise as result of this agreement . <p> It is understood and agreed that providers name has no obligation to provide/deliver equipment until the full payment has been made , notwithstanding a booking having been made . <p> Now , I am a firm believer in contracts . However , all contracts have to be customised to suit each particular situation . Do not feel the need to be cornered to a particular contract . STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS .... and remember to demand quality . After all , you are paying for it ! <p> Because I feel like nothing is being done . I feel like if I atleast have ONE vendor confirmed for the wedding , I will have made some progress . So far , nothing . I have even not blogged in so long . I had to go for an out of town training . I feel as though I need 8 months off to work on preparing for this wedding as well as my honeymoon ! Urgh ! <p> However , I must say that finally , I gave hubby his engagement gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the go to gift for their men but he has too many watches and he is kinda obsessed with them . I was fearful I was not going to get him something he would like . <p> Yaani , there is a way I am already tired of looking for a venue . Granted , we havent looked at many but the ones we have looked at , only 2 are even remotely potentially viable . <p> The following places have ceased to lease/rent out their grounds : <p> Marula Manor <p> Jaffery 's -- They only lease out a small garden on the school side and then you have a limit on how loud your speakers can be , so really , whats the point ? <p> Kenya Institute of Administration -- Which is a shame since the grounds are pretty fantastic -- Maybe they want to keep them that way <p> The following venues would n't work for us <p> Zen Garden -- They can only hold 300 people maximum we are looking at 500 people . Note that they charge for the grounds and the price per plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion to charge for the grounds if you are going to charge that much per plate . <p> Sky Blue Gardens - It is somewhere in Karen and let me just say that the grass is just NOT the business . You know how you can walk into a venue and go WOW ... yeah , that will NOT happen . I can assure you of that story . <p> So we still have many more to check out , Karen Blixen and the like . I 'm not looking forward to it because truth be told , I do n't care for reception part of the wedding but since it is OUR wedding , I have to put some effort ! <p> Babe and I were part of a wedding this past weekend . We had decided not to start on planning our wedding as such until after this particular wedding ... NOW IT 'S TIME ! <p> Congratulations to the new couple ! <p> Can I say that the wedding went on FANTASTICALLY ? ! ? ! They had their own vows which made me ALMOST tear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading , my heart swelled with pride .... Small Thrills , I know ! <p> Anyway , now its down to the wire ..... Since I am working , I ca n't just be thinking about the wedding but when I google something and I see interesting ideas , I 
##1827251 <h> Search <p> But before I get into that story , I have to say that its so nice to meet someone who says they read my blog and I need to update it . Sweet ! ! ! <p> Anyway , let me just tell you brides out there , if you are looking for a wedding dress , you HAVE to go to Next Boutique . I am not being paid to say this but I totally dig the customer service in that place . I went in and the dresses were already waiting for me . Remember the previous dress that I had liked , well , it was still there . I tried on the new stuff and the FIRST one was GORGEOUS ! Its really insanely pretty ! I ca n't wait to wear it ! Only mother dearest and I were at the place so no one else has seen the dress . I need to lose like 2 more kilos or so for it to fit PERFECTLY ! <p> Can I just brag that I have lost 6 six kilos since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . <p> Mother dearest also ended up getting her outfit for the day and I also got a black dress for another occassion . Which reminds me , mother wants me to wear a long dress for the evening party . SO NOT HAPPENING ! <p> I am so looking for something short and flirty and BRIGHT ! ! think yellow and red <p> In other news , nothing annoys me more than vendors who do n't respond to email or phone calls . This is what has made my search for a tent person so hard . WHY DOES CHAIRMANIA HAVE TO BE SO EXPENSIVE 
##1830352 <p> That the Northern Irishman 's immediate reaction to the Swiss side 's third goal of the night was to throw Jonjo Shelvey into the breach said much about the esteem in which the midfielder is currently held at Anfield . <p> Though the 20-year-old could claim no part in the Sebastian Coates header which came just a minute after his introduction , the two goals which followed ensured his name was etched twice on the scoresheet and that Liverpool took the three points . A 5-3 scoreline may have flattered the Reds , but the three-goal turnaround which Shelvey 's arrival catalysed was an entirely accurate depiction of his influence . <p> SHELVEY 'S KEY MATCH EVENTS <p> 88 ' <p> GOAL ! A thumping strike seals win <p> 76 ' <p> GOAL ! Sweeps home to make it 4-3 <p> 67 ' <p> Replaces Oussama Assaidi <p> PLAYER RATING <p> Continued his brilliant start to the season by scoring twice in a 25-minute substitute appearance to seal the win for the Reds <p> The Romford-born midfielder did not just take his goals well ; he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sorely lacking in a topsy-turvy game . In fact , it was a performance reminiscent of another in Europe 's second-tier competition witnessed by Reds fans just two years ago . <p> At Anfield in November 2010 , the Merseysiders trailed 1-0 to Napoli and looked certain to be heading to yet another defeat under a hapless Roy Hodgson . Half-time substitute Steven Gerrard had other ideas though and , three goals later , had sealed the points for his side following an untouchable goalscoring cameo . <p> Of course Shelvey may have scored less in his short appearance against Young Boys , but he also had less time . That his double came in dragging an inexperienced side to victory away from home also makes his showing all the more impressive and ensures that the parallels between the two midfielders will continue to be drawn . <p> The Charlton academy product has arguably surpassed the Liverpool captain 's performances so far this season , with concerns over the Huyton-born star 's sluggishness following an injury-hit campaign last time out still yet to be erased . Yet , Rodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go if he is to oust the skipper from the side on a permanent basis , there are several moments forever etched into the club 's folklore which testify to the 31-year-old 's ability . <p> The Northern Irishman can at least take comfort from the patient approach he can take in introducing Shelvey to the side , a luxury which was not afforded his predecessor . Due to injuries to Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva , Kenny Dalglish handed Shelvey something of a baptism of fire last year , one which he had not earned yet still took with both hands . <p> The vicissitudes of a difficult campaign at Anfield - one in which the youngster 's promising but occasionally frustrating performances were never excused by his tender years - have shaped Shelvey for the better . The harshest critics have only served to instil the player with the mental capacity necessary to succeed at Anfield , a quality which dovetails well with his undeniable talent . <p> This was never more evident than in his substitute appearance against champions Manchester City just four weeks ago , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thigh tear . There was collective concern amongst the crowd about the midfielder 's ability to cope , especially when replacing such a vital cog in Rodgers ' team , but Shelvey simply set about laying those doubts to rest in the remaining 84 minutes of an intense contest . <p> And it is this sort of form will not have gone unnoticed by England boss Hodgson , who appears to be in the midst of a search for a goalscoring midfielder - as the recent botched Tom Cleverley experiment proves . <p> He could certainly do worse than look at Shelvey , who also underlined his international credentials by scoring and providing an assist as Stuart Pearce 's Under-21 side defeated Azerbaijan 2-0 earlier this month . <p> Exposure in the Three Lions senior squad will only underline Rodgers ' astuteness in making signing Shelvey up to a new long-term contract one of his first moves upon joining Liverpool . The 1.7 million paid to Charlton by Rafael Benitez may also start to look like something of a bargain given the midfielder 's price has already doubtless increased several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career now entering its final years and Shelvey 's promise seemingly endless , Liverpool may hope
