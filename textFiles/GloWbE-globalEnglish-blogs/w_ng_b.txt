Fellow Spaniard Rafael Benitez all too aware that every dropped point will be accompanied by discussion about the apparent inevitability of Guardiola 's eventual arrival at Stamford Bridge ... it just goes with the highly paid territory . <p> Is it realistic though for the former Barcelona Head Coach to be held-up as a magical cure to all of Chelsea 's managerial ills ? It may sound ridiculous to some , but assessing his suitability for the role requires Roman Abramovich to look far beyond Guardiola 's fantastic record with arguably the greatest club side we 've ever seen . Two Champions League titles and three domestic league titles among a total of fourteen major honours in four years , and all of this done playing a style of football admired almost universally . <p> Guardiola achieved the managerial ' Holy Grail ' , namely ' winning football ' that 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the embryonic stages of trying to do at Chelsea , before his tenure was ended after eight months and two major trophies . <p> Di Matteo was arguably ahead of schedule in his attempts to reshape and redefine Chelsea 's style of play , as apparently desired by Roman Abramovich . What surprises me is the commonly held view that Guardiola 's track record at Barcelona means he 's likely to achieve this quicker than most . It 's a theory that seems to ignore or gloss over some potential drawbacks in Chelsea appointing Guardiola . <p> For all the silverware he amassed in Spain and his undoubted talent , Guardiola would discover situations and challenges at Stamford Bridge that would be alien to a coach who has spent his entire managerial career in Barcelona . <p> Chelsea are owned and run by a billionaire , Barca is held up as a model of supporter ownership , famed for a youth academy that furnished Guardiola with the likes of Xavi , Iniesta and Messi -- players schooled in the footballing principles of La Masia , just as Guardiola was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy , which is now producing potential gems like Lucas Piazon , Nathaniel Chalobah and Islam Feruz , but restraints of time mean it 's values and principles are nowhere near as entrenched as Barca 's youth system , where a football philosophy has been passed down through many generations . <p> It is one example of how managing Chelsea would require Guardiola to show a lot of versatility and adaptability , areas in which he 's yet to be fully tested during a five-year coaching career spent exclusively in Barcelona . <p> It 's impossible for anyone to say with certainty whether he would or would n't thrive at Stamford Bridge but appointing a senior manager in any profession is surely about minimising risk and appointing the person whose skill set is best suited to achieving the company 's objectives . <p> Guardiola appears to fit the well-documented brief perfectly after achieving incredible success while playing attractive football , but it 's surely short-sighted to presume this can be easily replicated at a very different club in a very different country , particularly with a coach who , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we hope will be a lengthy career . <p> Indeed , to be considered a great football manager you surely have to achieve longevity , preferably with variety , something I 'd associate with the likes of Jose Mourinho , Fabio Capello and Louis van Gaal , but not Pep Guardiola just yet . <p> Sir Alex Ferguson 's won more trophies than any of them at Manchester United , but he also won a league title with St Mirren before domestic and European honours with Aberdeen , not to mention a brief spell in charge of the Scottish national side , all prior to his arrival at Old Trafford in 1986 . <p> Pep Guardiola 's undoubtedly shown qualities that suggest he may well go on to achieve a similar sort of managerial longevity , but at this stage of his career the Chelsea job would be a huge risk , both for Guardiola and the man said to so admire him , Roman Abramovich . <p> Many say the current incumbent at Stamford Bridge , Rafael Benitez , is merely keeping the seat warm ahead of Guardiola 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' interim manager ' lends weight to that theory , but right now the older of the two Spaniards

##3606951 <h> THE RESURGENCE OF ARMED ROBBERY <p> Recent reports indicate that the armed robbery incidence has gone up . It appears armed robbers has change their strategy and are becoming daring-even raping women , and housemaids in the process . The Lagos-Ogun axis has now become their domain such that some landlords and others with means are now moving out of their houses to escape the wrath and rampage of these marauders . They seem to have taken their clandestine operations a notch or two higher . Sadly , this situation did not just come suddenly . It has been long coming . These crimes , alongside recent surge in the suicide rate and abduction cases in Nigeria reveal an undercurrent of tension in the land . However , to merely look at this issue from the stand point of crime alone would be missing the point and ignoring the root cause of the problem . It did not just happened in vacuum . Indeed many commentators have predicted it years ago . It 's in line with principle of cause and effect law of nature . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain dire . The causes of these crimes can be traced to many socio economic challenges in operations . It can be split into three . The first is the high level of poverty ; high cost of living and high unemployment rate . These three things represent highly combustible mix of crime . With unemployment rate above 20% , the survival instinct of many idle youths is beginning to kick in . Many that can not find job and can not commit crime , end up committing suicide . The situation has not been helped by the lack of social safety net . The second point is the get rich quick syndrome encouraged by the political process . The process whereby anybody can enrich himself at the country 's expense and have the boldness to flaunt it create a wrong signal in the society . <p> toolbar maker Finally , the most encouraging license for crime to reign is the weakness in the country 's security and apprehension capacity coupled with poor justice system . Last week the IG of police call on the Lagos state police command to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the requisite working tools and appropriate remuneration , welfare and training , it amount to hollow cry . The police issue goes beyond the simplistic ideas of state policing , it demand real investment beyond mere political posturing . What needs to be done is to deal with it on short and long term . The short term is to quickly support the police with the necessary tools . Most of the police shy away from armed robbery shoot out because of superior fire power of the robbers . It can be likened to bringing a knife to a gun fight . The police should also be encouraged to take advantage of the community leaders and night watch group to get local information and intelligence . They do n't have to be a state police to mingle and effectively relate with host community . The civil defence corps can be co-opted ( since they have recently been allowed to carry gun ) . Effort should also be to recruit more police . The ratio of police to citizen currently at 1 to 400 is low in light of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geared toward good governance and job creation . Let make it clear : government has put some measures to achieve this , but it has been too little and fragmented . There is need for lot more focus of it . Innovations should be encouraged and supported . The government should also encourage companies to hire more , by offering some sort of tax reliefs . Government should look at the introducing reasonable social safety net . Even the most capitalistic society appreciates the need for it to protect their weak members . The obvious challenge to it is to ensure it does not breed corruption , government dependency , and cost overrun . If the problem is

##3618450 <h> Olumhense : Private Jets For Jesus <p> SHOULD a pastor own a private jet ? That this is even a debate issue in Nigeria reflects just how wayward some of our Christianity has travelled , particularly since the end of the civil war and the arrival of large piles of oil money . <p> We are good adopters , and in the past 20 or 30 years , these Christian strands in Nigeria have " grown " side by side with the monies flowing in the streets and the technologies produced by others . Christianity has moved from the pews into the realm of business , and from the pulpits to American-style television . <p> In the process , some of the emerging Christian leadership , adopting the culture of American television and stage , became celebrities and rock stars . Christianity became marketable , and marketability became mistaken for commercialization . <p> These pastors also became instant television producers , concerned about their looks and make-up as they prepared for worship services tailored for broadcasting . They worked on scripts and colours and lighting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They became stars as their Ministry became a business . And since there is no business without politics , business took politics in its arms and kissed her . Increasingly , pastors prayed not for right over wrong , nor simply for the mercy of God or the wisdom of Solomon , but for specific individuals or political parties . <p> Increasingly , pastors enshrined and preached the immediacy and centrality of prosperity , often praying for prosperity answers before nightfall . <p> Prosperity is good . In a way , our entire journey as homo sapiens is about prosperity : health , education , longevity ; heaven is prosperity over earth , and if we make heaven , we triumph -- that is , prosper -- over humanity . <p> The problem is that some of our Christian leaders often neglected the fact that prosperity is not always about materialism . From their glittering thousand-dollar suits , some of them prospered into the best cars , alligator-skin shoes , suites in five-star hotels . <p> All of this often happened alongside barbaric businessmen , guzzling governors and looting legislators many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness or sadness , sought the comfort of a pastor . <p> As you know by now , many pastors pray with their eyes closed . It helps focus on the celestial , but also conveys the impression of holiness . <p> Evidently , it also helps block out the obvious : that some of the powerful people appearing for prayers in the dead of night , or conveniently arranging to meet with the pastor in faraway lands , are thieves who have robbed the people blind . <p> Now , forgiveness is normal in Christianity . It is the foundation of the Christian Church , as the entire mission of Jesus Christ , in the Christian faith , was to take away sin and effect reconciliation with the Father . It is the place of a Christian leader to help with that process , so when he engages a sinner , it is to be expected . <p> The only problem is that in Nigeria , some pastors have often seemed to close their eyes a little too much and too long : allowing celebrity thieves to impoverish the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplice , accepting vast " contributions " they had reason to know could not have come from a legitimate income . <p> In 2007 , Archbishop Peter Akinola , the leader of the Anglican Church , showed up at a " glorious homecoming " celebration for one Olusegun Obasanjo , who had recently , reluctantly , and vindictively , given up the job of President of the Federal Republic . <p> " You have got the best in the world and your eyes have seen the worst in the world . All that is left now is to make heaven , " he told Obasanjo . <p> He assured the former president that while he had finished his " horizontal fights , " his spiritual journey had just begun , and urged him to fight the battle of his conscience , and seek forgiveness from those he has wronged . <p> The people Obasanjo had wronged , for eight long years , were the people of Nigeria , and the good bishop knew it as did all of the pastors who followed Obasanjo around and prayed with him routinely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have enough money , you have enough houses , you have enough land , enough ( cars ) , enough properties , even enough children and all should be enough ... God has given you far too many houses . What to eat is not your problem . Paying children 's school fees is no longer your problem ... " <p> He did not tell Obasanjo that all those riches were at the expense of his deeply disappointed people . <p> Indeed , many of the Christian leaders who interpret Christianity as a tool for personal prosperity pretend to see no link between bad governance and the manna from heaven they preach to their exhausted congregations . For them , their access to the corridors of power is merely part of their own prosperity . They do not see their blindness to bad governance to be collusion , or their silence to be support . <p> This is really a double rape , because on the other side , the pastors collect relentlessly from the poor to fund an affluent lifestyle . It is the collections that are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of Naira in personal wealth , and purchase jets by which to rule the sky . <p> In the case of Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor , the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria ( CAN ) , he did not even have to work at buying the jet himself : his congregation presented it to him as a " gift . " It is impressive when a congregation can raise $40 or $50 million to buy a jet . <p> According to a recent newspaper story , in Nigeria private jet ownership has grown by 650 per cent in the past five years , with those wealthy enough to afford it , including our pastors , spending about $7.5 billion <p> Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah has described this trend on the part of Christian leaders as an embarrassment because it diminishes the moral voice of the church in the fight against corruption . <p> It is not surprising that he immediately came under attack . Sunday Oibe , a spokesman for CAN , said : " If there is any clergyman in the country whose constituency is government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the last decade . " <p> Kukah , he accused , served in the Obasanjo government , only to later attack the former president . Kukah , he accused , fraternized with former Governors James Ibori and Peter Odili . <p> Kukah never served in the Obasanjo government . " Fraternized " with corrupt governors ? Does that mean he knew them , accepted contracts from them , used them as his route to riches and glamour ? <p> Which explains the very point : corruption fights back . Corruption not only defends itself ; in Nigeria , it advertises in Eagle Square . Corruption blackmails ; on the offensive , it paints everything in its own colours . <p> The obvious is that it is those pastors who buy jets remind one less of a Christian leader and more of a playboy or a corrupt former governor . A pastor who buys a jet , even from " legitimate " resources , can not avoid being perceived as being corrupt or compromised <p> The reason is that a private jet is not just a mode of transportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of humility . It suggests matching riches and possessions , affluent luxury homes , exotic cars , expansive hotel suites and immense bank accounts . <p> A private jet , for a Christian leader , suggests the corruption of the Christian spirit and contradicts the life of Christ and the ability to live a life of humility and compassion , or to serve the poor . <p> A private jet may be transportation to a businessman , and a Christian leader can argue eloquently that he needs it to simplify his mission . In a country as desperate as Nigeria , the only destination to which a luxury private jet transports a pastor is away : from 
##3620352 <h> The Author <h> Share <p> Just as air is extremely vital to living , your words are what keep your spirit going . One very subtle way of murdering someone is simply by denying that person the vital thing to make him live . This could be done by suffocation . During this time , the person gasps for air to no avail , and the person suddenly stops struggling till he dies . <p> So it is with our spirit . Funny enough , our spirit does n't follow the rule of life by using air to live . Our words have a great impact on our spirit . Our words are our spiritual air . The Message translation renders Proverbs 18:21 as this : ' Words kill , words give life ; they 're either poison or fruit -- you choose . ' Watch what you say . This is one primary reason we are told to watch our songs . I reserve no apologies to anyone who did n't intend to see this as an ' excessively spiritual thing ' , but I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They are a basic tool in the Devil 's kingdom to keep you dead most of the days of your life . His plans for you are to keep you miserable always . His plans for you are to make you to never bear fruit for your Heavenly Father . Do n't sing those songs casually . Watch them . A lot of people do n't know the spiritual truth that the moment they give their lives to Christ , they CAN NOT die ! They only change location to a higher glory . The nails on the cross , or the scourging , or the piercing , or the thorns did not kill Jesus . Jesus died because He had accomplished His purpose on earth ; He had fulfilled scriptures , and then according to John 19:30 , ' Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit . ' He gave it up . <p> Learn to speak life and positivity all the days that you live . They are what rule you . Now this is what I mean by ' breathing through your words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to breathe . Let your words be the nostrils you use to breathe . Get to build yourself up daily . I know it can be a frustrating deal to try to speak ' life ' in Nigeria , especially in Lagos where many people behave the animals they were not created to be . Try . Just try . Thank the Holy Spirit for giving you the power to do that extraordinary thing . He had already given you that grace when you gave your life to Jesus . If you 've not given your life to Jesus yet , then do so immediately . Lagos is a good testing ground for all that I have said . Just like someone retorted once while driving , " anyone who drives in Lagos and has not abused and cursed one day of his life , is a liar , and as such should go to hell ! " Imagine my roaring laughter ! It was true ! But it is a virtue you need to imbibe ! It is always easier to do the wrong things than the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confirm . We 've got to be conscious in doing the right thing . Only the Holy Spirit can help you . If you can pass the ' test ' in Lagos , then you can be sure to be a good christian anywhere ! Be conscious of what you say and never let anyone 's misdeeds affect your ' breathing . ' You own the nostril , so simply wade off the person 's hands that want to suffocate you . Always bless . It is n't the realistic thing to do , BUT IT 'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO , SO DO IT ! Notable men of God who only need to speak for the dead to come to life did n't get special anointing from anywhere ; do n't let anyone deceive you on that . It involves years of training ; training one 's self on always thinking and speaking positivity to every situation around . If your clock stops working , start from there : speak life words to it .

##3863451 <h> Ifeanyi Ubah is a Fraudster of Magnitude -- Cosmas Maduka <p> Managing Director , Coscharis Group of Companies , Dr. Cosmas Maduka , has vowed to ensure that he collects back all the money due to him that Managing Director , Capital Oil and Gas Industries Limited , Mr. Ifeanyi Ubah , has allegedly fraudulently appropriated through a failed business transaction between the duo . <p> Maduka , in a statement Sunday from the Coscharis Group , which he owns , detailed his encounter with Ubah , saying he had entered into partnership with Ubah in response to his request for ehe entrepreneur to assist the oil dealer grow his business . <p> He also denied the allegation Ubah made last week that he and Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc , Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede , who chaired the Presidential Committee on Verification and Reconciliation of Fuel Subsidy Payments , were plotting to take over Capital Oil . <p> According to Maduka , the stage for the failed business transaction between him and Ubah was set during the celebration of his ( Maduka 's ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , sought him out to assist with his business , explaining that he had been victimised by competitors and the banks . <p> " In spite of the numerous warnings against having anything to do with him , Maduka felt the urge to assist the young man because he felt no one could be as bad as he ( Ubah ) was being portrayed and after all Ubah is his kinsman from Nnewi , " the statement said . <p> The Coscharis Group highlighted some of the warnings its chairman , Maduka , was given against dealing with Ubah to include his failure to remit sales proceeds to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) after selling petroleum products stored in his tank farm ; failure to remit sales proceeds to Mrs. Uju Ifejika , who had a through-put-arrangement with Ubah , after he had sold the petroleum product in his care ; alleged refusal to settle his indebtedness to several banks ; and his exposure to Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria ( AMCON ) , which has taken over his bank debts . Maduka said because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him credit and he had sought his assistance to help him access credit for his oil business . <p> " On the strength of this , Dr. Cosmas Maduka entered into a joint venture business agreement with Capital Oil ( Ifeanyi Ubah ) for the importation and sale of Premium Motor Spirit ( PMS ) . <p> " The basis of the joint venture agreement was that Dr. Cosmas Maduka would provide the funding for the importation while Capital Oil would be responsible for the logistics , for the importation as well as handle the sale of PMS . " Capital Oil 's role was therefore to provide its Petroleum Import Permits from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency ( PPPRA ) and The Department of Petroleum Resources ( DPR ) which are required to import PMS into Nigeria . " Capital Oil would also source the products , open Letters of Credits to the supplier who must deliver the product to Capital Oil storage tank in Nigeria , arrange for the sale of the product in Nigeria , and pay the proceeds and subsidy element into the joint venture account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement added . <p> Maduka 's greatest mistake was to believe that Ubah was a reformed character despite his track record of allegedly defrauding several persons , as shortly after the business transaction was sealed , he revealed his true character , the group said . According to the statement , based on the agreement , Capital Oil covenanted that Coscharis Motors would be entitled to immediate possession of the products while the oil company would lease the tanks in which the products would be sold to Coscharis , as part of measures to ensure that Coscharis had proper storage for the products that Capital Oil had pre-sold to it , based on the agreement . <p> " This agreement provided for an account to be opened into which Capital Oil would domicile proceeds of subsidy collected by way of Sovereign Debt Notes for the products imported , which together with proceeds of the sale of the products would be used to repay the bank 's credit facility , " Coscharis said . <p> The company explained that given the fact that all the banks approached to finance the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maduka approached Access Bank for a facility to fund the importation of petrol . The bank , the company added , consented and later raised the facility granted to Coscharis Motors to $164 million to accommodate additional requests by Ubah and Capital Oil for additional importation , leading to the opening of 10 Letters of Credits ( L/Cs ) that were established and fully negotiated . <p> " However , shipments were made and products were partially received for six out of the 10 Letters of Credit while products for the remaining four Letters of Credit established for the importation of 130,000 metric tonnes of petrol were not delivered at all , " it explained further . <p> The statement said even for the six L/Cs for which shipment was made , not all the products were delivered to the tank farm as expected by Capital Oil while there was no delivery of products for the remaining four L/Cs . It said when the petrol that was expected to be discharged into Capital Oil 's tank farm at Ibafon , Lagos , did not arrive as scheduled and the company could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil in collusion with shippers had diverted the product . <p> " This belief is strengthened by the fact that under Letters of Credit , the products covered by the Bills of Lading were supposed to have been delivered within three weeks from the date of the Bills of Lading ( on or before January , 2012 ) but till today , the products have not been seen , " the statement said . " Capital Oil 's diversion of these products in collusion with the shippers has made the repayment of the facility scheduled to come from the sales proceeds impossible . <p> " Accordingly , the exposure to Access Bank Plc stands at about N21 billion while interest accrues . Also , Capital Oil has refused to release the 56,568,587.11 litres of PMS in the designated tank for this transaction under the management of our warehousing agent in its tank farm for disposal to facilitate the payment of our financial obligation to Access Bank , " Coscharis added . The perceived fraud , Coscharis explained , compelled Maduka to petition the Special Fraud Unit ( SFU ) of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duo to give statements and was followed by interrogations . <p> Maduka , the company said , has vowed to collect every farthing owed by Ubah , adding : " Ifeanyi Ubah may have defrauded the Federal Government and other individuals and gone free but given the fact that I earned every kobo through my sweat , I will collect my money to the very last kobo . <p> " Allowing a fraudster of this magnitude off the hook will send wrong signal to the international community about the sincerity of the government 's prosecution of the anti-corruption campaign . I vow to pursue this matter to the end . " The company 's chairman observed that the alleged fraud perpetuated by Ubah was similar to the destruction of Banco Noroeste , the Brazilian bank that was defrauded to the tune of $242 million by Mr. Emmanuel Nwude , Mrs. Amaka Anajemba and other accomplices in a space of three years . " I and my family will fight with everything to ensure that Ubah repays all the money he owes me . God is my witness , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people told you before you entered into partnership . My advice to you is that you should be careful in the pursuit of your claims because in Nigeria , failed business agreements and asking for one 's rights have resulted in hired killings and other untold actions . Only God knows the number of banks this type of businessmen and women have defrauded and sent into liquidation ... Well , May God help you . <p> chidex <p> Well said Mr Marcus , its only a blind man that can throw a stone in an unchatted direction like in Nigerian business . Undertaking a business of this magnitude like Mr Maduka have engaged with Mr Uba needs careful manouver , but this been made difficult for both by their involvement of both the Nigerian govt and the international community . Be careful Mr Maduka , there are still millions to be made by you considering your age , you cant win in everything and remember nigeria is a dangerous business environment esp your area , where men can go to any lenght in settling and score . My advice is move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . You can still make more than you already have . Take it easy . <p> MathewBabs <p> Oga just be careful this man called uba is a hard man , God is watching what everybody does under this

##3864651 <h> Main menu <h> An Update To My GLO Scam Post <p> Yesterday I wrote a post complaining about underhand and I dare say fraudulent length GLO in conjunction with a VAS company is going to increase their ARPU ( Average Revenue Per User ) . Since then , a few things have happened <p> The spam texts have become more desperate . Some of the recent texts i 've received are " Gooday I met u , I am Rose , wht is ur name ? " ; " Can I be ur friend ? " ; " Pls reply me , I want us to chat , am Temi " ; " Hello I am very sexy " . etc . I have received a few missed calls too . <p> I have an idea of actual VAS company that is behind the ' service ' <p> I have got a link that will enable me petition the NCC Executive Vice Chairman directly . <h> Why this is important . <p> Unlike Loy who says " rants do n't pay my bills . I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud " , I think this is rather important <p> Telcos occupy a rather extraordinarily powerful position in technology ecosystem they should be held to account for misdeeds tat affect a lot of people . <p> This is directly related to 3rd party mobile services provided on their platform . If VAS services are abused and become generally known to be unsafe , it affects all of us . We are still trying to get people to start using digital payment methods . <p> There is a debate about the role telcos should play in mobile money . If my small prepaid airtime is not safe with telcos , what is the risk of giving the same people access to all my money in the bank ? <p> So I will do my best to follow this up . I am thinking writing to the EVC might be too harsh considering I have not made a complaint to GLO . So during run-around today , I will stop over at their head office to file a complaint formally . I will see how that goes before proceeding with my other options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to NCC ) and also copy the Glo customer service manager or director so they know its not to be taken lightly ... someone needs these telcos of their commitments to customers . cheers ! <p> http : //myOnePage.com/Oo Oo Nwoye <p> Yup . I am trying to get the email addy of an executive in GLO who I will copy in my letter . <p> http : //www.victorasemota.com/ Victor Asemota <p> //There is a debate about the role telcos should play in mobile money . If my small prepaid airtime is not safe with telcos , what is the risk of giving the same people access to all my money in the bank ? // ..... <p> Why this does not make sense on many levels is that based on the CBN mobile payments framework telcos are not meant to be banks and wont have access to " all your money " . They will provide wallets which you may or may not decide to fund depending on your needs unlike a bank account that is the only alternative to having your money under your mattress . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplete it.Banks have already proven many times that they are not to be trusted but you still leave your money there anyway because you have no choice . <p> The power of the telco is with the subscriber they can decide to be with them or not to be . When mobile number portability is pulled off you can decide to move your number to a spam-less network even if it means you will only get service when you are in VI . <p> While Glo 's acts are despicable and I do nt support them , I agree with Loy that rants are of no effect , action is better . I have ranted about GTBank without result and now I am acting with my feet . I am moving my account to Stanbic . <p> Try to petition the NCC for MNP to be fast-tracked and also agitate for more respect for privacy and consumer protection . We have a consumer protection agency at the national level that is useless and allows people to be promised aeroplanes when they have no private hangars or airports . Someone should remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nwoye <p> Thanks for your comment . <p> I think my post makes sense . <p> I said there is a debate . Because currently , there is constant lobbying going on by Telcos not wanting to be shackled to banks and allowed to go their own way . All it takes is a board meeting at CBN for things to change and for telcos to go alone . But let us take what you said about them having access to " only " my wallet . The fundamental difference between a wallet and pre-paid credit is the limit a person will have at risk . The average top-up amount is a maximum of N500 . However , using a wallet would mean you will have money in there for much more thank recharging/topping up . BTW , if I am sending money " to the village " ( remittance ) via mobile money like they are pushing for , it is possible that all the recipients money would be at risk . As for number portability , this risk is industry wide therefore moving from one ' insecure ' telco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to telcos to regulate their practices or else an external body would do so . As for Loy and his views on ranting . The job of the media is to be a watchdog . To fight the peoples fight , to bring awareness . However he states such posts do not feed him so who am I to argue ? It is his prerogative to chose what he covers . You hit the nail about the need for more consumer protection which is why we need to get people talking , ranting and petitioning . It is the job of everyone ESPECIALLY the media . I am doing my best and will have an update by Monday hopefully . <p> Gary sabiya <p> Glo has been sending me text using the number 8888 , through which the still credit like Judas who used to dip his hands into the treasury . I did not sign up for that service . Question , How long has this been going on ? Are we no longer to have trust even in the administrators . say day when a network betrays the trust @ 
##3866552 <h> SITE LINKS <h> Responsive capacity building to tackle skills shortage -- Dr Usman <p> November 21 , 2012 admin <p> Recently , the National Director General of Centre for Management Development inNigeria , Dr. Kabir Kabo Usman paid a working/courtesy visit to Imo state . In this interview with Peoples Times ' Staff Writer/Correspondent Ferdinand Ekeoma in Owerri , he spoke extensively on the objectives , vision and challenges of his agency . Excerpts- <p> Sir , As the Director General of Center for Management Development , what are the challenges that face your Agency ? <p> Well as you know , literarily I 'm the Director General and Chief executive , Center for Management Development , and by our mandate , of course we are an agency of government , and federal government parastatal under the national planning commission , and our primary responsibility is in the area of man power development for the country , and such , we have got a clear mandate , we are goverened by a council , which is of course , Nigerian Council for management development , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incubation center , and it is meant , you know to do actually all the leg work in terms of capacity and stability building . <p> Naturally , there would n't be any institution or orgamization that would n't have challenges , but part of our challenges is our trying to translate our vision into reality , what is it ; we are based actually in Lagos as our headquarters , we have got area offices across the zones in the federation , and thirdly we need to make sure that , you know , those zones have decent and beffiting offices that will enable us to deliver our capacity building with particular reference to those zones , so definitely , there are going to be challenges in terms of maintenance of those centers , and making sure that facilities , modern art facilities in line with current challenges and also with new technology , so particularly when you look at the south the east zone , you know in those states , in the 70s , the head office was based in aba , in Abia state , but sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owerri which is more central , so that we can serve the zone equitably , so actually we do have challenges in terms of beffiting accommodation and our responsibility is to work together with the state government , you know to identify and ask for assistance . <p> what prompted your visit to Imo state ? <p> I 'm here in Imo state , particularly for three reasons , the first reason of course to make a courtesy call to His Excellcemcy , the governor of Imo state , and to congratulate him for his hard work , and the loudable achievements he is making , with particular reference to his focus in area of education , human capital development , capacity building and man man power development in the state . The second reason of course is to ask , you know for collaboration and partnership , you know between the state government and center for Management development , to identify a befitting location , which we would wish that it would be donated by the state government , to enable us to function effectively in terms of providing responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in Imo state , but across the entire South east zone . And the third of course is a gesture of goodwill to imo state government by bringing in , you know a workshop that is being funded by African capacity building foundation which is based in Harere in Zimbabwe , to enable it happen , it is now happening in Links Hotel Owerri , and we have identified , you know a certain number of slots which we allocated to Imo state , and currently there are about thirty civil servants from Imo state that are attending this five days workshop for fee of charge , and we have invited other neighboring states to contribute , by bringing in participants from their own respective states as well so this is the sign into the direction we intend to proceed and it has been well received , well attended . I came and did the official opening of the workshop and I could see that there is quite a lot of learning that is taking place , but projects of this nature is timely and also it 's needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of the civil servants , these are the reasons why I 'm here for this visit to Imo state . <p> We understood that your Agency has a relationship with the Nationnal Planning Commission , what has the cooperation between the two Agencies been like ? <p> Our agency as I have said earlier on is a parastatal under the National Planning commission , that is being actually managed by the Minister of National Planning commission , Dr. Shamsudeen Usman , who is also the deputy Chairman of the National Planning Commission , and we have a clear mandate from the minister that we must provide capacity building , not only at the federal level , but also at the state level . Even though it is a federal government owned agency , but it has national outlook , and it is our responsibility to develop the man power of the country , not just only at the federal government level , and the minister directed that we should embark on a lot of work at the states . One of the works we have done was to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skills mismatch , skills leading , and skills lagging in the respective states , which we have done . And the next stage is to provide , responsive capacity building that will tackle the issue of skills shortage and skills gaps in those states , and one of the workshops we are currently doing is just to do that in the areas of planning and budgeting so we invited all the directors of planning , research , and statistics , to come and share their own experiences and address the issue of planning and budgeting a lot of intention of moving the agenda forward in the areas of monitoring and evaluation , so there is a national framework now . If you have projects , how do you select those projects , how do you manage those projects , how do you benchmark them ? You need to have a monitoring system , you need to ensure that what you are delivering , there is quality , there is standard , there is value for money , and also there is value addition . So in response to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are other initiatives that have been directed by the Honorable Minister for Planning , Dr. Shamsudeen Usman , to provide , typical example in the areas of public private partnership and in the areas of procurement . We need to give a lot of capacity building in those particular areas , so that we can empower the civil servants , to improve the quality and standard of service , you know to the communities . <p> From your explanations , it 's obvious your agency has a serious focus in the South East , what have the response and reactions of the people been like ? <p> Well , the response could have been better because we have been here since 2009 , but there is n't too much up take in terms of the existing programmes that we have . We want more patronage and we sincerely look forward to talk to His Excellency , the Governor about this issue . I have been to Owerri Imo state on a number of occasions , almost four times and met with the Head of service and various permanent secretaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can work together and have implant training programmes that are targeted to meet the skills shortage needs , to make sure that the staff are up skilled to deliver the quality service with high level of productivity and making sure they perform effectively in their own functions , so we are still having challenges , you know in terms of the level of patronage . <p> Funding seems to be one of the major challenges facing many government agencies , how is this affecting your agency ? <p> Well , naturally it 's true that there are funding challenges , that is why we are looking outward in terms of means to generate revenue . The Internally Generated Revenue(IGR) will enable us to deliver high quality projects . As you are fully aware , we are government parastatal , we are not a private sector , we are not about profit making , we are about providing quality service . You ca n't provide quality service if you do n't have adequate funds to do so , that is why we have to work and collaborate with states to synergize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we can have the right infrastructure to deliver high quality jobs . <p> Considering the problem many agencies and parastatals encountered this year , I mean regarding shortfall in budgetary allocations and implementation , is your agency making any effort towards ensuring that it gets reasonable budgetary allocation that will enable it function effectively ? <p> Well , we have worked very hard , we presented our case to our minister , and thirdly from the look of things there would be some bit of more budgetary allocation top address some of the issues we have raised . But as you know , no matter what ever allocation that you get from the state or federal government , definitely it 's not going to be enough , so some thing has to be done . You know , you need your own initiatives to generate income , some where some how . A typical example is ; if you are working on your annual salary , am sure there is no way you will say that all your salaries are now enough to meet all your commitments , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to prioritize also . We have done that , and we are also looking at the 2013 budget that will enable us look at the issues , in the areas of infrastructure , and
