##1611750 <p> Spiritual practice has to be a process of endless disappointment . We have to see that everything we demand ( and even get ) eventually disappoints us . This discovery is our teacher . It 's why we should be careful with friends who are in trouble , not to give them sympathy by holding out false hopes and reassurances . This kind of sympathy -- which is not true compassion -- simply delays their learning . In a sense , the best help we can give to anybody is to hasten their disappointment . Though that sounds harsh , it 's not in fact unkind . We help others and ourselves when we begin to see that all our usual demands are misguided . Eventually we get smart enough to anticipate our next disappointment , to know that our next effort to quench our thirst will also fail . The promise is never kept . Even with long practice , we 'll sometimes seek false solutions , but as we pursue them , we recognise their futility much more rapidly . When this acceleration occurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such acceleration . We must notice the promise that we wish to exact from other people and abandon the dream that they can quench our thirst . We must realise that such an enterprise is hopeless . <p> Christians call this realisation the " dark night of the soul . " We 've worn out everything we can do , and we do n't see what to do next . And so we suffer . Though it feels miserable at the time , that suffering is the turning point . Practice brings us to such fruitful suffering , and helps us to stay with it . When we do , at some point the suffering begins to transform itself , and the water begins to flow . <p> In their many different idioms the classical spiritual writers have attempted to throw light on the eternal question of union with God .

##1612451 <p> World War II ( 1939-1945 ) killed more people , destroyed more property , disrupted more lives , and probably had more far-reaching consequences than any other war in history . It brought about the downfall of Western Europe as the centre of world power and led to the rise of the Soviet Union as a " super-power " to rival the United States . Japan and Germany , defeated in the war , later made dramatic economic recoveries . The war brought new technologies that were to change the postwar world . The development of the atomic bomb during the war opened the nuclear age . <p> The exact number of people killed because of World War II will never be known . Military deaths probably totalled about 17 million . Civilian deaths were even greater as a result of starvation , bombing raids , massacres , epidemics , and other war-related causes . The battlegrounds spread to nearly every part of the world . Troops fought in the steaming jungles of Southeast Asia , in the deserts of northern Africa , and on islands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union , below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean , and in the streets of many European cities . <p> World War II began on Sept. 1 , 1939 , when Germany invaded Poland . Germany 's dictator , Adolf Hitler , had built Germany into a powerful war machine . That machine rapidly crushed Poland , Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Belgium , Norway , and France . By June 1940 , Great Britain and its commonwealth allies stood alone against Hitler . That same month , Italy joined the war on Germany 's side . The fighting soon spread to Greece and northern Africa . In June 1941 , Germany invaded the Soviet Union . Japan attacked United States military bases at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec. 7 , 1941 , bringing the United States into the war . By mid-1942 , Japanese forces had conquered much of Southeast Asia and had swept across many islands in the Pacific . <p> Germany , Italy , and Japan formed an alliance known as the Axis . Six other nations eventually joined the Axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union were the major powers fighting the Axis . They were called the Allies . The Allies totalled 50 nations by the end of the war . <p> During 1942 , the Allies stopped the Axis advance in northern Africa , the Soviet Union , and the Pacific . Allied forces landed in Italy in 1943 and in France in 1944 . In 1945 , the Allies drove into Germany from the east and the west . A series of bloody battles in the Pacific brought the Allies to Japan 's doorstep by the summer of 1945 . Germany surrendered on May 7 , 1945 , and Japan on Sept. 2 , 1945 . <p> An uneasy peace took effect as a war-weary world began to rebuild after World War II . Much of Europe and parts of Asia lay in ruins . Millions of people were starving and homeless . Europe 's leadership in world affairs had ended . The United States and the Soviet Union had become the world 's most powerful nations . But their wartime alliance broke down soon after the war . New threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communism in Europe and Asia . <p> WORLD WAR II/Causes of the war <p> Many historians trace the causes of World War II to problems left unsolved by World War I ( 1914-1918 ) . World War I and the treaties drawn up at the end also created new political and economic problems . Forceful leaders in several countries took advantage of those problems to seize power . The desire of dictators in Germany , Italy , and Japan to conquer additional territory brought them into conflict with democratic nations . <p> The Peace of Paris . After World War I ended , representatives of the victorious nations met in Paris in 1919 to draw up peace treaties for the defeated countries . The treaties , known together as the Peace of Paris , followed a long and bitter war . They were worked out in haste by countries with opposing goals and failed to satisfy even the victors . Of all the countries on the winning side , Italy and Japan left the peace conference most dissatisfied . Italy gained less territory than it felt it deserved and vowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German territories in the Pacific and thereby launched a programme of expansion . But Japan was angered by the peacemakers ' failure to endorse the principle of the equality of all races . <p> The countries that lost World War I--Germany , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria , and Turkey--were especially dissatisfied with the Peace of Paris . They were stripped of territory and arms and were required to make reparations ( payments for war damages ) . <p> The Treaty of Versailles , which was signed with Germany , punished Germany severely . The German government agreed to sign the treaty only after the victorious powers threatened to invade . Many Germans particularly resented a clause that forced Germany to accept responsibility for causing World War I. <p> Economic problems . World War I seriously damaged the economies of European countries . Both the winners and the losers came out of the war deeply in debt . The defeated powers had difficulty paying reparations to the victors , and the victors had difficulty repaying loans from the United States . The shift from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war . <p> Italy and Japan suffered from too many people and too few resources after World War I. They eventually tried to solve their problems by territorial expansion . In Germany , runaway inflation destroyed the value of money and wiped out the savings of millions of people . In 1923 , the German economy neared collapse . Loans from the United States helped Germany 's government restore order . By the late 1920 's , Europe appeared to be entering a period of economic stability . <p> A worldwide business slump known as the Great Depression began in the United States in 1929 . By the early 1930 's , it had halted Europe 's economic recovery . The Great Depression caused mass unemployment and spread poverty and despair throughout the world . It weakened democratic governments and strengthened extreme political movements that promised to end the economic problems . Two movements in particular gained strength . The forces of Communism called for revolution by the workers . The forces of fascism favoured strong national government . Throughout Europe , the communists clashed with the fascists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest economic problems and the deepest resentment of the Peace of Paris . <p> Nationalism was an extreme form of patriotism that swept across Europe during the 1800 's . Supporters of nationalism placed loyalty to the aims of their nation above any other public loyalty . Many nationalists viewed foreigners and members of minority groups as inferior . Such beliefs helped nations justify their conquest of other lands and the poor treatment of minorities within their borders . Nationalism was a chief cause of World War I , and it grew even stronger after that war . <p> Nationalism went hand in hand with feelings of national discontent . The more people felt deprived of national honour , the more they wished to see their country powerful and able to insist on its rights . Many Germans felt humiliated by their country 's defeat in World War I and its harsh treatment under the Treaty of Versailles . During the 1930 's , they enthusiastically supported a violently nationalistic organization called the Nazi Party . The Nazi Party declared that Germany had a right to become strong again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Peace of Paris established an international organization called the League of Nations to maintain peace . But nationalism prevented the League from working effectively . Each country backed its own interests at the expense of other countries . Only weak countries agreed to submit their disagreements to the League of Nations for settlement . Strong nations reserved the right to settle their disputes by threats or , if tough talk failed , by force . <p> The rise of dictatorships . The political unrest and poor economic conditions that developed after World War I enabled dictatorships to arise in several countries , especially in those countries that lacked a tradition of democratic government . During the 1920 's and 1930 's , dictatorships came to power in the Soviet Union , Italy , Germany , and Japan . They held total power and ruled without regard to law . The dictatorships used terror and secret police to crush opposition to their rule . People who objected risked imprisonment or execution . <p> In the Soviet Union , the Communists , led by V. I. Lenin , had seized power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country by the time he died in 1924 . After Lenin 's death , Joseph Stalin and other leading Communists struggled for power . Stalin eliminated his rivals one by one and became the Soviet dictator in 1929 . <p> In Italy , economic distress after World War I led to strikes and riots . As a result of the violence , a strongly nationalistic group called the Fascist Party gained many supporters . Benito Mussolini , leader of the Fascists , promised to bring order and prosperity to Italy . He vowed to restore to Italy the glory it had known in the days of the ancient Roman Empire . By 1922 , the Fascists had become powerful enough to force the king of Italy to appoint Mussolini premier . Mussolini , who took the title il Duce ( the Leader ) , soon began to establish a dictatorship . <p> In Germany , the Nazi Party made spectacular gains as the Great Depression deepened during the early 1930 's . Many Germans blamed all their country 's economic woes on the hated Treaty of Versailles , which forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations . In 1933 , Adolf Hitler , the leader of the Nazis , was appointed chancellor of Germany . Hitler , who was called der Fuhrer ( the Leader ) , soon made Germany a dictatorship . He vowed to ignore the Versailles Treaty and to avenge Germany 's defeat in World War I. Hitler preached that Germans were a " superior race " and that such peoples as Jews and Slavs were inferior . He began a campaign of hatred against Jews and Communists and promised to rid the country of them . Hitler 's extreme nationalism appealed to many Germans . <p> In Japan , military officers began to hold political office during the 1930 's . By 1936 , they had strong control of the government . Japan 's military government glorified war and the training of warriors . In 1941 , General Hideki Tojo became premier of Japan . <p> Aggression on the march . Japan , Italy , and Germany followed a policy of aggressive territorial expansion during the 1930 's . They invaded weak lands that could be taken over easily . The dictatorships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The democratic countries responded with timidity and indecision to the aggression of the dictatorships . <p> Japan was the first dictatorship to begin a programme of conquest . In 1931 , Japanese forces seized control of Manchuria , a region of China rich in natural resources . Some historians consider Japan 's conquest of Manchuria as the real start of World War II . Japan made Manchuria a puppet state called Manchukuo . In 1937 , Japan launched a major attack against China . It occupied most of eastern China by the end of 1938 , though the two countries had not officially declared war . Japan 's military leaders began to speak about bringing all of eastern Asia under Japanese control . <p> Italy looked to Africa to fulfil its ambitions for an empire . In 1935 , Italian troops invaded Ethiopia , one of the few independent countries in Africa . The Italians used machine guns , tanks , and aeroplanes to overpower Ethiopia 's poorly equipped army . They had conquered the country by May 1936 . <p> Soon after Hitler took power , he began to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Versailles . In 1936 , Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland , a region of Germany along the banks of the Rhine River . Under the treaty , the Rhineland was to remain free of troops . In March 1938 , German soldiers marched into Austria and united it with Germany . Many people in Germany and Austria welcomed that move . <p> The acts of aggression were easy victories for the dictatorships . The League of Nations proved incapable of stopping them . It lacked an army and the power to enforce international law . The United States had refused to join the League or become involved in European disputes . Great Britain and France were unwilling to risk another war so soon after World War I. The two powers knew they would bear the burden of any fighting . <p> The aggressors soon formed an alliance . In 1936 , Germany and Italy agreed to support one another 's foreign policy . The alliance was known as the Rome-Berlin Axis . Japan joined the alliance in 1940 , and it became the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis . <p> The Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936 to 1939 . In 1936 , many of Spain 's army officers revolted against the government . The army rebels chose General Francisco Franco as their leader . Franco 's forces were known as Nationalists or Rebels . The forces that supported Spain 's elected government were called Loyalists or Republicans . The Spanish Civil War drew worldwide attention . During the war , the dictatorships again displayed their might while the democracies remained helpless . <p> Hitler and Mussolini sent troops , weapons , aircraft , and advisers to aid the Nationalists . The Soviet Union was the only power to help the Loyalists . France , Britain , and the United States decided not to become involved . However , Loyalist sympathizers from many countries joined the International Brigades that the Communists formed to fight in Spain . <p> The last Loyalist forces surrendered on April 1 , 1939 , and Franco set up a dictatorship in Spain . The Spanish Civil War served as a military proving ground for World War II because Germany , Italy , and the Soviet Union used it to test weapons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for World War II in that it split the world into forces that either supported or opposed Nazism and Fascism . <p> The failure of appeasement . Hitler prepared to strike again soon after Germany absorbed Austria in March 1938 . German territory then bordered Czechoslovakia on three sides . Czechoslovakia had become an independent nation after World War I. Its population consisted of many nationalities , including more than 3 million people of German descent . Hitler sought control of the Sudetenland , a region of western Czechoslovakia where most of the Germans lived . Urged on by Hitler , the Sudeten Germans began to clamour for union with Germany . <p> Czechoslovakia was determined to defend its territory . France and the Soviet Union had pledged their support . As tension mounted , Britain 's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain tried to restore calm . Chamberlain wished to preserve peace at all cost . He believed that war could be prevented by meeting Hitler 's demands . That policy became known as appeasement . <p> Chamberlain had several meetings with Hitler during September 1938 as Europe teetered on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On September 29 , Chamberlain and French Premier Edouard Daladier met with Hitler and Mussolini in Munich , Germany . Chamberlain and Daladier agreed to turn over the Sudetenland to Germany , and they forced Czechoslovakia to accept the agreement . Hitler promised that he had no more territorial demands . <p> The Munich Agreement marked the height of the policy of appeasement . Chamberlain and Daladier hoped that the agreement would satisfy Hitler and prevent war--or that it would at least prolong the peace until Britain and France were ready for war . The two leaders were mistaken on both counts . <p> The failure of appeasement soon became clear . Hitler broke the Munich Agreement in March 1939 and seized the rest of Czechoslovakia . He thereby added Czechoslovakia 's armed forces and industries to Germany 's military might . In the months before World War II began , Germany 's preparations for war moved ahead faster than did the military build-up of Britain and France . <p> WORLD WAR II/Early stages of the war <p> During the first year of World War II , Germany won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Netherlands , Belgium , Norway , and France . Germany then attempted to bomb Britain into surrendering , but it failed . <p> The invasion of Poland . After Hitler seized Czechoslovakia , he began demanding territory from Poland . Great Britain and France pledged to help Poland if Germany attacked it . Yet the two powers could aid Poland only by invading Germany , a step that neither chose to take . Britain had only a small army . France had prepared to defend its territory , not to attack . <p> Great Britain and France hoped that the Soviet Union would help defend Poland . But Hitler and Stalin shocked the world by becoming allies . On Aug. 23 , 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact--in which they agreed not to go to war against each other . They secretly decided to divide Poland between themselves . <p> On Sept. 1 , 1939 , Germany invaded Poland and began World War II . Poland had a fairly large army but little modern equipment . The Polish army expected to fight along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new method of warfare they called blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . The blitzkrieg stressed speed and surprise . Rows of tanks smashed through Poland 's defences and rolled deep into the country before the Polish army had time to react . Swarms of German dive bombers and fighter aircraft knocked out communications and pounded battle lines . <p> The Poles fought bravely . But Germany 's blitzkrieg threw their army into confusion . On Sept. 17 , 1939 , Soviet forces invaded Poland from the east . By late September , the Soviet Union occupied the eastern third of Poland , and Germany had swallowed up the rest . <p> The Phoney War . Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on Sept. 3 , 1939 , two days after the invasion of Poland . But the two countries stood by while Poland collapsed . France moved troops to the Maginot Line , a belt of steel and concrete fortresses it had built after World War I along its border with Germany . Britain sent a small force into northern France . Germany stationed troops on the Siegfried Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opposite the Maginot Line . The two sides avoided fighting in late 1939 and early 1940 . Journalists called the period the Phoney War . <p> The conquest of Denmark and Norway . Valuable shipments of iron ore from Sweden reached Germany by way of Norway 's port of Narvik . Hitler feared British plans to cut off those shipments by laying explosives in Norway 's coastal waters . In April 1940 , German forces invaded Norway . They conquered Denmark on the way . Britain tried to help Norway , but Germany 's airpower prevented many British ships and troops from reaching the country . Norway fell to the Germans in June 1940 . The conquest of Norway secured Germany 's shipments of iron ore . Norway also provided bases for German submarines and aircraft . <p> Chamberlain , the champion of appeasement , resigned after the invasion of Norway . Winston Churchill replaced him as Britain 's prime minister on May 10 , 1940 . Churchill told the British people he had nothing to offer them but " blood , toil , tears , and sweat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countries--Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands--hoped to remain neutral after World War II began . However , Germany launched a blitzkrieg against them on May 10 , 1940 . The Low Countries immediately requested Allied help . But Luxembourg surrendered in one day , and the Netherlands in five days . British and French forces rushed into Belgium and fell into a German trap . As the Allied forces raced northward , the main German invasion cut behind them through the Belgian Ardennes Forest to the south . The Germans reached the English Channel on May 21 . They had nearly surrounded Allied forces in Belgium . <p> King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered on May 28 , 1940 . His surrender left the Allied forces trapped in Belgium in great danger . They were retreating toward the French seaport of Dunkerque on the English Channel . Britain sent all available craft to rescue the troops . The rescue fleet included destroyers , yachts , ferries , fishing vessels , and motorboats . Under heavy bombardment , the vessels evacuated about 338,000 troops from May 26 to June 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the army left behind all its tanks and equipment . The remaining Allied troops in Dunkerque surrendered on June 4 , 1940 . <p> The fall of France . France had expected to fight along a stationary battlefront and had built the Maginot Line for its defence . But German tanks and aircraft went around the Maginot Line . The Germans passed north of the Maginot Line as they swept through Luxembourg and Belgium and into northern France in May 1940 . They launched a major assault against France on June 5 . The blitzkrieg sent French forces reeling backward . As France neared collapse , Italy declared war on France and Great Britain on June 10 . <p> German troops entered Paris on June 14 , 1940 . The French government had already fled the capital . Paul Reynaud had become premier of France in March . Reynaud wanted to fight on . But many of his generals and cabinet officers believed that the battle for France was lost . Reynaud resigned , and a new French government agreed to an armistice ( truce ) on June 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied the northern two-thirds of France and a strip of western France along the Atlantic Ocean . Southern France remained in French control . The town of Vichy became the capital of unoccupied France . Marshal Henri Petain , a French hero of World War I , headed the Vichy government . He largely cooperated with the Germans . Then in November 1942 , German troops occupied all France . <p> One of the French generals , Charles de Gaulle , had escaped to Britain after France fell . In radio broadcasts to France , he urged the people to carry on the fight against Germany . The troops who rallied around de Gaulle became known as the Free French forces . <p> The Battle of Britain . Hitler believed that Great Britain would seek peace with Germany after the fall of France . But Britain fought on alone . Hitler made preparations to cross the English Channel and invade southern England . Before the Germans could invade , however , they had to defeat Britain 's Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . The Battle of Britain , which began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the air . <p> In August 1940 , the German air force , the Luftwaffe , began to attack RAF bases . Germany 's aircraft out-numbered those of the RAF . But radar stations along England 's coast provided warning of approaching German planes and helped the RAF intercept them . <p> Each side greatly overestimated the number of enemy planes it had shot down . By September 1940 , the Luftwaffe mistakenly believed it had destroyed the RAF . The Germans then halted their strikes against RAF bases and began to bomb London and other civilian targets . They hoped to weaken civilian morale and force Britain to surrender . Air raids known as the Blitz took place nearly every night through the autumn and the winter . In May 1941 , Germany finally gave up its attempts to defeat Britain from the air . <p> Hitler 's decision to end the attacks on the RAF enabled Britain to rebuild its air force . Britain 's survival was immensely important later in the war because the country served as a base for the Allied liberation ( freeing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war spreads <p> World War II had become a global conflict by the end of 1941 . Fighting spread to Africa , the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe , and the Soviet Union . The Axis and the Allies also fought each other at sea . In December 1941 , the United States entered the war . <p> Fighting in Africa . The Italians opened battlefronts in Africa at about the time of the Battle of Britain . Mussolini expected easy victories over the small British forces in North Africa . In August 1940 , the Italians pushed eastward from Ethiopia and overran the forces in British Somaliland . The following month , Italian forces that were stationed in Libya invaded Egypt . <p> For two years , the fighting seesawed back and forth across Libya and Egypt . Troops from Australia , New Zealand , India , and South Africa fought alongside British soldiers to keep the Axis out of Egypt . Axis control of Egypt would have cut Britain off from oil fields in the Middle East and from the Suez Canal , the shortest sea route to Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweeping them out of Egypt and back into Libya . An Italian invasion of Greece then drew part of Britain 's force from Africa and ended the advance . <p> Early in 1941 , Hitler sent tank units trained in desert warfare to help the Italians in northern Africa . The tank units , known as the Afrika Korps , were led by General Erwin Rommel . Rommel 's clever tactics earned him the nickname " The Desert Fox . " During the spring , Rommel recaptured the Libyan territory the Italians had lost and drove into Egypt . The British again pushed the Axis forces back into Libya . In May 1942 , Rommel broke through British lines and reached El Alamein , only 320 kilometres from the Suez Canal . <p> However , the Germans did not save Mussolini 's empire in eastern Africa . By May 1941 , Britain had defeated the Italians in British Somaliland and Ethiopia . <p> Fighting in the Balkans .

But Yugoslavia 's armed forces rebelled and overthrew the government . An enraged Hitler ordered that Yugoslavia be crushed . German troops began to pour into the country on April 6 . Yugoslavia surrendered 11 days later . During that time , Hitler had to rescue Mussolini 's troops elsewhere on the Balkan Peninsula . <p> Mussolini had tired of playing Hitler 's junior partner , and he badly wanted a victory to boost his standing . In October 1940 , Italian forces based in Albania invaded Greece . They expected to defeat the poorly equipped Greek army easily . The Greeks fought fiercely , though they were greatly outnumbered . By December , they had driven the Italians out of Greece and had overrun part of Albania . Britain sent a small force to help Greece . But in April 1941 , a much larger German force came to the aid of the Italians . By the end of April , the Axis controlled Greece . <p> British troops in Greece withdrew to the island of Crete in the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German paratroopers descended on Crete and seized an airfield . More German troops then landed . The first airborne invasion in history gave Germany an important base in the Mediterranean by the end of May . <p> The defeats in the Balkans were serious blows to Britain . However , some historians believe that the detours into Yugoslavia and Greece were costly for Hitler because they delayed his invasion of the Soviet Union . Hitler confidently predicted victory over the Soviet Union within eight weeks , and he had failed to prepare for a winter war . <p> The invasion of the Soviet Union . Germany and the Soviet Union proved to be uneasy partners . Hitler viewed the Soviet Union as Germany 's chief enemy . He feared Soviet ambitions to expand in eastern Europe . Hitler also wanted control of Soviet wheat fields and oil fields . His 1939 nonaggression pact with Stalin served merely to keep the Soviet Union out of the war while Germany overran western Europe . <p> Stalin distrusted Hitler , and he sought to obtain more naval bases and to strengthen Soviet borders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Finns surrendered in March 1940 after a fierce fight . In the summer , the Soviet Union seized the countries of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania along the Baltic Sea . <p> Germany 's invasion of the Soviet Union , which was code-named Operation Barbarossa , began on June 22 , 1941 . It took the Soviet Union by surprise . German tanks smashed through Soviet battle lines . During the first few weeks of the campaign , the German armies encircled and killed or captured hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops . As the Germans advanced , the Soviet people destroyed factories , dams , railways , food supplies , and anything else that might be useful to the enemy . The Germans appeared to be heading for victory by late July . They then began to make mistakes . <p> Hitler 's generals wanted to press on to Moscow . But Hitler overruled them . Instead , he reinforced the German armies heading north toward Leningrad ( now St. Petersburg ) and south toward the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea . While the Germans wasted time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German advance slowed in September , though they took Kiev in the south . Heavy rain fell in October , and German tanks and artillery became bogged down in mud . <p> By November 1941 , the Germans had surrounded Leningrad and had begun to encircle Moscow . They reached the suburbs of Moscow by early December . The temperature then plunged to -40 C. An unusually severe Soviet winter had begun early . German troops lacked warm clothing and suffered from frostbite . Their tanks and weapons broke down in the bitter cold . Winter had saved the Soviet Union . <p> The Battle of the Atlantic . Britain 's survival in World War II depended on shipments of food , war materials , and other supplies across the Atlantic Ocean from North America . Throughout the war , Germany tried to destroy such shipments , while Britain struggled to keep its Atlantic shipping lanes open . <p> Germany 's surface fleet was far too weak to challenge Britain 's Royal Navy in battle during World War II .

In May 1941 , a fleet of British warships chased , trapped , and finally sank the Bismarck about 970 kilometres off the coast of France . Afterward , Germany rarely allowed its large warships to leave port . <p> The greatest threat to British shipping came from German submarines , called Unterseeboote or U-boats . U-boats prowled the Atlantic , torpedoing any Allied cargo ships they spotted . The conquest of Norway and of France gave Germany excellent bases for its U-boats . To combat the U-boats , Britain began to use a convoy system . Under that system , cargo ships sailed in large groups escorted by surface warships . But Britain had few such ships available for escort duty . <p> From 1940 to 1942 , Germany appeared to be winning the Battle of the Atlantic . Each month , U-boats sank thousands of tons of Allied shipping . But the Allies gradually overcame the U-boat danger . They used radar and an underwater detection device called sonar to locate German submarines . Long-range aircraft bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their production of warships to accompany convoys . By mid-1943 , the Allies were sinking U-boats faster than Germany could replace them . The crisis in the Atlantic had passed . <p> WORLD WAR II/The war becomes a global conflict <p> Commonwealth nations had entered the war either with or soon after Britain . Australia , New Zealand , and India declared war on Germany on Sept. 3 , 1939 . South Africa did so on Sept. 6 , and Canada on Sept. 10 . Many colonies , including the West Indies and African colonies , sent troops . <p> U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the neutrality of the United States . The majority of people in the United States thought that their country should stay out of World War II . Yet most Americans hoped for an Allied victory . Roosevelt and other interventionists urged all aid " short of war " to nations fighting the Axis . They argued that an Axis victory would endanger democracies everywhere . Isolationists , on the other hand , opposed U.S. aid to warring nations . <p> All the countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only Brazil , Canada , Mexico , and the United States sent troops .

Roosevelt appealed to the United States to become what he called " the arsenal of democracy . " <p> At the start of World War II , U.S. neutrality laws forbade the sale of arms to warring nations . The U.S. Congress soon changed the laws to help Britain and France . A new law permitted warring nations to buy arms for cash . But by late 1940 , Britain had nearly run out of funds for arms . Roosevelt then proposed the Lend-Lease Act , which would permit the United States to lend or lease raw materials , equipment , and weapons to any nation fighting the Axis . The U.S. Congress approved the act in March 1941 .

Japan , not Germany , finally plunged the United States into World War II . By 1940 , Japanese forces were bogged down in China . To force China to surrender , Japan decided to cut off supplies reaching China from Southeast Asia . Japan also wanted the rich resources of Southeast Asia for itself . Japan 's military leaders spoke of building an empire , which they called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . <p> The European colonial powers and the United States opposed Japan 's expansion in Southeast Asia . In 1940 , Japanese troops occupied northern Indochina ( today part of Laos and Vietnam ) . In response , the United States cut off exports to Japan of petroleum , scrap metal , and other important industrial raw materials . Tension rose after Japan seized the rest of Indochina in 1941 . The U.S. government then barred the withdrawal of Japanese funds from American banks . <p> General Hideki Tojo became premier of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders decided to attack the Americans , British , and Dutch in the Pacific . They realized they had to cripple the powerful U.S. Pacific Fleet . <p> On Dec. 7 , 1941 without warning , Japanese aircraft attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor in Hawaii . The bombing of Pearl Harbor was a great success for Japan at first . It disabled much of the American fleet and destroyed many aircraft . But in the long run , the attack on Pearl Harbor proved disastrous for Japan . It propelled the United States into the war . <p> The United States , Britain , and other Allies declared war on Japan on Dec. 8 , 1941 . The next day , China declared war on the Axis . Germany and Italy declared war on the United States on December 11 . World War II had become a global conflict . <p> WORLD WAR II/The Allies attack in Europe and northern Africa <p> Allied defeats in Europe ended late in 1941 .

Allied attacks from the east and the west forced Germany to surrender in 1945 . <p> The strategy . Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin--the leaders of the three major Allied powers--were known during World War II as the Big Three . The Big Three and their military advisers planned the strategy that defeated the Axis . Churchill and Roosevelt conferred frequently on overall strategy . Stalin directed the Soviet war effort but rarely consulted his allies . <p> At a meeting in Washington , D.C. , in December 1941 , Churchill and Roosevelt agreed that the European war must be won first , and that this would call for an Allied invasion of western Europe . Military leaders of the two major Western allies formed the Combined Chiefs of Staff , to exchange ideas and information . The political leaders of the Allies--Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin--relied heavily on their senior military advisers . <p> The main wartime disagreement among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stalin constantly urged Roosevelt and Churchill to open a second fighting front in western Europe and thus draw German troops from the Soviet front . Both Roosevelt and Churchill supported the idea but disagreed on where and when to invade . The Americans wanted to land in northern France as soon as possible . The British argued that an invasion of France before the Allies were fully prepared would be disastrous . Instead , Churchill favoured invading Italy first . This plan was adopted . <p> Roosevelt and Churchill first met in August 1941 aboard ship off the coast of Newfoundland . They issued the Atlantic Charter , a statement of the postwar aims of the United States and Great Britain . After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor , Roosevelt and Churchill agreed that Germany was a nearer and a more dangerous enemy than Japan . They decided to open the second front , to relieve the hard-pressed Soviet forces , and concentrate on defeating Germany . <p> In January 1943 , Roosevelt and Churchill met in Casablanca , Morocco . They agreed to invade the Mediterranean island of Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the conference , Roosevelt announced that the Allies would accept only unconditional ( complete ) surrender from the Axis powers . Churchill supported him . <p> Roosevelt and Churchill first met Stalin in November 1943 in Teheran , Iran . The Big Three discussed plans for a joint British and American invasion of France in the spring of 1944 . They did not meet again until Germany neared collapse . In February 1945 , Roosevelt , Churchill , and Stalin gathered at Yalta , a Soviet city on the Crimean Peninsula . They agreed that their countries would each occupy a zone of Germany after the war . France was to occupy a fourth zone . At the Yalta Conference , Stalin pledged to permit free elections in Poland and other countries in eastern Europe after the war . He later broke that pledge . Roosevelt died in April 1945 , two months after the Yalta Conference . <p> On the Soviet front . Soviet forces struck back at the Germans outside Moscow in December 1941 . The Soviet troops pushed the invaders back about 160 kilometres from Moscow during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moscow as they had been in December 1941 . However , the Soviet recovery was short lived . <p> In the spring of 1942 , the Germans again attacked . They overran the Crimean Peninsula and headed eastward toward Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus region . Hitler ordered General Friedrich von Paulus to press on and to take the city of Stalingrad ( now Volgograd ) . A savage five-month battle for Stalingrad began in late August . By September , German and Soviet soldiers were fighting hand to hand in the heart of the city . <p> With winter approaching , Paulus asked permission to pull back from Stalingrad . Hitler ordered him to hold on and fight . Soviet troops counterattacked in mid-November . Within a week , they had trapped Paulus ' army . The Luftwaffe promised to supply the army by air . But few supplies landed . Each day , thousands of German soldiers froze or starved to death . On Feb. 2 , 1943 , the last German troops in Stalingrad surrendered . <p> The Battle of Stalingrad marked a turning point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 300,000 German troops were killed or captured . An enormous number of Soviet soldiers also died . <p> In northern Africa . The Germans took a beating in northern Africa about the same time as their defeat at Stalingrad . In the summer of 1942 , German and Italian forces led by Rommel faced the British and their allies at El Alamein , Egypt . General Harold Alexander and Lieutenant General Bernard L. Montgomery commanded the British forces in northern Africa . <p> Rommel attacked in late August 1942 at Alam el Halfa , south of El Alamein . The British halted the attack , partly because they had secretly learned of Rommel 's battle plan . Churchill called for an immediate counterattack . But Montgomery refused to rush into battle before he was fully prepared . On October 23 , Montgomery struck at El Alamein . He had broken through the enemy lines by early November . The Axis forces retreated toward Tunisia with the British in hot pursuit . The Battle of El Alamein , like the Battle of Stalingrad , marked a turning point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's string of victories . <p> Soon after the Battle of El Alamein , the Allies invaded French colonies in northern Africa . Allied troops commanded by Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States landed in Algeria and Morocco on Nov. 8 , 1942 . Vichy French forces in northern Africa fought back for a few days . They then joined the Allied side . <p> The Allies hoped to advance rapidly into Tunisia and thereby cut off the Axis forces from their home bases in Italy and Sicily . But Axis troops moved faster and seized Tunisia first . There , Rommel prepared for battle . American troops first engaged in combat with the Germans in February 1943 near Kasserine Pass in northern Tunisia . Rommel defeated the inexperienced Americans in hard fighting . But thereafter , the Allies steadily closed in . The last Axis forces in northern Africa surrendered in May . Rommel had already returned to Germany . By clearing the Axis forces from northern Africa , the Allies obtained bases from which to invade southern Europe . <p> The air war . Before World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-range bomber was the most advanced weapon in the world . They believed that bombers could wipe out cities and industries and so destroy an enemy 's desire and ability to go on fighting . Their theory was tested during World War II . <p> The first great air battle in history opened in 1940 between Germany 's Luftwaffe and Britain 's Royal Air Force . During the Battle of Britain , Marshal Hermann Goering , commander of the Luftwaffe , failed to defeat Britain from the air . RAF fighter planes , including Spitfires and Hurricanes , helped win the Battle of Britain by shooting down German bombers . By May 1941 , the bombing of Britain had largely stopped . But RAF bombers pounded Germany until the end of the war . <p> At first , Britain 's bombing campaign was costly and ineffective . The RAF relied on area bombing in the hope of hitting a target by plastering the area with bombs . It favoured nighttime raids , using Lancasters , Halifaxes , and other heavy bombers . But pilots often missed their targets in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German cities . About 900 bombers battered Cologne on May 30 , 1942 , in the first such massive raid . <p> The United States joined the air war against Germany in 1942 . The American B-17 bombers were known as Flying Fortresses because of their heavy armour and many guns , and they could take much punishment . The B-17 also had a better bombsight than the RAF 's planes . The Americans favoured pinpoint bombing of specific targets during daytime , rather than area bombing at night . From 1943 until the end of the war , bombs rained down on Germany around the clock . <p> In spite of the massive bombardment , German industries continued to increase production , and German morale failed to crack . The air war achieved its goals only during the last 10 months of World War II . In that time , nearly three times as many bombs fell on Germany as in all the rest of the war . By the end of the war , Germany 's cities lay in ruins . Its factories , refineries , railways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German civilians had been killed . Millions more were homeless . The bomber had finally become the weapon its supporters had foreseen . <p> Germany 's air defences rapidly improved during World War II . The Germans used radar to spot incoming bombers , and they used fighter aircraft to shoot them down . In 1944 , Germany introduced the first jet fighter , the Messerschmitt Me-262 . The fast plane could easily overtake the propeller-driven fighters of the Allies . But Hitler failed to use jet fighters effectively , which kept Germany from gaining an advantage in the air war . <p> In 1944 , Germany used the first guided missiles against Britain . The V-1 and V-2 missiles caused great damage and took many lives . But the Germans introduced the weapons too late to affect the war 's outcome . <p> The invasion of Italy . The Allies planned to invade Sicily after driving the Axis forces out of northern Africa . Axis planes bombed Allied ships in the Mediterranean Sea from bases in Sicily . The Allies wanted to make the Mediterranean safe for their ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock a war-weary Italy out of the war . <p> Allied forces under Eisenhower landed along Sicily 's south coast on July 10 , 1943 . For 39 days , they engaged in bitter fighting with German troops over rugged terrain . The last Germans left Sicily on August 17 . <p> Mussolini fell from power on July 25 , 1943 , after the invasion of Sicily . The Italian government imprisoned Mussolini , but German paratroopers later rescued him . Italy 's new premier , Field Marshal Pietro Badoglio , began secret peace talks with the Allies . Badoglio hoped to prevent Italy from becoming a battleground . Italy surrendered on September 3 . However , Field Marshal Albert Kesselring , Germany 's commander in the Mediterranean region , was determined to fight the Allies for control of Italy . <p> Allied forces led by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark of the United States landed at Salerno , Italy , on Sept. 9 , 1943 . They fought hard just to stay ashore . Another Allied force had already landed farther south . The Allies slowly struggled up the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions . By early November , the Allies had nearly reached Cassino , about 120 kilometres south of Rome . But they failed to pierce German defences there . Some of the most brutal fighting of World War II occurred near Cassino . <p> In January 1944 , the Allies landed troops at Anzio , west of Cassino , in an effort to attack the Germans from behind . However , German forces kept the Allies pinned down on the beaches at Anzio for four months . Thousands of Allied soldiers died there . <p> The Allies finally broke through German defences in Italy in May 1944 . Rome fell on June 4 . The Germans held their positions in northern Italy through the autumn and winter . But in the spring , the Allies swept toward the Alps . German forces in Italy surrendered on May 2 , 1945 . Mussolini had been captured and shot by Italian resistance fighters on April 28 . <p> D-Day . Soon after the evacuation of Dunkerque in 1940 , Great Britain started to plan a return to France . In 1942 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the English Channel . That summer , the Allies raided the French port of Dieppe on the channel . The raiders met strong German defences and suffered heavy losses . The Dieppe raid convinced the Allies that landing on open beaches had a better chance of success than landing in a port . <p> Throughout 1943 , preparations moved ahead for an invasion of northern France the following year . The invasion plan received the code name Operation Overlord . The Allies assembled huge amounts of equipment and great numbers of troops for Overlord in southern England . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was selected to command the invasion . <p> The Germans expected an Allied invasion along the north coast of France in 1944 . But they were unsure where . A chain of fortifications , which the Germans called the Atlantic Wall , ran along the coast . Hitler placed Rommel in charge of strengthening German defences along the English Channel . Rommel brought in artillery , mined the water and the beaches , and strung up barbed wire . The Germans concentrated their troops near Calais , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies planned to land farther west , in a region of northern France called Normandy . <p> The Allies chose Monday , June 5 , 1944 , as D-Day--the date of the Normandy invasion . Rough seas forced them to postpone D-Day until June 6 . During the night , about 2,700 ships carrying landing craft and 176,000 soldiers crossed the channel . Minesweepers had gone ahead to clear the water . Paratroopers dropped behind German lines to capture bridges and railway tracks . At dawn , battleships opened fire on the beaches . At 6:30 A.M. , Allied troops stormed ashore on a 100-kilometre front in the largest seaborne invasion in history . <p> D-Day took the Germans by surprise . But they fought back fiercely . At one landing site , code-named Omaha Beach , U.S. troops came under heavy fire and barely managed to stay ashore . Nevertheless , all five Allied landing beaches were secure by the end of D-Day . The Allies soon had an artificial harbour in place for unloading more troops and supplies . A pipeline carried fuel across the channel . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached France . <p> The Allied forces advanced slowly at first . The Americans struggled westward to capture the badly needed port of Cherbourg . British and Canadian soldiers fought their way to Caen . The battle for Cherbourg ended on June 27 . Caen , which the British hoped to capture on D-Day , fell on July 18 . Near the end of July , the Allies finally broke through German lines into open country . <p> The drive to the Rhine . On July 25 , 1944 , Allied bombers blasted a gap in the German front near St.-Lo , about 80 kilometres southeast of Cherbourg . The U.S. Third Army under Lieutenant General George S. Patton drove through the hole . The battlefield had opened up . During August , the Allies cleared the Germans out of most of northwestern France . Allied bombers hounded the retreating Germans . <p> Patton 's army rolled eastward toward Paris . On Aug. 19 , 1944 , Parisians rose up against the occupying German forces . Hitler ordered the city destroyed . But his generals delayed carrying out the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 25 . <p> In mid-August 1944 , Allied forces landed in southern France . They moved rapidly up the Rhone River Valley . Meanwhile , Patton raced eastward toward the German border and the Rhine River . In late August , his tanks ran out of fuel . To the north , British forces led by Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery swept into Belgium and captured Antwerp on September 4 . The Allies planned a daring airborne operation to carry them across the Rhine . On September 17 , about 20,000 paratroopers dropped behind German lines to seize bridges in the Netherlands . But bad weather and other problems hampered the Arnhem operation . It became clear that victory over Germany would have to wait until 1945 . <p> Germany 's generals knew they were beaten . But Hitler pulled his failing resources together for another assault . On Dec. 16 , 1944 , German troops surprised and overwhelmed the Americans in the Ardennes Forest in Belgium and Luxembourg . However , the Germans lacked the troops and fuel to turn their thrust into a breakthrough . Within two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meuse River in Belgium . The Ardennes offensive is also known as the Battle of the Bulge because of the bulging shape of the battleground on a map . <p> The Soviet advance . The Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad ended Germany 's progress in eastern Europe . After January 1943 , Soviet soldiers slowly pushed the Germans back . Soviet forces had improved by 1943 , and they greatly outnumbered the opposing German armies . Supplies poured into the Soviet Union from Britain and the United States , and Soviet factories had geared up for wartime production . <p> Nevertheless , the Germans returned to the offensive in July 1943 , near the Soviet city of Kursk . They massed about 3,000 tanks for the assault . Soviet forces lay waiting for them . In one of the greatest tank battles in history , Soviet mines , tanks , antitank guns , and aircraft blew apart many German tanks . Hitler finally called off the attack to save his remaining tanks . <p> Soviet troops moved slowly forward during the summer and autumn of 1943 . In January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had begun in September 1941 . It had been the longest siege in modern history . About a million Leningraders died during the siege , mostly from lack of food and heat .

By late July , Soviet troops had reached the outskirts of Warsaw . Poland 's Home Army rose up against German forces in Warsaw on August 1 . But Soviet troops refused to come to Poland 's aid . Stalin permitted the Germans to destroy the Home Army , which might have resisted his plans to set up a Communist government in Poland after the war . The Home Army surrendered after two months . More than 200,000 Poles died during the Warsaw uprising . Soviet forces entered Warsaw in January 1945 . <p> Meanwhile , Soviet troops drove into Romania and Bulgaria .

Soviet soldiers reached the Oder River , about 65 kilometres east of Berlin , in January . Allied forces in the west occupied positions along the Rhine by early March . <p> British and Canadian forces cleared the Germans out of the Netherlands and swept into northern Germany . American and French forces raced toward the Elbe River in central Germany . Hitler ordered his soldiers to fight to the death . But large numbers of German soldiers surrendered each day . <p> As they advanced , the Allies discovered horrifying evidence of Nazi brutality . Hitler had ordered the imprisonment and murder of millions of Jews and members of other minority groups in concentration camps . The starving survivors of the death camps gave proof of the terrible suffering of those who had already died . <p> The capture of Berlin , Germany 's capital , was left to Soviet forces . By April 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunker ( shelter ) deep underground , Hitler ordered German soldiers to fight on . On April 30 , however , Hitler committed suicide . He remained convinced that his cause had been right but that the German people had proven unworthy of his rule . <p> Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz briefly succeeded Hitler as the leader of Germany . Doenitz arranged for Germany 's surrender . On May 7 , 1945 , Colonel General Alfred Jodl , chief of staff of the German armed forces , signed a statement of unconditional surrender at Eisenhower 's headquarters in Reims , France . World War II had ended in Europe . The Allies declared May 8 as V-E Day , or Victory in Europe Day . <p> WORLD WAR II/The war in Asia and the Pacific <p> The attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 , left the U.S. Pacific Fleet powerless to halt Japan 's expansion . During the next six months , Japanese forces swept across Southeast Asia and the western Pacific Ocean . Japan 's empire reached its greatest size in August 1942 . It stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burma , and south to the Netherlands Indies ( now Indonesia ) . The Allies halted Japan 's expansion in the summer of 1942 . They nibbled away at its empire until Japan agreed to surrender in August 1945 . <p> Early Japanese victories . On Dec. 8 , 1941 , within hours of the attack on Pearl Harbor , Japanese bombers struck the British colony of Hong Kong on the south coast of China and two U.S. islands in the Pacific Ocean--Guam and Wake . The Japanese invaded Thailand the same day . Thailand surrendered within hours and joined the Axis . Japanese troops took Hong Kong , Guam , and Wake Island by Christmas . <p> From Thailand , Japanese forces soon advanced into Malaya ( now part of Malaysia ) and Burma . Great Britain then ruled that region . The British wrongly believed that soldiers could not penetrate the thick jungles of the Malay Peninsula . They expected an assault by sea instead . But Japanese troops streamed through the jungles and rapidly overran the peninsula . <p> By late January 1942 , the Japanese had pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of the Malay Peninsula . The Japanese stormed the island on February 8 , and Singapore surrendered a week later . Japan captured about 85,000 soldiers , making the fall of Singapore Britain 's worst military defeat ever . <p> Japan 's next target was the petroleum-rich Netherlands Indies , south of Malaya . Allied warships protected those islands . Japan 's navy mauled the ships in February 1942 in the Battle of the Java Sea . The Netherlands Indies fell in early March . <p> Meanwhile , Japanese forces had advanced into southern Burma . China sent troops into Burma to help Britain hold onto the Burma Road . Weapons , food , and other goods travelled over that supply route from India to China . In April 1942 , Japan seized and shut down the Burma Road . The Japanese had driven Allied forces from most of Burma by mid-May . <p> Only the conquest of the Philippines took longer than Japan expected . Japan had begun landing troops in the Philippines on Dec. 10 , 1941 . American and Philippine forces commanded by U.S. General Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forces abandoned Manila , the capital of the Philippines , and withdrew to nearby Bataan Peninsula . Although suffering from malnutrition and disease , they beat back Japanese attacks for just over three months . <p> President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to Australia , and he left the Philippines in March 1942 . He promised the Filipinos , " I shall return . " On April 9 , about 75,000 exhausted U.S. troops on Bataan surrendered to the Japanese . Most of them were forced to march about 105 kilometres to prison camps . Many prisoners died of disease and mistreatment during what became known as the Bataan Death March . Some soldiers held out on Corregidor Island , near Bataan , until May 6 . By then , the Japanese were victorious everywhere . <p> Japan 's string of quick victories astonished even the Japanese . It terrified the Allies . The fall of the Netherlands Indies left Australia unprotected . The capture of Burma brought the Japanese to India 's border . Australia and India feared invasion . Japanese planes bombed Darwin on Australia 's north coast in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 helped turn the tide against Japan . They were ( 1 ) the Doolittle raid , ( 2 ) the Battle of the Coral Sea , and ( 3 ) the Battle of Midway . <p> The Doolittle raid . To show that Japan could be beaten , the United States staged a daring bombing raid on the Japanese homeland . On April 18 , 1942 , Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle led 16 B-25 bombers in a surprise attack on Tokyo and other Japanese cities . The bombers took off from the deck of the Hornet , an aircraft carrier more than 960 kilometres east of Japan . The raid did very little damage . But it alarmed Japan 's leaders , who had believed that their homeland was safe from Allied bombs . To prevent future raids , the Japanese determined to capture more islands to the south and the east and so extend the country 's defences . They soon found themselves in trouble . <p> The Battle of the Coral Sea . In May 1942 , a Japanese invasion force sailed toward Australia 's base at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Guinea . Port Moresby lay at Australia 's doorstep . American warships met the Japanese force in the Coral Sea , northeast of Australia . The Battle of the Coral Sea , fought from May 4 to 8 , was unlike all earlier naval battles . It was the first naval battle in which opposing ships never sighted one another . Planes based on aircraft carriers did all the fighting . Neither side won a clear victory . But the battle halted the assault on Port Moresby and temporarily checked the threat to Australia . <p> The Battle of Midway . Japan next sent a large fleet to capture Midway Island at the westernmost tip of the Hawaiian chain . The United States had cracked Japan 's naval code and thus learned about the coming invasion . Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet , gathered the ships that had survived the raid on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of the Coral Sea . He prepared to ambush the Japanese . <p> The Battle of Midway opened on June 4 , 1942 , with a Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and launched torpedoes against Japanese warships . But Japanese guns shot down most of the slow-moving planes . American dive bombers swooped in next . They pounded enemy aircraft carriers while their planes refuelled on deck . During the three-day battle , the Japanese lost 4 aircraft carriers and more than 200 planes and skilled pilots . Japan sank 1 U.S. aircraft carrier and shot down about 150 U.S. planes . <p> The Battle of Midway was the first clear Allied victory over Japan in World War II . Aircraft carriers had become the most important weapon in the war in the Pacific . Japan 's naval power was crippled by the loss of 4 of its 9 aircraft carriers . <p> Although Japan failed to capture Midway , it seized two islands at the tip of Alaska 's Aleutian chain on June 7 , 1942 . The Americans drove the Japanese out of the Aleutians in the spring and summer of 1943 . <p> The South Pacific . After the Battle of Midway , the Allies were determined to stop Japanese expansion in the South Pacific . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle campaigns on Pacific islands . The jungle itself was a terrifying enemy . Heavy rains drenched the troops and turned the jungle into a foul-smelling swamp . The men had to hack their way through tangled , slimy vegetation and wade through knee-deep mud . Japanese snipers hid everywhere , waiting to shoot unsuspecting Allied troops . Scorpions and snakes were a constant menace . Malaria and other tropical diseases took a heavy toll . <p> The Allies also encountered Japan 's strict military code in the South Pacific . The code required Japanese soldiers to fight to the death . Japanese soldiers believed that surrender meant disgrace , and the Allies rarely captured them alive . When cornered , the Japanese sometimes charged at Allied troops in nighttime suicide attacks . Rather than admit defeat , Japan 's military leaders took their lives by stabbing themselves in the abdomen according to the tradition of hara-kiri . <p> The Allies developed two major campaigns against Japan in the South Pacific . One force under General MacArthur checked the Japanese on New Guinea . Another force under Admiral Nimitz fought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies aimed at taking the port of Rabaul on New Britain . Rabaul was Japan 's chief base in the South Pacific . Japanese aircraft and warships attacked Allied ships from Rabaul , and Japan supplied other islands in the South Pacific from that base . <p> New Guinea . In the summer of 1942 , Japanese troops began an overland drive across New Guinea 's rugged , jungle-covered mountains to the Australian base of Port Moresby on the south coast . An Allied force made up chiefly of Australians quickly counterattacked . By November , the Japanese had been pushed back across the mountains . The Americans then attacked Japanese positions along the north coast in a series of brilliant operations that combined air , sea , and land forces . Brutal fighting continued on New Guinea until mid-1944 . <p> Guadalcanal . On Aug. 7 , 1942 , U.S. marines invaded the island of Guadalcanal in the first stage of a campaign in the Solomon Islands . The Japanese were building an air base on Guadalcanal from which to attack Allied ships . The invasion took the Japanese by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle developed . <p> The six-month battle for Guadalcanal was one of the most vicious campaigns of World War II . Each side depended on its navy to land supplies and troop reinforcements . In a series of naval battles , the Allies gained control of the waters surrounding Guadalcanal . They then cut off Japanese shipments . Until that time , Allied supplies had been short , and the U.S. marines had depended on rice captured from the enemy . By February 1943 , the starving Japanese had evacuated Guadalcanal . <p> After taking Guadalcanal , American forces led by Admiral William F. Halsey worked their way up the Solomon Islands . In November 1943 , the Americans reached Bougainville at the top of the island chain . They defeated the Japanese there in March 1944 . <p> Rabaul . In the summer of 1943 , Allied military leaders cancelled the invasion of Rabaul . Instead , American bombers pounded the Japanese base , and aircraft and submarines sank shipments headed for Rabaul . About 100,000 Japanese defenders waited there for an attack that never came . The Allies spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Island hopping in the Central Pacific . From late 1943 until the autumn of 1944 , the Allies hopped from island to island across the Central Pacific toward the Philippines . During the island-hopping campaign , the Allies became expert at amphibious ( seaborne ) invasions . Each island they captured provided a base from which to strike the next target . But rather than capture every island , the Allies by-passed Japanese strongholds and invaded islands that were weakly held . That strategy , known as leapfrogging , saved time and lives . Leapfrogging carried the Allies across the Gilbert , Marshall , Caroline , and Mariana islands in the Central Pacific . <p> Admiral Nimitz selected the Gilbert Islands as the first major objective in the island-hopping campaign . American marines invaded Tarawa in the Gilberts in November 1943 . The attackers met heavy fire from Japanese troops in concrete bunkers . But they inched forward and captured the tiny island after four days of savage fighting . About 4,500 Japanese soldiers died defending the island . Only 17 remained alive . More than 3,000 marines were killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphibious operations because of lessons they had learned at Tarawa . As a result , fewer men died in later landings . <p> In February 1944 , U.S. marines and infantrymen moved north to the Marshall Islands . They captured Kwajalein and Enewetak in relatively smooth operations . Allied military leaders meanwhile had decided to by-pass Truk , a key Japanese naval base in the Caroline Islands west of the Marshalls . They bombed Truk instead and made it unusable as a base . <p> The Americans made their next jump to the Mariana Islands , about 1,600 kilometres northwest of Enewetak . Bitter fighting for the Marianas began in June 1944 . In the Battle of the Philippine Sea on June 19 and 20 , Japan 's navy once again attempted to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet . During the battle , which was fought near the island of Guam , the Allies severely damaged Japan 's navy and destroyed its airpower . Japan lost 3 aircraft carriers and about 480 aeroplanes , or more than three-quarters of the planes it sent into battle . The loss of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By August 1944 , American forces occupied Guam , Saipan , and Tinian--the three largest islands in the Marianas . The occupation of the Marianas brought Allied forces within bombing distance of Japan . Tojo resigned as Japan 's prime minister in July 1944 after the loss of Saipan . In November , American B-29 bombers began using bases in the Marianas to raid Japan . <p> A final hop before the invasion of the Philippines took U.S. forces to the Palau Islands in September 1944 . The islands lie between the Marianas and the Philippines . The attackers met stiff resistance on Peleliu , the chief Japanese base in the Palaus . About 25 per cent of the Americans were killed or injured in a month-long fight . <p> The liberation of the Philippines . The campaigns in New Guinea and the Central Pacific brought the Allies within striking distance of the Philippine Islands . MacArthur and Nimitz combined their forces to liberate the Philippines . Allied leaders decided to invade the island of Leyte in the central Philippines in the autumn of 1944 . <p> The Allies expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They therefore assembled the largest landing force ever used in the Pacific campaigns . About 750 ships participated in the invasion of Leyte , which began on Oct. 20 , 1944 . It had taken the U.S. commander MacArthur , more than 21/2 years and many brutal battles to keep his pledge to return to the Philippines . <p> While Allied troops poured ashore on Leyte , Japan 's navy tried yet again to crush the U.S. Pacific Fleet . The Battle for Leyte Gulf , which was fought from Oct. 23 to 26 , 1944 , was the the greatest naval battle in history in total tonnage . In all , 282 ships took part . The battle ended in a major victory for the United States . Japan 's navy was so badly damaged that it was no longer a serious threat for the rest of the war . <p> During the Battle for Leyte Gulf , the Japanese unleashed a terrifying new weapon--the kamikaze ( suicide pilot ) . Kamikazes crashed planes filled with explosives onto Allied warships and died as a result . Many kamikazes were shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kamikaze became one of Japan 's major weapons during the rest of the war . <p> The fight for Leyte continued until the end of 1944 . On Jan. 9 , 1945 , the Allies landed on the island of Luzon and began to work their way toward Manila . The city fell in early March . The remaining Japanese troops on Luzon pulled back to the mountains and went on fighting until the war ended . <p> About 350,000 Japanese soldiers died during the campaign in the Philippines . American casualties numbered nearly 14,000 dead and about 48,000 wounded or missing . Japan was clearly doomed to defeat after losing the Philippines . But it did not intend to surrender . <p> The China-Burma-India theatre . While fighting raged in the Pacific , the Allies also fought the Japanese on the Asian mainland . The chief theatre of operations ( area of military activity ) involved China , Burma , and India . By mid-1942 , Japan held much of eastern and southern China and had conquered nearly all Burma . The Japanese had closed the Burma Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China lacked equipment and trained troops and barely managed to go on fighting . But the Western Allies wanted to keep China in the war because the Chinese tied down hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops . For three years , the Allies flew war supplies over the world 's tallest mountain system , the Himalaya , from India to China . The route was known as " the Hump . " <p> China . By 1942 , five years after Japan had invaded China , the opposing armies were near exhaustion . Japanese troops staged attacks especially to capture China 's food supplies for themselves and to starve the country into surrender . As a result , millions of Chinese people died from lack of food during the war . <p> A struggle between China 's Nationalist government , headed by Chiang Kai-shek , and Chinese Communists further weakened the country 's war effort . At first , the Nationalist forces and the Communists had joined in fighting the Japanese invaders . But their cooperation gradually broke down as they prepared to fight each other after the war . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . The United States trained pilots and established an air force in China . By the end of 1943 , Allied pilots controlled the skies over China . But they could not help exhausted Chinese troops on the ground . A U.S. commander , Major General Joseph W. Stilwell , served as Chiang 's chief of staff and trained the Chinese army . <p> Burma . The Allied campaign in Burma was closely linked to the fighting in China . From 1943 until early 1945 , the Allies fought to recapture Burma from the Japanese and reopen a land route to China . But rugged jungle , heavy rains , and a shortage of troops and supplies hampered the Allies in Burma . The 14th Army , commanded by the British General William Slim , fought a long and exhausting campaign against the Japanese . <p> Admiral Louis Mountbatten of Great Britain became supreme Allied commander in Southeast Asia in August 1943 . He directed several successful offensives in Burma in late 1943 and in 1944 . By the end of 1944 , Allied forces had battled their way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route across northern Burma to China in January 1945 . Rangoon , Burma 's capital , fell to the Allies in May . The Allies finally regained Burma . <p> India . India became an important supply base and training centre for Allied forces during World War II . Japan 's conquest of Burma in 1942 placed India in great danger . In early 1944 , Japanese troops invaded India and encircled the towns of Imphal and Kohima just inside India 's border . The British supplied the towns by air . The attackers finally began to withdraw from India late in June . Thousands of Japanese soldiers died of disease and starvation during the retreat . <p> Closing in on Japan . Superiority at sea and in the air enabled the Allies to close in on Japan in early 1945 . By then , Japan had lost much of its empire , most of its aircraft and cargo ships , and nearly all its warships . Hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers remained stranded on Pacific islands by-passed by the Allies . American B-29 bombers were pounding Japan 's industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . <p> In January 1945 , Major General Curtis E. LeMay , an American commander , took command of the Allied air war against Japan . LeMay ordered more frequent and more daring raids . American bombers increased their accuracy by flying in low during nighttime raids . They began to drop incendiary ( fire-producing ) bombs that set Japanese cities aflame . A massive incendiary raid in March 1945 destroyed the heart of Tokyo . By the end of the month , about 3 million people in Tokyo were homeless . <p> Japan 's military leaders went on fighting , though they faced certain defeat . The Allies needed more bases to step up the bombing campaign against Japan . They chose the Japanese islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa . <p> Iwo Jima lies about 1,210 kilometres south of Japan . About 21,000 Japanese troops were stationed there . They prepared to defend the tiny island from fortified caves and underground tunnels . Allied aircraft began bombarding Iwo Jima seven months before the invasion . American marines landed on Feb. 19 , 1945 , and made slow progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 25,000 marines--about 30 per cent of the landing force--were killed or wounded in the campaign for Iwo Jima . <p> Okinawa , the next stop on the Allied route toward Japan , lies about 565 kilometres southwest of Japan . Allied troops began to pour ashore on Okinawa on April 1 , 1945 . Japan sent kamikazes to attack the landing force . By the time the battle ended on June 21 , kamikazes had sunk at least 30 ships and damaged more than 350 others . The capture of Okinawa cost the Allies about 50,000 casualties . About 110,000 Japanese died , including many civilians who chose to commit suicide rather than be conquered . <p> By the summer of 1945 , some members of Japan 's government favoured surrender . But others insisted that Japan fight on . The Allies planned to invade Japan in November 1945 . Allied military planners feared that the invasion might cost as many as 1 million Allied lives . Some Allied leaders believed that Soviet help was needed to defeat Japan , and they had encouraged Stalin to invade Manchuria . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The atomic bomb . In 1939 , the German-born scientist Albert Einstein had informed U.S. President Roosevelt about the possibility of creating a superbomb . It would produce an extremely powerful explosion by splitting the atom . Einstein and other scientists feared that Germany might develop such a bomb first . In 1942 , American , British and other scientists began work on the Manhattan Project , a top-secret programme to develop an atomic bomb . The first test explosion of an atomic bomb occurred in the United States in July 1945 . <p> President Roosevelt died in April 1945 , and Vice President Harry S. Truman became president of the United States . Truman met with Churchill and Stalin in Potsdam , Germany , in July , shortly after Germany 's defeat . At the Potsdam Conference , Truman learned of the successful test explosion of the atomic bomb and informed the other leaders of it . The United States , Britain , and China then issued a statement threatening to destroy Japan unless it surrendered unconditionally . In spite of the warning , Japan went on fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb used in warfare on the Japanese city of Hiroshima . The explosion killed from 70,000 to 100,000 people , it is estimated , and destroyed about 13 square kilometres . After Japanese leaders failed to respond to the bombing , the United States dropped a larger bomb on Nagasaki on August 9 . It killed about 40,000 people . Later , thousands more died of injuries and radiation from the two bombings . Meanwhile , on August 8 , the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria . Soviet troops raced south toward Korea . <p> Victory in the Pacific . Although Japan 's emperors had traditionally stayed out of politics , Hirohito urged the government to surrender . On August 14 , Japan agreed to end the war . Some of the country 's military leaders committed suicide . <p> On Sept. 2 , 1945 , representatives of Japan signed the official statement of surrender aboard the U.S. battleship Missouri , which lay at anchor in Tokyo Bay . Representatives of all the Allied nations were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Victory over Japan Day . World War II had ended . <p> WORLD WAR II/The secret war <p> Throughout World War II , a secret war was fought between the Allies and the Axis to obtain information about each other 's activities and to weaken each other 's war effort . Codebreakers tried to decipher secret communications , and spies worked behind enemy lines to gather information . Saboteurs tried to disrupt activities on the home front . Many people in Axis-held territories joined undercover resistance groups that opposed the occupying forces . All the warring nations used propaganda to influence public opinion . <p> The Ultra secret . Soon after the outbreak of World War II , Britain obtained , with the help of Polish spies , one of the machines Germany used to code secret messages . In an outstanding effort , British mathematicians and codebreakers solved the machine 's electronic coding procedures . Britain 's ability to read many of Germany 's wartime communications was known as the Ultra secret . Ultra helped the Allies defeat Germany . <p> The Ultra secret played an important role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Ultra supplied advance warning of where and when the Luftwaffe planned to attack . Ultra also helped Montgomery defeat the Germans in Egypt in 1942 by providing him with Rommel 's battle plan . The British carefully guarded the Ultra secret . They were extremely cautious about using their knowledge so that Germany would not change its coding procedures . The Germans never discovered that Britain had broken their code . <p> Spies and saboteurs were specially trained by the warring nations . Spies reported on troop movements , defence build-ups , and other developments behind enemy lines . Spies of Allied nations also supplied resistance groups with weapons and explosives . Saboteurs hampered the enemy 's war effort in any way they could . For example , they blew up factories and bridges , and organized slowdowns in war plants . <p> Germany had spies in many countries . But its efforts at spying were less successful in general than those of the Allies . The Allied governments set up wartime agencies to engage in spying and sabotage . These agencies included the British Special Operation Executive ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( OSS ) . The Soviet Union operated networks of spies in Allied nations as well as in Germany and Japan . <p> Resistance groups sprang up in every Axis-occupied country . Resistance began with individual acts of defiance against the occupiers . Gradually , like-minded people banded together and worked in secret to overthrow the invaders . The activities of resistance groups expanded as the war continued . Their work included publishing and distributing illegal newspapers , rescuing Allied aircrews shot down behind enemy lines , gathering information about the enemy , and sabotage . <p> In such countries as France , Yugoslavia , and Burma , resistance groups engaged in guerrilla warfare . They organized bands of fighters who staged raids , ambushes , and other small attacks against the occupation forces . <p> All resistance movements suffered many setbacks . But they also achieved outstanding successes . For example , the French resistance interfered with German efforts to turn back the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944 . Norwegian resistance workers destroyed a shipment of heavy water headed for Germany . Heavy water is a substance needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective resistance movement of all--the Partisans . With Allied help , the Partisans drove the Germans out of Yugoslavia in 1944 . <p> Even in Germany itself , a small underground movement opposed the Nazis . In July 1944 , a group of German army officers planted a bomb intended to kill Hitler . However , Hitler escaped the explosion with minor injuries . He ordered the plotters arrested and executed . <p> The risks of joining the resistance were great . A resistance worker caught by the Nazis faced certain death . The Germans sometimes rounded up and executed hundreds of civilians in revenge for an act of sabotage against their occupation forces . <p> Propaganda . All the warring nations used propaganda to win support for their policies . Governments aimed propaganda at their own people and at the enemy . Radio broadcasts reached the largest audiences . Films , posters , and cartoons were also used . <p> The Nazis skilfully used propaganda to spread their beliefs . Joseph Goebbels directed Germany 's Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment , which controlled publications , radio programmes , films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ministry worked to persuade people of the superiority of German culture and of Germany 's right to rule the world . <p> Mussolini stirred the Italians with dreams of restoring Italy to the glory of ancient Rome . Italy 's propaganda also ridiculed the fighting ability of Allied soldiers . <p> Japan promised conquered peoples a share in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere , which would unite all eastern Asia under Japanese control . Using the slogan " Asia for the Asians , " the Japanese claimed that they were freeing Asia from European rule . <p> Nightly news bulletins beamed by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) to the European mainland provided truthful information about the day 's fighting . The Nazis made it a crime for people in Germany and German-held lands to listen to BBC broadcasts . In 1942 , the Voice of America , a U.S. government radio service , began broadcasting to Axis-occupied countries . <p> The warring countries also engaged in psychological warfare intended to destroy the enemy 's will to fight . Allied planes dropped leaflets over Germany that told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who broadcast radio programmes to weaken the morale of Allied soldiers . For example , William Joyce , a Briton who claimed German citizenship , made broadcasts from Germany . He was nicknamed " Lord Haw-Haw . " An American , Iva D'Aquino , who was called " Tokyo Rose , " broadcast for Japan . Such broadcasts merely amused most troops and civilians who heard them . <p> WORLD WAR II/On the home front <p> World War II affected the civilian populations of all the fighting nations . But the effects were extremely uneven . Much of Europe and large parts of Asia suffered widespread destruction and hardship . The United States , Canada , and Australia , which lay far from the battlefronts , were spared most of the horror of war . <p> The Allied war effort . Most people living in Allied countries fully backed the war effort . Nearly all Allied citizens despised Nazism and wished to defeat it . They also wanted to defeat Japanese militarism . <p> Producing for the war . Victory in World War II required an enormous amount of war materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and weapons . The United States , in particular , built many plants to manufacture war goods . Governments also turned old factories into war plants . For example , car factories began to produce tanks and aircraft . <p> The United States hugely increased its output . The U.S. government called for the production of 60,000 aircraft during 1942--a goal many industrialists believed was impossible to achieve . Yet U.S. war plants turned out nearly 86,000 planes the following year . Shipbuilding gains were just as impressive . For example , the time needed to build an aircraft carrier dropped from 36 months in 1941 to 15 months in 1945 . Britain , with factories frequently damaged in air raids , maintained and even increased its output during World War II . Nations such as Canada and Australia had become more important industrial powers by the war 's end . <p> Millions of women in the Allied nations joined the labour force during World War II , after men left for combat . Women worked in shipyards and aircraft factories and filled many jobs previously held only by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firewatchers , and air raid wardens . They also worked in voluntary services helping people who lost homes and belongings in air raids . Women replaced men on farms as well as in factories . They helped to raise the crops that fed Allied troops . <p> Financing the war . The war put the economies of the warring nations under great strain . Governments borrowed from individuals and businesses by selling them war bonds , certificates , notes , and stamps . Taxes also helped pay war costs . There were " economy drives " to increase efficiency , and avoid waste of reusable materials such as scrap metal . Even the richest Allied nation , the United States , spent more money than it raised to pay for the war . National debts increased . <p> Government controls over civilian life increased in most Allied nations . Governments set up various agencies and ministries to direct the war effort . These bodies controlled factory production , limited price increases , censored newspapers and newsreels , and set up rationing schemes to distribute scarce goods fairly . Each family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items as sugar , meat , butter , and clothing . <p> Mobilizing for the war . Great Britain , the United States , and other Allied nations introduced conscription or draft ( compulsory military service ) . Britain introduced conscription in 1940 , for men aged between 181/2 and 51 for both military and industrial service , and for women aged between 20 and 30 for industrial service and the women 's auxiliary forces . Boys and girls between 16 and 18 had to register for possible enrolment in youth organizations . Australia , New Zealand , Canada , and South Africa also introduced conscription , and similar call-up rules were applied in other Allied nations . The United States introduced its first peacetime conscription in 1940 , requiring all men between the ages of 21 and 35 to register for military service . The U.S. draft was later extended to men aged 18 to 45 . All over the world , millions of men were called up to serve in the army , navy , or air force . Millions more men volunteered . <p> Women also served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clerks , and cooks , and also filled many other noncombat positions . <p> Some people who did work of special importance , such as engineers , were not liable for conscription . In Britain , young men were conscripted to work in the coal mines , as well as in the armed services . <p> In all the Allied countries , civilians left their jobs to serve in the armed forces . Soon after war began in 1939 , Commonwealth troops began moving into combat areas alongside British and other Allied forces . The Australian 6th Division was raised shortly after Sept. 1939 and left for the Middle East in January 1940 . Many other Commonwealth troops were stationed in Great Britain . <p> Later , after the United States entered the war , large numbers of U.S. troops were based in Britain . For many people in Britain , it was their first chance of meeting men and women from these countries . Relations between civilians and soldiers were usually good . After the war many Americans returned home with British wives , who were known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans , Italians , Japanese and other citizens of Axis nations living in Allied countries risked being interned , or held in restriction , as enemy aliens . In the United States , only newly arrived Japanese immigrants were treated unjustly . After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 , some Americans directed their anger at people of Japanese ancestry . In 1942 , anti-Japanese hysteria led the U.S. government to move about 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from their homes on the west coast of the United States to relocation camps inland . About two-thirds of these people were United States citizens . <p> Civil defence . The civilian population of Great Britain united wholeheartedly behind the war effort . People worked long hours in factories and accepted severe shortages of food , clothing , and other goods . Many suffered bomb damage to their homes . World War II was a war in which civilians were in the front line . Government planners in Britain expected air raids . They based their plans on the experience of the Spanish Civil War , in which bombing from the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made , involving the police , ambulance and rescue services , and fire brigades . Air raid wardens worked in every neighbourhood , reporting to a central control on each bomb incident during an air raid . Civilians worked to rescue people trapped in bombed buildings . Firefighters controlled fierce blazes that engulfed streets and factories . Men too old for the armed forces volunteered to serve in a reserve local defence force known as the Home Guard . <p> In Germany , most of the people greeted the start of World War II with little enthusiasm . But Germany 's string of easy victories from 1939 to mid-1941 stirred support for the war . By the summer of 1941 , the Germans did not expect the war to last much longer . <p> Civilian life . Food , clothing , and other consumer goods remained plentiful in Germany during the early years of the war . Imports poured in from Nazi-occupied countries of Europe . The Allied bombing of Germany got off to a slow start and did little damage at first . <p> Germany 's situation had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union , and there were fewer reports of German victories to cheer the people . Allied bombs rained down day and night on German cities . Consumer goods became increasingly scarce . Yet the people continued to work hard for the war effort . <p> The Nazi terror . Hitler 's dreaded secret police , the Gestapo , ruthlessly crushed opposition to the Nazi Party . The Gestapo arrested anyone suspected of opposing Nazism in Germany and in German-held territories . <p> To free German men for combat , the Gestapo recruited workers from occupied countries . Millions of Europeans were eventually forced to work long hours under terrible conditions in German war plants . Many died of mistreatment or starvation . <p> The Nazis brutally persecuted several groups , including Jews , Gypsies , and Slavs . By 1942 , Hitler had started a campaign to murder all European Jews . The Nazis rounded up Jewish men , women , and children from occupied Europe and shipped them in railway wagons to concentration camps . About 6 million Jews died in concentration camps during World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups in gas chambers . Others died of lack of food , disease , or torture . The Nazis also slaughtered many Poles , Gypsies , and members of other groups . <p> In the Soviet Union , conditions were especially difficult , because fierce fighting went on for nearly four years . Stalin ordered retreating Soviet soldiers to burn everything in their path that German troops could use for food or shelter . But that scorched-earth policy also caused great hardships for the Soviet people . Millions of Soviet civilians died of famine and other war-related causes . In the Ukraine and areas occupied by the Soviet Union , many of the people at first welcomed the conquering German troops . They believed that the Germans would deliver them from Stalin 's harsh rule . But the cruelty of the Nazi occupation forces turned the people against them . During World War II , civilians and soldiers in the Soviet Union fought the Germans with a hatred and determination seldom matched elsewhere in Europe . <p> Occupied countries . Germany looted the conquered lands to feed its own people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant fear of Gestapo brutality . <p> Japan came closest to collapse of all the warring nations . As the Allies closed in , they deprived Japan of more and more of the raw materials needed by the country 's industries . Allied bombers pounded Japan 's cities , and Allied submarines sank Japanese cargo ships . By 1945 , hunger and malnutrition were widespread in Japan . But the Japanese people remained willing to make enormous sacrifices for the war effort . <p> WORLD WAR II/Consequences of the war <p> Deaths and destruction . World War II took more lives and caused more destruction than any other war . Altogether , about 70 million people served in the armed forces of the Allied and Axis nations . About 17 million of them lost their lives . The Soviet Union suffered about 71/2 million battle deaths , more than any other country . The United States and Great Britain had the fewest battle deaths of the major powers . About 400,000 American and about 350,000 British military personnel died in the war . Germany lost about 31/2 million servicemen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on civilian as well as military targets . Many cities lay in ruins , especially in Germany and Japan . Bombs wrecked houses , factories , and transportation and communication systems . Land battles also spread destruction over vast areas . After the war , millions of starving and homeless people wandered among the ruins of Europe and Asia . <p> No one knows how many civilians died as a direct result of World War II . Bombing raids destroyed many of the records needed to estimate those deaths . In addition , millions of people died in fires , of diseases , and of other causes after such essential services as fire fighting and health care broke down in war-torn areas . <p> The Soviet Union and China suffered the highest toll of civilian deaths during World War II . As many as 20 million Soviet and 10 million Chinese civilians may have died . Many of the deaths resulted from famine . <p> Displaced persons . World War II uprooted millions of people . By the war 's end , more than 12 million displaced persons remained in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nazi concentration and slave labour camps , and people who had fled invading armies and war-torn areas . Others were displaced by changes in national borders . For example , many Germans moved into Poland , Czechoslovakia , and other lands in eastern Europe that the Nazis took over . After the war , those countries expelled German residents . <p> To help displaced persons , the Allies established the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ( UNRRA ) . UNRRA began operating in 1944 in areas freed by the Allies from Nazi occupation . The organization set up camps for displaced persons and provided them with food , clothing , and medical supplies . By 1947 , most of the displaced persons had been resettled . However , about a million people still remained in camps . Many had fled from countries in eastern Europe and refused to return to homelands that had come under Communist rule . <p> New power struggles arose after World War II ended . The war had exhausted the leading prewar powers of Europe and Asia . Germany and Japan ended the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened . Emerging nations , such as India , sought independence from their old colonial rulers . The United States and the Soviet Union emerged from the war as the world 's leading powers . Their wartime alliance soon collapsed as the Soviet Union sought to spread Communism in Europe and Asia . The struggle between the Communist world , led by the Soviet Union , and the non-Communist world , led by the United States , became known as the Cold War . <p> After 1945 , the United States found it impossible to return to the policy of isolation it had followed before the war . Americans realized that they needed strong allies , and they helped the war-torn nations to recover . <p> World War II had united the Soviet people behind a great patriotic effort . The Soviet Union came out of the war stronger than ever before , in spite of the severe destruction it had suffered . Before the war ended , the Soviet Union had absorbed three nations along the Baltic Sea--Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania . It had also taken parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the war , Soviet troops occupied most of eastern Europe . In March 1946 , Churchill warned that an " Iron Curtain " had descended across Europe , dividing eastern Europe from western Europe . Behind the Iron Curtain , the Soviet Union helped Communist governments take power in Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Poland , and Romania . <p> Communism also gained strength in the Far East . The Soviet Union set up a Communist government in North Korea after the war . In China , Mao Zedong 's Communist forces battled Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist armies . Late in 1949 , Chiang fled to the island of Taiwan , and China joined the Communist world . <p> By 1947 , Communists threatened to take control of Greece , and the Soviet Union was demanding military bases in Turkey . That year , U.S. President Truman announced that the United States would provide military and economic aid to any country threatened by Communism . American aid helped Greece and Turkey resist Communist aggression . <p> In 1948 , the United States set up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies . Under the plan , 18 nations received 13 billion U.S. dollars in food , machinery , and other goods . The Soviet Union forbade countries in eastern Europe to participate in the Marshall Plan . <p> The nuclear age opened with the development of the atomic bomb during World War II . Many people believed that weapons capable of mass destruction would make war unthinkable in the future . They hoped that the world would learn to live in peace . But a race to develop ever more powerful weapons soon began . <p> At the end of World War II , only the United States knew how to build an atomic weapon . In 1946 , the United States proposed the creation of an international agency that would control atomic energy and ban the production of nuclear weapons . But the Soviet Union objected to an inspection system , and the proposal was dropped . Stalin ordered Soviet scientists to develop an atomic bomb , and they succeeded in 1949 . During the early 1950 's , the United States and the Soviet Union each tested an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have feared a nuclear war since the nuclear age began . At times , Cold War tensions threatened to erupt into war between the two superpowers . But the terrifying destructiveness of nuclear weapons may well have kept them from risking a major war . <p> WORLD WAR II/Establishing the peace <p> Birth of the United Nations ( UN ) . Out of the horror of World War II came efforts to prevent war from ever again engulfing the world . In 1943 , representatives of the United States , Great Britain , the Soviet Union , and China met in Moscow . They agreed to establish an international organization that would work to promote peace . The four Allied powers met again in 1944 at Dumbarton Oaks , an estate in Washington , D.C. The delegates decided to call the new organization the United Nations . In April 1945 , representatives from 50 nations gathered in San Francisco , California , U.S.A. , to draft a charter for the United Nations . They signed the charter in June , and it went into effect on October 24 . <p> Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies had decided on a military occupation of Germany after its defeat . They divided Germany into four zones , with the United States , the Soviet Union , Great Britain , and France each occupying a zone . The four powers jointly administered Berlin . <p> At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945 , the Allies set forth their occupation policy . They agreed to abolish Germany 's armed forces and to outlaw the Nazi Party . Germany lost territory east of the Oder and Neisse rivers . Most of the region went to Poland . The Soviet Union gained the northeastern corner of this territory . <p> The Allies brought to trial Nazi leaders accused of war crimes . The trials exposed the monstrous evils inflicted by Nazi Germany . Many leading Nazis were sentenced to death . The most important war trials took place in the German city of Nuremberg from 1945 to 1949 . <p> Soon after the occupation began , the Soviet Union stopped cooperating with its Western Allies . It blocked all efforts to reunite Germany . The Western Allies gradually joined their zones into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone to join . <p> The city of Berlin lay deep within the Soviet zone of Germany . In June 1948 , the Soviet Union sought to drive the Western powers from Berlin by blocking all road , rail , and water routes to the city . For over a year , the Western Allies flew in food , fuel , and other goods to Berlin . The Soviet Union finally lifted the Berlin blockade in May 1949 , and the airlift ended in September . <p> The Western Allies set up political parties in their zones and held elections . In September 1949 , the three Western zones were officially combined as the Federal Republic of Germany . It became known as West Germany . In May 1955 , the Western Allies signed a treaty ending the occupation of West Germany , and granting the country full independence . But the treaty was not a general peace treaty because the Soviet Union refused to sign it . <p> The Soviet Union set up a Communist government in its zone . In October 1949 , the Soviet zone became the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over East Germany remained strong , after the country became officially independent in 1955 . It did not relax until the 1980 's , shortly before the two Germanies reunited . See GERMANY ( History ) . <p> Peace with Japan . The military occupation of Japan began in August 1945 . Americans far outnumbered other troops in the Allied occupation forces because of the key role their country had played in defeating Japan . General MacArthur directed the occupation as supreme commander for the Allied nations . He introduced many reforms designed to rid Japan of its military institutions and transform it into a democracy . A Constitution drawn up by MacArthur 's staff took effect in 1947 . The Constitution transferred all political rights from the Japanese emperor to the people . In addition , the Constitution granted voting rights to women , and denied Japan 's right to declare war . <p> The Allied occupation forces brought to trial 25 Japanese war leaders and government officials who were accused of war crimes . Seven of these individuals were executed . The other people who were tried received prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of the other Allied nations signed a peace treaty with Japan . The treaty took away Japan 's overseas empire . But it permitted Japan to rearm . The Allied occupation of Japan ended soon after the nations signed the peace treaty . However , a new treaty permitted the United States to keep troops in Japan . China 's Nationalist government signed its own peace treaty with Japan in 1952 , and the Soviet Union and Japan also signed a separate peace treaty in 1956 . <p> Peace with other countries . Soon after World War II ended , the Allies began to draw up peace treaties with Italy and four other countries that had fought with the Axis--Bulgaria , Finland , Hungary , and Romania . The treaties limited the armed forces of the defeated countries and required them to pay war damages . The treaties also called for territorial changes . Bulgaria gave up territory to Greece and Yugoslavia . Czechoslovakia gained land from Hungary . Finland lost territory to the Soviet Union . Italy gave up land to France , Yugoslavia , and Greece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained territory from Hungary , but

The movie departs from film noir and enters the characteristic world of Atom Egoyan in its depiction of sex ...

Noir is the genre of night , guilt , violence and illicit passion , and no genre is more seductive . But the best noirs were made in the 1940s and 1950s , before directors consciously knew what they were doing ( " We called them B movies , " said Robert Mitchum ) . Once the French named the genre , once a generation of filmmakers came along who had seen noirs at cinematheques instead of in flea pits , noir could never again be naive ... Women are rarely allowed to be bold and devious in the movies ; most directors are men , and they see women as goals , prizes , enemies , lovers and friends , but rarely as protagonists .

Together , they are a danger , because they are just smart enough to think up plans they 're stupid enough to try ... Film noir , we are reminded , is not about action and victory , but about incompetence and defeat . - Roger Ebert , from his review of " After Dark My Sweet " <p> The working out of her elaborate plot to get what she does want makes this a tightly-constructed thriller that offers some of the same satisfactions as old-fashioned noir pictures . But noir was long ago divorced from the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sunlight ? specifically the all-forgiving Southern California sun ? where it has never quite managed to retain its old imaginative power . - James Bowman , reviewing " Mini 's First Time " , " American Spectator " <p> Film noir , while often centering on tales of cops and crooks and private eyes , usually reflects a darker world than that inhabited by such characters in other movies or even in real life . In place of the frothy romanticism at which Hollywood used to be so adept come haunted visions of doomed men and women for whom love is replaced by blind passion and sexual obsession , which often erupts in violence and cold-blooded murder . Deceit and duplicity run their crooked courses through these stories , pervaded by an atmosphere of impending doom . Women are predators , ensnaring weak-willed men , yet , like the men they enslave , they have no control over their lives . Many elements went to form the distinctive products of the movement . Among them are dramatic camera angles and stark , angular sets , visual images of rain-lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , echoing public buildings . The sun rarely shines in the world of film noir ; indeed , many of the classic movies were shot in either real or simulated darkness . The urban junhles of film noir are peopled with troubled souls who haunt streets which Raymond Chandler described as ' dark with something more than night ' . - Bruce Crowther , " Film Noir : Reflections in a Dark Mirror " <p> Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean , who is neither tarnished nor afraid ... He must be a man of honor , by instinct , by inevitability , without thought of it , and certainly without saying it ... He will take no man 's money dishonestly and no man 's insolence without due and dispassionate revenge .

Raymond Chandler , about Philip Marlowe <p> Film noir evolved from the American crime thrillers that rose to pulp prominence between 1920 and 1940 . Hollywood took those tales and put the focus on cynics , fall guys , sluts , heists , and murders most foul . The huge screens in movie theaters provided lurid masks for the resentments that pulse within Americana . Our hatred of the upper class and of goody-two-shoes morality got plenty of play . So did our repulsive puritanical troubles with sexual attraction , our reluctant but ultimate belief in the righteousness of force , and our tendency to answer life 's pervasive horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could American audiences resist the combative stance of an unimpressed hero whose ethos could be reduced to : " Is that so ? " How could they fail to be lured by all of the actresses cast as Venus ' flytraps ? Everything in film noir takes place at the bottom , in the sewers of sensibility . It holds that the force of the world is not only indifferent to , but obviously bigger than , the individual , which is why personal satisfaction , whether illegal or immoral , is the solution to the obligatory ride through an unavoidably brittle universe . A black and white phenomenon , film noir is thought to have achieved its greatest heights between 1945 and 1950 , though the apparent moment of final brilliance arrived in 1958 's Touch of Evil , directed with the heightened imagination of genius by Orson Welles . As a genre , film noir appeared as an antidote to the Hollywood conventions of pristine character and fulfilled romance because its creators sensed that " rah rah " was no longer the best prescription for the blues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellious , film noir generously utilized sex and violence , firmly rooting itself in American culture . - Stanley Crouch , " Slate Magazine " <p> 90s noir ... is noir without any moral compass whatsoever ... everybody is corrupt , out for his own ends and willing to sell out those to whom he owes obligations with little or no provocation ... Even if this were true of human kind , it would be fatal for a movie to say so . Simply put , when everybody is morally on a par , each trying to do down the next , it is boring . In classic noir , even when the characters themselves were all treacherous , there was always a stern moral presence visible above and behind them , ensuring that their treacheries came to nothing in the end . It was a vision of divine judgment so bleak as to create in us sympathy even for the worst of characters ...

It seems as though irony has entered Hollywood ? s soul . The problem with movies like Pirates of the Caribbean is that they draw us in by appealing to our childhood memory of the adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson or Captain Marryat , only to spoil it all by piling on unnecessary computer-generated images , incredible supernatural plot twists and gratuitously anachronistic pop cultural references .

##1617451 <h> Communism <p> The evil philosophies of fascism and communism were the two great 20th century mass killers . Of these , communism was the greatest killer . 100 million men , women and children have been murdered by socialism so far , and the killing continues today , notably in North Korea . In terms of body count , socialism is by far the most evil religion , the most evil ideology of any sort , of all time . <p> Behind the Iron Curtain , communists stamped out freethought as efficiently as in any authoritarian religious state . Communists are not sceptics , and are atheists only superficially . Marx and Lenin founded an irrational religion every bit as dogmatic , credulous , and opposed to freethought as any of the older religions they criticised . <p> Perhaps the central lesson of the 20th century is this : It is not enough to complain about the existing order . Your solution must be better , not worse . <p> It is not enough to have a revolution against the Tsar . Your revolution must create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not less free . <p> Clearly , though the Tsar was a dictator , Lenin made Russia less free , not more . <p> It is not enough to attack the Weimar Republic . The solution must be better , not worse . <p> Disillusioned with Weimar , the Germans turned to Hitler , who delivered total war , humiliating defeat , mass destruction , 7 million German dead , partition and occupation of half the country by Russia for decades , the permanent loss of territory , ethnic cleansing of millions of Germans , the rape of millions more , and a genocidal shame that will hang over Germany for a thousand years . <p> It is not enough to throw off western imperialism in Africa . Your independence must lead to a society that is more free and prosperous , not less , than society under imperialism . <p> Clearly , though imperialism could be brutally exploitative and racist , much of Africa is worse off since independence , not better . <p> Edmund Burke was the prophetic voice on this issue back in the 18th century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to a better society ) , and opposing the French revolution ( which led to bloodbath and dictatorship ) . If only every revolutionary considered Burke 's point , even for 5 minutes . Because today the world is still full of revolutions that , if they succeed , will enslave people , not free them . From western anarchists trying to destroy middle-class life , to the Palestinian resistance fighting to enslave the Palestinian people under theocracy and dictatorship , all will cause more oppression and poverty , not less . <p> When asked which communist or socialist countries exactly have worked , lefties often now point weakly to Sweden - since Cuba , the Soviet Union , and Mao 's China do n't seem to be popular any more . <p> This rather ignores the fact that Sweden is ranked by the Heritage Foundation as one of the most economically free countries in the world - " Mostly Free " . It is ranked as more economically free than Germany , Belgium , Spain , France or Italy . <h> Real thought <p> Marginalizing Conservative Ideas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been completely disproved by history , and are kept away from works that have been triumphantly vindicated by history . <p> J. Bradford DeLong notes that " as close to a perfect natural experiment as anyone could wish " was carried out in effect by the adoption of communism by a large number of countries in the 20th century . And these are the results . The table shows GDP per capita for paired Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc countries in 1991 . The conclusion : " Eschewing markets robs you of between 80% and 90% of your potential economic productivity . " <p> It 's so obvious , yet we need to say it again . People fight to leave communist states . They never fight to get into them . Why is this ? <p> People fight to get into democracies like America , Australia and Western Europe . Cubans die trying to get into America . East Germans died trying to get into West Germany . Why not the other way ? <p> Greg Gutfeld , 16 May 2011 , on the late Bin Laden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States : " The fact is , there is no line to get out of the United States , only a line to get in . And no one waits in line to get oppressed " . <p> As an atheist , I am completely on the side of the religious in their war on communism . Communism is an ultra-violent , irrational , barbarous state religion . No evidence supports its major claims . Indeed , they have all been proved wrong by history . Because no evidence supports their faith , the communist state attacks freedom of speech and freedom of religion . Apart from their brutality , torture and murder , it is the cowardice that is so striking . The communists know that their own stupid , ignorant ideas could not survive if people were free to discuss them . <p> The Soviets destroyed forever most of Russia 's ancient religious heritage . Clergy and laity butchered for their beliefs . Icons and churches all destroyed by the violent irrational religion of Marxism . <p> The Bible was banned by the communist bullies and cowards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Nazi holocaust is taken seriously and remembered . But the communist holocausts and democides are barely taught in school , ignored by Hollywood , and generally forgotten and trivialised in the popular culture . In the worst case , people in the West still admire or jokingly name things after Lenin , Trotsky , Mao and other communist butchers . <p> A bit " bolshie " , or " bolshy " , is like a term of amusement , rather than designating a mass killer of women and children . Like " young turk " , its casual use reflects how we ignore and trivialise non-Nazi holocausts . <p> stalinism.com by John Band - " dekulakise the nation and eliminate the bourgeoisie " . To some modern leftists , the Soviet democide is just a big , hilarious joke . But the " kulaks " and the " bourgeoisie " - millions of innocent men , women and children - were torn screaming from their homes , exterminated , shot , gassed , put in camps and starved to death . And it 's all just a big joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a joke ? How could you joke about Stalin 's killing of 40 million innocent men , women and children ? Do you not know much about it ? Or do you not care ? Is similar joking about the Holocaust acceptable ? <p> Lenin 's Tomb - An anonymous SWP nut ( since exposed as Richard Seymour ) names his blog after a democidal killer in order to be provocative : " Lenin is one of the last truly subversive signifiers . The Wall Street Journal can appreciate Marx , but Lenin still evokes a shiver or two . Therein lies the attraction . " Why not " Eichmann 's Tomb " ? <p> The song No More Heroes ( 1977 ) , by The Stranglers , describes Trotsky as a hero . Apparently this is not a joke .

In fact the present moment favors us far more than it does them . We are almost 99 percent sure that we can strike a mortal blow against them and consolidate the central position that we are going to need to occupy for several decades to come . With the help of all those starving people who are starting to eat each other , who are dying by the millions , and whose bodies litter the roadside all over the country , it is now and only now that we can - and therefore must - confiscate all church property with all the ruthless energy we can still muster .

He himself is not starving by the side of the road , so he does n't give a shit . Lenin sums up the world of communism . He is utterly indifferent to the millions dying in agony because of his own government . He has no interest whatsoever in helping them . All he sees is an opportunity to attack enemies ( in this case the church ) . <p> " Among religions , Bolshevism is to be reckoned with Muhammadanism rather than with Christianity and Buddhism . Christianity and Buddhism are primarily personal religions , with mystical doctrines and a love of contemplation . Muhammadanism and Bolshevism are practical , social , unspiritual , concerned to win the empire of this world .

" - Economic illiterate Karl Marx shows he has no idea what has made humans more prosperous since the Stone Age . If we all grew our own food , we would all live in grinding poverty and famine .

##1617452 <h> Crime <p> The state has almost ceased to attack innocent people in the West , with the Drug War being the last remaining major battlefield . <p> Apart from the Drug War , the major way that human rights and civil liberties are assaulted in the West today is by individuals attacking us . I do not see why we should tolerate this any more than we tolerate the state attacking us . Once the drug issue is resolved , it seems the spotlight of the civil liberties group should finally swing away from the state and towards crime . <p> Limerick thug Robert Sheehan and two friends set two small children on fire in Sept 2006 . The 4 year old and 6 year old suffered horrific burns . The Irish state declined to take seriously the protection of its citizens from this man , and he was soon free to attack other people . He attacked the wrong person and was shot dead in Sept 2012 . Comments here probably express what most people feel .

Freed after 3 years in prison . <p> Padraig Nally - jailed in Ireland for shooting a violent burglar in 2004 . Spent 1 year in prison . Freed at re-trial . <p> Martin McCaughey , a businessman in Dundalk in 2008 , sleeping at home with his wife and three children ( age 10 , 14 and 15 ) in the house , woke up in the night to find this burglar , Daniel McCormack ( above ) in his bedroom armed with a screwdriver . McCaughey chased him out of the house , and chased him in his car , hitting him with the car and stopping his escape . Screenshot from RTE . Most people in Ireland would applaud . But look at what happened next : <p> Third , the Irish state prosecuted McCaughey for assaulting the burglar . Thankfully , the jury had far more sense than the state , and they spoke for all of Ireland when they acquitted him on 15 Feb 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with legal bills over 100,000 . <p> Almost every comment here supports McCaughey . No wonder the jury acquitted , if these commenters are representative . One says : " I would n't have had to hear too much of the evidence to return a Not Guilty verdict . " <p> Comment probably sums up how the jury felt : " any " scumbag " going up before a jury in Ireland today is not going to win ... all the jury will be focusing on is the fact that the burglar was in someones house armed with a screwdriver before the incident . ... you sit in a jury stand for a couple of days and everything else about the case is passing you by apart from the fact that the guy sitting over there could have possibly broken into your house " . <p> There is no justice here .

Her 10 year old daughter was terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards . Where 's her compensation for that ? An award of 175,000 would be about right . In contrast to most burglars , he has the money to pay up . <p> The Guardian , 8 Dec 2011 , blames the police ( sadly this is serious , not a satire ) and complains that nearly three-quarters of the rioting scum had been stopped and searched in the previous year . <p> They think there is something wrong with this . They do not draw the obvious conclusion - that the police are good at their job and know who the criminal scum are in each area . <p> The Guardian also blames the riots on the fact that thieving scum - who squandered their chances at school and now live off the taxes of productive people - feel " alienated " from society . As if that is our fault , not theirs . <p> 76 percent of rioters had previous convictions .

I 'm shocked , shocked ! " <p> " According to a major survey most rioters said that if it was not for the police not being there they would probably not have stolen quite so many things . One rioter said : " It was only when the police eventually arrived and prevented me from stealing my ninth Wii in two days that I got very angry and decided to go home and pretend I had been watching television the whole time . " Another rioter said : .. " It was our chance to take back the streets where we hang around all day , frightening people . " " Also , I 'm sick of having my knives confiscated .

Yet again , it seems , crime is not caused by poverty . <p> It certainly looks as if something started to go wrong in the UK in the 1960s . That crime rose despite society getting far richer . Stats from here and here . <p> Likewise , as Ireland gets richer , it has more murders . Stats from here . <p> How Ireland 's wealth increased massively since 1950 . Contrary to left-wing dogma , this led to an increase , not decrease , in crime . Stats from Angus Maddison . <p> As Ireland gets richer , it has more serious ( indictable ) crimes . Stats from here . <p> Theodore Dalrymple , with personal experience of thousands of underclass criminals , writes more convincingly about the causes of crime than anyone I know . <p> The Most Politically Correct Magazine in the World by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge about unchanging human nature , and the nature of evil and selfishness , and now believes that crime is caused by deprivation and inequality , terrorism is a response to oppression and suffering , and war is caused by poverty and inequality . <p> Theodore Dalrymple : " The BMJ 's procrustean theory of war is the liberal theory of crime writ large and applied on a global scale . Poverty makes men desperate , and desperation drives them to crime or ( if they happen to control an army ) to war . It is therefore up to us - the rich and contented portion of humanity - to prevent crime and war by paying more : for social welfare programs in the case of crime , for foreign aid in the case of war . ... It is a tribute to the distorting power on educated minds of an abstract theory that anyone could believe such rubbish . ... The fact that crime in Britain has risen along with income should have been sufficient to persuade the BMJ that a more complex theory of human motivation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinguishing feature of much modern intellectual life . " <p> The idea that crime and terrorism are logical responses to " oppression " : <p> The same is true for crime . Crime is caused by memes , not poverty . Poverty was far worse in the past , and yet there was less crime , not more . <p> Theodore Dalrymple <p> On criminals : " .. contrary to the modern sentimental view , not all anger is justified or even sincere . Indeed , much of it is the product of dishonesty and bad faith combined with sheer ignorance . And far from assuaging this dishonest rage , liberal breast-beating fans it , sustains it and appears to justify it . " <p> Why prison works - " It is difficult to convince complacent middle-class intellectuals of the degree to which life in the poorest third of our society is dominated and further impoverished by crime and criminality . " Most crime is local , and it 's the respectable working class who suffer the most . The people to feel sorry for are not the criminals ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live in middle class , low-crime areas . The people to really feel sorry for are non -criminals in working class , high-crime areas . <p> Crime is caused by ideas , not by poverty . Most criminals in the west are not decent people , starving and " stealing a chicken to feed their family " . Feed their expensive drug , alcohol and gambling habits , perhaps - while they beat up their family . Or just lazy layabouts who want a DVD player but do n't want to work . Most criminals are greedy , lazy , selfish bullies . It 's old-fashioned language , and it 's annoying for them to hear it . But they need to hear it . Because that is what they are . They are not victims . They are greedy , lazy , selfish bullies . <p> Crime is caused by ideas . Crime is caused by bad , selfish ideas in criminals ' heads . This is the only explanation that makes any sense for the vast increase in crime in the west . And much of modern popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " Poverty causes crime " : <p> Yes , it is true that people with something to lose ( a house , a job ) tend not to commit crime . And that will always be true , whether crime rates are high or low . But that does not mean that poverty causes crime . First , poverty was greater in the past and crime was less . <p> Second , let me suggest a much more disturbing theory for the left : Saying that " poverty causes crime " causes crime . You may not think that these rarified sociological ideas percolate down to the uneducated criminals on the street , but as Theodore Dalrymple shows , they do . In garbled form , through popular culture , criminals get the message that they are victims and " society " owes them . It is a message they are only too eager to hear . Every selfish thug and bully likes to hear justifications for his actions . Telling criminals that poverty causes crime is : ( 1 ) encouraging the criminals , and : ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it and work hard and try to better themselves . <p> Ironically , comfortable middle class sociologists pronouncing in the media that poverty and inequality cause crime , may themselves be a cause of crime . How else to explain the rising levels of crime as prosperity increased ? " Sociology causes crime " may be more true than " Poverty causes crime " . Crime is caused by memes , not by poverty . <p> " It is probably no coincidence that the profession of criminology underwent a vast expansion at about the same time that criminal activity began the steepest part of its exponential rise . ... Of course , it might have been that the problem of crime called forth its students . But since social problems are often of a dialectical nature , could it not also have been that the students called forth their problem ? ... Since the cause of crime is the decision of criminals to commit it , what goes on in their minds is not irrelevant . Ideas filter down selectively from the academy into the population at large , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV , and become intellectual currency . In this way , the ideas of criminologists could actually become a cause of crime . " <p> Owen Corrigan , 25 Jan 2010 , provides a good example of how the left encourages crime . <p> Complaining about capitalism , he says : " Cut taxes right back to the bone and abolish various welfare supports and you may well encourage people back into work . But do n't start complaining when you have to step over the destitute on your way to your morning commute and do n't be surprised when you get home to find you 've been burgled by people driven to criminality . " <p> You can almost hear his glee at the thought of hard-working bourgeois middle-class people getting burgled . <p> Of course , no burglar in the West is driven to it . They do it because that 's the type of person they are . They do it because they are greedy , lazy , selfish bullies . <p> Fr . Peter McVerry is a left-wing priest who works with the homeless , drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little understanding of the suffering and fear these criminals inflict on the decent , hard-working members of society . <p> Fr . Peter McVerry , 22 Aug 2012 : " the greatest suffering inflicted on Irish people in recent years was caused , not by burglars in jeans , but by professionals in designer suits . " <p> Another cause of crime is clearly the breakdown of the family , the absence of fathers , and an increased toleration for the abandonment of mothers and children while men move on in search of more fulfilling sexual relationships . The almost total breakdown of the traditional family is a dominant feature , perhaps the most dominant feature , of high-crime , " underclass " areas in the West . <p> In some ways , this is the same issue as above - that crime is caused by ideas . In this case , the underclass is adopting bad ideas about marriage and sexual relationships developed by middle class intellectuals in the 20th century . <p> While the middle class experiment with sexual chaos when young , they often avoid pregancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , often very late , in their 30s . And I quite like these aspects of the sexual revolution , and would not like to turn the clock back . But people need to be responsible with their freedom , by using contraception diligently , and not having children until you have a career and a stable relationship for life . The middle classes are often responsible , instinctively ( if only because they worry about their careers ) . <p> As Theodore Dalrymple shows , the underclass , however , live in the world of sexual chaos that the middle class only flirt with . They raise their children in this world , rather than just partying in it . They take the ideas of the sexual revolution theorists seriously , which in many ways the middle class do not . And these bad ideas - that families are not necessary to raise children - are clearly a major cause of crime and dysfunction . <p> Dalrymple is different to many writers on family breakdown and the sexual revolution because he is not religious . In fact , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sexual revolution has made the underclass happy . To which the answer is obviously no . It has led to an increase , not decrease , in rape , domestic violence , child abuse , and all forms of abuse of women and children . <p> Much political and social discussion takes place in the absence of statistics , and is driven by ideology ( what we want to be true ) instead of statistics ( what is true ) . Even the fundamental difference between anecdote and statistics is not grasped by many people . <p> Many statistics are little known because they do not fit in with the prevailing ideology . We wish these things were n't true , so we ignore them . A few major examples are : <p> Child abuse , rape , and violence against women are statistically far more common outside marriage than within marriage : <p> Happy marriages and unhappy divorces by Mona Charen , July 19 , 2002 . " The data show that if a couple is unhappy , the chances of their being happily married 5 years hence are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they divorce and remarry . ... Those who enter marriage with a dim ( some might say accurate ) view of divorce and a strong religious or other motivation for avoiding it are not only less likely to divorce , they are also less likely to be unhappy . " <p> Children of divorce have ( statistically ) more problems of all types , and are statistically more likely to divorce themselves . This could lead to the heartless ( yet objectively true ) advice to your child that if you want your marriage to last , pick someone from a stable background - someone whose parents have stayed together . <p> While we 're at it , married men are richer , live longer and have more and better sex than single men . Why are all these statistics so shocking and contrary to the pious politically-correct ideas we were taught growing up ? <p> Parents ' pursuit of happiness kills children : Study estimates that if the United States enjoyed the same level of family stability today as it did in 1960 , the nation would have about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides every year . <p> A child who is not living with his or her own two married parents is at greater risk of child abuse . <p> There are many other statistics that make sense under an evolutionary-biology or a conservative view , but that do n't make any sense under a PC view . These statistics make conservatism look like it is based on reason ( so long as it does n't go too far , like actually banning sex outside marriage , etc. like it did in the past ) . And these statistics make PC ideas look like pure ideology , hostile to reason and evidence . <p> Figures for child abuse and neglect by family type . Colours are hard to read , but top-to-bottom maps to left-to-right . ( " Married biological parents " is gold . ) There are few findings as solid as the fact that children are safest ( by far ) when their parents are married and stay together . From US Department of Health " National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect " Hat tip Tony Allwright , Mar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect among step-parents and non-parents ( adopted parents , foster parents , " care " ) than among married biological parents . <p> There is also far more abuse and neglect among unmarried biological parents than among married biological parents . <p> Worst of all for abuse and neglect is the single mother with the live-in boyfriend . ( Feckless men being expected to care for children that are not even theirs . ) <p> None of this would surprise any evolutionary biologist , or indeed anyone who understands human nature , but it seems to come as a surprise to the left . <p> Another strange position by western civil liberties groups is to be against the death sentence for murderers . <p> The one valid argument against the death sentence , it seems to me , is that sometimes you will get the wrong person . <p> The argument against this , though , is that less innocent people will die than if murderers stay alive - some of whom will kill again within prison and after they leave ( there are case histories like these everywhere ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as terrible accidents in an imperfect human world , like car accidents ( which , because we allow cars to exist , kill at least a thousand times more innocents every year ) or civilian casualties in war , and everything possible should be done to minimise such accidents ( e.g. by repeatedly examining the case for years before execution ) . Whether this argument is convincing or not , it is certainly true that the position that will lead to the death of the most innocents is the anti-death-penalty position . <p> John O'Sullivan , August 30 , 2002 , finds that in the US , where some states have capital punishment and some do n't , there have been 820 murders committed by those who have already committed a murder , served their sentence , and been released ( or who murdered in prison ) . These 820 innocent people would be alive if capital punishment had been used . O'Sullivan says the anti-death penalty position is : " it is better to acquiesce reluctantly in the murder of 820 innocent men than to execute mistakenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2012 , says that in the UK , since the death penalty was suspended , about 150 people have been killed by persons previously convicted of homicide . The ban on capital punishment has killed 150 innocent people so far in the UK , about 3 people every year . " Would our courts have sentenced to death three innocent people a year , year in year out ? I doubt it . " <p> In any case , civil liberties groups argue that even if it is the right person , it is immoral to kill them . This to me is simply a dogmatic assertion . Some people believe that killers have an inalienable " right to life " . I do n't . Morality , human rights and civil liberties do not really " exist " . They are invented by us in order to preserve civilization . Believing that such rights should only apply to innocent humans is a perfectly reasonable philosophy . <p> I would also support the death penalty for permanently disabling someone ( brain damaging someone , setting someone on fire , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Benetton " <p> The Benetton company , who sell bland , crappy sweaters , produced ads in 2000 with pictures of death row killers . <p> Nothing to do with their product . Just designed to shock and get attention . They even included child killers . <p> The photographer Oliviero Toscani chose to include nothing about the victims ( of course ) . He said : " This campaign is not about victims . It is about the death penalty . The death penalty is unreligious . The 10 Commandments say ' Thou shalt not kill . ' It is against the law . " <p> Benetton 's Evil Ads : " Jesse Compton 's profile is typical . A full-page headshot accompanies an interview . " What did you want to be when you grew up ? " he is asked . " A lumberjack , " he replies . The questioner follows up : " What does it feel like when you 're cutting through a tree ? " Left unasked , however , is what it feels like to burn a three-year-old girl with a propane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Compton became an authority on when he and his girlfriend tortured her daughter to death . " <p> Of course they do have some principles : " Benetton 's only condition is that the inmates be photographed in their normal prison clothes and not clothing which would promote another company , such as a Gap shirt . " <p> 3 year old Tesslynn O'Cull ( above ) was beaten , burned , sexually assaulted , starved , tortured , mutilated and finally murdered by her 20 year old " step-father " Jesse Compton in Oregon in 1997 . Compton was sentenced to death by lethal injection , but is still alive today on death row . <h> Much of the population is to the right of me on crime <p> To summarise , I 've no problem with there being no death penalty , if that is what society wants . My problem is with civil liberties groups who have their blind spots and who fail to recognise that crime is a civil liberties issue . And the issue is the civil liberties of the victims . <p> British public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty is not " what society wants " . If a free democratic vote was ever allowed , the death penalty would be restored immediately : <p> In fact , I am constantly surprised at how much of the population is to the right of me on crime : <p> The Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs animal rights terrorists were given 12 year sentences in 2006 , which I thought about right , even a little high , given they did not kill anyone . A survey ( see details ) shows 45 percent agree with me that the sentences were about right , but a further 40 percent think they should have got more .

##1623251 <p> Ireland , here we come ! We should have been in Newfoundland on the evening of July 1 this year . The deed would be donel The first picture here , courtesy of Roy Day , is from the U.S. Navy 's NAVLANT weather web site out of Norfolk , VA . Those arrows point along the nominal great circle route to be flown by a TAM called " The Spirit of Butts Farm . " The arrows are called Beaufort wind scales . They point in The direction of the wind . The number of feathers on the tails indicates the wind speed . Newfoundland is the island on The left ; Ireland . the island on the right . The magic of weather satellites produced this description of what the surface winds were at 9:30am , Newfoundland time , on the morning of July 2 . Each big feather represents 10 knots ; little ones , 5 knots . There 's a bunch of 20-25 knot tailwind pushers out there . Our TAM will cruise at about 42mph airspeed . These winds would add about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64mph . The distance between St. John 's , Newfoundland , and Round Stone Bog , Ireland , is about 1900 miles as the crow flies . We have reason to believe that Joe Foster 's software will make " The Spirit " fly straight as a crow . The bottom line is , it would have taken about 30 hours to cross . Had we launched on Monday , July 1 at about 8:30pm , Newfoundland time , we would have arrived at Round Stone Bog at Sam , Ireland time , on Tuesday , July 3 . Five ant isa bit of an awkward lime for our crew in Ireland . We 're hoping for a little less wind for our real attempt in August . We hope for no fog and bright daylight along the coast of Ireland after a 36-hour crossing . <p> Here 's the present situation . We currently have four complete airframes and two autopilots . We 've tested one Argos transmitter and have three to go . <p> There 's a great bundle of loose ends still to be done , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of any of our assets during checkout flights , we should have four complete ( nearly ready to fly ) airplanes packed in a rented minivan that will be driven to Newfoundland by my wife , Gay , starting on Monday , July 29 . As a nearly blind passenger I 'll do my best to see the countryside as I listen to audiotapes about Wilbur and Orville between hours of Brahms ' magnificence . Six days later , on Sunday August 4 , will pull up to the RCAF Officers Club at the Airbase in St. John 's . Nelson Sherren , president of the RCAF Association , has arranged for quarters for the TAM crew there . He has also obtained a large room nearby that we will use as our center of operations . Nelson is a dedicated aviation historian who is pitching in all sorts of help to our historical event ; the first genuine model airplane to fly across the Atlantic . The first full-scale airplane to cross the Atlantic was a stick and cloth Vickers Vimy WWI bomber flown by RAF captains John Alcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible accomplishment ended in a rough landing on the Round Stone Bog near Clifden , Ireland . We hope to mock this remarkable achievement , thereby reviving the public 's interest in early Newfoundland-Ireland aviation history . Roy Day will be the contest director for this attempt to set a new FAI world record for distance in a straight line by a radio-controlled piston-powered model airplane . As specified by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale ( FAI ) , a true model airplane weighs less than 11 lbs ( 5kg ) and uses an engine of no more than 10cc displacement . The TAMs weigh 5.5lbs empty and will contain 5.5lbs of fuel at launch . Fuel consumption at 42 mph cruise speed is about 2.2oz/hr if I set the needle valve right . This target is not a sure thing . We 're trickling this " whiskey shot " through a tiny , tiny orifice , and I 've found it difficult and tedious to get it exact . Air temperature , fuel viscosity , barometric pressure , filters , and still other factors are hazards in the way of precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of fuel . If I do it wrong , we could wind up with only 30 hours . I measure and measure <p> for hours , and still have it far from perfect . We 'll know that I did it right when we land at the Bog ! Roy Day and Mary will be driving a different route than the one Gay and I have chosen . On Monday , the 5th of August , Joe and Loretta Foster and Les Hamilton will fly from Baltimore to St John 's . I am sorry indeed , that John Patton can not come to Newfoundland because he is moving his household to Wilmington , North Carolina , in the next few weeks . Pat has been the CD for the last ten records I 've established . We go way back , and l will miss him and his even keel . Carl Layden , Eastern Zone Director for the Model Aviation Association of Canada , ( MAAC ) , will serve as the Canadian contest director and FAl official . Paul Howey and his son Russell will fly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul designed transmitters that will report the TAM 's position during it 's Crossing . He , Rusty and Kevin Drum also fabricated autopilots that software guru Joe Foster has been designing and developing over the past four years . This project has been fortunate to have the help of all of these men - Joe Foster , Roy Day , Lea Hamilton , and Paul and Rusty Howey -whose services would have cost a fortune had they been paid their going rates I Ron Bozzonetti , Tweed Cotlrell and Bob Yount have given much time and expertise to the project as well , but will not be traveling to Newfoundland . Nor will Bill Savage who has painstakingly edited these words into print for every newsletter . In Ireland Paul and Rusty will meet up with Joe Dible and Noel Barrett to figure out how to be at the Bog when " The Spirit " approaches . Joe is a retired ' 747 captain for Air Lingus and is now president of the Irish Aeromodeling Committee . Noel Barren runs a successful hobby shop in Cork . Joe and Noel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys are highly qualified contest directors and FAI offlcials.Our Newfoundland crew will work on Tuesday , the 6th , and Wednesday , the 7th , to try to be ready for our first launch about 8:30pm on the 7th . Hopefully we 'll sweat and sleep fitfully morning , the 9th , to hear that Paul has landed the model and that we can claim a new record . If that happens , that 's it . We celebrate , pack our tents and go on a real vacation . If , on the other hand , we hear nothing after 40 hours have gone by , we launch the second model , which we 've been preparing while the first one was in flight . This procedure will continue until one of the models reaches Ireland or until all four <p> of our birds have disappeared . Now for a quick glance at technical achievement , look at Tweed Cottrtll 's picture that shows a near miracle . That 's a legally blind 76-year-old geezer launching a full-up weight ( 11lb ) TAM in dead calm on level ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a minimal shove on less than 0.2 horsepower . Never mind the aerodynamic theories . This picture shows that Tams are good airplanes . This second photo also shows that old men can do useful things . One of my personal goals in this project is to deliver a message to handicapped or impaired people of any age : Do n't despair . Do n't be turned into a vegetable . Keep trying , and do all you can with those abilities you still possess . The third picture , another by Tweed Cotter , is evidence of some fun flights we had in testing the navigation software that Joe Foster has developed . That day 's flight crew is posed in front of Ernie Lapis 's " cream puff ' 1964 Mercury Meteor convertible . In all of our testing ; we have not programmed the model to fly out of sight . We used two technologies . In the early stages of testing , we had 3 pilots with transmitters stationed at positions along the route so that the model was always in sight of a pilot The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we always knew who was responsible for turning on his transmitter if he saw the plane straying from the expected course . Ernie 's convertible offered a simpler and more versatile technique . And much more fun , Joe programmed the model to fly to waypoints along the side of a rural road , flying over crop fields . Joe was usually the pilot with a transmitter totake over in case the bird started to head out of sight . It never happened . We all sat in the convertible and watched the TAM follow its course beside the road at about 500 ft . We used these techniques for two very sensible reasons . The first was safety . Who knows where it might have come down in the case of a malfunction ! The second was frugality . We could n't afford to lose the model and the technical apparatus inside it . Both of these concerns will evaporate when we get to Newfoundland . We consider it safe to fly the model out of sight over the ocean . It will be at about 500 ft altitude on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There will be no airplanes that low or ships that tall . It 's hard to imagine any freak thing that might be a problem . As for losing assets , it would be nice to have the first one launched , land intact at Round Stone Bog , but after the massive effort we 've all put in on this project we are ready to say goodbye to all four models if that 's the way it goes . So we 're off to Newfoundland and Ireland in a couple of weeks . If you would like to know how the effort is going , you can turn your computer on to the National Geographic website , <p> http : **29;4964;TOOLONG and click on TAM , transatlantic aeromodel . The process for updating will be convoluted because three countries and three time zones are involved . Please be patient and tolerant .

##1627851 <h> Irish Bovine Animal Identification System - Overview <p> The aim of the Bovine Animal Identification System is to guarantee the safety of beef and beef products by the operation of an effective animal identification and tracing system . The system has four elements : tagging , bovine passport , on-farm bovine herd registers and a computerised database . <p> The important aspects of each of the elements of identification are as follows : <p> Tagging The tagging system requires the application by the keeper of two identically numbered yellow plastic eartags to all calves born on a holding within twenty days of birth . Keepers are obliged to order their annual requirement of eartags directly from the tag supplier approved by the Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine . They do this by completing the tag order card sent to them by the approved tag supplier and returning it with the appropriate fee . On application of a pair of tags to a calf , the keeper must complete a corresponding and identically numbered registration application form , which is supplied with each pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register the birth of each calf on a central birth registration database . This can be done by registering the calf birth online or by completing the registration application form received with the tags and sending it within seven days of tagging the calf to the registration agency appointed by the Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine . On receipt of a completed and valid registration application , the registration agency issues the keeper with a passport for the animal concerned . This passport must accompany the animal each time it is moved . All movements of the animal throughout its life must be recorded on the passport . <p> Bovine Herd Registers Keepers of cattle are required to maintain a herd register of all bovine animals on their holdings . The herd register must be kept up-to-date and must record information in relation to all calves born on the holding together with details of all animals entering or leaving the herd and of animal deaths on the holding . <p> Animal Identification and Movement ( AIM ) System The AIM system is a database which records all bovine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all animal movements and this information is used to verify the origin , identity and life history of cattle entering the food chain . It is also used to check compliance of cattle with eligibility criteria of the Single Payment Scheme . The AIM system can also be used to assist in the identification and tracing of bovines that may have come in contact with infectious diseases , for veterinary certification and to provide statistical information in respect of the cattle sector . <h> NOTIFICATIONS TO AIM <p> Keepers of cattle are obliged to notify the Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine of the movement of cattle to and from their holdings . In the case of cattle sold privately , the source keeper must obtain a Certificate of Compliance from the Cattle Movement Notification Agency or on-line from the Department 's website prior to the movement of any animal off the holding . Both the source and destination keepers must confirm within 7 days of the event that the movement has taken place . Keepers must also notify the Department of on-farm deaths . <h> ON-LINE FACILITIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-line facilities are available under the AIM system that allows farmers to : <p> register calf births ; <p> apply for a Certificate of Compliance ( to move cattle direct from farm to farm ) , from mid 2010 a farmer will be able to print the Certificate of Compliance from a home PC and printer ; <p> check cattle in the herd according to the AIM database ; <p> verify that movements in and out of the herd have been recorded on the system ; <p> view the life history of individual animals until they leave the herd ; and <p> view the most recent TB and Brucellosis test dates for animals in the herd . <p> Farmers must register with the Department 's Agfood.ie facility to avail of the on-line services , which are available free of charge . This can be done by clicking on the Agfood icon on the Department 's website www.agriculture.gov.ie and following the simple instructions .

##1629350 <p> Life Harry was born on April 27 , 1887 in Dublin . He was the second son born to Jim and Catherine Boland . His older sister Nellie was born in America in 1884 and his older brother , Gerry was born in 1885 while the family lived in Manchester . A younger sister Kathleen was born in 1890 and Edmund the youngest was born in 1893 . <p> Jim Boland was very active in Dublin GAA circles and he was also politically active . After the death of Parnell , Jim opposed Tim Healey for control of the Irish Party . In a dispute over control of the United Ireland newspaper office , Jim received a blow to the head . While thought to be a minor injury , it later developed into a cyst that exerted pressure on his brain . As time went on he experienced severe headaches and loss of memory . After an unsuccessful brain surgery , Jim 's health deteriorated rapidly . Catherine fetched a priest from nearby Phibsborough church to give her husband last rites . The priest refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * " Catherine sent for Fr . Headley , a sympathetic Dominican priest who gave Jim the last anointing .... Harry was eight years old when he lost a father he loved and admired very much . " <p> Harry was educated at the Synge St. Christian Brothers ' School but after a personality clash with one of the brothers , Harry refused to return to school . Nellie was sick with TB and Harry went to live with Tom Tynan and his wife and for 3 years he attended de la Salle College , Co . Laois as a novitiate . He excelled at sports in the college , hurling was his dominant game . The atmosphere of the Peafield House was very nationalistic and Harry did the same work as the three Tynan brothers , with Thomas Jr . being the same age as Harry , so they spent a good deal of time together . Harry 's older sister , Nellie died from the effects of TB <p> Both Harry and his brother Gerry joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood on the same day in 1904 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated Dublin hurling player . * In 1907 , he became a member of the Dublin County Board GAA at the unusual early age of 20 . When Harry went to London in 1909 on GAA business he met Michael Collins for the first time . Collins was involved in the GAA in London and was treasurer of the Geraldines club . Boland suggested to Collins that he join the IRB and Harry then brought him to Sam Maguire who initiated Collins into the organization . <p> He joined Irish Volunteers along with brothers Gerry and Ned at the inaugural meeting at the Rotunda . Harry , Ned and Gerry all participated in the Easter Rising of 1916 . He was imprisoned for his role in the Easter Rising of 1916 . After being identified by a prisoner he had taken and then released during the evacuation of the GPO , he was separated from the main body of Irish prisoners and told that he was to be court- martialled . * Harry was sentenced to ten years penal servitude ( with five years remission ) . After a brief stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dartmoor prison in England and then ultimately transferred to Lewes Gaol outside London . During this time the idea arose of putting some of the imprisoned men as candidates in the upcoming by-elections . Opinions differed on whether or not to do this , with Collins , Boland and Ashe in favor of it and De Valera and others opposed to it . However , Joe McGuinness a fellow prisoner was elected in the Longford by-election and he was hoisted on the shoulders of his mates and paraded around the gaol . Harry participated in activities to gain prisoner of war status for those imprisoned for the role in the Rising . As a result , Harry was identified as one of the ringleaders and was transferred to Maidstone Prison and treated as a convict along with De Valera and several others . Harry got to know De Valera well in prison and he admired him greatly . * Boland and De Valera had also learned that passive resistance , properly operated , could achieve political aims . <p> Through the help of funds raised by a hurling match , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin . This shop would later be used as a drop point for notes in Collins ' intelligence network . In the elections of 1918 , Harry won South Roscommon taking 72% of the votes cast . <p> On January 21 , 1919 while the first Dil ireann was assembling - Harry Boland and Michael Collins were on a boat to England to perform a special undercover job - namely , breaking deValera from jail - others answered the roll call for them and they were officially marked present . <p> After being freed from jail , deValera decided to go to America to bring Irish-American pressure on President Wilson to push for Ireland ' s claim at the upcoming Peace Conference . Collins was against this idea , thinking Dev 's place was in Ireland , this was the start of the conflict between deValera and Collins . <p> Harry took the place of San McGarry on the Supreme Council of the IRB and shortly after he became president . The IRB did not disband after the formation of the Dil ireann , although Cathal Brugha , the Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Collins and Boland believed the IRB had important work still to do . <p> On April 30 , 1919 amon de Valera appointed Harry as a special envoy from the elected government of the Irish Republic to the government and people of the United States . <p> He was later named Honorable Secretary of Sinn Fin , working closely with Michael Collins , 1917 ; Roscommon TD , 1918 ; ambassador to US , 1919 , organising de Valera 's fund-raising trip ; supported him in rift with Devoy ; opposed Treaty ; re-elected for Roscommon , June 1922 ; assassinated in Skerries Grand Hotel during Civil War , May 1922 ; there is a painting of the ' Funeral of Harry Boland '

##1639052 <h> Sister sites <h> Subsites <p> Friday , 30 November , 2012 <p> Forgiveness <p> Forgiveness is well known as being the central teaching of Christianity . It seems both eminently desirable and well-nigh impossible . Jesus ' teaching in the ' Our Father ' , his parable of the unmerciful servant and his encounter with Zacchaeus bring out how serious he is about this teaching . James McPolin SJ explains . <p> Maria worked in a bakery which we had built in our parish centre in Latin America for women seeking employment . I noticed that she looked sad at times . Then one day , as we chatted together , she explained to me why she felt sad . <p> A few years previously , the military came to the street where she lived and took young people out of their homes . They brutally killed Maria 's two daughters . She had felt sad ever since , she said . ' I tried for years to forgive those who killed my daughters but I was unable to do so . ' <p> Praying the Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us . " For a time I gave up saying the prayer . It is only recently that I have begun to pray it again . I think I am beginning to forgive now ' , said Maria with tears in her eyes . <p> In scenes of great brutality , Maria 's spirit of forgiveness touched me deeply . Every year , at Christmas , I remember her because it is a feast of peace , forgivness and reconciliation . Peace is an important message of Christmas . <p> The struggle for forgiveness Closer to home , in the North , we hear many stories about people 's struggles with forgiveness . On the killing of her brother , a woman says , ' As for the people who killed him ... I ca n't forgive . I could never forgive them . Maybe if they were truly sorry and showed it ... but even then I just do n't know ' . A man says about the killing of his father , ' I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ... we all have blood on our hands . When it comes to thoughts of revenge , I feel I have put it all behind me ' . <p> On the way to church Recently I read a book called Adventures in Reconciliation . It carries a story of a woman , Bernadette Power , called ' Murder on the way to Church ' . Her husband was shot dead beside her , her daughter was shot in the eye , and her son shot in the thigh . <p> ' For years I struggled ... Many a time I lost my head . But I knew in my heart that Jesus had not walked away ... I 've never seen the face of the man that murdered Mickey ... But I would still pray and say , " Lord , whoever he is , show him the mercy that you 've shown me " ... All I know is that , in faith , my prayer is , " Lord , if he goes before you , have mercy on him " . ' <p> Living the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the words of Jesus , ' Blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy ... If you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you ' . We find that the words of Scripture are most convincing when we meet people who put them into practice . <p> Jesus teaches that the call to forgive others is based squarely on God 's gracious forgiveness . In the parable of the unmerciful servant he describes an employee who receives forgiveness from his foreman but who does not grant it himself to others . This is a criticism of those who draw on God 's mercy and offer none of their own ( Mt.l8 ) . <p> A forgiving spirit When a Christian prays , ' forgive us our debts ' , he should also be able to say , ' as we also have forgiven our debtors ' ( Mt.6 ) . A forgiving spirit is the attitude with which to approach God for mercy : ' Forgive and you will be forgiven ' . <p> There can not be any limit to forgiveness for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of Jesus ' followers should keep score of others ' offences unless , of course , they have no objection to God keeping score of theirs . <p> Also , such forgiveness is to be from the heart , not merely for show ( Mt 18 ) . The parable of the servant also emphasises the quality of compassion often emphasized by Jesus in word and action : ' Should you not have mercy on your fellow slave , as I had mercy on you ? ' <p> Difficulties in forgiving Forgiveness is perhaps the most difficult of the demands Our Lord makes in the gospels . Recently I was present at an international seminar on reconciliation . There were Africans present who took part in discussions in Rwanda after the genocide . The question was raised if it were too much to expect people to forgive in such situations . Some said that to forgive is a gift of God and that one needs to be healed by God in order to forgive . Others said that forgiveness is not merely complicated ; it is also possible and impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gospels shows that his followers are asked to take it on . We may call forgiveness a moment of grace , yet the human effort that it requires can be immense . The power to forgive remains one of the most awesome powers of a human being as well as of the divine Being . Forgiveness seems both possible and impossible . <p> Forgiveness takes time I am sure that many people have special memories of important moments of forgiveness , for example , that of Gordon Wilson , whose daughter was murdered in the Enniskillen bomb on Remembrance Sunday in 1987 and who was able to forgive her killers immediately afterwards . <p> Not many are able to do this . Nor does Jesus ' invitation to forgive ask us to forgive immediately . Maria said that it took her a long time to forgive . <p> For us , forgiveness at times can be a slow and dark process that may sometimes seem impossible . The normal process of grieving takes time and it involves varying stages of denial , anger , bargaining and gradual acceptance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pray the Our Father without changing the words to something like ' Forgive us our trespasses , not as we forgive others , but as we would like to be able to forgive others , that is , in the way you forgive them ' . Sometimes forgiveness comes slowly , but in the end we are asked by God to forgive and we need to ask God for his gift to forgive . <p> We can not get away from the fact that God invites us to forgive as he forgives . It may take us a long time . We may find ourselves imprisoned in bitterness and resentment , even destroyed as human beings , till we shed our enmity and become reconciled with God and with those who may have injured us . <p> The example of Jesus We are encouraged not only by the call of Jesus to forgive but also by his example . In his ministry he gives forgiveness even when those who offend do not repent . It is clear that he forgave his enemies when they clearly had not repented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgive them for they do not know what they do ' . <p> Jesus invites Zacchaeus , the rich tax-collector , to table with him before he repents . There are other examples of people who were forgiven , though they had not yet given any sign of repentance . This does not mean that Jesus ' forgiveness restores the relationship with the sinner without any response . What it shows is that Jesus does not give up on anyone . <p> We see in Jesus a picture of a God who is anxious to take the initiative and mend broken relationships . At the same time we should not assume that forgiveness was easy for Jesus . At times we see him angry in the gospels . But his anger is often an expression of his compassion . Finally , his spirit of compassion and forgiveness comes across in his parables about mercy and compassion . <p> This 
##1640250 <h> Middle East <p> Christian Aid calls for UK legislation to end the trade in Israeli settlement products for the sake of peace and development ( June 2012 ) <p> Christian Aid and Quakers in Britain are uniting to urge the UK government to impose a ban on the import of Israeli settlement products . They will tell a Parliamentary meeting later today ( 19 June 2012 ) , joined by the Methodist Church and the Church of Scotland , that such a move would promote the prospects of peace between Palestinians and Israelis . <p> 4.8 million Palestinians are living as refugees . This report looks at how addressing this issue will help unlock the peace process . <p> Despite competing narratives and differing interpretations of the role that international law can play , we challenge policy makers in the UK and Ireland and the wider international community , including in the Middle East itself , to recognise that any resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict requires a comprehensive approach to peace that has hitherto been absent . This , by definition , includes resolving the refugee issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal blockade of Gaza in the face of significant international pressure have done little to change the plight of Gaza 's civilians , says a report published on 30 November 2010 by an international coalition of 22 development , human rights and peace-building organisations . <p> The report calls for renewed international action to ensure an immediate , unconditional and complete lifting of the blockade . <p> In the past year Israeli authorities have allowed only 41 truckloads of construction materials into Gaza . Rebuilding and repairing thousands of homes alone will require thousands of truckloads of building materials . <p> This report calls for action be taken to secure an end to the Israeli blockade . <p> The Middle East Quartet ( the EU , Russia , the UN , and the US ) is failing to make adequate progress towards improving the lives of Palestinians or improving the prospects for peace in the region .

##1640450 <h> Fostering <h> Information <p> Fostering in Ireland means taking care of someone else 's child in your own home . Often , a child can not live with his or her family either on a short- or long-term basis . This could be because of illness in the family , the death of a parent , neglect , abuse or violence in the home . Sometimes , it could be for economic reasons , like unemployment . In an ideal situation , the child placed in foster care will return to his or her own family as soon as this is possible . Foster care in Ireland is governed by the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child Care ( Placement of Children in Foster Care ) Regulations 1995 . In addition , the National Standards for Foster Care , 2003 ( pdf ) have a major role to play in ensuring that the foster care placements are adequately supported and that children in foster care are receiving the best possible care . There are currently about 4,500 children in foster care in Ireland . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruits and trains foster families according to the needs of the area . The HSE also places children with foster families who have been recruited and trained by non-statutory agencies . The HSE is responsible for each child in care but support to the foster family may be provided by the non-statutory agency . Each foster child has his or her own social worker who monitors the growth and development of the child and ensures that the best interests of the child are always kept in mind . Each foster family also has its own social worker , who may have helped assess the family as suitable to foster children and who will support the family throughout the foster term . An important part of the social worker 's role is to develop the relationship between the foster child and the foster family and between the foster child and his or her own family . It is important to note that fostering a child differs from adoption because a foster child always remains a permanent part of his or her own family . <p> Under Section 4 of the Child Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July 2007 , the foster parents or relatives who have been caring for a child for a continuous period of at least five years may apply to the court for an order . The consent of the HSE is required and the consent of the parents or guardians may be required . <p> The order may , subject to conditions , give the foster parents or relatives broadly the same rights as parents have to make decisions about their children . In particular , they will be able to give consent for medical and psychiatric examinations , treatment and assessments and sign the forms for the issue of a passport . <p> Children can be placed in foster care in two ways : <p> Voluntarily : This happens when a parent or family asks the HSE Area for help and/or <p> Court order : This happens when a judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the care of the HSE . <p> When a child is placed in foster care , the HSE assigns responsibility for the child to a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the HSE makes a decision on the type of fostering that is most suitable for the child . There are three different types of fostering : <h> Day foster care <p> This involves specially trained foster parents/carers providing foster care for a child on a daily basis . Day foster care takes place in the home of the foster parent and the child returns to his or her own home each night . This type of care gives the child 's own family an opportunity to deal with difficulties each day as they arise . The goal of day foster care is that the child can return home on a full-time basis . <h> Short-term foster care <p> This involves a child being cared for by a foster family for a short period ( ranging from 1 week to some months ) . The aim is for the child to return to his or her family full-time at the end of the short-term period . Sometimes , however , the child may remain in foster care on a longer-term basis . <h> Long-term foster care <p> This involves a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years and may continue until the child reaches adulthood . <h> Relative foster care <p> Relative foster care happens when another family member becomes foster parent of the child . For example , a grandparent , aunt , uncle , adult sister/brother , etc . <p> In this situation , the relative of the child is assessed by the HSE in exactly the same way as all other foster parents . <p> Children in Ireland are not taken into foster care in the first place , unless the HSE assesses that the child is at risk . In making their decision about the relative being foster parent to the child , the HSE will decide what is in the best interest for the child . Assessment will also take into account the needs of the child and the abilities , suitability etc. of the relative to be a foster parent . <h> The child 's family <p> When a child is placed in foster care on a daily , short-term or longer-term basis , maintaining links with his or her own family is very important . The child 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept fully informed of how the child is getting on . The child will see his or her own family as much as possible and even though he or she may live ( even for a longer-term period ) with another family , the child 's identity and name is his or her own . <h> Who can become a foster carer ? <p> Any person or family can apply to the HSE to be assessed as a foster parent or foster family . You do not have to be married in Ireland to be a foster parent . In fact , you could be a single person , civil partners or a cohabiting couple . You must be able to provide adequate and appropriate accommodation for the foster child . The HSE assigns a social worker to carry out an assessment of suitability . These assessments include meeting all members of the family ( particularly the foster parent(s) ) over a number of months . References , Garda clearance and medical examinations will also be required as part of this process . Every effort is made to ensure that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Rules <p> Young people up to the age of 18 can be fostered . <p> Any person or family can apply to the HSE to be assessed as a foster parent or foster family . References , Garda clearance and medical examinations will also be required as part of this process . <p> There are no maximum age limits for foster carers . In making a decision about suitability as a foster carer , every effort is made to ensure that those selected are suitable . In other words , the decision to place a child with a particular foster carer is on the basis of the individual child and their needs and each cases is judged on it 's own merits . <h> Rates <p> The HSE pays a basic maintenance allowance to foster parents and families and offers strong support structures to assist the child , carer and family during the fostering term . The HSE also provides training for the carer or family , on-going liaison with social workers , insurance and a medical card for the child in care . Allowances payable for children in foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child <p> Payment per week <p> Under 12 years <p> 312 per child per week <p> Over 12 years <p> 339 per child per week <p> An allowance may be paid between the ages of 18 and 21 where the child is still with the family and in full time education . This allowance is known as an After Care Allowance . <p> After fostering a child for 6 months you should be eligible for Child Benefit , but have to apply for it . <h> How to apply <p> If you are interested in fostering and would like to offer a child a home , you should contact your Local Health Office in the HSE . <p> The Irish Foster Care Association is a voluntary organisation working with the HSE throughout Ireland to promote fostering as the best option for children who can not live with their own family .

##1641151 <p> Daniel Vaughan , scientist , mathematician , physiologist and astronomer , was born at Glenomra near Kilbane , Broadford , County Clare , around 1818 . His father , John , was a farmer and Daniel had a brother Edmund ( or Owen ) and a sister called Margaret . He was a nephew of Bishop Daniel Vaughan . Daniel received his early education at the local hedge school and later attended the Killaloe classical school . <p> He emigrated to the United States around 1840 , though the circumstances and the date of his departure are unclear . One version states that , at eighteen years of age , he paid for his passage using money given by his uncle for the purpose of studying for the priesthood . There are also doubts as to his marital status at this time . He may have been a widower at the time he left Ireland and there is a possibility that he had a son who remained with relatives in Ireland . <p> He spent some time in the southern states and by 1842 was working as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon he was running a classical school in the area , teaching Greek , Latin , mathematics and astronomy . He was a gifted linguist , fluent in German , Italian , French and Spanish . He was appointed to the chair of Greek in a college at Bardstown in Kentucky . His interest in scientific studies was growing and he became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . Several of his journal articles were published and , resulting from his work in experimental physiology , he was awarded a fellowship in the Association . His articles included On the Motions of Numerous Small Bodies and the Phenomena Resulting there from and Solar Light . <p> By 1850 Daniel Vaughan was living in Cincinnati and continuing his studies in the scientific area . He was particularly interested in astronomy and natural phenomena . In December 1850 his article Chemical Researches in Animal and Vegetable Physiology was published in the Eclectic Medical Journal .

His paper entitled The Stability of Satellites Revolving in Small Orbits was published in 1857 and was considered a very important study . Shy and eccentric , much of his time was spent in the public library on Vine Street , Cincinnati . He was held in high regard in the academic world , solving major problems of physical astronomy through his mathematical genius .

##1648250 <h> PRINGLE CALLS ON GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH SUICIDE PREVENTION AUTHORITY <p> Thomas Pringle TD has called on the government to establish a Suicide Prevention Authority to tackle the prevalence of suicide and self-harm in our society . <p> Speaking on the matter to Eamon Gilmore today at Leaders ' Questions , the Independent TD for Donegal South West said mental illness and suicide is a major problem in our society , with three times more deaths by suicide than on our roads in this country . <p> " This week Turn the Tide on Suicide launched a campaign for the establishment of a Suicide Prevention Authority in Ireland and I think it 's time that this proposal was given very serious consideration . <p> " Up to 700 people every year take their lives by suicide , over 300,000 people suffer from mental illness and 75,000 people self-harm in this country . Surely this represents a crisis of national proportions ? <p> " The National Suicide Prevention Office is clearly limited and underfunded . As part of the HSE they are not independent and can not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government made a commitment to ring fence 35 million annually for mental illness . The question has to be asked where this funding has gone -- are services being expanded , or has the money gone to close gaps in the health budget ? <p> " We have seen the success in recent years of the Road Safety Authority and how road deaths have been reduced , despite the terrible tragedies of recent days , impact is being made . <p> He added a Suicide Prevention Authority could achieve similar results . <p> " What it needs is the commitment of government to have it established and ensure that there is an adequate budget to help an authority in its work . <p> " From there we could through time see the numbers of people who are at risk getting help and the toll that suicide takes in our society being reduced , but urgent action is required to make this change , " stated Pringle . <p> It would be great if this government could realise that the rate of suicide and self harm has increased as a direct result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition the previous government left this country in . At present , their is little or no job prospects , fee 's make it prohibitive for students to go to college in a lot of cases , and the cost of living is well beyond what income most youngsters have . The slightly older generation are burdened with negative equity and serious debt . Until this government are willing to acknowledge this , and deal with it , then suicide will continue to be the only option for some people .. I really feel for the people who are in despair at present and we need to be able to reach out to these people before its too late .

##1650951 <p> The Managerial System The managerial system , which was invented in the U.S. , has also been adopted ( with local modifications ) in countries such as Australia , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Honduras , Chile , and Brazil . A short description of its application in the U.S. is set out below . <p> The U.S. As noted above , the Irish managerial system was initially inspired by the managerial system then being introduced in a number of U.S. cities . This " council-manager " system as it is known has gained in popularity and is now used in the majority of cities with populations over 12,000 . Other U.S. cities have retained councils/mayors with executive authority ( to differing degrees ) , while the town meeting system is still used in some smaller towns in New England . <p> While the operation of the council-manager system will vary from city to city ( each city will have its own charter , perhaps based on a menu of options laid down by state law -- see an example from Massachusetts below ) the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , passing ordinances , voting appropriations , and having overall supervisory authority for city government . The city manager has executive responsibility for the implementation of policy and for the hiring and management of staff . <p> Commonwealth of Massachusetts <p> General Laws -- City Charters <p> " Plan A " , a city government and legislative body composed of the mayor and a city council , the councillors being elected at large . <p> " Plan B " , a city government and legislative body composed of a mayor and city council , the councillors being elected partly at large and partly from districts or wards of the city . <p> " Plan C " , a city government and legislative body composed of a mayor and commissioners as specified . <p> " Plan D " , a city government and legislative body , to be known as the city council , composed of seven or nine members , one of whom shall be mayor and shall be the official head of the city , and an administrative officer , called the city manager . <p> " Plan E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as the city council , composed of seven or nine members , one of whom shall be elected as mayor by and from such members and shall be the official head of the city , and an administrative officer , called the city manager ; the members of the city council and the elective members of the school committee to be elected at large by proportional representation . <p> " Plan F " , a city government and legislative body composed of a mayor and a city council , the councillors being elected partly at large and partly from wards of the city , with the mayor and city councillors to be nominated in party primaries . <p> Two Examples of the Manager/Mayor/Council Division of Powers in the U.S. <p> The charter of the City of Miami , Florida gives the directly elected Mayor the power to appoint the City Manager , appoint committees and to present a budget and state of the city address ( but only after consultation with the manager ) and to veto some major decisions of the Commission ( Council ) , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all administrative and staffing functions . Miami-City is a city within Miami-Dade County , a higher level tier of local government which in turn also has its elected Mayor and County Manager . <p> The small city of Cerritos , Los Angeles , population 51,000 , ( praised in the Economist magazine for its effective governance ) operates a strong managerial system . In this case the Mayor is appointed by the other councillors , and has no defined executive powers . Unlike Miami above , it is the Manager who prepares and proposes the Budget for example . The Manager is likewise in charge of all staffing and administrative affairs and in fact there is a prohibition on councillors communicating with officials ( save for making enquiries ) except through the Manager . <p> Councils with A Directly Elected Non-Executive Mayor <p> New Zealand Alongside the election of the council , each local council area directly elects a mayor who is chair of the council . The mayor is not given any particular executive functions but has a moral authority by virtue of popular election . Each local authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for implementing the local authority 's policy agenda . Councils are elected every 3 years . <p> New Zealand law specifies that there should be a clear split between policy aspects of local government and the operationalisation of such policies . Within this set up the CEO reports to the council while all other staff report to the CEO . The council is described as acting as a Board of Directors acting on behalf of the community . <p> It should be noted that the lower tier local authorities in New Zealand have a similar range of functions as Irish local authorities , although it is also noteworthy that around 90% of New Zealand 's local authority expenditure is raised locally . <p> Indirect Election of Executive Mayor Local authorities in Spain and France are governed by councils who in turn elect executive mayors for the lifetime of the council . <p> Spain Spanish legislation provides for an executive mayor to be elected from among the elected councillors of the local authority . In turn , the mayor can , if he or she wishes , create governing teams , cabinet-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In turn , Spanish law allows councils to grant professional city managers the functions of organising and managing their administrative services , who operate in a similar manner to a CEO in an English local authority . The actual powers given to a manager can vary depending on the size of the local authority area , with the manager 's role increasing in complexity with the size of the city . <p> France French mayors often have a very high profile and this can sometimes give the erroneous impression that they are directly elected while in reality they are appointed by the elected council . In France , there are three main tiers of local administration : the commune , department and region . <p> 80 per cent of communes have fewer than 1,000 residents . Each commune has a deliberative or decision-making body ( the municipal council ) and an executive ( the mayor ) . The number of municipal councillors is proportional to the population . Municipal councillors lay down guidelines for municipal policy , adopt the budget , manage municipal assets , notably primary school buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate . <p> The mayor is both the commune 's elected authority and the state 's representative in it . Mayoral acts are unilateral administrative acts , generally orders , whose legality is subject to control by the courts , when they are issued by the mayor as the commune 's chief executive , and to the approval of the Departmental Prefect to whom the mayor is subordinate when acting in the capacity as the state 's representative . <p> Direct Election of Executive Mayors <p> Italy In Italy , the mayor , who has executive functions , is directly elected by the people living within the commune , as is a council of between 15- 80 members . The term of office for a mayor is five years , and they can not normally serve for more than two consecutive terms . <p> Larger towns ( with populations over 10,000 ) employ Segretari Generali with professional administrative functions . Laws enacted in 1990 introduced the concept of managerial responsibility . These laws established a series of managerial functions that had to be performed by the SGs as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reserved these functions for the councils themselves . These tasks include managing services , supervising the work of department heads , coordinating their activities in accordance with the mayor 's directives , and implementing the decisions taken by the political bodies . <p> Germany Germany is a federal parliamentary democracy , made up of 16 states or Lnder . There are around 14,000 municipalities in the 16 Lnder . Following reforms in the 1990s all Lnder have enacted legislation which provides for the direct election of executive mayors . In the middle-sized and larger cities these are full-time salaried positions while in small municipalities they operate on a part-time , non-salaried formula . <p> The direct election of the mayor was meant to further extend the rights of citizens in local decision-making . It also aimed at strengthening the political and administrative leadership in local policy making and administration as , particularly in the case of the " strong " mayor , he/she is not only chairperson of the elected council , but also holds the chief executive function in directing local administration . <p> Above the local tier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local administration known as Kreise ( districts ) also exists . A district council oversees these with a mandate varying between one and four years . <p> Cabinet or Collective Government Some countries operate collective , or cabinet-like local governance , with executive power invested in a small executive elected from among the local council . <p> The Netherlands In the Netherlands , the mayor ( burgemeester ) is de facto appointed by the national cabinet , de jure by the monarch . She/he is the leader of the municipal executive , which in turn is selected from the municipal council . The municipal council is directly elected . In effect , executive power is exercised by the executive rather than the mayor , who is its formal head . <p> The municipal council supervises the executive . In keeping with the way he or she is elected , the mayor mainly exercises a supervisory role over the proper preparation , adoption and implementation of city policies . For example , he or she must publish an annual report on the quality of services , which is then passed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's main job is to assist the executive committee , the mayor , and the committees created by both . The executive committee specifies the functions that the manager must perform . The importance of this figure varies according to municipality . In the majority of cases , the position is quite strong ; he or she heads the entire administrative organisation and takes decisions on his or her own initiative . In other cases , however , the manager merely provides technical assistance . <p> Sweden In Sweden , the mayor is directly appointed by the central government . A legislative municipal council of between 31 and 101 members is elected from a party list system of proportional representation at municipal elections . The council in turn appoints a municipal executive board from its members . The executive board is headed by its chairperson . <p> This executive board holds executive power , performing the functions of strategic management and coordination . The president of the executive board is the political leader of the local council in Sweden , and often leads the largest political party on the council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent committees with executive competence over operational matters . <p> Legally , in Sweden the CEO is not a powerful figure . The position is optional , and if it is created , local politicians define the role which the CEO is to perform . Despite this , CEOs tend to have important responsibilities and take on administrative coordination . The 1992 reform of local government specified that the CEO may only perform administrative functions and must execute political decisions without questioning them . <p> Finland In Finland there are no mayors as such . The form of local government is similar to that in Sweden with an elected council and an executive committee . <p> The highest executive official ( manager ) is appointed to public office by the city council . The manager is given the responsibility of executing the decisions of the council . All functions are performed under the direction , supervision and monitoring of the executive committee , that is , the city board of directors . The city board of directors are responsible for the administrative and financial management of local governments , for preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for implementing the council 's decisions . <p> The city manager supervises the administrative and financial management of the local governments and is only subordinate to the board of directors . <p> England and Wales Prior to the reforms under the Local Government Act 2000 , executive and policy making responsibility in English local authorities rested with the elected council . Much of the executive decision making was undertaken by committees of the council . In turn , decisions were implemented by council officials working under a chief executive . While a chief executive did not have the powers of a county manager in Ireland , it was , and is , still the case that councillors and committees depended on the chief executive for advice and guidance . In practice therefore , the chief executive had to establish a close working relationship with the council leader/mayor and committee chairpersons . The mayor/leader in the English local government model was elected annually , and similar to Ireland , the lack of continuity in office was seen to give rise to a lack of public recognition . <p> Local Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the visibility of local leaders , the U.K. Government reformed the system of English and Welsh local authority governance to provide for a political executive which was to be separate from the majority of council members . The Local Government Act 2000 provided for 3 possible models of executive : <p> A mayor and cabinet executive , consisting of a directly elected mayor and 2 or more councillors appointed by the mayor ; or , <p> A leader and cabinet executive , consisting of a leader elected by the council and 2 or more councillors appointed by the leader or council itself ; or , <p> A mayor and council manager executive , consisting of a directly elected mayor together with an official appointed as manager . <p> Of the 3 models proposed , most of England 's 400+ councils adopted the second option -- that of a leader and cabinet executive . 12 councils opted for a directly elected mayor , while only one council opted for the mayor and manager option . In total , referendums to seek the provision of a directly elected mayor were held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 to 1 against elected mayors . <p> The effect of the changes in most councils , therefore , was to place power in a cabinet type structure . The upside was that it delivered key leaders , but it has been criticised as marginalising the powers of " backbench " councillors . <p> The October 2006 Local Government White Paper , entitled Strong and Prosperous Communities , reviewed this issue again . It stated that local authorities in England and Wales adopted " a cautious approach to change " , and it went on to criticise the fact that most leaders face election every year : " This can make it hard to take and see through essential but difficult decisions that may in the short term be unpopular . It also brings uncertainty for senior management teams in pursuing and implementing longer term strategies . The Government believes that it is important that councils move towards having more stable and more visible political leadership . " <p> Therefore , the U.K. Government has now decided to legislate for 3 models of executive arrangement as follows : <p> A directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly elected executive with a 4 year term ; and , <p> An indirectly elected leader with a 4 year term . <p> All executive power is to be vested in the mayor/leader but power may be delegated to members of the local authority cabinet . These changes are now being legislated for . <p> Local Government Reform in Northern Ireland Currently in Northern Ireland the 26 district councils have a very limited range of services ( these include waste management , building control , recreation services etc ) . Power rests with the elected members and councils are administered by Chief Executive Officers . Under Direct Rule , the Review of Public Administration Report Better Government for Northern Ireland ( March 2006 ) contained decisions for reforming the administrative structures in Northern Ireland , including reducing the numbers of councils from 26 to 7 while giving those councils additional powers in areas such as planning , roads , urban renewal etc . <p> The decisions of the 2006 report were reviewed by the new devolved administration . On 13 March 2008 the key decisions on the future shape of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rationalised to create 11 districts , and a range of functions will be transferred to the new councils , including aspects

An initial GOAL emergency response will normally include water , food and sanitation distributions , as well as the provision of emergency healthcare , emergency and transitional shelters and cash-for-work or emergency cash transfer programmes . We also train communities on disaster-preparedness and risk reduction in many disaster-prone regions of the developing world . <p> Crisis Recovery <p> As the title suggests , crisis recovery is a GOAL intervention to help populations recover from an extreme emergency situation . The initial crisis may have been natural , such as the earthquake in Haiti , famine in Niger , or the south-east Asian tsunami , or a manmade disaster , as in the post-election violence in Nigeria or the civil conflict in Northern Uganda . Crisis recovery is by definition a process , and is intended to aid recovery and a ( usually gradual ) return to normality by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be specifically designed to cater to the particular , often multifarious , immediate , medium and long term needs of the victims . <p> Read about our Transitional Shelter Programme in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti to learn more about some of the aid we deliver in this area Healthcare <p> GOAL health programmes can include direct healthcare provision , and the building and equipping of health centres and the training of local staff in their management . <p> We also operate emergency feeding , specialised feeding for the vulnerable , and extensive inoculation programmes , and train local communities in health awareness and hygiene promotion . <p> Community Development <p> GOAL seeks to empower individuals and groups of people in many parts of the developing world by providing them with some of the skills they need to affect positive change in their communities . Within most communities there is enormous potential which , if assisted , encouraged and properly harnessed , can create significant long-term sustainable benefit for the entire locale . <p> GOAL helps identify common concerns , and can provide training and opportunities for the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . Where appropriate , we will assist the community to build relationships with political representatives and other key people and organisations . <p> By enabling people to act together to common advantage , our community development programmes foster social inclusion , create equal opportunities , and enhance the lives of beneficiaries . Education <p> GOAL is a firm advocate of education as one of the few possible escape routes out of poverty in the developing world . Consequently , where it is feasible we implement extensive formal and non-formal education programmes . <p> The former can include the ( re- ) building and furnishing of schools , pre-school preparatory work with street and slum-dwelling children , and support for pupils through the provision of stationery , uniforms and school fees . <p> Non-formal education programmes include basic numeric skills training for children and adults , the promotion of health awareness , coaching in livelihood enhancement , and management and healthcare training for health clinic staff . Livelihoods Development <p> A person 's livelihood is the means by which he or she can earn and sustain a proper standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means , nor the skills , or the opportunities to provide for themselves and their families . <p> Where circumstances will allow , GOAL intervenes with training and support for individuals and communities to enhance their livelihood prospects . <p> GOAL has numerous livelihood programmes in operation in the developing world , each tailored to the particular needs , circumstances and potential of local communities . <p> HIV and Aids <p> It is estimated that , worldwide , 9,000 people die every day from an Aids-related illness ; by far the majority of these deaths are in the developing world . GOAL implements a range of programmes for HIV and Aids sufferers , their carers , and the people indirectly affected by HIV or Aids . <p> This can include attending to the health , education and social needs of orphans and street-dwelling children , through GOAL 's comprehensive Street Children programmes . <p> Read about our Housing Support Programme in Uganda to find out more about our work to support people affected by HIV and Aids <p> Integrated Development and Slum Development Programmes <p> GOAL implements integrated development programmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . The needs of a locality will dictate the shape and focus of each individual programme , but to varying degrees they all encompass aspects of health , water and sanitation , food , nutrition , education , livelihoods , and slum development . The latter , slum development , itself further includes housing , children-at-risk and local community development . See our Brick Kilns Programme in India as an example of our work in this area . <p> Food Distribution <p> In instances of extreme poverty , populations will always struggle to acquire enough food to sustain life . When drought , famine or another natural disaster ( such as earthquakes , flooding , hurricanes etc ) strikes , an already bad situation is rendered infinitely worse . <p> The same is true of manmade catastrophes such as war and civil unrest , when food opportunities become severely restricted . <p> Food distribution forms an integral part of the GOAL response to an emergency , and is also central to many of its medium to long-term development programmes . <p> WASH/WatSan <p> WASH is the acronym for water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three as absolute fundamentals to people 's health and well-being . WatSan is an abbreviated term for Water and Sanitation . In virtually every country where GOAL has a presence , WASH or WatSan are involved in the provision of clean water and sanitation facilities and in training local communities in best hygiene practices . Proper hygiene practices are essential in the curtailment of disease and infection , and particularly so in relation to new mothers and babies . <p> Children-at-Risk <p> In developing countries around the world , there is an ever-present risk to the well-being of significant numbers of children and young people . GOAL has designed and implements programmes to address the specific needs of at-risk children and youngsters . <p> Each country has its own particular problems that directly or indirectly negatively impact on children : <p> A conflict situation : As well as the manifest threat to their lives that war brings , children risk being orphaned or separated from their parents , and left to fend for themselves . Or they may be abducted and forcibly recruited into one of the warring factions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , water and medical care is scarce and the risk of infection high . <p> Where there is a high prevalence of HIV and Aids : Invariably , in a country where there is a high prevalence of HIV and Aids there will also be high numbers of orphans . Without economic support these children are often forced to leave their homes , they usually gravitate towards large towns and cities to live as " street children " , making them particularly vulnerable to adult exploitation . <p> In areas of extreme poverty : In extreme poverty situations , where a high risk to health through lack of food , water , sanitation and adequate healthcare is already existent , children can be in further danger from parents who may be tempted to sell them in order to temporarily ease economic pressures . <p> Natural disasters : The risk to children from drought , famine , earthquakes , flooding and all manner of other natural disasters is obvious . <p> In respect of its feeding programmes , GOAL is most concerned to ensure that the food it distributes is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young children , nursing mothers and pregnant women , in respect of whom a supplementary feeding programme will usually be initiated . <p> As part of its efforts to raise the nutritional value of the food being consumed in developing countries , GOAL has designed and implements many agricultural and home-garden initiatives ( both practical and educational ) , each one particular to the prevailing conditions of the region . <p> Click here to see where GOAL is working in the developing world and learn what we are doing in each country to alleviate the suffering of those most in need . <p> Since 1977 , GOAL has spent in excess of 720 million delivering aid to some of the most vulnerable people in the developing world . We have achieved all this on an exceptionally low administration cost base . <p> GOAL Ireland is a registered charity in Ireland : Charity Reg No : CHY 6271 GOAL UK is a registered charity in the United Kingdom : Charity Reg No : 1107403 GOAL USA is registered in the US as a 501(c) ( 3 ) not-for-profit organization and 
##1657952 <p> In Dundalk Institute of Technology , litter is dealt with on an ongoing basis on campus by Estates staff members who sweep outside each entrance several times a day along with emptying outside litter bins . The litter dealt with includes cigarette butts , plastic bottles , paper cups and sweet wrappings . Of these , the biggest problem relates to cigarette butts . <p> Littering is identified as a minor offence in DkIT , and if persistent a major offence in the Student Code of Conduct . In DkIT there is a policy of no smoking on campus within a 15 metre perimeter of each entrance , but it was found that this is not adhered to . Another notable problem is that bins have not been installed at entrances to the P J Carroll 's building due to a preservation order on that building . There is also heavy littering in the car parks as motorists extinguish their cigarettes before getting into or out of their cars and along the paths around campus . Therefore the issue can not be entirely blamed on the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided there is a heavy littering of cigarette butts . <p> Despite these issues , on the whole DkIT has an excellent record in relation to litter as attested by the performance in various assessments of Dundalk carried out by external bodies . For three consecutive years DkIT has performed exceptionally well in An Taisce 's annual IBAL surveys . Achieving Grade A 's in both 2010 and 2011 . <p> The DkIT Green-Campus committee recognised the complexity of the issues surrounding litter and that more could be done to engage students and enable them to litter less . Littering of butts was identified as a major issue which was being exacerbated by the lack of bins in some areas and the failure to use the bins provided in other instances . <p> During Green Week 2012 and Spring Clean 2012 , Green Campus focused on the issue of Cigarette Butt littering on campus . It was decided to engage the help of the Local Authority and that litter wardens should come on campus for one day during Green Week warning students about the fines they could incur by throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than disposing of them in the correct manner . No fines were given on this day ; rather the aim was to educate students and change attitudes and behaviours towards littering . In preparation it was discovered that the Litter Wardens do not actually have authority to fine on campus . Tidy Towns provided promotional material such as posters , stickers and beer mats to raise awareness of issues surrounding litter and in particular , the problem of cigarette butts being thrown on the ground . For National Spring Clean 2012 , volunteers including DkIT staff , students , and the Green Campus committee gathered over 4,000 cigarette butts over the course of a three hour clean up . <p> 4,000 Cigarette Butts were collected in 3

##1659852 <p> There are many interesting facts about Ireland which are frequently misunderstood and misinterpreted . This page presents some information . <p> The island is known as ' Ireland ' and is divided into two countries : <p> The Republic of Ireland <p> Northern Ireland <p> The Republic officially known as ' Eire ' is comprised of 26 counties and is an independent country with its own government , administration , army , navy and air force . The country no longer has any political links with the UK - Irish citizens are not subjects of the Queen of England <p> Neutrality : the Republic has long maintained neutrality . During the Second World War , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , requested that allied forces be allowed to use the Irish western sea ports in the Battle of the Atlantic ( war against German U boats ) . This was refused although Ireland covertly co-operated with the allies during the war ( see Dublin by train , Glencree German war graves , for further details ) . To this day the Republic is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may see neutrality eroded . It joined the EU/EEC in 1973 . <p> Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and consists of 6 counties . Up to 2002 it had its own administrative assembly ( Stormont ) but it is currently suspended . References to " 32 " by nationalists refer to the total number of counties in Ireland ( north and south ) <p> There are four Irish provinces - Ulster , Leinster , Munster and Connaught . Ulster includes the six northern Irish counties and three now in the Republic - Cavan , Donegal and Monaghan . These provinces have little meaning in political or administrative terms nowadays . These divisions are quite ancient , dating from the period following the Norman invasion around the 13th century . <p> The principal local administrative authorities are the 27 counties , each of which has a county council ( Tipperary is divided into north and south ridings ) . Each council has a chairman who usually doubles as the Lord mayor . The function of each council ( sometimes borough ) is to organize local services , particularly local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as helpdesks and helplines ) , waste disposal and fire brigades . Other important functions include financial planning , the making of bye-laws , collection of rent and tolls , the maintenance of parks , gardens and open spaces , street cleaning , and other services . Members of the local authority ( councillors ) are not normally paid for their services , although they have been known to claim the odd expense or ten ! <p> Local authorities in Ireland do not control the police ( Gardai ) or military . This is done at national level ; while there are regional centres for the Gardai , they are administered on a national level . <p> Legal facts : The highest court in the land is the Supreme Court ; the lowest are the District Courts . The District Courts are the essence of the judicial system in Ireland ; they perform essential services over local and criminal jurisdictions . A District judge must be a lawyer of at least ten years ' standing . The District Courts may refer to the Circuit Courts ( where the cases of appellants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges must be Senior Counsels ; the ' circuit ' refers to the group of courts to which s/he must travel . The judge may appoint a jury if necessary , otherwise cases are judged by judge alone . The High Court normally site in Dublin and deals with cases beyond the Circuit Court ( such a constitutional matters ) . The Supreme Court is the last recourse for legal appeals and includes the Chief Justice , the President of the High Court plus four other judges . They normally deal with constitutional matters ; the president of Ireland can refer bills passed by the Dail ( parliament ) and Seanad if s/he thinks they might affect the constitution . <p> Legal facts : The Attorney General ( AG ) is effectively the chief Irish lawyer , representing the government at the Supreme Court and advising on matters of technical constitutional law . The AG can also provide liaison between British and Irish legal officers amongst other things . The office fell into serious disrepute following a series of extraordinary events in 1982 ; the then AG , Patrick Connolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving Malcolm MacArthur the keys to his Dalkey apartment . The government , led by Charles Haughey , made an attempt to conceal the events ; the Taoiseach later described the episode as " grotesque , unbelievable , bizarre and unprecedented " . This gave rise to the popular Irish acronym GUBU , symbolizing Haughey 's ability to escape thorough judgement with skilful argument and use of language . <p> Ireland was most recently ruled by the British and was previously invaded by the Normans ( French ) and Scandinavians ( Vikings ) . <p> The Irish Free State was formed in 1921 leading to the withdrawal of British Crown forces in Ireland and civil war . The official truce was declared on 11 July 1921 . <p> Did you know ? <p> Ireland has virtually no coal or iron . Instead , there are plentiful supplies of peat or turf , much of which is harvested for power production under the state 's company Bord na Mona . They own almost as many kilometers in railway line ( for transporting the peat ) as the state rail company does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navan at Tara Mines . There are hopes that offshore gas fields will be further developed ; additionally there is minor ongoing exploration into oil , some of which has been successful and controversial . Minerals such as gypsum , magnesite and barytes were extensively mined in the 1960s-1980s but all such operations have since ceased or been scaled down . <p> The transition from ' free state ' to republic was somewhat painful . In June 1932 the British penalized Ireland by imposing a 40% tax on Irish imports , a retaliation to Ireland 's retention of the Irish Land Annuities . To this day there is still a proportion of Irish homeowners who owe yearly ground rent to British landlords . <p> Senior citizen perks : In recent years Irish governments have given real support to the elderly . Everyone over 65 gets free bus and rail travel in the Republic , as well as free bus and train tickets to Belfast . As well as the expected old-age pension , there is a good health support system . Pensioners do not need to pay a TV licence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In addition they get free telephone line rental and a small concession towards phone costs . Speaking personally , I have absolutely no problem with these measures ; after all , our seniors made and established our country and deserve all they get . <p> The harp , Ireland 's official emblem , is the only musical instrument used as a national emblem in the world . <p> Not only do schools get far more holidays that their UK counterparts , but a large number of schools close for the days whenever there are elections . Schools that host counting rather than voting do better - counting can take up to two days where voting is only for one day . <p> Water charges or rates are not paid by ordinary households , nor are water meters issued in the Republic . It is extremely likely that this situation will change in the large cities , due to ongoing development and lack of sustainable infrastructure . In the greater Dublin area , the dramatic increase in high density housing has placed much stress on water and sewerage services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s . In the Republic of Ireland 1962 the death rate per 1000 of the population was a staggering 11.9 , that is , 12 people in every 1000 died that year ( the figures will include infant deaths - the average life expectancy for men was the age of 66.8 years and women died on average aged 68.6 years ) . In the 2005 census the number of deaths per 1000 of the population was quoted as 6.6 , almost half that of the 1962 figure . Why the dramatic increase in life expectancy ? The facts speak for themselves ; part of the answer lies in better quality food , healthcare , employment and general well-being . <p> School summer holidays for secondary pupils begin around the beginning of June until the end of August - the best part of three months !

##1666950 <p> People do n't just recommend that you watch an Ed Burns film ; they seize you by the arm and just insist . It 's because they feel a deep personal connection to the kind of stories he writes . They get him and he gets them . <p> From the beginning of his career Burns has explored the Irish American experience in a way that few other writers and directors ever have . <p> Now fans of his work have reason to celebrate this holiday season . Apart from a cast reunion of sorts going on in The Fitzgerald Family Christmas , Burns is also making his cinematic return after two decades to the Irish American landscape that first made his career . <p> Back again are Michael McGlone and Connie Britton , who originally starred in The Brothers McMullen , but this time they appear as new characters from the kind of Irish background both they and Burns know like the back of their hands . <p> It all plays out with a certain inevitability while watching the film , which opens on November 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It evolved as I was writing the script , " Burns , 44 , tells the Irish Voice . " I had a conversation with Mike and Connie a few months prior to writing the screenplay about the possibility of a McMullen sequel . I wanted to get their thoughts on where they thought their characters might be 20 years from when we left off . " <p> Then Burns started to think about other actors he 's worked with successfully , and he started to write parts for them . <p> " I had just worked with Caitlin Fitzgerald and Kerry Bishe in Newlyweds and I knew that I wanted them to play two of the younger sisters , " he reveals . <p> Once he had his four principals written and cast , he realized the film was about a family coming together for a reunion . <p> " And I decided to do the same with my own filmmaking family . I went through the casts of every film I have ever made and cast at least one actor from every film I have made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened was that so many of these actors had known each other for such a long time , so the minute we started rolling the cameras you had a sense that these people really did have a shared history , which is actually true .

##1669851 <h> Alphabet of the Irish Language <p> Vowels can be either short or long . We use a mark called a sneadh fada , or fada for short , to indicate long vowels . So long vowels would be written : <p> , , , , <p> Short vowels are written without a fada : <p> a , e , i , o , u <p> There are also some vowel combinations that are always pronounced long , even though they are not marked with a fada . Whether a vowel is long or short affects its pronunciation , as explained in the section on pronunciation . <p> Modern Irish uses the regular latin alphabet , so any normal font will work fine , as long as it has the accented vowels ? which most do .

##1680552 <h> Hugh O'Neill <p> Essex arrived on the 15th of April , 1599 . He had an army of 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse -- the most powerful , if not the best equipped force ever sent into the country . He at once issued a proclamation , offering pardon to all the insurgents who should submit , and he despatched reinforcements to the northern garrison towns , and to Wicklow and Naas . He then marched southward , not without encountering a sharp defeat from Rory O'More . He attacked the Geraldines , without much success , in Fermoy and Lismore , having , on the whole , lost more than he had accomplished by the expedition . An engagement took place between O'Donnell and Sir Conyers Clifford , in the pass of Balloghboy , on the 16th of August , in which Conyers was killed , and his army defeated . His body was recognized by the Irish , towards whom he had always acted honorably , and they interred the remains of their brave and noble enemy with the respect which was justly due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to England for more troops , and his enemies were not slow to represent his incapacity , and to demand his recall ; but he had not yet lost grace with his royal mistress , and his request was granted .

When he arrived at the Lagan , where it bounds Louth and Monaghan , O'Neill appeared on the opposite hill with his army , and sent the O'Hagan , his faithful friend and attendant , to demand a conference . The interview took place on the following day ; and O'Neill , with chivalrous courtesy , dashed into the river on his charger , and there conversed with the English Earl , while he remained on the opposite bank . It was supposed that the Irish chieftain had made a favourable impression on Essex , and that he was disposed to conciliate the Catholics . He was obliged to go to England to clear himself of these charges ; and his subsequent arrest and execution would excite more sympathy , had he been as amiable in his domestic relations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ulster enjoyed a brief period of rest under the government of its native princes . In 1600 O'Neill proceeded southward , laying waste the lands of the English settlers , but promoting the restoration of churches and abbeys , and assisting the clergy and the native Irish in every possible way . Having lost Hugh Maguire , one of his best warriors , in an accidental engagement with St. Leger , the President of Munster , he determined to return to Ulster . A new Viceroy had just arrived in Ireland , and he attempted to cut off his retreat ineffectually . <p> O'Neill had now obtained a position of considerable importance , and one which he appears to have used invariably for the general good .

##1681650 <p> Neo-Luddism - a future based on simplicity ( first published on indymedia.ie Nov. 2012 ) People who have asked me about Neo-Luddism often assume that I am completely anti technology , but that is not the case . Like the original Luddites , I am opposed to the use of technology to disempower and impoverish people and I am also opposed to the abuse of technology simply to make profit or to kill ( sometimes it 's both ) . <p> We have had technology for a long time , some would consider the stick , a flint hand axe or fire as the first technology ; hence to be opposed to technology per se is somewhat disingenuous . <p> My position is not based on ignorance -- I have a science degree , which consisted primarily of Business Studies and Computer Science ; I have personal experience of working in the City of London for financial institutions and financial publications and I spent 10 years living a thoroughly modern lifestyle in one of the world 's major cities and I have also visited several other major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on personal experience and observation of the system of human civilization that most people would ( incorrectly ) describe as Capitalist society . Like previous versions of this system , which appears to have emerged from the early city states of Arabia , I believe this version is also destined to crash . <p> The difference now is that the system has spread to encompass the whole planet and hence its collapse will have a global rather than a localized impact . If we consider the Earth as a system , I would posit that it is a single input closed system . That single input is radiation , mostly solar , although the Earth is on rare occasions influenced by the impact of meteorites . However , in terms of Human existence we can effectively ignore the infrequent input of a significant meteorite collision . <p> A truly closed system is one that has no outside inputs , but our planet has a single continuous energy input from the sun , that is fixed within a narrow range ( TSI approx. 1.3 KW/m2 ) . Everything else here is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , useable land , limited fossil fuels , limited air-borne gasses , limited metals etc . <p> The natural equilibrium established over millions of years does allow variance in temperature , drinkable water , oxygen levels etc , however these are within limits defined by the size and content of the system -- i.e. the physical limitations of this planet , a factor in life that we have tended to ignore . <p> After several millennia of experiments in living -- what me might call civilizations we still do not seemed to have mastered the basics of prudent use of resources , cooperation for the benefit of the species or understanding the limits imposed by being a constituent of what is essentially a closed system . I believe that our current state of technology could enable us to achieve an equitable , sustainable and efficient way of living , but I do not believe that we currently have the will to implement such a way of life . Technology is employed mostly to find more creative ways of killing each other , creating mostly useless rubbish for consumers to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving the above . <p> Alvin Toffler wrote what I 'd consider a visionary book about our future in 1970 , entitled ' Futureshock ' . Unfortunately Toffler 's disturbing predictions proved to be correct and I 'd suggest that the onward march of technology , which seems to be for its own sake , is making our problems worse , not better . <p> Two other writers that have influenced my thinking are E.F . Schumacher and Thom Hartmann . Although writing from vastly different perspectives , I feel that both of them accurately illustrate the mistakes we 've made and the problems that we will continue to encounter . <p> If we must insist on filling our homes with useless plastic crud , manufactured and shipped from China ( or the next up-and-coming cheap producer ) and continue to rely on those others than ourselves and our immediate social circle for the necessities of life then I think that we can expect our civilization to completely collapse within decades . <p> I do not endorse Neo-Luddism simply because I find a simple lifestyle to be emotionally satisfying .

If I am indeed right about a collapse then those who are just good with iPads will have dramatically lower chances than those who are good with basic knowledge of food production , herbal medicine , DIY , mechanics , etc . <p> If I am wrong ( I 'd honestly love to be wrong ) then these are all additional skills that might come in useful at some point , might be fun to indulge in and could even save on expenditure . Personally I am not prepared to put my faith in a technological solution to the world 's problems .

##1681651 <p> Tlachtga and the ancient roots of Halloween/Samhain ( originally published in druidry.org , November 2011 ) Most people have some awareness of the origins of the fire festival of Samhain , the time that is known in common parlance as Halloween . Samhain is the word for November in Gaeilge ( Irish ) and is thought to be derived from sam-fuin , meaning end of summer . The modern celebrations of Halloween are derived from the traditions of the British Isles and no doubt similar traditions around a festival of the dead existed throughout Europe . More than anything , the modern celebrations are influenced by the importing of North American practices , which are themselves the distortion and adaptation of customs exported to the New World , primarily by the Irish and Scottish emigrants . <p> In terms of modern paganism the main themes of this fire festival are as follows : Death and rebirth -- at this point in time ( end of October ) the natural world appears to be dying , the Mabon , or Child of Light , passes beyond maturity into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consort to the goddess . This is otherwise symbolized by the time of the Crone , Hag or Cailleach who will re-emerge in spring transformed into the youthful form of the goddess . This was also a time of collecting the last of the harvest ( Samhain being the last of 3 harvest festivals ) and the time at which animals were culled prior to the onset of winter . <p> Festival of the dead -- the acknowledgement of the ancestors and the dead in general was central to Samhain celebrations and offerings of food were commonplace throughout the British Isles . A person 's failure to pay appropriate respects to the dead ( such as eating offerings of food ) was thought to result in themselves being ostracized from such festivities when they too became deceased . Other customs and precautions such as throwing out all dirty water and proper attention to the hearth were observed - the consequences of failing to do so are described in the Irish myth Eachtra Nera where a hanged man 's spirit spits water over the members of the household he has entered causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a common time of divination and prophetic vision Eachtra Nera again being a prime example , Nera sees a vision of the possible events of the Samhain a year hence , an attack on the king 's dn by the sidh . This was common time to play divinatory games or perform divination charms , particularly related to marriage or love . Indeed the Birn Breac ( fruit loaf ) containing a mock wedding ring is a survival of such customs and is still commonly eaten in Ireland today . Trickery , cross dressing -- particularly of young boys to confuse potential thieves among the sidh was common . Suspension of normal order and time , removal of doors , moving of signs was indicative of the removal of barriers between the material realm and the otherworldly realm . Such activities as ' trick or treating ' are descendants of the buachaill tui - a group of disguised revelers who represented the spirits of the dead accompanying the goddess of the land in the form of a mock horse character an Lir Bhn , or the white mare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apples being a clear link to the otherworld in Celtic mythology . <p> Sacrifice -- the slaughtering of animals at this time was highly practical but it is also a time when offerings were made to the gods to ensure the return of the vital forces in nature and to protect the people and their means of survival through the dark and harsh winter months . Sacrifice of pigs was common into the medieval era and it is likely that in earlier times humans were also sacrificed -- archaeological remains supports this theory . Sacrificial rites remain in Ireland even now in the form of ' Bleeding for St. Martin ' , albeit a christianized form of sacrifice of a hen or cockerel at the beginning of November . <p> Sacred fire -- It is a common custom to light Samhain/Halloween fires even now for Celtic peoples of all religions , however in the UK the date has been displaced to 5th November in commeration of the attempted blowing up of the English Houses of Parliament by Guy Fawkes in 1606 . This tradition is directly descended from the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co , Meath , Ireland . The druids lit a sacred fire , probably at the new moon ( end of Oct/start Nov ) . Tlachtga was on the horizon from Tara , some 12 miles away , perhaps the Tara fire was lit once the Tlachtga was seen or the fire was brought from Tlachtga to Tara , possibly by boat . Tlachtga was the sacred place of druids , Tara ( Teamhair ) was the seat of the Ard R or High King , who feasted surrounded by the R Tuaithe ( provincial kings ) and flatha ( nobility ) , symbolically demonstrating the unity and stability of the people at this time of growing darkness , chaos and threatening forces within nature . However , it was Tlachtga where the first fire was lit at this time and then after the lighting of the Tara fire the fires would be lit all over the country . The sunrise and moon rise at Samhain form an alignment from Tlachtga , to the quartz standing stone in Cairn L of Loughcrew ( Slieve na Caileach/Sleive Bearra ) and Lambay Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mound of the Hostages ( at Tara ) is also illuminated by the sunrise at Samhain . This alignment continues west across the country also intersecting ' Lugh 's Seat ' at the end of the volcanic ' Pillars of Samhain ' and the cairn of Mr-Roghan above the Keash caves . <p> Now called the Hill of Ward , after a former owner of the 17th century , Tlachtga is a hill fort consisting of a series of four concentric banks with a central platform . It was disturbed in 1641 during Cromwell 's invasion but has never been properly excavated , although it has been suggested that there is a barrow burial there , probably dating from the Bronze Age . The person who is buried at Tlachtga is most likely an important figure , perhaps even a king or queen , but that will remain a mystery until a proper archaeological dig takes place . <p> There are three wells within a few hundred metres of the site , one near the main road from Athboy ( Atha Bu ) is relatively modern but is perhaps fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the south lies a more ancient and much larger well that retains its old name Tobar Draoithe or ' The Druids ' Well ' , which most likely was the main well associated with and used for practices at Tlachtga . Modern druid ceremonies at the new moon make use of this well , whilst the more general public gathering on October 31st at Tlachtga ( that has now taken place for over a decade ) uses the roadside well on the road from Athboy . <p> It is well known that Tlachtga was one the great assemblies ( aonach ) of the Gaelic people , in 1168 Ruaidr Ua Conchobair ( last ard r of Ireland ) , presided over a national synod of kings and prelates at the site . The rulers of the intermittent kingdom of Mide also sat here , although Tlachtga is often associated with the province of Munster and the medieval kingdom of Brega . Ceremonies centred around the lighting of the winter fires are said to originate from Lugh Lmfhota , ( the Tuatha De Dannan hero of the second battle of Moytura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , the tradition of Samhain fires is some 3,500 years old . <p> As for Tlachtga herself , there are several stories relating to this goddess , the most recent being that of the medieval metrical dindsenchas ( place lore ) and banshenchas ( women 's lore ) , both of which refer to Tlachtga 's father Mog Roith as being a student of Simon Magus , and also describe Magus ' three sons raping her at Imbolc . She gave birth to triplets at Samhain at the site that bears her name and died in the process . This version of the story was most likely ecclesiastical fantasy , appearing to be based on a medieval tale of the beheading of John the Baptist , in which Mog Ruith takes on the role of executioner . In the banshenchas version Tlachtga 's story is partly merged with the myth of Etain and Midir , also the unknown martyr that Tlachtga is said to have slain may be a confusion with the account of her father described above . <p> The earliest form of Tlachtga was a druidess type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuatha De Dannan and Milesians . The meaning of her name is ' Earth Spear ' , probably relating to lightning . She was described as daughter of the chief druid Mog Ruith of Munster who lived in the time of high king Cormac McAirt ( mid 3rd century AD ) , although he may well have been a god in an earlier form , his name means ' devotee of the wheel ' , which probably relates to the sun . <p> Tlachgta is said to have created a pillar stone called Cnamhcaill meaning ' bone damage ' out of a fragment of Roth Ramach her father 's wheel . It is said to kill all who touch it , blind those that gaze upon it and deafen those that hear it . This pillar is thought to represent lightning , which would tie in with the meaning of her name , as lightning was likened to a spear thrown at the ground . Tlachtga was most likely not only an ancient goddess , discredited and demoted by Christian scribes , but a goddess of death and rebirth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , Tlachtga is said to have given birth to three boys -- Doirb , Cumma and Muach . In the oldest version of the story they became rulers of Munster , Leinster and Connaught ( 3 of the provinces of Ireland ) . It was said that while their names are remembered that Ireland would be safe from domination by strangers . Of course , they were indeed forgotten and Ireland , as we all know , fell under the yoke of the Normans . Her triple birth and subsequent death resembles Macha 's double birth and death from grief , giving her power to the land in the process , leading some to see Tlachtga as a form of the triple goddess . <p> So , it become clear that Tlachtga is intimately linked with the symbolic death and rebirth of the land at Samhain , perhaps this is why her story was rewritten to diminish her impact and ensure that she and her sacred temple were forgotten by mainstream society . They did such an efficient job that most modern pagans are unaware of either her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to eliminate Samhain , amongst other pagan traditions , there is still a direct link between the ancient sacred fire of Tlachtga and the modern lighting of bonfires , between the ancient festival of the dead and our modern pageantry of ghosts , ghouls and other such fun and games . <p> Perhaps now it is time for Tlachtga , this almost forgotten goddess , to retake her rightful place within Celtic culture and for a renewed understanding of her significance in Paganism , the history of the land of Ireland and also the Celtic customs and traditions that survive to this day . <p> Luke Eastwood is facilitator of a Druid grove in Co .

##1685550 <h> Microfluidics <p> How can mankind take advantage of electricity ? What can you do with a transistor ? What is a PC supposed to do on the internet ? Most of the pioneers of the modern information age have been ridiculed by these questions in the early stages of their discoveries . And also many of these fine people have undountedly underestimated the impact of their research much like it is hard for parents to predict the future achievements of their children from their elementary school education . They just know that on the basis of a decent education , " something good " will happen . <p> While the potential of microelectronics and information technology is now widely acknowledged , there is still a lot to explore in its neighborhood . How about integrating mere information processing with the acquisition of information from the real world . In a traditional laboratory , for instance , , information is usually obtained from a measurement setup which interfaces over an electronic bus system with a computer . Can we integrate physical data acquisition and processing ? <p> Microtechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capability with microelectronics is indeed feasible . On the analogy , molecular biology is now on the verge of turning presently often empirically guided medicine into an information science .

One way is direct interaction , for example with modern tools like atomic force microscope tips . However , this mechanical approach is cumbersome in practice and does not comply with the natural mode of interaction . Almost all biomolecules in a living organism are within or at least in contact with some kind of a liquid matrix - mostly water - by which they are transported and herethey encounter there reaction partners . <p> Microfluidic devices in a certain sense mimic this natural environment .

##1694250 <p> Many visitors to Governey Park , Graiguecullen , wonder why one of the avenues there is called Whitney Place . Many of the younger generation too are unaware who Whitney was . The answer is the avenue was so called to honour and perpetuate the name of a great Graiguecullen man , Liam Whitney . <p> William Whitney was born in Sletty Street , Graiguecullen on 11 May 1915 . His father was Thomas Whitney and his mother was Mary Kenny of Moone , Co . Kildare . <p> Whitneys ' ( as it was popularly called ) was at the extreme end of the row of small houses then forming Sletty Street . The house was very conspicuous as it was the only two-storey building on the row . Liam was the second eldest of a family of five boys and one girl . He attended Graiguecullen B.N.S. where he was an outstanding pupil . He was a diligent student and took a particular interest in the Irish Language and Irish History . It was not surprising therefore , that all through his life he signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urged those with whom he came into contact to use any Irish words they knew , no matter how simple they might be . <p> After leaving Graiguecullen School he attended Technical School in Carlow . Even in later years when in employment he continued to attend various classes in the Technical School . <p> Liam got employment in Knockbeg College where he eventually rose to the position of chargehand . Being skilful in carpentry and building he was indispensable about the college . He had also charge of the livestock in which he took a keen interest . Liam gave them the same attention as if they really belonged to himself . However , most people in Carlow knew him as the man who came into town in the car to buy various provisions for the College . The College authorities knowing that he was a young man of high intelligence and absolute integrity entrusted him with this work and their trust was not misplaced . <p> As his father and mother had died at a comparatively early age Liam worked hard after hours to supplement the family income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on farm or elsewhere which would bring in money to rear and educate the younger members of the family . <p> However , Liam thought of others as well as his own . Anyone in need had only to mention it and he was ready to help : to repair a leaking roof , to dig a garden for some old person , to finance parents unable to clothe their children for Holy Communion or Confirmation etc. etc . In a word Liam was a real Christian gentleman . His charity was unbounded , he was a man of his word . He said he would do a thing it was done . He was absolutely honest and in Goldsmith 's words " He owed not any man . ' ' He was forthright in his views . His listeners knew he meant what he said . There was no shilly shallying about him . <p> As a Gaelic Football enthusiast he was known far and wide . He was the driving force in Graiguecullen G.F. Club where he was Treasurer and Secretary for many years . His house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matches re-played. bruises healed . As it overlooked Fennell 's Field The Old Football Ground - it seemed to keep constant watch over the Gaelic activities . <p> Liam 's ambition was to have a proper playing pitch for Graiguecullen . He inspired the other members of the club to collect funds to purchase a suitable field . Unfortunately he had passed <p> away before the dream had become a reality with the opening of Fr . Maher Park . I am sure that from Heaven he often looks down at that spacious arena . <p> Like his uncle Pakey ( another famous Whitney in his day ) Liam took a deep and active interest in politics ; this was not surprising as he was always a great student of the chequered history of his native land . <p> Liam was blessed with a particularly good singing voice and in the mid 1940 's was a member of the famous St. Fiacc 's Choir which broadcast from Radio Eireann several times and was heard at concerts in many parts of the country for many years . With his usual thoroughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was very disappointed when eventually the group disbanded . <p> Liam died unexpectedly on 11th March 1957 in the prime of life . However , he passed to his eternal reward as he would have wished , working in the College he had served so well , surrounded by the priests to whom he had given such devoted service . I bhFlaitheas De go raibh a anam dilis . <p> When the houses were built in the Sletty portion of Graiguecullen the people urged the Urban Council to call one of the streets after the man who had been for long such a wonderful figure in the village . Hence in Graiguecullen we have today ' ' Whitney Place ' ' as a last ing memorial to a local man who was a great Christian and a grand specimen of Irish manhood . Let us hope that many will try to follow in his footsteps . <p> ' This was previously published in the The Parish of KILLESHIN , Graiguecullen ' 
##1694350 <p> With 14 albums out , including his latest , Fresh Evidence , Rory Gallagher is a blues legend in Europe . In an age when the custom pedal board is standard equipment on any rock stage , Rory 's raw , gutsy , seemingly acoustic approach to the electric guitar has inspired may a player to start learning their way around the instrument . Among them is fellow Irishman Vivian Campbell . On a break from his newest project , with ex-Foreigner vocalist Lou Gramm , Vivian was glad to sit down for an interview with one of his early heroes . <p> VIVIAN : You started me wanting to play guitar , so , where did you pick it up , and who were you listening to ? <p> RORY : As an absolute youngster , I liked the guitar-cowboy pictures : Roy Rogers , Gene Autry . But then I heard Elvis Presley , Lonnie Donnegan and Chuck Berry , almost all at the same time on the radio , and was I keen to get an acoustic . The songs Lonnie Donnegan was singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a back door into blues stuff . At the same time , I liked what Eddie Cochran played on the guitar . I did n't even have a record player then . I would just listen to Radio Luxembourg , AFN , and BBC jazz programs , because in those days they would n't play a blues record on a pop program . But , you can imagine in Ireland at that time , just any American guitar freaked me out , regardless of who it was . There was no guitar player in Cork , where I come from . I had seen a friend of my father 's who was a guitar player , and he left the guitar in the house one night , and I just sat there looking at it . I was afraid to touch it . I was just fascinated by it . I started playing electric when I was around 12 . <p> VIVIAN : How did you learn ? <p> RORY : Just out of books for chords . At first you worked out what chord symbols were , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one showed me anything . One or two other fellows in Cork started playing guitar . They might discover a chord and then show it to you , but no one was good enough to give you a lesson . There was one guitar teacher , but he was a classical player , and he would n't teach any other kind of guitar . <p> VIVIAN : That 's snooty ! <p> RORY : Oh , very snooty , yeah . So that 's how I started The first electric I had was called a ? Solid 7 . ? A Rosetti Solid 7 ; Italian made , I think , and a little four-watt Sunn amplifier called a ? Little Giant , ? which I wish I had now , ? cause it used to distort like mad , It would be the equivalent now to sort of a good Pignose . <p> VIVIAN : At what point did you get into playing slide guitar ? Was that later on ? <p> RORY : Later on . I started when I was in a dance band for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first slide player I saw was Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones Other than hearing what it was on the radio , I never saw anybody until later on . I remember Alexis Korner played slide , and I saw Jeff Beck play a bit of slide . He does n't do that much anymore . I suppose Brian Jones really opened the door there . The dance band allowed me to do a slide instrumental . A blues thing . <p> VIVIAN : How did you learn the slide tunings ? You told me about the DADGAD tuning . Is that a standard slide tuning ? <p> RORY : Well , I doubt t . No , the first tuning was a peculiar form of A tuning , which I worked up myself and I used on the first Taste album . I used the D tuning for a song we did , ? Leaving Blues , ? which s a Leadbelly song that Davey Graham had done . So we used his arrangement . I was playing slide , but not in a proper open tuning . Later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and D as in E , which remain the standard , Elmore James-type slide , or open G , which I use most of the time , The strange thing is that I cant remember what that original A tuning was . I ? d like to go back and try to find it . It must have been close enough to the G tuning , but I think these are the good accidents that you 'd love to find out again . At the time , you do n't sit down and say , ? Well , I 'm gon na write this out. ? You did n't have Walkman 's or anything like that . So , sometimes , when you 're kind of undernourished , you make do . You get things done just as well , you know ? <p> VIVIAN : I remember you played mostly slide on your Telecaster , and last night , at the show , you played all the slide on your Strat . <p> RORY : Yeah . I used to have the Tele strung completely with medium strings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythm pickup , mainly , for slide , cause the Tele lead pickup used to feed-back . Eventually I got that rectified . But then I got the Telecaster as a string-bending guitar as well and developed a style of playing slide on regular , standard tuning , so I only play open tuning now when I play that red Gretsch guitar at the end . That 's n open G and I use a capo , although we do a song called ? Ghost Blues ? and I de-tune the Strat to G , even though the strings are a bit slack . But it 's quite okay for that song . Oddly enough , 60% of the time I play slide in ordinary tuning . It gives you the option of slipping it into your back pocket and going back to normal guitar . <p> VIVIAN : And most of the time on your pinky ? <p> RORY : Most of the time . I do have it on my ring finger , and still do . For certain blues tunes , you 're playing a very traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for slapping the first two strings for a riff . Then I put the capo on or the bottleneck on my ring finger . Either glass or steel , but I have a brass one as well for different attacks to the songs <p> VIVIAN : Last night you seemed to be using the bottleneck , the glass only , on the acoustic . RORY : That 's right . <p> VIVIAN : Do you ever use the steel on the acoustic ? Or is it too harsh . <p> RORY : It 's a bit harsh , actually If I was playing the dobro , the National , I would use a metal , either the copper or the steel . The glass one 's a bit light , although in a quiet studio situation , the glass is okay on the National . It 's quite soft and Hawaiian , but I like to keep the option open . Some slide players just stick with one particular slide and that 's that . I actually vary it to the circumstance of the song . <p> VIVIAN : Being Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might encompass you and Gary Moore ? Would you think there 's any of that jig music coming across ? <p> RORY : I think so , in solos . Gary has the speed of an Irish mandolin player . And I think Gary and myself play quite aggressively , but we 're very different players in lots of other respects . He works from a very formal scale point of view and he 's got great speed and technique . I think with the plectrum approach , the picking approach , even when I 'm playing a fairly straight blues kind of number , or a rock number , that jig thing will creep in . Or , you might use an oblique kind of suspended chord , or a modal chord that would be very Celtic , and then blues music and Irish music has a lot of singing , a lot of wailing . There 's a lot of bending of notes in the singing , and when the girls are playing the uileann pipes , that 's not that far from bending notes on a slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk music 's . There 's a lot of stories in the songs , and there 's a lot of melancholy , a lot of minor key things , so there is a parallel . But I would n't want to say that we 've all suffered as much as each other , and all of that trivia . Some people will say , ? Well , why do n't you just become a complete , bona fide American and just play in the tradition ? <p> VIVIAN : Chicago blues ? <p> RORY : Yeah , but I can do that , and I do that all night , but I think , in the end , nobody 's gon na thank you if you do n't develop your own style . Playing for two hours onstage there 's some numbers where we play very close to traditional , Chicago style of blues , or the country blues . It 's very hard not to try to put your own little thing on it , really . . VIVIAN : One thing I 've noticed as a guitar player are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I learned from you and from Gary , particularly from you . You do a lot of the split harmonics , the squealing , where you play at different points below or over the pickups , or below the lower part of the neck . Gary does that a lot , too , As a guitar player I developed playing very , very heavy with my right hand . I guess that 's pretty much a blues thing . Blues players have a lot more attack . Stevie Ray Vaughan had an incredible attack . <p> RORY : Well , what Stevie also had with his attack on the right hand would be instantaneous with his left-hand vibrato . It was very , very sturdy , as was another great , Mike Bloomfield , who had that as well . And certainly early Eric Clapton had that attack . One noticeable thing about Stevie was the first note was extremely powerful and intense . I sometimes like to sneak into a solo and then go for the intense note a little bit in , and not try and vibrate every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a jazz player 's approach . I know you do n't like that kind of vibrato . I think you can overdo the string vibrato . There 's plenty of room for playing straight notes and then coming in with the funny note , or , obviously , if it calls for it , the first one has to be the big note . <p> VIVIAN : When you say that , it almost sounds like ? Voodoo Chile , ? where the solo ends with a pretty ripping note . <p> RORY : It has to be . That one , and a few others , just call out for it to be that way . If you 've got that note down , the rest just follows . That 's the beauty of the instrument . You can approach it lots of different ways . I also like to do triplets with the plectrum , which is corny , I know , but it 's a mandolin technique . If you move your left hand around the guitar at the same time , you get what is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gives you a bit of freedom . VIVIAN : How do you change , as a guitarist , from record to record ? <p> RORY : I think it 's depending on the songs , obviously , and depending on how happy you are with your amplifiers and the band and the studio and all these other factors . In the last couple of years , I 've got a bit of a dimension on myself , on my playing . I can also see the strengths I had 20-odd years ago , and I can see the strengths I have now , and what I have to learn and what I have to improve . Sometimes , if you 're touring like mad and flying all the time , you assume you 're a fairly good player , but it 's nice to get to the point where no matter how mad the show looks you can actually have composure inside your brain to enjoy playing , as well as just to do a show . <p> VIVIAN : Do you get nervous ? <p> RORY : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get nervous about , singing or playing , or both ? <p> RORY : I 've always gotten nervous about everything . The monitors , the band , myself , the heat , the length of the show , what to play , what not to play . I 've tried to train myself , to give myself pep talks and say , ? What is this , you 've been playing 20-odd years . You know enough tricks now to get through it . You know how to play . You know they 're good players . You know you 've played this gig before. ? All those factors just go out the window when I 'm in the dressing room . I just get wired up , and it 's probably a good thing , because when you hit the stage it sort of ignites . I would n't mind being a little bit cooler and calmer , but I 'm still as nervous as I was when I was 18 . <p> VIVIAN : When you improvise from night to night do you play different solos in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structure ? <p> RORY : I ? d say about 75% improvised . There 'd be 10% that are worth re-doing every night , ? cause they 're pretty or they work well . There 's always that 5% of things that you have to include every night because they 're nice , but they might not always be in the same part of the solo . It depends on how hot you are as a player that night . It 's not that you dodge anything , but you 're not gon na foul up something . There are certain nights that we all have , where you know that , ? God , these hands will do anything tonight ! ? You know , and you take yourself right to the edge , the limit . And then other nights where , subconsciously , you know that you 're playing okay and think , ? Make a good job of this , be tidy. ? But then , even on a bad night , you might play badly for a number or two , but then make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any formal technique . I 've developed quasi-kinds of techniques . I still can play very primitive and brutal , which is just as important to me as being super-clever on the guitar . <p> VIVIAN : How do you prepare for a gig ? Do you warm up , do you practice ? <p> RORY : I play the guitar in the hotels and at home all the time . I did go through a phase where I did n't practice enough , and oddly enough , when I 'm recording , I actually practice less , which is bad , because you 're concentrating on the material . But the last year or so I 've got back to that teenage thing of playing after breakfast . I 'll play the guitar . I 'll play it in the afternoon and the evening and I always have the cassette kind of handy , not just for writing songs . <p> VIVIAN : So , it still excites you ? <p> RORY : Oh it does , and it 's Linus with his security blanket . Like , on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar , ? had to go and I was stuck in Tokyo or somewhere without the guitar for the day . <p> VIVIAN : Oh , that 's dreadful . I 've been in the same predicament myself . <p> RORY : And it 's like your twin brother is missing . <p> VIVIAN : Especially in a town like Tokyo . <p> RORY : I 've made a point of playing more , because you turn the television on and it 's a distraction . You go to the bar ; it 's another distraction . And you walk so much . I 've turned the guitar into therapy . So you just play without concentrating on it too much . I wish I had some formal training that I could go through certain routines and scales , but my personality does n't go hand in hand with that . I think in my own hodgepodge way I can get there . <p> VIVIAN : Do you play with your pinky much ? <p> RORY : Yeah , an awful lot . <p> VIVIAN : But you do actually fingerpick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nails , too , for certain chords . You get a nice little kind of ? jang ? But on my left hand , I made a point , early on , of using my small finger , ? cause I remember one time talking with Peter Green and he never used his small finger . He said he knew it was a lazy habit . And even Eric Clapton does n't use his small finger much . <p> VIVIAN : Well , most guitar players do n't . Gary Moore seldom will use it ? cause he wants the speed for hammer-ons . Michael Schenker ? s another one who hardly plays with his little finger . Most modern guitarists will use it maybe for the occasional chord , but when it comes to their lead work , they mostly rely on their third finger to carry all the weight . What do you think of today 's guitar players ? What do you think is happening to guitar playing , and where do you see it going in the future ? Can people play any faster ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you personally or musically ? <p> RORY : Well , speed is impressive . There was a time when I thought , who was the fastest ? I mean , Beck seemed to me as fast as you wanted to be . Clapton never made a point of playing fast . Django Reinhardt is probably the best , fastest guitar player in the world , even to this day . Then look at what Eddie Van Halen has done . I do sense it 's getting further and further away from where a lead guitar player is also a rhythm player , has knowledge of chops and riffs , and also the speed and the technical knowledge . It 's almost getting into the violin-type theories , like Paganini . I mean , it 's impressive to listen to , and it 's a credit to that young generation . <p> VIVIAN : Do you think a lot of them are missing the point ? <p> RORY : I think so . Obviously , there 's a point in what they 're doing , and someone like Steve Morse plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Albert Lee plays fast country guitar . There 's different kinds of speed . I would hate to be a super-duper speed merchant guitar player and still not enjoy John Lee Hooker 's weird chords , and slowness , and Keith Richards ? kind of primitive playing . It 's like a lot of these hammering tricks and harmonic tricks , and the whammy bars been used . It all had to be done . I ? d love to have a lot of those qualities , but I would n't take them to give away whatever I have in other things . Personally , I would love all these rock players to be blues fans . But I do n't think you have to . <p> VIVIAN : You mentioned Eddie Van Halen a while ago . To me , he was a very , very influential guitar player , and it was from the period of the first Van Halen record on that a lot of guitar players really started to develop monstrous chops , as far as speed and technique go . But I personally consider Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't consider him to be one of the faster guitar players . I think he 's slow in comparison to Yngwie Malmsteen or Vinnie Moore , but his phrasing and his vibrato make him a beautiful player . He 's very , very musical . <p> RORY : Well I suppose he was the borderline case , because he claims he was influenced by Eric Clapton 's tone , and that he was also influenced by Hendrix , which surprises me . I mean , Hendrix was the guy that brought the vibrato arm back . Hendrix had great speed as well , but Hendrix ? s speed was just that he 'd go off on an adventure on the neck , and had no technical bearing a lot of the time . It was exciting . So it depends on what you want . With a lot of the speed players , if you 've got a good ear as a musician you can predict where they 're going , and where they 're coming back . It 's like a foregone conclusion , in the same way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violin section doing something . I really prefer what Hendrix was doing , going down a different avenue every night on the guitar , and seeing where he came out . <p> VIVIAN : My personal opinion is that a lot of modern music has become very formulated . <p> RORY : Gary made a conscious attempt , when Van Halen and the new breed came , to catch up with them and be as fast and all that , as well as having all the 010 things . Now he 's gone full-circle again , but Gary initially was n't a blues player , because I saw Gary when he was literally a kid . Well , he was a blues player in the Jeff Beck/Yardbirds type of thing . And he was great at it , too . The first time I saw him play a Telecaster , it was with Taste , and his band was called Platform 3 , at Betty Stark ? s club in Belfast , a dance club . We did a couple of gigs together . He 's very good as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervening years , he 's cut up with Albert King , and he does n't go very far back into country blues , though , which would be nice if he did . <p> VIVIAN : You have a lot of country influences . Is that because you played with a show band , or is that because that kind of music naturally appealed to you ? <p> RORY : I like country music . I hope show band did n't do it to me , I like steel guitar , and I like players like James Burton , and ordinary country-pickin ? licks . <p> VIVIAN : So you 'd also pluck as well as fingerpick when you play electric . That 's an interesting approach . While on the subject of blues , every now and again it seems to come around , and some people have had phenomenal success . You mentioned John Lee Hooker ; Bonnie Raitt is winning Grammies and selling millions of records , and Gary Moore has had the biggest record of his career , playing what is essentially Chicago-style blues . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought it would happen again on this scale , to be honest with you , so I 'm delighted . I could see the buildup of interest in roots music . The Fabulous Thunderbirds and Stevie Ray Vaughan helped a lot , then you had people like George Thorogood , who brought barroom blues back into the picture . I thought they 'd ail do well and so on , but I 'm surprised because of au the other music 's hold , gripping the media , because of videos , because of rap , disco techno-pop and because a lot of the younger journalists had no interest in the blues , or no feeling for it . I knew the music would survive , but I 'm pleasantly surprised , in 1990 onto 1991 , that John Lee Hooker , Bonnie Raitt , and Jeff Healey are happening . But I think this time , in the ? 90s. it 's gon na be a deeper interest , and it 's not gon na be a blues boom from Britain , which was a great thing in itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blues boom . A lot of the young kids into rock got fed up with drum machines and synthesizers . Even ex-punks are looking for something raw and honest . I do n't like doing the Professor on the blues , but it deserves to come back , if nothing else . There 's nothing else like it . <p> VIVIAN : The snare drum sounds a mile wide , billions of reverb , and every track just sounds so lush and so produced . Everything is so formulated in this era of the professional songwriter . The whole industry has kind of created this monster . Maybe that 's why people genuinely want to feel something that 's a lot more honest , or a lot more down to earth . <p> RORY : Let 's say anybody turns the car radio on one night at two in the morning , and they heard Guitar S in or a Howlin ? Wolf track out of nowhere , just breaking through the airwaves out of all this other stuff . I defy them not to be affected by it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyrics are great . There 's a lot of humor in them . There 's lots of guitar playing in the blues . I mean , you could get piano players , you get unusual drummers , you get great harp players , plus the blues life and the blues . Robert Cray 's the only young black guy who 's kind of breaking through , but there are other guys coming through now . <p> VIVIAN : On that subject , L.A. is a very trendy place and The Los Angeles Times here was touting your appearances in the L.A. area as ? Must See ? performances , as if you were a debut artist that no one had heard of . They were saying that ? this guy is an authentic blues guy , much in the mold of Stevie Ray Vaughan. ? It seems kind of ironic to me , because 12 years ago or so I was going to your concerts and I ? d never heard of Stevie Ray Vaughan . It 's funny how things become in vogue , and now you 're actually sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much in vogue , and its very hip to know who Rory Gallagher is ! <p> RORY : Well , I 'm persona-non-grata sometimes . The same happens , more so in England , which is very trend con-scious . I ? d say , around the new wave thing there , artists like myself were hammered . The fans will stick with you and all that but it 's ironic in 1991 , given the last couple years I had away from America and with flying problems as well , I thought I ? d never get back to the states . It 's great to be back now , but there were certain tours where I was happy to go back to Europe at the time . You know , playing guest to some of these huge , mega-acts who would n't be too kind to you with very basic things like monitors for the stage , and things like that . Even though we did have good peaks of success here ourselves . Sometimes I get depressed about staying away from the states for so long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now the gap has been so long , I feel like 20% newcomer here , which s good for me , because I have n't been in people 's hair for the last seven years , so now they can either like me or not like me . <p> VIVIAN : What 's changed since then ? <p> RORY : I still play rock , but I think that the blues arm is a lot stronger the last couple of years in what we do . Even my own compositions . That 's been a bog plus . Since Defender , I think I 've , if I may say so , improved as a songwriter . There are a lot of new themes and ideas and I 've been able to match the music with the lyrics with more artistry in song writing . I 've written good songs before , but some would bee by accident or some would be a lot of hard work . I 'm not saying I have any formulas now or anything , but I have certain chords , certain lyric things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of what age you are , certain months of the year , or certain years , all of a sudden you get a very illuminated look at what you can do , what 's happening and you have a level-headed attitude about success , commercially or otherwise . Even at the moment , my priority is just to exist to play and if I can have an audience , great , but I 'm not going to behead myself for the music business . So that 's what makes these gigs great ; they 've all been on our terms . <p> RORY : I have to use percentages . About 60% would be riffs , nice rhythm patterns or phrases . The rest would be inspired by a definite thing . It would be a hitting my head all day kind of line , an unusual phrase , or a little story that suggests a phrase . Then I build up the thing or something that happened to me and I just readjust it to make it about somebody else . I get inspired by al . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinema type tunes , like ? Kid Gloves , ? where it 's a boxer in trouble , to a song like ? A Million Miles Away , ? which would be a more personal sort of introspective idea . Then you get songs like ? Philby. , ? which is about a mental parallel with the British spy who went to Russia . ? Shadow Play ? is semi-extraterrestrial , semi-what am I doing in this place ? What is show business ? ? That 's more of a rock song really . ? Bad Pennies ? s a very traditional thing . ? Off the Handle ? is a classic blues-type tense thing . ? Big Guns ? is about a gangster . I 'm inspired a lot by crime fiction . ? King of Zydeco ? is about a road movie . Some guy gets totally fed up with the big city , and wants to hit this musical juke-joint and see somebody like Clifton Chenier playing , away from the commercial pressures . You break any song down and it sounds like a clich . <p> VIVIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one guy I can ever remember who 's produced one of your records . That 's Roger Glover , who produced Calling Card . Aside from that you 've produced everything yourself ? <p> RORY : Yeah , I co-produced a few with Alan O ? Duffy , if you know him at all . He worked with the band Horselips , oddly enough , Paul McCartney and the Kinks . He 's an Irish guy . To be honest , it 's not that I want my name ? Produced by , written by. ? I was considering Nick Lowe , Dave Edmunds , fairly obvious people like that , I once asked Glynn Johns and he was already working on an album . He would have been glad to do it . The first thing I find hard is to fit into somebody else 's working pattern , or if they show up with their briefcase and they lay down the law . I think I have a few ideas , but I 'm not against the help another pair of hands and ears , providing it clicked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see their rockabilly sensibilities work-ing well with your kind of music . <p> RORY : They 'd be casual people . I admire other people . There was one idea of using Jimmy Page as a producer once , oddly enough . <p> VIVIAN : Wow ! <p> RORY : Knowing his ears for sound and production , it would be great , because I imagine he 's the kind of a guy that you could say , ? Okay , we 're finished playing , you mix it. ? I 've never had that trust in anyone to leave the mixes to them . Any time I 've tried it , I 've come back a bit unhappy with what they 've done . In the next couple of albums , if I come across some producer who just clicks , it would be great . There 'd be a lot less pressure on me , plus it would help the record . <p> VIVIAN : Do n't you find it hard when you 're producing , because you write all the material , you sing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hats to wear . Do you ever find that you lose perspective on any one of those things , by doing them all ? <p> RORY : Well , when I was co-producing with Allen O'Duffy , I do n't think I lost too much perspective . I produced the last two myself . I 'm sure it could have been better with the help of somebody else , but I do n't know how much better . It 's very hard for me to say . I 'm sure if I had another producer you might have more echo on the records , or for sure more editing , or all kinds of adventurous things . <p> VIVIAN : I was thinking more specifically in terms of performances . When do you feel you know yourself well enough ? <p> RORY : I 'm fairly convinced that you can usually tell . The outside producer would have to get the band up if you 're repeating a performance . That 's where the advantage is , but as a rule , we either have it in the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it and move on to another song . <p> VIVIAN : You do n't sing live when you make records , do you ? I mean , for keeps ? <p> RORY : I did on the earlier albums , which was ridiculous , That 's where a producer would have said to me . ? Look , give yourself a chance , just concentrate on rhythm guitar , and then lead. ? That was this blues ethic . I assumed all blues records were recorded like that . Even when we were doing rock songs I was using a kind of a blues mentality , or a reggae mentality . It all had to be as nature intended . Subsequently , we ended up with a couple of tracks where we left on feedback . But then I started getting a different attitude to overdubbing vocals , and getting more time for phrasing , and singing better , and so on . We 're talking about a long time ago . I thought the performance of singing would have that spirit of the moment . even if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdubbing . I was trying to do the live lead guitar as well . Even if it was mistakes and all . <p> VIVIAN : Earlier you were saying about how you sometimes feel in your hotel room , you get those performances , and you put them on cassette . Then you want to put them on your record , so obviously feel and performance is a lot more important to you than it is , seemingly , to most people who make records these days . Seriously , it distresses me when I talk to young musicians , and they talk about finding a producer to do their record , and their primary focus is the sounds . They talk about drum sounds and guitar sounds . They think of producers in the role of engineers , or getting a good sound for a record , but obviously your approach is much more on getting the heart and soul of the performance . <p> RORY : Its , yeah . If I look back on some of the albums , if there was a weak point , we certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we did n't know . We could have spent more days on guitar sounds , drum sounds , bass sounds , to go with the performances , But by nature , as whatever kind of unit we were , we would try to get the first take or second take , and patch it up later , We 'd already be playing by the time the guy was plugging the mikes in . That was our fault . We were a bit impulsive . Whereas , all this business of , ? Hey , Mel , we 're gon na take three weeks to get the snare drum sound , ? seemed grandiose to me . I 'm hoping to beat the system by just getting things on cassette , or on DAT . Or getting the drummer to play in mono with me and the rhythm guitar in a hotel . I know it sounds a bit daft , but I think that might do it just so that the feel is never lost . I can refer back to cassettes of my own , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there that night , whether the guitar 's in tune or not , or whether you 're plugged through a transistor amp , or whether you 're plugged into the gadget or whatever , you can never get that again . You can try and you do get it sometimes , I know in a few months , when I get back , I 'm gon na spend some time working at that . <p> VIVIAN : Are you going to do anything radical ? Is the next Rory Gallagher record going to have big snare drum sounds ? Are you going to do anything particularly different from what you 've done in the past , with regards to recording or sounds , or do you feel you 'll pretty much just concentrate on performance ? <p> RORY : I 've got three projects on hand . I can either do a live album during this tour , which would be an exciting , well recorded thing . There 's an acoustic album that I 'm always talking about , or let 's go back into the studio and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all three . <p> VIVIAN : I think you should do the live album . You 're a great live performer , and you 've got an exceptional band at the moment . That harp player is outrageous , so you got ta capture that guy live . The stuff you were playing with him last night where you were trading off licks , and then you 'd do a harmony to him , was pretty hot . I ? d like to hear some of that live . <p> RORY : It would be nice , actually , ? cause we have n't had a live one for a long time , and if anything else , people know , when we do a live album , it 's not just fulfilling the contract ? cause we 've no new songs . Most of our live albums have been unrecorded songs . But , going back to the studio thing , I 'll try to leave enough time next time to look at the big drum sounds , and all these other things , as well as performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the way I 've been speaking of them . Some have been worked on , songwise , a lot . We 've always probably been a bit conservative in terms of what the sonic possibilities were . You see , I can be impressed by a big-sounding metal record , or a big rock record , and then I can also be astounded by a guy with an acoustic , or an African record . I 'm absolutely caught between that . I feel lots of possibilities , and I feel I 've got ta spend some time in the studio on my own , rather than going in with a project on hand . The problem is you get these Porta-studios and you stay at home . What you should do is save up your money and book some studio time with nothing on the agenda . Just go in and relax and lay down sounds , and call the band in if necessary , but instead of this business of , ? Oh , it 's January the first , we 're starting the album now. ? With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own studio by now is the key question . I should have done it years ago . <p> VIVIAN : But you do n't have an effects rack . Why would you want a studio ? <p> RORY : Simply because , if you 're up late at night , you could have the desk on and get it on tape . Something happens to you when you go into recording stu-dios quite often . A lot of song writing ideas hit you , because the equipment 's set up , the tapes are hot , the lights are on , you 're in the mood , and it 's like you 're in a factory . <p> VIVIAN : Is the Strat a ? 63 ? <p> RORY : ? 61 . <p> VIVIAN : You 've changed the frets on them , right ? <p> RORY : Yeah , I 've got jumbo frets and a 5-way switch . <p> VIVIAN : I noticed last night that you play most of the time on position two . You do n't play on the back pickup , right ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the rhythm pickup for certain things as well . If I find the acoustics of the room are too harsh with the Strat , I do n't use the lead pickup quite as much . I 've got a master tone control on the Strat . There 's only one tone control working on that guitar . So that on the lead pickup , I can back-off the treble . <p> VIVIAN : Is that knob #2 ? <p> RORY : Number 2 , yeah , ? cause the middle one is super glued in so it does n't do anything . I did that ? cause I always liked the idea , on the Telecaster , that you could adjust the tone on the lead pickup . That 's the only modification . <p> VIVIAN : What 's position four ? Is that the single , the back and the middle ? <p> RORY : I use that a lot , obviously . I do n't use the middle pickup that much , but I do for slide . It 's quite okay for slide . I rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . <p> VIVIAN : That 's both neck and middle ? <p> RORY : Yes , and I use the neck one a bit . <p> VIVIAN : I know it 's a tremolo guitar . Did you ever use the bar on it ? <p> RORY : On the short one I used to use it now and then . If you had to play an instrumental , there are advantages to playing ? Walk . Do n't Run , ? by the Ventures with that . I just lopped it off , eventually . <p> VIVIAN : So , did your bridge rest right on the wood ? <p> RORY : Yes . <p> VIVIAN : So you do n't lean on it ? It does n't pull up ? <p> RORY : In the Taste days I had n't lopped it off . In fact , quite often the pitch would go up . I ? d notice I ? d be pressing and eventually somebody told me to put a block of wood in the back , and that would be that . The machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one Gotah on it . I know the sixth one broke at one date , and I just stuck another one on and I left that on , just as a gypsy thing . The pickups have been rewound . <p> VIVIAN : You get a tremendous tone for a single-coil Strat . Are you using any kind of distortion device between the guitar and the amp ? <p> RORY : I 've got a Boss Graphic EQ . <p> VIVIAN : Is that a little 6 band ? <p> RORY : Yeah , one of the real old green ones . And I 've got a DOD analog . They 're back on the amps , and that 's set at the minimum setting , just for a little bit of slap-back . I 've got a Dyna-comp , which is on all the time , to drive the songs from the leads . It 's not for effect . It 's a form of compression and I have it at a setting where the compression 's really low on it . I usually use a Tube Screamer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a Boss overdrive . I use them for some solos , not all solos . I was against using them for years . If I was doing a solo , I had to look at the monitor guy to turn it up and all this . So I keep close to the natural sound . I have a brown Boss octave thing . <p> VIVIAN : I heard that last night . You sounded like Prince ! He uses that a lot . <p> RORY : I 've got a Boss flanger , as opposed to a chorus , which I use sparingly , I use that only in ? Shadow Play ? and ? Moon Child , ? and one other song . That 's my talk on technology . I have a Vox wah-wah which I did use for one or two gigs , but purely to click it on for slide solos . I used it in the studio , for some solos as well . I do n't use it on-stage , because even as it is , I try to keep it simple , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack some day . I 'm a slave to technology . <p> RORY : Well , even Eric Clapton is now . For years , Eric was the paragon of direct into the amp . Now he 's using different amps . He 's using Soldanos . He 's got all these other racks as well . He 's got some echo and chorus . <p> VIVIAN : He 's been heavily chorused . I personally do n't like that . His last couple of records he 's had way too much chorus on his tone . It 's really watered it down , taken the edge off it . So , what about amps ? What did you start using , and what have been your mainstays through the years ? <p> RORY : I used the Vox AC-30 for years and years , and I used to use a Rangemaster treble booster on it , which was great . I still have one at home . Very primitive , but I used to use the normal input in the Vox , which was not known as the brilliance input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the Rangemaster . Then I went to a Fender Twin , a Tweed Twin , and I had a Deluxe which I bought for the studio . Then I had a Fender Bassman linked with the Twin for a long time . I used to use these boosters made by DiMarzio . They were treble boosters with kind of a graphic on them . Then I moved to Ampeg VT-22 linked with VT-44 . Then I moved to Marshall 50 watt combo , and then I had two combos . Presently , in England . I was using a 50 watt Marshall with an AC-30 amp , and then an optional 4x12 Marshall which I use for big halls . This American tour , I 'm using a Fender Twin Tweed , ? 55 model , with the Marshall 50 watt linked together , and a third one just for extra volume if needed . <p> VIVIAN : If they 're linked together , which one do you mike ? Or do you mike both ? <p> RORY : You mike them all , but you let the sound man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than volume and the Marshall ? s for the direct . It 's a schizophrenic setup . I ? d rather just use one amp . There was a time when one Vox would do me , or one Fender , but our volumes crept up , like all the bands . A lot of it 's insecurity , too , with amplifiers blowing up on you in the past . You 're always needing a spare amp nearby . <p> VIVIAN : Strings are Fender .10 gauge ? <p> RORY : Yeah . I just changed the fourth string to a .44 . It 's the same on the Telecaster . On the Gretsch that would be something like .12 . <p> VIVIAN : I thought you always used heavier picks to get all those split harmonics . <p> RORY : Yeah , well I would use a slightly thicker one than that . They 've actually gone down in quality . They used to be thicker , or at least there was a thicker version of them , but that 's all you can get now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split harmonic stuff , too , and I use harder Tortex picks . This would be too soft for me . <p> RORY : I must investigate that . Also , there 's a trick that Schenker used to do , you probably do yourself , to use that end . <p> VIVIAN : No , I never tried that . <p> RORY : It 's very scrapey , but you get that ? cshshh ? every time you hit the note . <p> VIVIAN : Oh yeah ! I remember , as a kid , I used to have this one pick , and it was the only one I could ever find . I realized later it was a Marlin pick . It was a regular heart-shaped pick , but it had a grip on the bottom half . It was really thick . It was hard plastic and blue colored . It was chopped off on the bottom , so it did n't have the bottom v , and it just had like little teeth and stuff , and I used to be able to just wander across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of sounds because it was a really , really hard pick . I remember the night I lost my pick ; I was heartbroken . I thought I ? d never be able to play again . <p> RORY : Oh . Yeah . The first time you break a guitar string , it 's like aaahg ! That happened to me , and I thought , God almighty , is this the end of the world ? ? ? You panic . <p> VIVIAN : How many other guitars do you have ? You used to use Martin acoustics , which sounded glorious . Do you still have them ? <p> RORY : I do . <p> VIVIAN : Last night you were using a Takamine ? <p> RORY : It 's as close to the Martin as I 've heard . I got it on this Japanese trip . I 'm impressed with it . When you plug it in , there 's no great volume drop when you go to acoustic . You 've got to keep the pressure up there . I 'm impressed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it does n't sound synthetic , like some electro-acoustics sound . <p> VIVIAN : Do you have any other old Strats lying under your bed at home ? <p> RORY : No . I have a ? 57 with me on the road , which is a three-color sunburst I got in Memphis off a guy named Robert Johnson , of all names . He 's an incredi-ble guitar player . I use that in the studio sometimes . It 's a round neck . I 've got a couple Danelectros and a Supro . I 've got this Diatone which is a weird one . I 've got that Melodymaker that I was using last night . A white ? 63 Telecaster . The lead pickup was rewound . It was repainted ; I stripped it down to its natural wood , and then I tried to get the natural creme finish that I could get , but it turned out kind of white . I used that with Taste as well . It 's a very good Tele . I have a black Esquire , with a maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Tele , I did n't bring that one over . And I have a red Junior that I got off Jeff , you know , the SG Junior . I used that on the record , on ? Kid Gloves. ? for the rhythm and the intro , for the opening , on the chords on ? Walking Wounded. ? The oth-er odd man out , on the record , is a Chet Atkins Gretsch , a small bodied one , Les Paul shaped . I used that on ? Middle Name ? for rhythm , and for the rhythm on ? King Zydeco. ? I have an anniversary Strat , too , which Fender gave me . <p> VIVIAN : One of those silver ones ? <p> RORY : Yeah , but mine is more white than silver . I took the skin off the neck ? cause it was a little bit hard to play . It 's down to the wood now , and I put big frets in . It 's a bit flashy looking for me , but I use it in the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat pole pieces . They 're not staggered , so it 's a smoother sound . The body either looks bigger or is bigger or deeper than the other Strats . But I 've gotten very fond of it , and it 's also got a 3-spring tremolo on it . I have n't lopped it off . I use it for a little bit of tremolo . I do n't use tremolo much , but on the odd track that I would use it , it 's quite effective . I like the feel of bending the string behind the note . <p> VIVIAN : Has Fender ever gotten in contact with you ? Have they tried to talk you into playing their new Jeff Beck model , or this new Eric Clapton model with the Lace-sensor pickups ? <p> RORY : Yes , well , there was a plan for me to go to the factory on this visit . They were going to do a Rory Gallagher signature model . <p> VIVIAN : Excellent ! <p> RORY : So that 's in the pipeline . <p> VIVIAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This interview was from guitar for the practicing musician , August 1991 issue .

##1696250 <h> Food Safety <h> Cooking fish <p> Healthy and delicious , fish is also incredibly versatile . Once you have chosen your fish , you are spoilt for choice when it comes to cooking it . You can choose from : <p> Grilling <p> Frying <p> Roasting <p> Baking <p> Poaching <p> Steaming <p> Microwaving <h> Our recommendation <p> Bake or grill your fish as fried fish is much higher in fat , especially if it is coated in batter . <p> Try not to add any salt to your fish . Sometimes all fish needs is a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to taste great ! <h> Points to remember when cooking fish <p> You can cook whole fish to preference or ' pink ' in the middle because harmful bacteria can be on the outside but not in the middle . So , as long as the outside of the fish is cooked , any harmful bacteria should be killed . <p> You should always make sure that any fish that has been minced or skewered , such as fish cakes has been are cooked until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because products made from minced fish can contain harmful bacteria throughout , so they must be cooked thoroughly to make them safe to eat . <h> Is there anything else I should do when handling fish ? <p> Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before and after 
##1696251 <h> Food Safety <h> Storing <p> A well-stocked kitchen can be a lifesaver when it comes to pulling quick meals together and keeping our food intake healthy . To ensure your food is safe to eat , however , it is important to take proper care with how your food is stored . Stay safe by following these these basic guidelines on the how , when and where of food storage . <p> Proper food storage is important to help you : <p> Keep food safe by limiting the growth of harmful bacteria and preventing contamination of foods <p> Preserve food quality , including nutrients , flavor and texture , and <p> Make the most of the money you spend on food by preventing spoilage . <p> To store food properly , you need to know not only how to store foods , but also how long they will be safe and of high quality . The advice below on date marks , storing leftovers , freezing and defrosting will help you to store your food safely . It is also essential that cross-contamination between raw foods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages have date markings to let us know how long food can be kept before it is unsafe to eat or before the quality of the food begins to deteriorate . <h> Use-by-date <p> A ' use-by-date ' indicates the length of time that a food will remain safe to eat if properly stored and means that the food should be eaten by this date at the latest when correctly stored ( for example , in a fridge at 5 degree Celsius or less ) . Perishable foods such as cooked meat products , prepared foods and salads will display a ' use-by-date ' on the label and should not be eaten after this date has expired as this could present a health risk . Remember that the when pre-packaged foods , such as cooked meats and prepared salads , are opened , the use-by date no longer applies and the food label will advise that the product should be consumed within a specified number of days -- normally 2 or 3 and by the original use-by date . <h> Best-before-date <p> A ' best-before-date ' is more about food quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean that the food will be harmful , but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture . Remember , the ' best-before-date ' will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label , such as ' store in a cool dry place ' or keep in the fridge once opened . <h> Storing leftovers <p> Leftover food needs to be handled and stored safely so that it does not pose a food safety risk . <p> Here are a few tips for storing leftover food : <p> When you have cooked food and you are not going to eat it straight away or if there are leftovers after serving , place on a clean plate , cover and refrigerate within 2 hours . <p> Throw away any high risk food that has been standing at room temperature for more than two hours and throw away all food scraps . <p> Remember to use clean dishes and utensils for cooked food to prevent cross-contamination . <p> Dividing food into smaller portions and putting it in a shallow dish can help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling a turkey or other large bird , removing the legs will help it cool more quickly . It is important that leftover cooked rice is quickly cooled and then refrigerated . <p> Remember not put food in the fridge when it is still hot , because it could raise the temperature of the fridge and allow other foods to get too warm . <p> Leftovers stored in the fridge should be eaten within three days . <h> Freezing <p> Freezing is a great way to store food . If food is properly frozen there are no food safety concerns and the maximum length of time for storage of food in the freezer is a quality and not a food safety issue . There are however a number of steps that you can take to make sure that frozen food is stored safely : <p> Do n't put food in the freezer when it 's still hot . Cool it as quickly as possible ( within two hours ) , cover and put in the freezer . It makes good sense to divide foods to be frozen into usable amounts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the freezer door properly closed and only open when necessary . <p> Do not freeze any foods after their ' Use by ' date , because they might not be safe to eat . <p> If you have a power cut , keep the freezer door shut . Afterwards , throw away any food that has started to defrost . If you 're not sure what to do in this situation , contact your local Environmental Health Officer or you can call the safefood Helpline on 0800 085 1683 ( NI ) or 1850 40 4567 ( ROI ) . <h> Defrosting <p> Most foods need to be defrosted before they can be eaten or cooked and there a number of golden rules to make sure that the food is thawed safely : <p> The safest way to defrost food is in the fridge . Allow at least 24 hours for every 2-2.5 kg ( 4-5 lbs ) . <p> Make sure that poultry has thawed completely before cooking . You can check whether the meat feels frozen by using a fork or skewer . When defrosting a whole bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavity . If poultry is still partially frozen when you start to cook , it will cook more slowly and might not reach a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria . <p> When you have defrosted food , cook or eat it within 24 hours . Do n't refreeze . <p> Do n't defrost food in the microwave unless you are going to cook and eat it straight away . This is because when food is defrosted in the microwave it can get warm enough to allow harmful bacteria to grow . With pre-packed foods , always follow the manufacturers ' instructions . If a food label tells you to cook the food from frozen 
##1696252 <h> Food Safety <h> What goes where in the fridge <p> This frightful fridge shows some of the most common mistakes people make in their fridges -- it 's neither cool nor clean , and breaks all the rules when it comes to what goes where . <p> It is very important that germs do not spread from raw foods to ready-to-eat foods . The information below contains a few cool rules on keeping your fridge a safe place to store your food . <h> Temperature : Some cool rules <p> Keeping food correctly chilled in the fridge slows down the growth of bacteria . At temperatures between 5C and 63C ( ' the danger zone ' ) , bacteria on food can grow to a point where they can make you ill . <p> Here are some cool rules to keep foods safe : <p> Keep the fridge at 5C or below . <p> Place a mercury-free fridge thermometer on the bottom shelf above the salad drawer , and check the temperature once a week , ideally first thing in the morning . <p> The numbers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , so check the user handbook and use a thermometer to check the temperature . <p> Keep the fridge door closed tightly , as the temperature will rise if the door is left open . <p> Do n't overpack the fridge , as this can stop cool air from circulating freely and the fridge may not keep the foods properly chilled . <p> Do n't put hot food in the fridge as this can raise the fridge temperature . <h> Storage shelf life <p> It is very important to prevent germs from raw foods spreading to ready-to-eat foods . <p> Store ready-to-eat foods such as cheese , yoghurt , cooked meats and leftovers on the middle and top shelves . <p> Put raw meat , fish and poultry in sealed containers on the bottom shelf so they do n't touch each other or drip onto other foods . <p> Store leftovers in the fridge

##1709450 <p> The alkanes ( i.e. the paraffins ) are the simplest homologous series of organic compounds of hydrogen and carbon , where all atoms are linked by single bonds . <p> The general formula for the alkane series of hydrocarbons is CnH2n+2 . The alkanes are said to be saturated because the maximum number of bonds are formed between each carbon atoms and its neighboring carbon and hydrogen atoms . The lack of any multiple bonds ( i.e. double-bonds or triple-bonds ) in the alkanes explain the relative chemical inertness of this series of hydrocarbons . <p> The shapes of the alkanes shows that all bonds on the carbon atoms are identical and that the bond angles are close to 109 degrees . Thus , each carbon atom is at the center of a tetrahedral structure , with either carbon atoms or hydrogen atoms at the apices of the tetrahedron . All bonds between carbon atoms ( i.e. C-C bonds ) , or between a carbon atom and hydrogen ( i.e. C-H bonds ) , are s bonds ( sigma bonds ) . These bonds are formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms . <p> The alkane with the simplest structure is methane , CH4 . Each succeeding member of the alkane series has a further methylene group , -CH2- , in the chain . The methane molecule consists of a central carbon atom , surrounded by four hydrogen atoms , with a tetrahedral shape . This tetrahedral structure of methane indicates that the geometry of the orbitals of the carbon in methane molecule , on which the geometry of the bonds depend , is significantly different from the structure of the orbitals in the carbon atom . This is due to hybridisation of four atomic orbitals in carbon atom to four identical molecular orbitals in methane molecule . These molecular orbitals are called SP3 Hybrid Orbitals . The single covalent bonds joining carbon to carbon and carbon to hydrogen in alkanes are sigma bonds formed by the end-on overlap of electron orbitals , so that each carbon atom is the center of a tetrahedron . There is free rotation about all bonds in alkanes . <p> Structural isomerism results from the fact that for a given formula , the carbon and hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while retaining the normal combining power of each element . For example , in the case of butane , C4H20 , the atoms can be arranged in two different ways , yielding n-butane and iso-butane . <p> Because carbon has a valency of four , and because the carbon to carbon and the carbon to hydrogen covalent bonds are almost identical chemically , it is possible to arrange the linkages between the atoms in an alkane in many different ways . This leads to the concept of structural isomerism , where the isomers have identical formulae but different structural arrangements . Only one arrangement of the atoms within the molecule is possible for methane , CH4 , ethane , CH3CH3 , and propane , CH3CH2CH3 . However , starting with butane , CH3CH2CH2CH3 , alternative arrangements of the atoms is possible . The prefix n- ( for normal ) and iso- ( for isomeric ) is affixed to the name to distinguish between the isomers . <p> n-Butane C4H20 CH3CH2CH2CH3 Iso-Butane C4H20 CH3CHCH3 CH3 <p> The number of possible isomers increases rapidly as the number of carbons increases . Pentane has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unbranched chain alkane . Structures II and III are branched chain alkanes . Because the number of structural isomers increases rapidly with increasing number of carbon atoms in a molecule , a systematic method of naming the organic compounds has been promulgated by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry , IUPAC . <p> In structure I , the longest continuous chain contains four carbon atoms and thus this compound is a pentane . <p> In structure II , the longest continuous chain contains four carbon atoms and thus this compound is a butane . As this also has a methyl group attached to the second carbon atom ; it is therefore called 2-Methylbutane . <p> In structure III , the longest continuous chain contains three carbon atoms and thus this compound is a propane . As this also has two methyl group attached to the second carbon atom ; it is therefore called 2,2-Dimethylpropane . Note that in this molecule , the central carbon atom is bonded to four carbon atoms , and the twelve hydrogen atoms are attached 
##1709451 <p> The alkynes are the third homologous series of organic compounds of hydrogen and carbon , where there is at least one triple-bond between the atoms in the molecules . <p> The alkenes are said to be unsaturated because of the existence of a multiple bond in the molecule . The general structure of the alkene series of hydrocarbons is CnH2n-2 . The first member of the ethene series is ethyne ( previously called acetylene ) . The names of all alkynes end in " -yne " . Rules for the systematic naming of alkynes are similar to those for alkenes . In the case of higher members of the alkene series , the triple bond may be between the terminal carbon atoms of the chain , or may be between internal carbon atoms in the chain . <p> The bond formed between the hydrogen atom and the unsaturated carbon atom , and first bond between the unsaturated carbon atoms in the ethynes are s bonds ( sigma bonds ) and these bonds are formed by the end-on overlap of sp hybrid orbitals of the carbon atoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ( i.e. at 180 degree ) to form a linear molecule . The second and third bonds that makes up the triple bond of the unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes are p-bonds ( pi-bonds ) , formed by the side-on overlap of the two p-orbitals on each of the carbon atoms . The p-bonds ( pi-bonds ) are much more reactive than the s bonds ( sigma bonds ) , and react readily in addition reactions . <p> Acetylene is a linear molecule , all four atoms lying along a straight line . This linear structure can only be explained by the existence of sp hybridisation of the orbitals of the carbon atoms of ethyne . <p> The carbon-carbon triple bond is thus made up of one strong bond and two weaker ( bonds ; it has a total strength 123 kcal . It is stronger than the carbon-carbon double bond of ethylene 100 kcal or the single carbon-carbon bond of ethane 83 kcal , and therefore is shorter than either . <p> The C-C distance is 1.2 A , as compared with 1.34 A in ethylene and 1.54 A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by carbon atoms joined by either a double or a single bond . <p> The hydrogen attached to the carbon-carbon triple bond in ethyne or in any alkyne where the carbon-carbon triple bond is situated at the end of a carbon chain is able to separate from the rest of the molecule as a hydrogen ion ; the electronegative carbon is able to retain both electrons from the broken covalent bond . <p> A significant result of this bonding is that ethyne can unite with metals and so be distinguished from alkenes by chemical means . <p> The ethynes are highly dangerously explosives when mixed with air or oxygen . <p> Oxidation of Alkynes <p> Ethyne is oxidised by a dilute aqueous solution of potassium permanganate to form oxalic acid . Thus , if ethyne is bubbled through a solution of potassium permanganate the solution is decolourised . This is Baeyer 's test for unsaturated organic compounds . <p> KMnO4 HCCH ==&gt; O = COH Ethyne O = COH Oxalic Acid <p> Addition Reactions of Alkynes <p> Because of the unsaturated nature of ethyne addition reactions can occur across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hydrogen are passed over a nickel catalyst at 150 degC , ( or over platinum black catalyst at room temperature ) ethene is first formed and then this is further reduced to ethane . <p> Ethyne reacts explosively with chlorine at room temperature , forming hydrogen chloride and carbon . To control the reaction , acetylene and chlorine ( also bromine ) are added in retorts filled with kieselguhr ( hydrated silica ) and iron filings . <p> HCCH + Cl2 ==&gt; ClHC=CHCl + Cl2 ==&gt; Cl2HCCHCl2 <p> Addition of Hydrogen Halides . <p> Ethyne reacts with the halogen acids . Hydrogen iodide adding on the most readily , at room temperature . A similar reaction occur with hydrogen bromide at 100 degC . Reaction with hydrogen chloride occurs very slowly . <p> HCCH + HCl ==&gt; H2C=CHCl + HCl ==&gt; CH3CHCl2 <p> Addition of Water ( Hydration ) <p> Hydration of ethyne occurs when the gas is passed into dilute sulphuric acid at 60 degC . Mercuric sulphate is used as a catalyst for the reaction , and the product formed is ethanal ( i.e. acetaldehyde ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formation <p> When a slight excess of ethyne and ammonia are passed over an alumina catalyst at 573 degK , ethanonitrile ( i.e. acetonitrile ) is produced . <p> 573 degK HCCH + NH3 ==&gt; CH3CN + H2 Ethyne Ethanonitrile <p> Polymerisation of Alkynes due to Triple Bond <p> The products obtained by polymerising ethyne depend on the conditions used . <p> When ethyne is passed through a glass tube at 4000C a little benzene is formed . This is not a suitable way to make benzene in quantity but it is an example of direct conversion from an open chain to an aromatic compound , ( i.e. one with a closed-ring benzenoid structure ) <p> 400 degC 3 C2H2 ==&gt; C6H6 Ethyne Benzene <p> Two molecules of ethyne can be combined to produce vinyl ethyne , HC ( CCH=CH2 , by passing the ethyne into a saturated solution of cuprous chloride in ammonium chloride continuously in such a way that low conversions of starting material occur . <p> Cu2Cl2 NH4Cl 2 HC CH ==&gt; HCCCH = CH2 Ethyne Vinyl Ethyne <p> This linear polymerisation can be extended by altering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethynes indicate acidic properties for the hydrogens which are attached to the carbon atoms involved in the triple bond . Ethynes readily form compounds with metal . <p> When ethyne is passed through a solution of sodium in liquid ammonia then sodium acetylide is formed and hydrogen is liberated . <p> liq.NH3 HCCH + 2Na ==&gt; 2HCCNa + H2 Sodium Acetylide <p> The other hydrogen atom in ethyne can be similarly replaced . When ethyne is passed into a solution of cuprous chloride in ammonia , cuprous acetylide is produced . <p> HCCH + Cu2Cl2 + NH4OH ==&gt; CuCCCu Copper Acetylide <p> Silver acetylide is formed when ethyne is passed into an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate . <p> AgNO3 NH4OH HCCH ==&gt; AgCCAg + 2 HNO3 Silver Acetylide <p> These substitution reactions which ethynes undergo to form compounds with metals are not occur with the alkenes . These reactions can be used as tests to distinguish between acetylene and ethylene . When acetylene is passed through an ammonical solution of silver nitrate or cuprous chloride , at room temperature , precipitates of silver acetylide ( white ) or cuprous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguishing ethyne from ethene by chemical means , these reactions provide a useful method for the preparation of higher alkynes : <p> HCC-Na+ + CH3I ==&gt; HCCCH3 + NaI Propyne <p> Warning : Methyl acetylides are explosive when dry so great care should be taken in their preparation . The metal acetylides can be destroyed when they are still wet by warming with dilute acid which will regenerate the parent ethyne . <p> The carbon-carbon triple bond of the alkynes is formed in the same way as a double bond of the alkenes , by the elimination of atoms or groups from two adjacent carbons . <p> W X W X HC - CH ==&gt; HC = CH ==&gt; HCCH X X Alkane Alkene Alkyne <p> The groups that are eliminated and the reagents used are essentially the same as in the preparations of alkenes . <p> Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Dihalides <p> This reaction is particularly useful since the dihalides are readily obtained from the corresponding alkenes by addition of halogen . This amounts to conversion by several steps of a double bond into a triple bond . <p> Dehydrohalogenation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus obtained , with halogen attached directly to double bonded carbon , are called vinyl halides , and are very unreactive . Under mild conditions , therefore , dehydrohalogenation stops at the vinyl halide stage ; more vigorous conditions , use of stronger base is required for alkyne formation . If only the first step of this reaction is carried out , it is a valuable method for preparing unsaturated halides . <p> Reaction of Sodium Acetylides with Primary Alkyl Halides <p> This reaction permits conversion of smaller alkynes into larger ones . In practice , the reaction is limited to the use of primary halides because of the great tendency for secondary and tertiary halides to undergo a side reaction , elimination . <p> NaNH2 HCCH ==&gt; HCC(-)Na(+) + RX <p> Dehalogenation of Tetrahalides <p> This reaction is severely limited by the fact that these halides are themselves generally prepared from the alkynes . As is the case with the double bond and a dihalide , the triple bond may be protected by conversion into a tetrahalide with subsequent regeneration of the triple bond by treatment with zinc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions will be similar to those of alkenes ( i.e. electrophilic addition ) , because of the availability of the loosely held pi-electrons . The carbon to carbon triple bond is less reactive than the carbon to carbon double bond towards electrophilic reagents . As well as the addition reactions , alkynes undergo reactions that are due to the acidity of a hydrogen atom attached to the triple bonded carbon . <p> The carbon-carbon triple bond in ethyne is thus made up of one strong sigma-bond and two weaker pi-bonds . It has a total strength 123 kcal/mole . This is stronger than the carbon-carbon double bond of ethylene which has a total strength of 100 kcal/mole or the single carbon-carbon bond of ethane which has a total strength of 83 kcal/mole . <p> The carbon-carbon bond lengths , which depend on the strengths of the bonds are <p> The ethynyl radical , CHC* , is a more electronegative group than that formed by carbon atoms joined by either a double or a single bond . Thus , the hydrogen attached to the carbon-carbon triple bond in ethyne , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a carbon chain , is able to separate from the rest of the molecule as a hydrogen ion , so that the alkyne shows acidic properties . The electronegative carbon is able to retain both electrons from the broken covalent bond . A significant result of this bonding is that ethyne can form compounds with metals
