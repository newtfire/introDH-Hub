Style " ( Nasty China Style ) , a parody of " Gangnam Style " portraying day-to-day conflicts between Mainland Chinese and Hongkonger in Hong Kong , has already passed over the 1 million mark in a week . " Nasty China Style " has even become a popular phrase online . <p> As of Nov 4 , " Nasty China Style " has over 1.1 million views . <p> " Shina " -- The Most Offensive Name for China <p> In fact , the song title should be translated as " Nasty Shina Style " . " Shina " ( ? ? / ? ? ) , derived from " China " in Sanskrit , is the most offensive name for China in both Japanese and Chinese . <p> The banner " Kick Out the Shina People " in an anti-Chinese protest in Japan in Oct 2010 <p> A man was holding the sign " Shinaman Ma Ying-jeou get out of Taiwan " in a Taiwan independence protest in Aug 2008 . <p> " Shina " was rarely used in Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more Hong Kong netizens have started to use the offensive word . The song was originally titled as " Nasty Locust Style " . In the end , " Shina " is used in both the title and lyrics . Despite the growing acceptance of the use of " Shina " , many " anti-locusts " netizens feel uncomfortable with it . <p> " Nasty Locust Style " was the original title <p> " Nasty Shina Style " -- The China Threat <p> The song is written in the first person and divided into Mainland Chinese and Hongkonger parts . <p> The chorus is " Nasty Shina style . Hey , just poop on the spot " . ( " Do n't crap everywhere " is wrongly translated . ) <p> Mainland Chinese Perspective ( 0:14 -- 1:05 ) This part is sung in Mandarin-accent Cantonese . <p> ( Inside Yung Kee Restaurant ) I woke in the morning and went to Yung Kee Restaurant in Central to have breakfast tea . F**k , wait to be seated ? Are you OK ? Dumba** ! I wear gold all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 9-carat diamond . My spit can drown you , dumba** ! <p> ( Inside MTR ) I 've just pooped . I had an urgent need to poop inside MTR and therefore just pooped on the spot . Picking up my poop is your ( Hongkonger ) responsibility . I like it that way . What do I care ? Stop looking ! I tell you to tolerate it ! Why do n't you listen to me ? I 've just pooped . Whatever . I 've just pooped . <p> ( On the Road ) Mainland China is so powerful ! The Mercedes Benz driver is my father , hey , his name is Li Gang . Mainland China is so powerful ! The Mercedes Benz driver ran over people indiscriminately . Wow ! He ran over people indiscriminately . Wow ! After killing a dozen people , he immediately paid for the compensation . What do I care ? ? <p> Hongkonger 's Perspective ( 1 : 36 -- 2 : 11 ) <p> ( Inside Yung Kee Restaurant ) I woke up in the morning and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . A locust refused to wait to be seated and even scolded my father . He wore gold all over his body . His butt was gilded . He wore a 9-carat diamond . Despite all these , you still have to wait to be seated , dumba** . <p> ( Inside MTR ) I was taking public transit . I saw a locust pooping inside MTR . Holding your poop is your responsibility . It 's really stinky . I 'm mad . Stop looking ! I told you to hold your poop . No matter how I say , you still do whatever you like . You just pooped . Wow , you look like sh*t ! <p> ( On the Road ) Wow , Mainland China is powerful . The Mercedes Benz driver is his father . Wow ! His name is Li Gang . For real ? <p> Ng : Alas ... Again ! The child is wearing a diaper . Why did he still poop on the busy street ? Do these Mainland Chinese want to provoke people deliberately ? ? ! ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> C : I ca n't understand at all . Hong Kong has many foreigners , including those who are from poor regions . They do n't act like that . <p> Wan Chin : Exactly , Pakistanis and Nepalis , many of whom are from poor regions in their home countries , still obey rules in Hong Kong . <p> Lee : I agree completely . Some foreigners from South Asia are from poor regions . Why do n't they act like that ? <p> Wong : Mainland Chinese uncouth behavior is intentional . They heard from their friends that no matter how improperly they behave , they neither get beaten nor get punishment in Hong Kong . Behaving uncouthly is even enjoyable . <p> Do n't tell me that Mainalnd Chinese who go to Hong Kong do n't know what a washroom is . How hard is it to find a washroom in urban Hong Kong ? ! <p> They have lived in Mainland China , a distorted/oppressed place , for a long time . When they come to Hong Kong , they have to be the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " sickness " is formed by constant psychological distortion and oppression . When no one punishes , they will vent it all off in Hong Kong . <p> " Chinese are still pooping everywhere . Hongkongers , for how much longer do you tolerate these ? " <p> I remember growing up there are signs at restaurants saying that if you spit on the floor you might get fined $2,000 . Should n't this kind of behaviour be fined even more ? if the HK government increase the fine for defecating or urinating in the public to $10,000 ( with inflation in consideration ) , and make sure they have to pay before they leave HK , it might stop them from doing that . <p> There is already a public littering fine that is applicable to public urination and defecation.That is aside the fact that public urination and defecation is an arrestable offence . But we hardly see any real action taken towards these people by our law enforcement departments . <p> What is the obsession with mainland kids pooping or urinating in public ? I am a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , they have to go , no time to ask around or find a washroom : only one choice poop/piss your pants or on go on the street . Its just children . But you can buy a travel potty with a diaper lined bag . Just fold it out an stick the bag on -- child poops , wipe bum , remove bag , seal and put in the rubbish bin . But I do n't think this gadget is available in the mainland . Even in Europe or America this is common . Its not a mainland thing . When I was a kid in HK ( before 1997 ) HK kids were doing this . Mummy holds the kid over a drain on the road and they peed directly into the drain . I am against any mainland interference in HK , but honestly , stop with the toilet thing , its just distracting from the real problem ... political , financial and cultural infiltration , undermining and bullying . Long live HK and Taiwan -- shining examples for mainland China on where one day mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being ruled by fat , overpaid and corrupt officials . <p> Growing up in the 60s &; 70s in HK , I do n't remember coming across many instances of kids pooping in public ( in the urban area anyways ) ; maybe the occasional toddlers peeing while being held by parents on the street gutters . I think the issue at present has more to do with the location of defecation ; like pooping inside mall area ( where washrooms are available ) , on trains . Sadly , this habit is not limited to kids . Not sure about Europe or U.S.A. but this is not common in Canada , not nowadays anyway . Yes , we may see parents changing diapers in public but letting their kids poop on the street ? That would be a big Canadian no-no LOL . This habit can easily be corrected if only the police would enforce the law , like they 
##3572250 <h> It Just Is <p> by Michael on January 1 , 2012 <p> Last night , a friend decided to make one last post for the year that was leaving . In just three small words he made his feelings evident : " 2011 , fuck you . " <p> It had been a hard year for him . He had lost his job . He struggled with depression . His car had mechanical problems . He was being plagued by migraines . He got a job which required him to move across the country leaving behind his wife , friends and family . And he is struggling to support two households located different sides of the continent . <p> Amazingly enough , all of his anger was directed towards the year 2011 , as though the intangible movement of time were somehow responsible for everything that had gone wrong in his life . He did n't curse the boss who fired him , or the car the died , or his health , or even the new job . He did n't blame himself for anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decisions . Everything went wrong for him and it was 2011 ? s fault . <p> What he did n't seem to notice is all the good things that happened . Because he was fired , he was available to apply for and be hired at a more prestigious company for a higher salary . Because his car died , he had to walk to work more , thus forcing his body to produce more endorphines which helped alleviate his feelings of depression . His year had n't really been rotten -- that was just the aspect he focused on . <p> Now I do n't usually subscribe to the concepts of good or bad . What one person views as good can be seen as bad by someone else . What if everything that happened -- just happened ? <p> I 'm gon na leave you with a zen story about an old farmer his neighbors ideas of good and bad . <p> There once was an old farmer in a remote village . He was the envy of all his neighbors because he owned the only horse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neighbors . <p> " It could be good , it could be bad , " said the old farmer . " I do n't know . It just is . " <p> One day the horse ran away . " Oh , this is bad , " said the neighbors . <p> " It could be good , it could be bad , " said the old farmer . " I do n't know . It just is . " <p> The next day , the horse came back , bringing another horse with it . " Oh , this is good , " said the neighbors . <p> " It could be good , it could be bad , " said the old farmer . " I do n't know . It just is . " <p> The next day , the farmer 's son tried to ride the new horse , but it threw him and the son 's leg was broken . " Oh , this is bad , " said the neighbors . <p> " It could be good , it could be bad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just is . " <p> The next day , the army marched into town and rounded up all the young men for military service . Because of his broken leg , the old farmer 's son was the only one spared . " Oh , this is good , " said the neighbors . <p> " It could be good , it could be bad , " said the old farmer

##3577752 <h> Florence <p> November 12 , 2012 <p> This post is long overdue , but we have either been in transit , or have been out and come back late in the evening and therefore have n't had much time to get together and reflect on our day . Enough of the excuses , and let me give you brief overview of our past few days in Italy . After 14 + hours in the air , we arrived safely in Rome on Saturday afternoon . Weather was fantastic with bright blue skies , however it was a mirage , and before we knew it the weather had turned for the worse . We headed to Florence , where we spent Sunday visiting some famous art galleries such as the Galleria dell'Accademia , which houses the famous statue of David by Michelangelo , amongst other pieces of Renaissance art . <p> We spent most of Monday on the road . We travelled to Siena , which is famous for its medieval architecture , as well as the Palio di Siena , a horse race around the main piazza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we visited the Basilica of San Domenico , which houses the severed head and finger of Saint Catherine . <p> As we left Florence for Rome , the weather turned for the worse and we had to take a detour due to significant flooding around Florence area .

After covering significant distance both in the air and on the road as well as experiencing inclement weather , they are in extremely positive spirits and are demonstrating a very positive attitude . <p> Hope you are 
##3581151 <p> While Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor may have quashed speculation that the planned stadium at Kai Tak could be relocated to make way for more housing , there is still cause for public concern . Lam confirmed that the government is seeking to increase the amount of residential and commercial development on the site . Depending on how this is carried out , it could end up being a costly long-term mistake . <p> Politically speaking , it might be unwise to dismiss the outcome of the three-year public consultation that formulated the original Kai Tak plans . The Harbourfront Enhancement Committee , a multisectoral advisory body appointed by the Tung Cheehwa administration in 2004 , was quite successful in engaging stakeholders and building a consensus . Though the process was sometimes contentious , Kai Tak managed to avoid the bitter controversy that has embroiled other major projects such as the West Kowloon Cultural District . The plan was accepted by the major stakeholders as a good-faith effort to create a green and people-oriented harbour district . In response to criticism by civil society groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycling facilities improved , and the historical Lung Tsun stone bridge was to be preserved in situ . <p> With the legitimacy of the public consultation process in doubt following the national education controversy , what message will the government send by disregarding one of the rare consultations that was actually a success ? Although Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying is under strong public pressure to address housing affordability , he can ill-afford to undermine his administration 's long-term credibility . <p> On the environmental front , there may also be costs . Chinese University professor of architecture Edward Ng Yan-yung recently estimated that if plot ratios were increased from the current maximum of 5 to 7 , ventilation in neighbouring districts of Kowloon City , San Po Kong and Hoi Hung might become as poor as in Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei . Conversely , sacrificing 20 hectares of green space instead -- also suggested by government adviser Michael Choi Ngaimin -- could have even worse results than relocating the stadium . Most people visit stadiums only occasionally , but parks are used in everyday life , especially by Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , East Kowloon has precious little high-quality green space . <p> This is not to say that development density can not be increased , but it must be designed carefully . Kai Tak must not be allowed to become another cookiecutter " wall effect " development . <p> People are understandably angry over housing costs , and the needs of low-income families cramped into subdivided rooms and young adults waiting to move out of their parents ' homes are real . Yet there is no physical housing shortage -- we currently have 240,000 more flats than households . While a looser land policy might be a good idea overall , the immediate problem is that abnormally low interest rates have encouraged an influx of hot money . Hong Kong 's residents must wait for the market to cool . <p> Expanding the housing supply should not come at the expense of urban design . The property market rises and falls every few years , but buildings put

The necessary staple of the life of such a world Plato regards with disdain ; handicraft and trade and the working professions he regards with disdain ; but what becomes of the life of an industrial modern community if you take handicraft and trade and the working professions out of it ? The base mechanic arts and handicrafts , says Plato , bring about a natural weakness in the principle of excellence in a man , so that he can not govern the ignoble growths in him , but nurses them , and can not understand fostering any other . Those who exercise such arts and trades , as they have their bodies , he says , marred by their vulgar businesses , so they have their souls , too , bowed and broken by them . And if one of these uncomely people has a mind to seek self and philosophy , Plato compares him to a bald little tinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his release from service , and has had a bath , and bought a new coat , and is rigged out like a bridegroom about to marry the daughter of his master who has fallen into poor and helpless estate . <p> Nor do the working professions fare any better than trade at the hands of Plato . He draws for us an inimitable picture of the working lawyer , and of his life of bondage ; he shows how this bondage from his youth up has stunted and warped him , and made him small and crooked of soul , encompassing him with difficulties which he is not man enough to rely on justice and truth as means to encounter , but has recourse , for help out of them , to falsehood and wrong . And so , says Plato , this poor creature is bent and broken , and grows up from boy to man without a particle of soundness in him , although exceedingly smart and clever in his own esteem . <p> One can not refuse to admire the artist who draws these pictures . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a primitive and obsolete order of things , when the warrior caste and the priestly caste were alone in honour , and the humble work of the world was done by slaves . We have now changed all that ; the modern majesty consists in work , as Emerson declares ; and in work , we may add , principally of such plain and dusty kind as the work of cultivators of the ground , , handicraftsmen , men of trade and business , men of the working professions . Above all is this hue in a great industrious community such as that of the United States . <p> Now education , many people go on to say , is still mainly governed by the ideas of men like Plato , who lived when the warrior caste and the priestly or philosophical class were alone in honour , and the really useful part of the community were slaves . It is an education fitted for persons of leisure in such a community . This education passed from Greece and Rome to the feudal communities of Europe , where also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour , and where the really useful and working part of the community , though not nominally slaves as in the pagan world , were practically not much better off than slaves , and not more seriously regarded . And how absurd it is , people end by saying , to inflict this education upon an industrious modern community , where very few indeed are persons of leisure , and the mass to be considered has not leisure , but is bound , for its own great good , and for the great good of the world at large , to plain labour and to industrial pursuits , and the education in question tends necessarily to make men dissatisfied with these pursuits and unfitted for them ! <p> That is what is said . So far I must defend Plato , as to plead that his view of education and studies is in the general , as it seems to me , sound enough , and fitted for all sorts and conditions of men , whatever their pursuits may be . " An intelligent man , " says Plato , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberness , righteousness , and wisdom , and will less value the others . " I can not consider that a bad description of the aim of education , and of the motives which should govern us in the choice of studies , whether we are preparing ourselves for a hereditary seat in the English House of Lords or for the pork trade in Chicago . <p> Still I admit that Plato 's world was not ours , that his scorn of trade and handicraft is fantastic , that he had no conception of a great industrial community such as that of the United States , and that such a community must and will shape its education to suit its own needs . If the usual education handed down to it from the past does not suit it , it will certainly before long drop this and try another . The usual education in the past has been mainly literary . The question is whether the studies which were long supposed to be the best for all of us are practically the best now , whether others are not better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us injuriously in the predominance given to letters in education . The question is raised whether , to meet the needs of our modern life , the predominance ought not now to pass from letters to science ; and naturally the question is nowhere raised with more energy than here in the United States . The design of abasing what is called " mere literary instruction and education , " and of exalting what is called " sound , extensive , and practical scientific knowledge , " is in this intensely modern world of the United States , even more perhaps than in Europe , a very popular design , and makes great and rapid progress . <p> I am going to ask whether the present movement for ousting letters from their old predominance in education , and for transferring the predominance in education to the natural sciences , whether this brisk and flourishing movement ought to prevail , and whether it is likely that in the end it really will prevail . An objection may be raised which I will anticipate . My own studies have been almost wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural sciences have been very slight and inadequate , although those sciences have always strongly moved my curiosity . A man of letters , it will perhaps be said , is not competent to discuss the comparative merits of letters and natural science as means of education . To this objection I reply , first of all that his incompetence , if he attempts the discussion but is really incompetent for it , will be abundantly visible ; nobody will be taken in he will have plenty of sharp observers and critics to save mankind from that danger . But the line I am going to follow is , as you will soon discover , so extremely simple , that perhaps it may be followed without failure even by one who for a more ambitious line of discussion would be quite incompetent . <p> Some of you may possibly remember a phrase of mine which has been the object of a good deal of comment , an observation to the effect that in our culture , the aim being to know ourselves and the world , we have , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thought and said in the world . A man of science , who is also an excellent writer and the very prince of debaters , Professor Huxley , in a discourse at the opening of Sir Josiah Mason 's college at Birmingham laying hold of this phrase , expanded it by quoting some more words of mine , which are these : " The civilised world is to be regarded as now being , for intellectual and spiritual purposes , one great confederation , bound to a joint action and working to a common result , and whose members have for their proper outfit a knowledge of Greek , Roman and Eastern antiquity , and of one another . Special local and temporary advantages being put out of account , that modern nation will in the intellectual and spiritual sphere make most progress , which most thoroughly carries out this programme . " <p> Now on my phrase , thus enlarged , Professor Huxley remarks that when I speak of the above-mentioned knowledge as enabling us to know ourselves and the world , I assert literature to contain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . But it is not by any means clear , says he , that after having learnt all which ancient and modern literatures have to tell us , we have laid a sufficiently broad and deep foundation for that criticism of life , that knowledge of ourselves and the world , which constitutes culture . On the contrary , Professor Huxley declares that he finds himself " wholly unable to admit that either nations or individuals will really advance , if their outfit draws nothing from the stores of physical science . An army without weapons of precision , and with no particular base of operations , might more hopefully enter upon a campaign on the Rhine , than a man , devoid of a knowledge of what physical science has done in the last century , upon a criticism of life . " <p> This shows how needful it is for those who are to discuss any matter together , to have a common understanding as to the sense of the terms they employ , --how needful , and how difficult . What Professor Huxley says , implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of belles lettres , as they are called : that the study is an elegant one , but slight and ineffectual ; a smattering of Greek and Latin . and other ornamental things , of little use for any one whose object is to get at truth , and to be a practical man . So , too , M. Renan talks of the " superficial humanism " of a school-course which treats us as if we were all going to be poets , writers , preachers , orators , and he opposes this humanism to positive science , or the critical search after truth . And there is always a tendency in those who are remonstrating against the predominance of letters in education , to understand by letters belles lettres , and by belles lettres a superficial humanism , the opposite of science or true knowledge . <p> But when we talk of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity , for instance , which is the knowledge people have called the humanities , I for my part mean a knowledge which is something more than a superficial humanism , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Wolf , the critic of Homer , " which is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources . For example : a knowledge of classical antiquity is scientific when the remains of classical antiquity are correctly studied in the original languages . " There can be no doubt that Wolf is perfectly right ; that all learning is scientific which is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources , and that a genuine humanism is scientific . <p> When I speak of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity , therefore , as a help to knowing ourselves and the world , I mean more than a knowledge of so much vocabulary , so much grammar , so many portions of authors in the Greek and Latin languages . I mean knowing the Greeks and Romans , and their life and genius , and what they were and did in the world ; what we get from them , and what is its value . That , at least , is the ideal ; and when we talk of endeavouring to know Greek and Roman antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we mean endeavouring so to know them as to satisfy this ideal , however much we may still fall short of it . <p> The same also as to knowing our own and other modern nations with the like aim of getting to understand ourselves and the world . To know the best that has been thought and said by the modern nations , is to know , says Professor Huxley , " only what modern literatures have to tell us ; it is the criticism of life contained in modern literature . " And yet " the distinctive character of our times , " he urges , " lies in the vast and constantly increasing part which is played by natural knowledge . " And how , therefore , can a man , devoid of knowledge of what physical science has done in the last century enter hopefully upon a criticism of modern life ? <p> Let us , I say , be agreed about the meaning of the terms we are using . I talk of knowing the best which has been thought and uttered in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a large word ; it may mean everything written with letters or printed in a book . Euclid 's Elements and Newton 's Principia are thus literature . All knowledge that reaches us through books is literature . But by literature Professor Huxley means belles lettres . He means to make me say , that knowing the best which has been thought and said by the modern nations is knowing their belles lettres and no more . And this is no sufficient equipment , he argues , for a criticism of modern life . But as I do not mean , by knowing ancient Rome , knowing merely more or less of Latin belles lettres , and taking no account of Rome 's military , and political , and legal , and . administrative work in the world ; and as , by knowing ancient Greece , I understand knowing her as the giver of Greek art , and the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scientific method , and the founder of our mathematics and physics and astronomy and biology , I understand knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek poems , and histories , and treatises , and speeches , so as to the knowledge of modern nations also . By knowing modern nations , I mean not merely knowing their belles lettres , but knowing also what has been done by such men as Copernicus , Galileo , Newton , Darwin . " Our ancestors learned , " says Professor Huxley , " that the earth is the centre of the visible universe , and that man is the cynosure of things terrestrial ; and more especially was it inculcated that the course of nature had no fixed order but that it could be , and constantly was , altered . " But for us now continues Professor Huxley , " the notions of the beginning and the end of the world entertained by our forefathers are no longer credible . It is very certain that the earth is not the chief body in the material universe , and that the world is not subordinated to man 's use . It is even more , certain that nature is the expression of a definite order , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries , " the purely classical education advocated by the representatives of the humanists in Our day gives no inkling of all this ! " <p> In due place and time I will just touch upon that vexed question of classical education ; but at present the question is as to what is meant by knowing the best which modern nations have thought and said . It is not knowing their belles lettres merely which is meant . To know Italian belles lettres is not to know Italy , and to know English belles lettres is not to know England . Into knowing Italy and England there comes a great deal more , Galileo and Newton , amongst it . The reproach of being a superficial humanism , a tincture of belles lettres , may attach rightly enough to some other disciplines ; but to the particular discipline recommended when I proposed knowing the best that has been thought and said in the world , it does not apply . In that best I certainly include what in modern times has been thought and said by the great observers and knowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question between Professor Huxley and me as to whether knowing the great results of the modern scientific study of nature is not required as a part of our culture , as well as knowing the products of literature and art . But to follow the processes by which those results are reached , ought , say the friends of physical science , to be made the staple of education for the bulk of mankind . And here there does arise a question between those whom Professor Huxley calls with playful sarcasm " the Levites of culture , " and those whom the poor humanist is sometimes apt to regard as its Nebuchadnezzars . <p> The great results of the scientific investigation of nature we are agreed upon knowing , but how much of our study are we bound to give to the processes by which those results are reached ? The results have their visible bearing on human life . But all the processes , too , all the items of fact , by which those results are reached and established , are interesting . All knowledge is interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to all men . It is very interesting to know , that , from the albuminous white of the egg , the chick in the egg gets the materials for its flesh , bones , blood , and feathers ; while , from the fatty yolk of the egg , it gets the heat and energy which enable it at length to break its shell and begin the world . It is less interesting , perhaps , but still it is interesting , to know that when a taper burns , the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water . Moreover , it is quite true that the habit of dealing with facts , which is given by the study of nature , is , as the friends of physical science praise it for being , an excellent discipline . The appeal , in the study of nature , is constantly to observation and experiment ; not only is it said that the thing is so , but we can be made to see that it is so . Not only does a man tell us that when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , as a man may tell us , if he likes , that Charon is punting his ferry-boat on the river Styx , or that Victor Hugo is a sublime poet , or Mr. Gladstone the most admirable of statesmen ; but we are made to see that the conversion into carbonic acid and water does actually happen . This reality of natural knowledge it is , which makes the friends of physical science contrast it , as a knowledge of things , with the humanist 's knowledge , which is , say they , a knowledge of words . And hence Professor Huxley is moved to lay it down that , " for the purpose of attaining real culture , an exclusively scientific education is at least as effectual as an exclusively literary education . " And a certain President of the Section for Mechanical Science in the British Association is , in Scripture phrase , " very bold , " and declares that if a man , in his mental training , " has substituted literature and history for natural science , he has chosen the less useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , we . must all admit that in natural science the habit gained of dealing with facts is a most valuable discipline , and that every one should have some experience of it . <p> More than this , however , is demanded by the reformers . It is proposed to make the training in natural science the main part of education , for the great majority of mankind at any rate . And here , I confess , I part company with the friends of physical science , with whom up to this point I have been agreeing . In differing from them , however , I wish to proceed with the utmost caution and diffidence . The smallness of my own acquaintance with the disciplines of natural science is ever before my mind , and I am fearful of doing these disciplines an injustice . The ability and pugnacity of the partisans of natural science make them formidable persons to contradict . The tone of tentative inquiry , which befits a being of dim faculties and bounded knowledge , is the tone I would wish to take and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that those who are for giving to natural knowledge , as they call it , the chief place in the education of the majority of mankind , leave one important thing out of their account : the constitution of human nature . But I put this forward upon the strength of some facts not at all recondite , very far from it ; facts capable of being stated in the simplest possible fashion , and to which , if I so state them , the man of science will , I am sure , be willing to allow their due weight . <p> Deny the facts altogether , I think , he hardly can . He can hardly deny , that when we set ourselves to enumerate the powers which go to the building up of human life , and say that they are the power of conduct , the power of intellect and knowledge , the power of beauty , and the power of social life and manners , he can hardly deny that this scheme , though drawn in rough and plain lines enough , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true representation of the matter . Human nature is built up by these powers ; we have the need for them all . When we have rightly met and adjusted the claims of them all , we shall then be in a fair way for getting soberness and righteousness , with wisdom . This is evident enough , and the friends of physical science would admit it . <p> But perhaps they may not have sufficiently observed another thing : namely , that the several powers just mentioned are not isolated , but there is , in the generality of mankind , a perpetual tendency to relate them one to another in divers ways . With one such way of relating them I am particularly concerned now . Following our instinct for intellect and knowledge , we acquire pieces of knowledge ; and presently , in the generality of men , there arises the desire to relate these pieces of knowledge to our sense for conduct , to our sense for beauty , --and there is weariness and dissatisfaction if the desire is baulked . Now in this desire lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have upon us . <p> All knowledge is , as I said just now , interesting ; and even items of knowledge which from the nature of the case can not well be related , but must stand isolated in our thoughts , have their interest . Even lists of exceptions have their interest . If we are studying Greek accents , it is interesting to know that pais and pas , and some other monosyllables of the same form of declension , do not take the circumflex upon the last syllable of the genitive plural , but vary , in this respect , from the common rule . If we are studying physiology , it is interesting to know that the pulmonary artery carries dark blood and the pulmonary vein carries bright blood , departing in this respect from the common rule for the division of labour between the veins and the arteries . But every one knows how we seek naturally to combine the pieces of our knowledge together , to bring them under general rules , to relate them to principles ; and how unsatisfactory and tiresome it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , or accumulating items of fact which must stand isolated . <p> Well , that same need of relating our knowledge , which operates here within the sphere of our knowledge itself , we shall find operating , also , outside that sphere . We experience , as we go on learning and knowing , --the vast majority of us experience , ? the need of relating what we have learnt and known to the sense which we have in us for conduct , to the sense which we have in us for beauty . <p> A certain Greek prophetess of Mantineia in Arcadia , Diotima by name , once explained to the philosopher Socrates that love , and impulse , and bent of all kinds , is , in fact , nothing else but the desire in men that good should for ever be present to them . This desire for good , Diotima assured Socrates , is our fundamental desire , of which fundamental desire every impulse in us is only some one particular form . And therefore this fundamental desire it is , I suppose , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , which acts in us when we feel the impulse for relating our knowledge to our sense for conduct and to our sense for beauty . At any rate , with men in general the instinct exists . Such is human nature . And the instinct , it will be admitted , is innocent , and human nature is preserved by our following the lead of its innocent instincts . Therefore , in seeking to gratify this instinct in question , we are following the instinct of self-preservation in humanity . <p> But , no doubt , some kinds of knowledge can not be made to directly serve the instinct in question , can not be directly related to the sense for beauty , to the sense for conduct . These are instrument-knowledges ; they lead on to other knowledges , which can . A man who passes his life in instument-knowledges is a specialist . They may be invaluable as instruments to something beyond , for those who have the gift thus to employ them ; and they may be disciplines m themselves wherein it is useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconceivable that the generality of men should pass all their mental life with Greek accents or with formal logic . My friend Professor Sylvester , who is one of the first mathematicians in the world , holds transcendental doctrines as to the virtue of mathematics , but those doctrines are not for common men . In the very Senate House and heart of our English Cambridge I once ventured , though not without an apology for my profaneness , to hazard the opinion that for the majority of mankind a little of mathematics , even , goes a long way . Of course this is quite consistent with their being of immense importance as an instrument to something else ; but it is the few who have the aptitude for thus using them , not the bulk of mankind . <p> The natural sciences do not , however , stand on the same footing with these instrument-knowledges . Experience shows us that the generality of men will find more interest in learning that , when a taper burns , the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in learning how the circulation of the blood is carried on , than they find in learning that the genitive plural of pais and pas does not take the circumflex on the termination . And one piece of natural knowledge is added to another , and others are added to that , and at last we come to propositions so interesting as Mr. Darwin 's famous proposition that " our ancestor was a hairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears , probably arboreal in his habits . " Or we come to propositions of such reach and magnitude as those which Professor Huxley delivers , when he says that the notions of our forefathers about the beginning and the end of the world were all wrong , and that nature is the expression of a definite order with which nothing interferes . <p> Interesting indeed , these results of science are , important they are , I and we should all of us be acquainted with them . But what I now I wish you to mark is , that we are still , when they are propounded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sphere of intellect and knowledge . And for the generality of men there will be found , I say , to arise , when they have duly taken in the proposition that their ancestor was " a hairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears , probably arboreal in his habits , " there will be found to arise an invincible desire to relate this proposition to the sense in us for conduct , and to the sense in us for beauty . But this the men of science will not do for us , and will hardly even profess to do . They will give us other pieces of knowledge , other facts , about other animals and their ancestors , or about plants , or about stones , or about stars ; and they may finally bring us to those great " general conceptions of the universe , which are forced upon us all , " says Professor Huxley , " by the progress of physical science . " But still it will be knowledge only which they give us , knowledge not put for us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , and touched with emotion by being so put ; not thus put for us , and therefore , to the majority of mankind , after a certain while , unsatisfying , wearying . <p> Not to the born naturalist , I admit . But what do we mean by a born naturalist ? We mean a man in whom the zeal for observing nature is so uncommonly strong and eminent , that it marks him off from the bulk of mankind . Such a man will pass his life happily in collecting natural knowledge and reasoning upon it , and will ask for nothing , or hardly anything , more . I have heard it said that the sagacious and admirable naturalist whom we lost not very long ago , Mr. Darwin , once owned to a friend that for his part he did not experience the necessity for two things which most men find so necessary to them , ? religion and poetry ; science and the domestic affections , he thought , were enough . To a born naturalist , I can well understand that this should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so strong his love for his occupation , that he goes on acquiring natural knowledge and reasoning upon it , and has little time or inclination for thinking about getting it related to the desire in man for conduct , the desire in man for beauty . He relates it to them for himself as he goes along , so far as he feels the need ; and he draws from the domestic affections all the additional solace necessary . But then Darwins are extremely rare . Another great and admirable master of natural knowledge , Faraday , was a Sandemainian . That is to say he related his knowledge to his instinct for conduct and to his instinct for beauty , by the aid off that respectable Scottish sectary Robert Sandeman . And so strong , in general , is the demand of religion and poetry to have their share in a man , to associate themselves with his knowing , and to relieve and rejoice it , that , probably , for one man amongst us with the disposition to do as Darwin did in this respect there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faraday . <p> Education lays hold upon us , in fact , by satisfying this demand . Professor Huxley holds up to scorn mediaeval education , with its neglect of the knowledge of nature , its poverty even of literary studies , its formal logic devoted to " showing how and why that which the Church said was true must be true . " But the great mediaeval Universities were not brought into being we may be sure , by the zeal for giving a jejune and contemptible education . Kings have been their nursing fathers , and queens have been their nursing mothers , but not for this . The mediaeval Universities came into being , because the supposed knowledge , delivered by Scripture and the Church , so deeply engaged men 's hearts , by so simply , easily , and powerfully relating itself to their desire for conduct , their desire for beauty . All other knowledge was dominated by this supposed knowledge and was subordinated to it , because of the surpassing strength of the hold which it " aimed upon the affections of men , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for beauty . " <p> But now , says Professor Huxley , conceptions of the universe fatal to the notions held by our forefathers have been forced upon us by physical science . Grant to him shalt they are thus fatal , that the new conceptions must and will soon become current everywhere , and that every one will finally perceive them to be fatal to the beliefs of our forefathers . The need of humane letters , as they are truly called , because they serve the paramount desire in men that good should be for ever present to them , the need of humane letters , to establish a relation between the new conceptions , and our instinct for beauty our instinct for conduct , is only the more visible . The Middle Age could do without humane letters , as it could do without the study of nature , because its supposed knowledge was made to engage its emotions so powerfully . Grant that the supposed knowledge disappears its power of being made to engage the emotions will of course disappear along with it , but the emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will remain . Now if we find by experience that humane letters have an undeniable power of engaging the emotions , the importance of humane letters in a man 's training becomes not less , but greater , in proportion to the success of modern science in extirpating what it calls " mediaeval thinking . " <p> Have humane letters , then , have poetry and eloquence , the power here attributed to them of engaging the emotions , and do they exercise it ? And if they have it and exercise it , how do they exercise it , so as to exert an influence upon man 's sense for conduct , his sense for beauty ? Finally , even if they both can and do exert an influence upon the senses in question , how are they to relate to them the results . the modern results , if natural science ? All these questions may be asked . First , have poetry and eloquence the power of calling out the emotions ? The appeal is to experience . Experience shows that for the vast majority of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next , do they exercise it ? They do . But then , how do they exercise it so as to affect man 's sense for conduct , his sense for beauty ? And this is perhaps a case for applying the Preacher 's words : " Though a man labour to seek it out , yet he shall not find it ; yea , farther , though a wise man think to know it , yet shall he not be able to find it . " Why should it be one thing , in its effect upon the emotions , to say , " Patience is a virtue , " and quite another thing , in its ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> " for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the children of men " ? Why should it be one thing , in its effect upon the emotions , to say with the philosopher Spinoza , Felicitas in eo consistit quod homo suum esse conservare potest ? Man 's happiness consists in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite another thing , in its effect upon the emotions , to say with the Gospel , " What is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , forfeit himself ? " How does this difference of effect arise ? I can not tell , and I am not much concerned to know ; the important thing is that it does arise , and that we can profit by it . But how , finally , are poetry and eloquence to exercise the power of relating the modern results of natural science to man 's instinct for conduct , his instinct for beauty ? And here again I answer that I do not know how they will exercise it , but that they can and will exercise it I am sure . I do not mean that modern philosophical poets and modern philosophical moralists are to come and relate for us , in express terms , the results of modern scientific research to our instinct for conduct , our instinct for beauty . But I mean that we shall find , as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thought and uttered in the world , we shall find that the art and poetry and eloquence of men who lived , perhaps , long ago , who had the most limited natural knowledge , who had the most erroneous conceptions about many important matters , we shall find that this art , and poetry , and eloquence , have in fact not only the power of refreshing and delighting us , they have also the power , ? such is the strength and worth , in essentials , of their authors ' criticism of life , they have a fortifying , and elevating , and quickening , and suggestive power , capable of wonderfully helping us to relate the results of modern science to our need for conduct , our need for beauty . Homer 's conceptions of the physical universe were , I imagine , grotesque ; but really , under the shock of hearing from modern science that " the world is not subordinated to man 's use , and that man is not the cynosure of things terrestrial , " I could , for my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> " for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the children of men ! " <p> And the more that men 's minds are cleared , the more that the results of science are frankly accepted , the more that poetry and eloquence come to be received and studied as what in truth they really are , ? the criticism of life by gifted men , alive and active with extraordinary power at an unusual number of points ; so much the more will the value of humane letters , and of art also , which is an utterance having a like kind of power with theirs , be felt and acknowledged , and their place in education be secured . <p> Let us therefore , all of us , avoid indeed as much as possible any invidious comparison between the merits of humane letters , as means of education , and the merits of the natural sciences . But when some President of a Section for Mechanical Science insists on making the comparison , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted literature and history for natural science has chosen the less useful alternative , " let us make answer to him that the student of humane letters only , will , at least , know also the great general conceptions brought in by modern physical science ; for science , as Professor Huxley says , forces them upon us all . But the student of the natural sciences only , will , by our very hypothesis , know nothing of humane letters ; not to mention that in setting himself to be perpetually accumulating natural knowledge , he sets himself to do what only specialists have in general the gift for doing genially . And so he will probably be unsatisfied , or at any rate incomplete , and even more incomplete than the student of humane letters only . <p> I once mentioned in a school-report , how a young man in one of our English training colleges having to paraphrase the passage in Macbeth beginning , <p> Can'st thou not minister to a mind diseased ? <p> turned this line into , " Can you not wait upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things it would be , if every pupil of our national schools knew , let us say , that the moon is two thousand one hundred and sixty miles in diameter , and thought at the same time that a good paraphrase for <p> Can'st thou not minister to a mind diseased ? <p> was , " Can you not wait upon the lunatic ? " If one is driven to choose , I think I would rather have a young person ignorant about the moon 's diameter , but aware that " Can you not wait upon the lunatic ? " is bad , than a young person whose education had been such as to manage things the other way . <p> Or to go higher than the pupils of our national schools . I have in my mind 's eye a member of our British Parliament who comes to travel here in America , who afterwards relates his travels , and who shows a really masterly knowledge of the geology of this great country and of its mining capabilities , but who ends by gravely suggesting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should make him their king , and should create a House of Lords of great landed proprietors after the pattern of ours ; and then America , he thinks , would have her future happily and perfectly secured . Surely , in this case , the President of the Section for Mechanical Science would himself hardly say that our member of Parliament , by concentrating himself upon geology and mineralogy , and so on , and not attending to literature and history , had " chosen the more useful alternative . " <p> If then there is to be separation and option between humane letters on the one hand , and the natural sciences on the other , the great majority of mankind , all who have not exceptional and overpowering aptitudes for the study of nature , would do well , I can not but think , to choose to be educated in humane letters rather than in the natural sciences . Letters will call out their being at more points , will make them live more . <p> I said that before I ended I would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep my word . Even if literature is to retain a large place in our education , yet Latin and Greek , say the friends of progress , will certainly have to go . Greek is the grand offender in the eyes of these gentlemen . The attackers of the established course of study think that against Greek , at any rate , they have irresistible arguments . Literature may perhaps be needed in education , they say ; but why on earth should it be Greek literature ? Why not French or German ? Nay , " has not an Englishman models in his own literature of every kind of excellence ? " As before , it is not on any weak pleadings of my own that I rely for convincing the gainsayers ; it is on the constitution of human nature itself , and on the instinct of self-preservation in humanity . The instinct for beauty is set in human nature , as surely as the instinct for knowledge is set there , or the instinct for conduct . If the instinct for beauty is served by Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and art , we may trust to the instinct of self-preservation in humanity for keeping Greek as part of our culture . We may trust to it for even making the study of Greek more prevalent than it is now . Greek will come , I hope , some day to be studied more rationally than at present ; but it will be increasingly studied as men increasingly feel the need in them for beauty , and how powerfully Greek art and Greek literature can serve this need . Women will again study Greek , as Lady Jane Grey did ; I believe that in that chain of forts , with which the fair host of the Amazons are now engirdling our English universities , I find that here in America , in colleges like Smith College in Massachusetts , and Vassar College in the State of New York , and in the happy families of the mixed universities out West , they are studying it already . <p> Defuit una mihi symmetria prisca , -- " The antique symmetry was the one thing wanting to me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not presume to speak for the Americans , but I am sure that , in the Englishman , the want of this admirable symmetry of the Greeks is a thousand times more great and crying than in any Italian . The results of the want show themselves most glaringly , perhaps , in our architecture , but they show themselves , also , in all our art . Fit details strictly combined , in view of a large general result nobly conceived ; that is just the beautiful symmetria prisca of the Greeks , and it is just where we English fail , where all our art fails . Striking ideas we have , and well-executed details we have ; but that high symmetry which , with satisfying and delightful effect , combines them , we seldom or never have . The glorious beauty of the Acropolis at Athens did not come from single fine things stuck about on that hill , a statue here , a gateway there ; no , it arose from all things being perfectly combined for a supreme total effect . What must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sense for beauty , whereof this symmetry is an essential element , awakens and strengthens within him ! what will not one day be his respect and desire for Greece and its symmetria prisca , when the scales drop from his eyes as he walks the London streets , and he sees such a lesson in meanness as the Strand , for instance , in its true deformity ! But here we are coming to our friend Mr. Ruskin 's province , and I will not intrude upon it , for he is its very sufficient guardian . <p> And so we at last find , it seems , we find flowing in favour of the humanities the natural and necessary stream of things , which seemed against them when we started . The " hairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears , probably arboreal in his habits , " this good fellow carried hidden in his nature , apparently , something destined to develop into a necessity for humane letters . Nay , more ; we seem finally to be even led to the further conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a necessity for Greek . <p> And therefore , to say the truth , I can not really think that humane letters are in much actual danger of being thrust out from their leading place in education , in spite of the array of authorities against them at this moment . So long as human nature is what it is , their attractions will remain irresistible . As with Greek , so with letters generally : they will some day come , we may hope , to be studied more rationally , but they will not lose their place . What will happen will rather be that there will be crowded into education other matters besides , far too many ; there will be , perhaps , a period of unsettlement and confusion and false tendency ; but letters will not in the end lose their leading place . If they lose it for a time , they will get it back again . We shall be brought back to them by our wants and aspirations . And a poor humanist may possess his soul in patience , neither strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisans of physical science , and their present favour with the public , to be far greater than his own , and still have a happy faith that the nature of things works silently on behalf of the studies which he loves , and that , while we shall all have to acquaint ourselves with the great results reached by modern science , and to give ourselves as much training in its disciplines as we can conveniently carry , yet the majority of men will always require humane letters ; and so much the more , as they have the more and the greater results of science to relate to the need in man for conduct , and to the need in him for beauty . <p> 1 Not the Rede lecture , Cambridge University , 1882 , in reply to Thomas H.

##3811150 <h> Concept #6 : Competition <p> Stuffs I Learned from this Concept : - Definition of " Competition " - Types of Competition and Competitors - Layers of Competition - Difference between Direct Competition and Indirect Competition . - The Competitions Happening Currently - How it relates to " Need " and " Want " . <p> Completed Activities in this Concept : - Competition Video Project <p> The significant concept for this concept is : " Businesses respond to the conditions of the marketplace ( needs , wants , supply , demand , competition ) " . The knowledges that I have learned improved my understanding to the significant concept , as I realizes business is n't simply about demanding and supplying a product , or fulfilling needs and wants -- it 's also about competitions between competitors . The competitions are formed while business responds to the condition of the marketplace , fulfilling the needs and the wants . The amount of competitions , depends on whether it 's a need or a want , and how general the need/want is . For example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this business would have to face any competitions from other businesses that relates to dessert , including frozen yogurts , chocolates , and biscuits etc . On the opposite side , if a business is simply focusing on the want of green tea ice cream , this business would only have to face the competitions from business that relates to green tea ice cream . The only way of being a successful business , is to overcome the competitions around , including the direct ones and the indirect ones , by providing a better quality or selling at a cheaper price to fulfill the market 's need and want . <p> The guiding question for this concept is : " How do organizations respond ethically to the needs and wants of markets ? " . The knowledges that I have learned allows me to answer the guiding question , because it gives me an idea that business/organizations does n't simply responds to the needs and the wants in the market by just providing products and services . In order to comes out with a victory , the business would reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or usually , the business would increase the product 's quality or decrease the product 's price , in order to attract buyers to buy their product , raising the chance of beating the other competitors . As an example , McDonald is now a worldwide known fast-food restaurant ; the keys of making McDonald a successful business , is the serving speed , the product 's great taste and the product 's cheap price . <p> Understanding of " Competition " has a connection to the understanding of " Needs and Wants " , because needs and wants is exactly what business are trying to fulfill , through supplying . This explains how competition occurs , it 's formed when two or more businesses are providing products that satisfy the same needs or wants . This also relates to " Starting a Business " , due to the fact that starting a business involves with changing price , using unique products , and improving quality -- this are all factors that contributes to business of winning the competition , attracting buyers to purchase its products , and comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time reading through your blog post . It was very descriptive and I could tell that you spent a lot of time summarizing the information that we have learned from this unit into a way that connects to the significant concepts and the guiding question . I also like how you mentioned that businesses can only rely on satisfying for one layer of competition , but to satisfy in as many as they can , which I feel is almost like something I have learned myself and that is diversification for economics . I also really enjoyed your examples cause if I had trouble understanding what you send in a statement , I would gain understanding and knowledge through a more circumstantial aspect . However I a minor problem from communication was your grammar , which is not terrible but did cripple my
