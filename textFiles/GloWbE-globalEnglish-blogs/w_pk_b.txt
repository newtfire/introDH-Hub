##3495052 <h> VC Financing for Startups : Understanding Cost Drivers <p> This breaks down the legal costs behind a financing deal rather well . It also makes a critical point : small firms are startups as well , which puts them in a great position to understand the needs , cost prohibitions , and though process of a startup -- they also cost less , for often the same caliber of work . Nugget of thought for entrepreneurs . <p> To understand what drives legal fees ( aside from an army of associates ) during a financing round , it 's important for startups , especially those going through their first few rounds , to understand why a transaction costs more than a few hundred dollars . It 's also important to understand why choosing a firm that 's a good fit for a startup matters in these rounds . <p> Leveraging Knowledge <p> Few things can hurt a startup more than a vague or hurried term sheet that will result in increased costs down the road . To avoid these problems , s mart entrepreneurs and investors involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as smooth as possible . For entrepreneurs , they need to understand that a VC 's counsel is not the startup 's counsel and that they absolutely need their own counsel as well . It 's like buying an insurance policy that will cost your startup much less than potential future problems stemming from vague term sheets . <p> In most funding rounds , costs start increasing due to due diligence required by investors before a deal is closed . This means due diligence on the following ( if not more ) subjects : <p> ( 1 ) Litigation Diligence : Investors want to ensure that there are no pending or threatened suits against the startup that could materially reduce its value ( they can not just take your word on this ) . <p> ( 2 ) Tax and Liability Diligence : Investors need assurance that the startup is up to date on all taxes and potential obligations . <p> ( 3 ) IP Diligence : The assurance that each IP the startup claim s as its own really belongs to the startup and not anyone else . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or similar issues , that all former/current **40;14428;TOOLONG ... have legally and properly assigned rights to any IP to the startup , and if reverse vesting of common stock held by key employees is necessary . <p> ( 5 ) Corporate Governance Diligence : Investors want to ensure that the entity is properly formed and corporate governance matters have been properly followed ( i.e. startup 's corporate records must be in order ; if they are not , lawyers and the startup must go into overdrive conducting a " cleanup " to ensure that everything is up to date , properly documented , and ready for inspection -- this can add significant costs and often can be delay , or kill , a deal closing ) . <p> ( 6 ) Stock Option Diligence : Legal diligence to ensure that all stock option grants were properly approved and 409A compliant ; this may also result in a change to the price per share if contemplated on a " pre-money valuation " basis . <p> ( There are more aspects that can drive up the costs , but those listed above can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cap <p> Anytime a startup ( or an investor ) hires counsel , they should ask for a cap on the legal fees ; SLF works to ensure that in closing deals such as early financing rounds , our legal bill comes under the cap , however other firms have been known to bill at the cap regardless of complexity or simplicity of the deal . <p> If an attorney or firm does not want to talk in terms of a cap on the legal fee , it may be prudent to search around a little more . <p> For more information on startup legal services , email us at sardar@sardarlawfirm.com or join us for a class taught by Benish Shah and Sheheryar Sardar . <p> " Benish and Sheheryar provided many useful insights about the startup world and launching a company .

##3497650 <p> A triumphant Vladimir Putin , Russian president from 2000 to 2008 before becoming prime minister due to term limits , has just won a third six-year term with nearly 64 percent of the vote . <p> Opposition claims that his presidential election victory was unfair and fraudulent are ignored by Putin . Instead , he criticized the opposition for failing to offer a constructive program and failing to become a real political force at the ballot box -- difficult to do in a country with controlled elections . <p> Putin 's tough remarks indicate he is not going to be influenced by the massive protests that have revealed public anger over his continuing 12-year rule . He will no doubt appoint Medvedev to be Prime Minister again in the interests of stability , though his next term of office may not be as stable as he hopes . Political instability in Russia has been growing over the years and anti-Kremlin movements have grown in confidence since the December 2011 parliamentary elections , when Putin 's United Russia Party lost its super-majority in the Duma . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and anti-Kremlin sentiment has led to a perception of a weaker Putin . At the same time , the European financial crisis affected Russia 's economy because an estimated 75 percent of foreign investment in Russia comes from European Union countries . Trade has rebounded lately as demand for Russia 's oil and gas continues and prices for both are at record highs . Economic uncertainties however , feed into domestic political problems and Putin will have to find a new balance to weather the volatility ahead . <p> Any sign of weakness in the Kremlin is likely to be welcomed by the United States and Central European countries , particularly when negotiating the missile defense issue . The emerging states of the former Soviet Union in particular are always looking for opportunities to assert their independence from Russia . But the smaller breakaway territories of the region such as the former Georgian territory of Abkhazia and the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan are in a more ambivalent position as they lack resources to exist as independent nation-states and must rely on Russian patronage . Russia has a strong military presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided with financial and military aid through neighboring Armenia . <p> Russia has shown that it will use its dominant position in the breakaway areas to control the " parent " states and punish them if they do something Russia does not like . For example Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 when Georgia attempted to join NATO . The breakaway states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia were recognized by Russia who keeps troops stationed there as a constant threat to Georgia . <p> Recent elections in South Ossetia and Transdniestria , a separatist region of Moldava , saw Russia 's preferred candidates both losing , suggesting that Russian influence may be waning . But the need for Russian funding still guarantees the allegiance of smaller separatist regions , and while Russia remains a relatively powerful country it will continue under Putin to assertively oversee the nations in the former Soviet sphere . <p> That is why the issue of the Gabala Radar Station in Azerbaijan is becoming a symbolic yet pivotal actor in the missile defense question that has preoccupied U.S. and Russian policymakers for some years . The Gabala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1985 and is now leased and operated by the Russian Aerospace Defense Forces . It has a range of 6,000 kilometers , covering Iran , Turkey , India , Iraq and the entire Middle East , and can detect and track the launch of missiles to enable a defense system to intercept offensive strikes . <p> The current lease expires in December 2012 , and Moscow wants to extend the lease for another 25 years . Azerbaijan 's response has been to raise the rent , first from the existing $7 million a year to $15 million , then to $150 million and again to $300 million . <p> The standoff is interesting because the Gabala station needs modernization and the Russians are building a new and more powerful station in Armavir , in neighboring Armenia which can replace the Gabala station when its second phase comes online . By increasing the rent so dramatically , Azerbaijan is asserting its independence from Russia and its ability to offer the station instead to NATO . Speculation about the reasons behind Azerbaijan 's new assertiveness range from the absence of progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalizing the Trans-Caspian pipeline . <p> If Russia refuses to pay up , then it will lose the Gabala Radar Station . AZ News online reports that , " Moscow then will not only lose one of its trump cards in negotiation with Washington on missile defense , but it will also give the Americans a station that will help them conduct operations against Iran . " <p> However , the Gabala station may not be such a trump card after all . In 2007 , Putin offered the station to the United States if they would abandon their proposed deployments of missile defense systems in Poland and Czech Republic . The United States refused and Russia then had to appease Iran who thought that the Russians were trying to gain favor with the US at Iran 's expense . The Russians explained it away by saying that the Gabala station was simply a passive surveillance system , a listening post , and had no anti-missile component . Moscow continues to this day to insist that Iran is not capable of launching ballistic missiles and that the United States has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect them against a possibly belligerent Russia . <p> The fate of the Gabala station then is highly symbolic of Russia 's new President 's attitude toward the former Soviet satellites . Putin 's new Presidency could well be one of heightened tensions as he seeks to suppress internal dissent by creating external enemies . Georgia and Chechnya were hostage to his inordinate ambitions , and the tragic loss of life and the human rights abuses have gained Putin little but international disrepute . If Azerbaijan is pressured to lower the rent by an autocratic Russia , then the Gabala station would be a constant reminder that Azerbaijan is still a client state , and that the Russians have a right to maintain their last military outpost in an independent country . <p> If the United States were to support Azerbaijan , and perhaps reopen discussions with the Russians about Gabala and remind them of their earlier offer , perhaps this relic of the Cold War could be taken over by NATO or even demolished , decommissioned or turned into a tourist hotel as some in Azerbaijan have suggested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country and photos of the site show it to be an especially ugly piece of brutal concrete Soviet architecture . Let us hope a pragmatic President Putin will see it as technologically outdated and too expensive to continue to maintain . Like the statues of Stalin , Gabala radar station should go -- along with Cold War symbols and Cold War thinking . <p> Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a Research Professor at the US Army War College , Lecturer at the University of Chicago , Fellow and Member of the Board of Directors at the Institute of Social Policy and Understanding and a former Research Scholar at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and World Fellow 
##3498051 <h> The Endless Baptism of Palestine <p> For the last few months , I 've been working on a series of essays on Palestine . I 've now written and erased my words until there is nothing left but the original title of the series . It could fit on a button : " Islamophobia is not the answer to Anti-Semitism . " -- -Eventually , the title too had to be scratched . Because although anti-Muslim sentiment is fueled by and benefits US imperialism and Israel 's apartheid practices , Palestinian Christians suffer as well . <p> Each day I tried to work . I felt myself covered with dust . I read of the erasure of Palestinian names from Israeli maps and how each erasure was attended by a massacre of innocents . I felt myself consumed in darkness while reading stories of Al-Dawayima where an entire village of Palestinian citizens was murdered , beaten , some raped , their bodies thrown down into the town well by Israeli soldiers . i I tried to write of the massacre of the people of Nasir al-din , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hunger . If you do n't believe me , read and read . <p> These massacres are the seeds of Israel 's creation . The occupation of Palestinian land and apartheid conditions for Palestinians continues to the present day . At the same time there is forced ignorance of the history of Israel and its current crimes . As a Muslim-raised New Yorker , I am baffled and horrified almost every day by how little people know about Palestine . I can not read the New York Times without gagging . There is a creation of a fake history right before our eyes , the kind of history that hurts the most . <p> It is always difficult to find the words to say what I know and feel about Palestine and the ways in which we in the United States are complicit in Israel 's crimes because when I do , I hear cries of " Anti-Semite " thrown like dirt in my eyes . This is what is done when someone tries to tell the truth of Palestine , even though Zionism in current practice has been included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rights on par with apartheid and neocolonialism . This Charter has been ratified by 53 African countries . <p> Before they were bullied into changing the definition , the UN General Assembly also defined Zionism as " a form of racism and racial discrimination " and added that " any doctrine of racial differentiation of superiority is scientifically false , morally condemnable , socially unjust , and dangerous . " This was in 1975 . Due to pressure from the United States and Israel , the UN had to change its tune . At the UN Conference on Racism in 2001 , the United States and Israel threatened to walk away from the conference if Zionism continued to be associated with racism . Thus , Zionism was n't labeled as racism in the UN anymore . However , an independent Human Rights Forum at the same conference did connect Zionism with racism and cited Israel 's racially inspired brutality , acts of genocide , and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians as obvious forms of racism . <p> And so I know I am not completely alone , but still the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series . I could only begin writing this piece after John Murillo , a poet , teacher , and friend of friends , shared during a Cave Canem workshop , Lorca 's Theory and Play of the Duende . Lorca spoke of the darkness . The beauty of his words were branches I could grasp to see me to the other side . In the end , my first response , before I could write any of what I wrote above , was a poem , a loose cento created from a patchwork of Gabriel Garcia Lorca 's words : <p> i The movie " Salt of the Sea " ( written/directed by Annemarie Jacir ) contains a poignant and necessary response to the Al-Dawayima massacre . <p> iv The verses of Jeremiah from the Hebrew Bible are used to justify the creation of the State of Israel . <p> v The drunken soldier quotes and misquotes the Hebrew Bible and Theodor Hertzl , the founder of Zionism . Hertzl 's thoughts on the methods of creating the state of Israel are contradictory . He wrote both about living peacefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in Uganda or Palestine ) and " spiriting " these same residents away across the border and not allowing them back in . Hertzl wrote : " The process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly .

##3499550 <p> Costly equipment for biomechanical analysis at the National Cricket Academy ( NCA ) in Lahore is now set to be used , after years of neglect . The PCB has also approved renovation work at the NCA indoor school , and is updating it with a modern video simulator . <p> The biomechanical equipment was procured for about Rs 44 million ( $460,000 ) when Nasim Ashraf was in charge of the PCB , and was meant to be installed by December 2008 . Since then all the equipment - 18 cameras along with the other supporting apparatus and the relevant software have been unused . The project was put on hold by the then chairman Ijaz Butt after PCB 's audit revealed massive financial mismanagement and the construction contract for the laboratory where the equipment was to be housed was suspended . <p> According to the plan , part of the NCA 's outdoor practice area was to be used to accommodate the dedicated laboratory that would enable biomechanics experts to take a 2D analysis of a bowler 's action , by filming the players and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NCA biomechanics lab is equipped with state of the art Advanced Motion Capture Architecture from the UK-based Vicon Motion Systems Limited .

The project , according to Alam , will be managed by a team that includes a biomechanics expert , doctors , a mathematician , computer analysts and coaches . <p> " We have entered the first phase of negotiation with the experts to be taken on board for making the lab functional , " Alam said . " The key role is that of a biomechanics expert and we are already engaged with an expert who has done her PhD from Austria . We will soon reach an agreement with her and a mathematician to work the laboratory . Besides , we have all the medical doctors , well-trained analysts and coaches .

##3504750 start viewing messages , select the forum that you want to visit from the selection below . <h> Help : ( <p> Been advised to re-post this in here : <p> Dear everyone , Here is a brief summary of my story : I am a revert to Islam . I said my Shahadah on the 1st of November this year . I was christened as a baby and went to a Church of England school where we went to Church once a week but that was about it . Then I moved to another school due to moving house ( non religious school this time ) . I am 17 so I still go to secondary school ; my school is just for girls and I would say the majority are non-religious however there are a handful of Muslims in each class- we are a very open school . Anyway , growing up I didn ? t think much about God .. I just prayed when I wanted nice weather or something trivial like that ! Then , when I started high school I became agnostic/weak atheist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my partner was Muslim ? we got/get on really well , and I get on well with her Muslim friends too . Due to our friendship , I got the amazing chance to spend all of Ramadan with her family in a Muslim country . We had a lot of debates about God during this summer , and we spoke a lot . On my return to England I decided to buy a Quran and I started reading a lot about Islam . I had a lot of doubts at first , but I slowly started to find faith in God . I decided then , to visit a Mosque and I took my Shahadah there and then ; they also gave me lots of books to read . I felt uneasy however , and slightly anxious straight after however I now feel more secure .. I know God exists . My problems : My friends at my school are not Muslim , and while they are lovely and understanding people , I can ? t tell them I am Muslim ? they think my interest is a joke and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? t drink , etc . They aren ? t the kind of people that always drink and party but occasionally they drink , and I can ? t get involved with that , plus , they just don ? t understand and I am finding it hard . I really wish I was surrounded by people who would constantly remind me of Allah . My family kind of know I have converted , but I said it in passing , and I don ? t pray yet ( another problem .. it ? s too difficult . I am at school during 3 of those and I can ? t skip class so I will have to make up for them and just .. argh ) . Anyway , my family are okay with it .. not happy , but okay ? my mother is a Christian ( but not practicing ) and my brother an atheist . Today has been an awful day , I feel tension between my friends and I , and tension within myself due to my constant sinning ( i.e I don ? t treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change .. lying etc ) . To make matters worse , our very new little puppy might die .. he doesn ? t have much chance and we love him so much ? . I told my brother I would pray for the pup , but he said ? God doesn ? t exist ! ! ! ? ? I get very frustrated . Even though I know God exists I sometimes begin to doubt since everyone around me doesn ? t believe . I am feeling so lost and stressed out right now . They are just a few of my issues . HELP ? please .. EDIT : My puppy died yesterday .. is there really a God .. seriously Rebecca xxx <h> Re : Help : ( <p> Congratulations on your recent conversion to Islam . May Allah make it easier for you and give you the correct knowledge of this beautiful religion and the ability to practice it in comfort . Ameen <p> Firstly , you must move away from your non-Muslim friends . If they are inviting you to things like alcohol and other sinful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick to your Muslim friends , especially the one who invited you to Islam in the first place . <p> Sister , one thing you need to understand is that this religion is very easy . Allah does not burden a soul with more than it can bear . As for you missing prayers , this is not good . If you have already learned how to pray , then you are obligated to do so five times a day . Ask your teacher to excuse you from the classroom so that you may pray . Praying the fard only takes 3-5 minutes anyway , you wont be asking for much . They ca n't say no , you have a right to practice your religion and they cant stop you . <p> Secondly , you must treat your parents with utmost respect . <p> Say , " Come , I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you . He commands that you not associate anything with Him , and to parents , good treatment , and do not kill your children out of poverty ; 6:151 And We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother carried him , increasing her in weakness upon weakness , and his weaning is in two years .

You must treat both your parents with respect , and obey all their commands ( except those which go against Islam ) . This will make Allah very pleased with you . And of course I do nt have to tell you that lying is a major sin also . Why do you have to lie , they already know you are a Muslim , yes ? <p> What you should do is start studying this deen . Once you have a good foundation , start giving da'wah to your family . I know it must be hard for you , but if you do it with ikhlas , Allah will make it easier for you .

They were very few in number , and all were either poor or slaves . They were surrounded with kufr and shirk . Yet their Iman was so strong . You have you be like that with your family . Holding on to the deen in times of such hardship and negative influences will get you so much reward from Allah , insha-Allah ( God-Willing ) . <p> Undo your stress and frustrations by doing dhikr , reading the Quran , and the the life of the Prophet .

Welcome to the forum and congratulations on finding your way back to Islam .

We all have to part one day . Everyone around you was disappointing you but it seems you took solace in your puppy who was the only being that accepted you for who you are.Now he is gone , you are devastated . At this point I think it is imperative we find someone that you can go to talk to.All these pent up feelings , emotions and despondency is not going to do anyone any good , especially you . <p> Sister are there no muslimahs at your school whom you can befriend or anyone at the masjid , where you took the shahaadah , who you can talk to ? <p> Also , it is important you continue to be educated about Islam .

It 's sad to hear your puppy passed away , but then to question whether God exists is taking a few backward steps . Remember , Islam means complete submission and surrendering to the will of Allah . From Him we came and to Him we 'll be returning . He is our Rab which , means our lord , sustainer , cherisher and master .

##3860552 <p> Alhamdulillah , the masterplan for Masjid Ilyas ( London Markaz / Riverine Centre ) was submitted on 5th Spetember 2012 . They are now in the last stages of the planning application . therefore Newham Council have started a PUBLIC CONSULTATION . <p> No matter what school of thought you follow ( if any ) and what opinions you hold with regards to Tabligh Jamaat , i call on the Ummah to stand side-by-side with fellow Muslims ( yes TJ 's are Muslims ) and unite in the face of opposition from Newham Council , politicians , journalists and other prominent non-Muslims . Those who oppose Islam do not distinguish which school of thought you follow , they oppose Islam , full stop ! <p> Newham Council have a very hostile policy to Muslims when it come to planning permission for Masjids , Islamic schools , etc . They have been clear policies of ensuring Islamic institutions do not thrive in their area .
