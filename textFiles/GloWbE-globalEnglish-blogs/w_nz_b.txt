##3780252 <p> When Sarah ' Inkymole ' Coleman received an email with ' Playboy ' in the subject line , she almost deleted it as spam . However , it turned out to be an approach to be the first illustrator to work on the cover of the American men 's magazine for 23 years - and the first ever to get to redraw the iconic logo . We caught up with Coleman to find out more about the project - and get an exclusive peek at her work in progress , <p> NB : What in your portfolio do you think attracted them to you ? <p> SC : " They told me exactly what clinched it for them - my covers for Sight &; Sound magazine , where they would send me the cover , usually with a film actor on it , and I would annotate round it . " <p> NB : What was the brief ? Did you have the photo or a comp guide ? <p> SC : " I was actually sent nine possible photographs from the shoot . The final cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know until Hugh Hefner , the owner , had made his decision at the last minute . He is still extremely involved in the running of the magazine , and so it would be up to him to choose .

" <p> NB : Did you draw inspiration from any of the illustrated Playboy covers from over two decades ago ? <p> SC : " I did have a scout around , yes . But I did n't want to be distracted - Playboy art director Mac was very specific about the style of my work that he liked , so I did n't want to move away from that , especially given the tight timescale .

##3780951 <h> Do You Have a History of Diabetes ? <p> There can be little doubt that diabetes is a growing problem , and more and more men and women are finding themselves faced with the serious health challenges a diagnosis of diabetes carries with it . Diabetics face an increased risk of circulation problems , vision problems , cardiac issues and other serious complications . It is important , therefore , for those newly diagnosed with diabetes , as well as those who have been living with the disease for years , to understand the disease and how it can be kept under control . There may be a history of diabetes in your family , if there is , you need to be regularly tested to ensure you stay healthy . <p> The testing process for diabetes is straightforward enough , but it is important for patients to understand how the disease is diagnosed as well as what treatment options are available . Diabetes is broken down into type 1 and type 2 , with type 1 representing childhood diabetes and type 2 representing the adult onset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed world continues to struggle with problems related to obesity and poor diet , adult onset diabetes is being seen in younger and younger men and women and increasingly in children and teenagers as well . <p> No matter what the type , the symptoms that lead diabetics to initially seek treatment are very similar . Typical symptoms that suggest a diagnosis of diabetes include excessive thirst , frequent urination and unexplained weight loss . These symptoms may worsen over time , prompting those affected to seek medical assistance . <p> Routine screening for adult onset diabetes is recommended as part of the standard medical examination for those with a number of risk factors that may predispose them to the disease . These risk factors include a family history of diabetes , obesity , poor diet and smoking . Those who may be at risk should be sure to share this information with their doctors in order to develop an effective screening program . <p> There are a number of tests used by medical professionals to screen for diabetes , including the fasting blood glucose test , the glucose tolerance test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients to discuss the pros and cons of each of these methods , as well as their specific risk factors , in order to determine the best course of treatment . <p> The criteria for determining whether or not a particular patient is diabetic is quite specific , but the exact blood sugar reading that indicates a diagnosis of diabetes will be different depending on the exact type of test performed . After the testing has been completed and the results received it is important for each patient to discuss his or her results with their family doctor . A thorough understanding of the underlying disease condition is the first step toward effective treatment . <p> For many clinicians the fasting plasma glucose test is considered the gold standard of diabetes testing , and many doctors will utilize this test in order to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of diabetes made through the random glucose testing method . A glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher made through a fasting glucose test indicates a diagnosis of diabetes . <p> Another excellent test for diagnosing diabetes in children and adults is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of glucose is administered orally and the patient 's blood plasma glucose level is taken two hours later . A plasma glucose level at or above 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes is present . <p> Random blood glucose testing is frequently used to rule a diagnosis of diabetes in or out , as well as to keep track of blood sugar levels in those with a confirmed diagnosis . A random blood glucose level of at or above 200 mg/dL typically indicates that diabetes is present , although the doctor may order one of the other two tests in order to confirm that diagnosis . <p> This confirmation is particularly important when clinical symptoms such as increased thirst , unexplained weight loss , frequent urination and blurred vision have not been reported . Diabetes is a chronic condition with lifelong implications for the patient , and it is important for physicians to make a confirmed diagnosis before ordering treatment and lifestyle changes . Repeated blood sugar testing may be ordered , particularly if the original readings were borderline . <p> There is no doubt that a diagnosis of diabetes is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the medical community are so careful about making and confirming such a diagnosis .

From diet and lifestyle changes to better medications , there are plenty of avenues for diabetes to explore . <p> We have all kinds of advices for all kinds of diabetic patients from Type 1 Diabetes to Gestational diabetes and through your persistence and your will to live a vibrant and healthy life , and through our death-defying , undying and endless efforts , we can work hand in hand to prevent this from getting worse .

##3786251 <h> Microsoft updates roadmap for Windows Embedded <h> Vendor eyes new homes for OS in ATMs , Kiosks and other devices <p> Microsoft plans to release Windows Embedded Standard 8 next March , as the company aims to bring Windows 8 features to a whole host of devices outside the PC , including ATMs , information kiosks , advertising displays and even industrial machines . <p> On Thursday , Microsoft introduced a new roadmap for the next versions of its Windows Embedded family of products . As part of that roadmap , the company will release Windows Embedded Compact 2013 in next year 's second quarter . The upcoming version of Windows Embedded Enterprise has also been renamed to Windows Embedded 8 Pro , and will launch in March . <p> Microsoft is best known for its PC-based Windows operating system , but the company is also a major player in the market for software for " intelligent systems " . These can include everyday devices that contain processors connected to a network , such as store checkout systems , digital signs , smart TVs , and manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such devices were limited by their processing power , and some had no need for a complex operating system . But as chips have become faster and the technology more advanced , common household electronics , work tools and industrial machines are becoming more powerful computing devices . Already , the intelligent systems market generates more than US$1 trillion in revenue , according to research firm IDC . By 2015 , that figure that will double to over $2 trillion . <p> " This is phenomenal opportunity us , " said John Doyle , director of product management for Windows Embedded during a news conference . " Our goal in the Windows Embedded team is to extend Windows 8 to industry specific devices . " <p> Devices built with the next versions of Windows Embedded can leverage its improved user interfaces , opening the way for more touch or gesture-based controls . But the new versions also aim to pave the way for better data connectivity , linking each device remotely to a company 's network , so that its information can be securely sent back for use and analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Windows Embedded software products . Windows Embedded POSReady , which had originally been meant for the retail market , will be renamed Windows Embedded 8 Industry , and is meant to also serve healthcare , manufacturing , financial sectors . A beta release of it will be available in January . <p> Microsoft will also release another OS called Windows Embedded 8 Automotive . More details will be released early next year . <p> Microsoft already has 700 partners worldwide that use Windows Embedded , said Doyle in an interview . Some of these partners include electronics vendors Fujitsu , Huawei , NEC , along with industrial , financial and transportation firms . <p> The company decided to hold its Windows Embedded in Beijing , given that many Windows Embedded vendors , or likely about a third of its partners , are based in the Asia-Pacific region , Doyle said . <p> " Over the next number of years , by 2016 , almost one third of intelligent systems will be used in APAC ( Asia-Pacific ) region , " he said . " We think the APAC region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helping to lead in the market , as vendors in the country work to develop more intelligent systems for use in banks and in manufacturing , Doyle said . <p> " Our strategy is to evolve the ecosystem . The end customers , the end banks , the end retailers , they want a complete system , " he said . " The day of selling a stand-alone embedded appliance are numbered because fundamentally , in order to drive the insight and intelligence , the systems need to be connected . " <p> Microsoft is the largest vendor for commercially sold operating system software meant for embedded system devices , said Shane Rau , an analyst with research firm IDC . The market generates about US$1 billion in revenue , and Microsoft has a 40 to 45 percent share . <p> The company has mainly sold its Windows Embedded software for use in retail devices , like cashier systems or information kiosks . But the company has an opportunity as more market segments move to intelligent systems , which will require more powerful operating system software , Rau said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to grow the fastest in adoption . <p> " ( Rivals ) have spent years specialising in these markets , and they have an understanding of what 's suitable for a doctor , or for someone who manages a power plant , " he said .

##3789850 <p> Ex New Zealand Sevens star Zar Lawrence was back at Blake Park , Mount Maunganui last weekend for the 2012 Bay of Plenty Invitational sevens tournament . <p> Lawrence was also back in Bay of Plenty colours after playing for Northland at the same event last year . <p> It was a double blow for the sevens veteran . First he was dropped by the Bay of Plenty NPC team and then he was left out of the New Zealand Sevens team for the 2010-2011 season after 6 years of service . <p> It was good to see Zar back in Bay of Plenty colours and back playing sevens . The Bay will need all of his experience 
##3789851 <p> But the interest in this match is more about the development of Kenya under the tutelage of ex-England coach Mike Friday . While he has n't been there for very long ( 4 months ) , Friday will be very keen to make a solid start to Kenya 's campaign . <p> I recall when Kenya beat England in the quarter finals of the 2010 USA Sevens -- the first time it was played in Las Vegas . The Kenyans had great support and scored in extra time the game to beat England who looked a little out of sorts on their first outing on the narrow playing surface at Sam Boyd Stadium . <p> Kenya score the winning try against England in the Quarter final at the 2010 USA Sevens in Las Vegas <h> 2 . Samoa v Spain <p> Spain are the up-and-comers of world sevens . <p> Samoa have once again lost key players over the off-season including their strong running forward Alafoti Fa'osiliva and Ken Pisi in the backs.So this will be a good test of where Samoa are at in their re-build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for Spain but it would be unwise to under-estimate the Spaniards who play an excellent brand of sevens and have try-scoring capability out wide . <h> 3 . Argentina v France <p> This is always a keen match up . Terry Bouhraoua is back for France and when he is on song with team mates Paul Albaladejo and Renaud Delmas in the backline , France can cut up any defense . But things can also go the other way and Argentina have capable players of their own . <p> Expect the forward exchanges to be full of venom . <h> 4 . Wales v Portugal <p> Portugal did not finish last season as strongly as Spain despite being more known in sevens circles . They had played consistently up to Hong Kong and did enough to qualify for the top 15 for this season but they did not really kick on to the greatest finish . <p> Wales have lost Harry Robinson to 15-a-side but they should be very strong up front with Rhys Shallard and Richie Pugh and an experienced looking squad . <h> 11 . Argentina v Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 2 very physical sides . <p> It should also be a great battle among the creative little men , Pedro Leal of Portugal and Diego Palma of Argentina . <h> 15 . Fiji v Tonga <p> Tonga beat Fiji at the 2012 New Zealand 7s in Wellington <p> There is no love lost between the Pacific nations . Tonga caused a great upset when they beat Fiji in pool play on Day#1 of the New Zealand Sevens back in February . <p> Unfortunately they did not qualify for the top 15 this year but did well enough in qualifying to bag the 16th place at both the Australia and New Zealand events . <p> Fiji are without several of their stars from last season so it will be interesting to see how they line up . <h> 17 . Kenya v Spain <p> This should be a good match up of playing styles . Both teams use the width , moving the ball to create opportunities . Both have pace out wide and capable ball players . <p> This will be the real test of how far Kenya have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regularly saw them in the Cup Quarter finals on Day#2. <h> 19 . USA v Canada <p> It 's fair to say that Canada have had the measure of their neighbours in recent encounters . <p> It 's also fair to say that there is no love lost between the 2 countries in sport . <p> I remember a boil-over in Las Vegas a couple of years ago where Canada had a player sent off . <p> With Phil Mack back in the side , Canada may continue their winning ways but they will need to contain the USA wide men who are among the quickest in the world . <h> 21 . England v Samoa <p> This will be a real test of the new-look Samoa side . They have lost most of their recognised names from the last 2-3 years and must now re-build to mount a serious challenge for Olympic gold in 2016 . <p> I 'm told there are a couple of exciting prospects but they face one of the best prepared sides in the world at the moment . <p> Dan Norton and Mat Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Cracknell and Rob Vickerman will look to contain the Samoan forwards . <p> England should win this game to advance unbeaten and in good shape for their run at the Cup on Day#2. <h> 22 . Argentina v Wales <p> Argentina are as tough in sevens as they are in 15-a-side rugby . <p> But Wales look to be back to full strength with Shallard and Pugh leading the way up front and the experience of in the back line . <h> 23 . New Zealand v South Africa <p> New Zealand and South Africa met twice at the Hong Kong 7s in March . This time it might be the Blitzbokke 's turn <p> New Zealand have a new look squad for this tournament while South Africa have a familiar look . The challenge for Gordon Tietjens is to get 2-3 of the new players up to the speed and pressure of international sevens . <p> If he can do it , this will be a good match up . If not , the experienced players in the New Zealand team could start to feel the pressure and fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight edge in this match . <h> 24 .

##3789852 <p> The other upset news is that Wales were also pipped on points difference -- by France . Despite winning 2 of their 3 pool games , they too will be competing for the Bowl on Day#2 . <p> Richie Pugh tweeted : <p> Gutted ! To win 2 from 3 and miss out on the quarters shows how tight and tough this series is gon na be . <p> Wales stalwarts Richie Pugh and Rhys Shellard <h> Injuries were another talking point on Day#1 <p> Australia were wrapped to have Wallaby Luke Morahan back for their home event but the Queensland Reds wing pulled up within minutes of Australia 's first game . <p> English star and World Series top points scorer M at Turner got hurt in the first game of the day against Kenya <p> Also injured in that match was English forward Chris Cracknell who will be gutted after having just come back from a long layoff <p> New Zealand 's Mark Jackman suffered a wrist injury cutting the number of experienced players on the Kiwi roster to just 5 <p> Samoa 's speedster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first game against Spain <p> Tom Iosefo left the field against Spain after scoring a try in the corner . He did not make it back onto the field on Day#1 <h> 3 new speedsters emerge <p> We had heard about the pace of the USA 's new star Carlin Isles but it 's another thing entirely to see it in action . He easily went around New Zealand 's quickest man Gareth Williams-Spiers in the first match of Pool A. <p> US coach Alex Maggleby already had express pace in Rocco Mauer . His challenge now will be to sort out the defensive techniques and get these boys free in space -- although they do n't need very much of that to create opportunities . <p> Fiji are fielding an astonishing number fo uncapped players in this event . At least one of them is a star in waiting . Ratu Raitini is electric . He scored tries against Scotland and Australia in a 1-point loss nail-biter to close the day . We hope to see 
##3789952 <h> The End Of . com Dominance ? <p> Tuesday , September 25th , 2012 <p> Ever since the dawn of the internet , a digital real estate game has been afoot . Domain names are the addresses of websites , and just like the real world , prime addresses come at hefty prices . In 2009 , Insure.com sold for $16 million to QuinStreet -- an incredible sum for nine letters and a dot . Of course , back when the internet was fresh and new there were many more domains to choose from , and many have accrued in value . Even now , the unfortunate practise of " domain squatting " -- buying up loads of different domains and leasing/selling them to people if they wish to use it -- is common enough to be frustrating . If your favourite . com is n't available , it 's well worthwhile considering all your domain options . <h> Alternatives To . com <p> Depending on your business , there are a number of possible options . <p> . net -- The second most popular domain suffix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken or too expensive to buy . It 's neat , professional , and suits the IT and web industries in particular . Using . net often opens up new branding opportunities . <p> Country Extensions -- If your business is fairly localised , a country extension such as . co.nz or . com.au is an excellent alternative to . com . It will usually give you a much more diverse range of naming options , and it is trusted and understood by the markets in those countries to mean that it is a local business and not some faceless overseas corporation . <p> Alternative Extensions -- For some businesses , using an alternative extension such as . ly , . nu , or . me will create the right image for the brand , such as Lookbook.nu . This domain works because the target audience is web savvy young people -- for a more traditional business , the . com or . net may be a better investment . <p> Domain Hacks -- This is becoming one of the most popular new domain name styles due to its sheer freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web-oriented businesses as the average user still finds it difficult to fathom domains outside the usual format , but it produces extremely creative results . Domain Hacking means using the domain , sub domain and extension to create a word -- usually to do with the brand .

However " tens of thousands " of dollars worth of beams and bracing had already been installed at this stage -- preventing too much further damage . <p> Venture inside the immaculately presented house now and it 's hard to believe its interior floors , ceilings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new details such as wood panelling in the library , the grand stairway and upstairs landing ; and stunning plaster features including pillars , cornices and ceiling roses are so in keeping with the home 's original era . They could have been there over its lifetime . <p> The owners say one of the biggest challenges of the repair and renovation works has been to live amongst it -- something they would not attempt again . <p> For several weeks their well appointed , modern kitchen and extensive living area had no floorboards , revealing the black sand that lies beneath the home . <p> " We had to live in the hallway , set up with a fridge , a little table and chairs , and a microwave and toaster on a cabinet . We even used the Lladro cabinet as our pantry , " they said . <p> One of the builder 's more unpleasant discoveries during the repair works was that the box gully , where the home 's two roofs met was running the wrong way . When it came down , so did over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests , rotten water and mould . <p> Plaster dust was also a constant irritation for the owners , as was moving all their possessions and treasures from room to room as the works were completed over many months . <p> However the results of their discomfort are well worth it . <p> It 's hard to find the right superlatives to describe the home . A delicious visual feast perhaps ? <p> Every room is immaculately presented , with so many fine details in the decoration , treasures and artworks on display you need time to take them all in . <p> My favourite room was the gentleman 's library with its new wood paneling and polished floorboards perfectly evoking the grandeur of a bygone era . <p> This room was originally the waiting room of Dr Maxwell Ramsey , who built the home in 1904 to both live in and work from . <p> The formal dining , drawing room and new morning room downstairs are equally impressive . <p> Upstairs are four sumptuous bedrooms , each with its own modernised bathroom , a configuration that has led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest house at some point in the twentieth century . <p> A new wide verandah , complete with outdoor built in fire and dining and lounge settings has been added to the back of the house . This is a perfect space for entertaining -- something the couple likes to do often . <p> The home is surrounded by a vibrant cottage garden and extensive vegetable garden , both developed by the owners . <p> Apart from external paintwork , some minor repairs to cracks caused by the June and December quakes , and the renovation of one of the upstairs bedrooms , the works at Gracemere are complete . <p> " We have put so much into the house and have tried to do everything to the highest possible quality so it will last at least another 100 years.Canterburyhas lost so much heritage in the disaster which is

##3792650 <h> Environment vs economics : A fine balance <p> By Pattrick Smellie , November 5 , 2012 @ 2:21 pm <p> It 's tricky finding a balance between environmental causes and the bottom line . <p> Whether it 's the loss of Environment Minister Nick Smith or a new determination by the Key government to steamroll barriers to faster economic growth , there 's been a marked cooling in the government 's relations with the environmental lobby in its second term of government . <p> True , there 's always tension there . But in its first three years , the National-led administration produced a judicious mix of wins for the environment at the same time as building its growth agenda . <p> For all the furore over mining on conservation land , deep-sea oil exploration and enthusiasm for looser urban boundaries , National listened closely to the likes of the Environmental Defence Society , Guy Salmon 's Ecologic , and other ' moderate ' green lobbies such as Forest &; Bird and WWF-NZ . <p> These groups generally do n't count their victories in measures of television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resource consent challenges , legislation and regulation -- the endless war over little words with big implications . <p> The little word that 's causing the biggest rift is ' balance ' . <p> While the ideal of balancing economic and environmental benefits might seem obvious to the lay observer , the fact is that the concept of finding such balance went out the window in 1991 , with the passage of the Resource Management Act . <p> Instead , it has sought certain environmental bottom line protection , both on land in New Zealand 's deep ocean . <p> In the case of proposed reforms to the RMA , the recently published recommendations of the government-appointed Technical Advisory Group concluded that the the courts have been interpreting the RMA as a question of economic and environmental balance anyway . <p> Rather than reaffirm the original intent , the TAG suggests it would be better to change the law to reflect how it 's said to have operated in practice . In the process , more than 20 years of common law precedent will go out the window , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define what the new law means . <p> Naturally , this does n't greatly please environmental guardians who 've worked hard for years to find , ironically , the balancing point between vital protections and allowing the economy to develop . <p> The irony is perhaps greatest in the case of the Exclusive Economic Zone ( Environmental Effects ) Bill , in which a similar presumption in favour of balance has led to a highly public parting of the ways between the government and the EDS , WWF-NZ , Forest &; Bird , and Ecologic . <p> As EDS chair Gary Taylor has put it : " The scales are being tipped on land and in the oceans more towards developmental interests and away from environmental bottom lines . That trade off will always lead to more and more environmental loss . We need to establish what we want to protect first . Having done that , we can let the market generally rip . " <p> That was what Taylor had in mind when he led the charge for a regime to regulate resource exploitation in the EEZ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or development . <p> Yet the EEZ is where much of New Zealand 's potential future wealth lies . Out on the Chatham Rise , plans are advancing to mine phosphate nodules from the ocean floor by the end of 2014 . Off the west coast of the North Island , numerous players are well-advanced on initiatives to mine ironsands for export to the steel mills of Asia . <p> That 's not to mention the potential for deep-sea oil and gas exploration . These are all key parts of the government 's plans to dramatically lift New Zealand 's growth rates , so it 's hardly surprising it 's sought a regime that 's likely , on balance , to favour economic interests rather than the environment . <p> At the time of writing , the government was undecided on its approach on either the RMA or the EEZ . But given the government 's enthusiasm for faster growth , the trend is clear . <p> There 's just one problem : What if the new regimes do n't create the certainty businesses need to invest ? <p> The EEZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to environmental protection . <p> The real threat to the government 's growth plans may yet be the prospect of protracted litigation to re-establish exactly where the boundaries lie . <p> Pattrick Smellie is a Wellington journalist and founder of the BusinessDesk news service . <h> Share this on <h> Comments <p> I think the problem here is the framing of the issue as ' economy vs environment ' . I do n't believe they 're mutually exclusive , necessarily . <p> There are other ways to frame it , including ' economy&lt; -- &gt;environment ' , where we focus on technologies and ways of doing things which are environmentally sound and which serve up economic benefit , sometimes as a RESULT of being economically sound . GreenTech would seem an obvious example . <h> anne <p> The point that the ' powers to be ' seem to miss here is that you can have an ' evironment ' without an economy but you ca n't have an economy without an environment . New Zealand 's ' clean , green ' image is worth billions to our exporters yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the economic benefits with it . <p> Agree with both these points . The ' 100% Pure ' legacy is vital for the growth of the F &B; export sector and Tourism in particular , no matter how tenuous it is . The current government seem to have pitted economic progress against the environment , which is fundamentally flawed in its approach . <h> Andy Kenworthy <p> Agree with above . This whole discussion is too often based on faulty and out of date framing of ' balance ' - it too often translates as ' how much destruction , waste and pollution can we get away with ' . Imagine having a house and saying I am seeking a balance between willfully destroying bits of it , while redecorating the rest . Your neighbours would rightly think you were mad . The only viable long term future lies in finding where human well-being ( which is most definitely NOT the same as the economy as it is currently defined ) can exist in harmony with nature . <p> This particular phrase is brilliant : ' As EDS chair Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped on land and in the oceans more towards developmental interests and away from environmental bottom lines . That trade off will always lead to more and more environmental loss . We need to establish what we want to protect first . Having done that , we can let the market generally rip . " ' <p> The Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford ( INET ) led by Eric Beinhocker has published some great papers on how strict environmental protection regimes are beneficial for markets because they tend to constrict resources and encourage innovation . <p> Our focus on false dichotomies is a sad state of affairs . I 'm happy to not have economic ' development ' if it means that we trash the environment in the same way that I 'm happy that people are ( generally ) paid a fair wage , and that children go to school , rather than being paid a pittance or put to work at the age of four . <p> We 've got it backwards . Society frames what is and is n't acceptable regarding how they want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way around . Unfortunately , the calls of what are or are not acceptable do n't seem to be loud enough . <p> What do you URL <p> Comment <p> If you enter anything in this field your comment will be treated as spam <p> HTML will be removed .

##3794552 <h> Tuesday , August 17 , 2004 <p> And lo ... there was a return to bloggery ! Back from a very nice week off in sunny Northern California visiting my folks , and wrapping up the visit from my New Zealand in-laws all in one fell swoop . Had an excellent time introducing baby Peter to where I grew up , and traveling a 450-mile car trip with a 6-month-old was n't totally horrific , although there were a few moments where we were already planning my vasectomy ... The boy was excellent for the most part though , and everyone kept telling us what we already know , that he 's the cutest baby that ever was and ever shall be . <p> Hung out with my old high school pals Nathaniel and Lenka and their own children , connected with my newspaper buddies Keith and Rob , showed my in-laws the Gold Country and got to spend a lovely morning hiking solo along one of my favorite youthful haunts , the South Yuba River , going for a fine swim in those smooth , granite-boulder-laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 weeks or so after my in-laws arrived here in Oregon July 28 , but we all had a great time . Living up here in Oregon far from both our families , Avril and I kind of appreciate the time we do get to spend with them , particularly now that we have baby Peter . Weird now to get back to " normal " life with work , smelly cats and wee , stuffy house after a week in my parents ' cavernous abode . But came back Saturday night to a pile of mail , comics and newspapers to read and best of all , Avril wo n't have to wait too long to see her family again -- she and Peter get to fly over to New Zealand for a visit in January .

##3794750 <p> To update Tekkit to 3.1.3 , open Technic launcher . Click ' options ' . At the top of options select ' always use development builds ' . At the very top where it says ' Select Modpack build ' it should now show ' 3.1.3 1.2.5 Latest ' Click ' Ok ' . <p> When you click ' Login ' it should now ask you if you want to update . Click yes and wait . If it says ' Update Failed ' , click again until it works . <p> Enjoy <p> " Minds are like parachutes ; they work best when open . " - Lord Thomas Dewar <p> It looks like 3.1.3 is allot buggier than I thought . For now I have rolled the server back to 3.1.2 , and reset the map to just before the update . <p> For a more permanent fix we have a couple of options : 1 ) Stay on 3.1.2 for a while longer 2 ) Remain on 3.1.3 and remove the Nuclear control mod ( More items will vanish from the world ) 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally fixes most of the mod update problems ) <p> What do you guys think ? <p> Some Music A Great Quote : " Never memorize what you can look up easily " <p> Maybe we should stay on 3.1.2 . I do n't use the nuclear mod but know others do and would lose a lot of what they have been working on . If I lost my machine I would lose the current reason I play Tekkit and would be sad . <p> I also noticed a few more bugs/issues last night like auto chest sorting and project tables bringing up error messages although they were actually working . <p> Just my opinion . <p> " Minds are like parachutes ; they work best when open . " - Lord Thomas Dewar <p> over the last few days i have seen many potential new tekkians unable to join the sever due to the fact its version is outdated , I feel we should update to the latest version tekkit , I understand this means alot of work for current tekkians but it also means the benefit of a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so over the next week please let my self or nyvyn know if you are keen so sori can make the arrangements for the smoothest possible update , it would be good to let us know what is important in your current build b4 the change so we can try to accommodate it as best as possible . <p> In regards to noogan 's post is it possible to get an idea of what we would lose if we updated ? So far I understand that we would lose the nuclear control mod . I assume this means all things nuclear . The only user I know of who currently uses nuclear is iamtk so we will talk with him and see what he thinks . <p> I also noticed last time that a lot of items were disabled as being dangerous because they were able to bypass protection i.e. all rm tools and the tables that craft them . Can we get around this ? <p> Retrievulators were also disabled and disappeared . Would it be possible to allow them before the update so they do nt disappear as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistons they are a real nuisance to replace . <p> In terms of getting more players on Tekkit , I 'm with noogan . <p> Cheers nyvyn <p> " Minds are like parachutes ; they work 
##3796150 <h> Friday , October 12 , 2012 <h> How to be like Penny Lane from ' Almost Famous ' <p> Penny Lane , in my opinion is the best role Kate Hudson has played to date . After shining in this film she fell into the turbulent cycle of acting in trashy Rom-com 's where her bohemian spirit side is neglected in favour of the ditzy blonde stereotype . <p> Penny lane encapsulates how I wish I was as a sixteen year old . Carefree , bohemian and a confidence that seems inherent . She twirls around like hoards of groupies are n't gaping at her and smiles like she knows something you do n't . Lead guitarists drop at her feet . It 's just that easy . <h> 1 . Wear your hair in corkscrew curls <p> All killer 70 's girls did this . Rocking the curls screams ' I 'm Ziggy Stardusts 's illegitimate child and will out glamour you ' . Curls are also great to push behind your ear when your giving rockstars ' eyes ' or to let twirl around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with invitation to a far off destination <p> After meeting Will Miller for the first time , Penny Lane asks him to come to Morocco with him to assume alternate personas and start a new life . This little trick adds to her intoxicating nature . Inviting people you click with to join you on overseas adventure makes you seem deathly bohemian . What I like the most is at the end of the movie Penny actually ends up going there . She 's a free spirit with commitment . <h> 3 . Dance freely and when you want to <p> Director Cameron Crowe said his favourite scene of the whole movie was when Kate Hudson was dancing by herself in the abandoned Fever Dog venue . She 's all alone with stray ticker tape at her feet but she looks so perfect . Her dancing is slow and fluid . Disgustingly enchanting for everyone around her . <h> 4 . Know everyone even if only by acquaintance <p> Penny Lane looks very in the know as she goes around kissing all the Rock stars ' and entourage on the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reunite with and not only do you seem like a bubble of warmth but you will also exude sociality . Everyone wants to get to know the girl who somehow knows everyone . <p> 5 . Wear a shag jacket The jacket is Penny Lane 's identifying item . It keeps her warm with all those crochet crop tops she sports and exudes ' rock star girlfriend ' . You can chuck it over windows when you do n't want to be seen and be identified as ' that girl ' when sporting it . " I always tell the girls , ' never take it seriously . ' If you never take it seriously , you never get hurt , you always have fun and if you ever get lonely , just go to the record store

##3878550 <p> Comber is one of NZ 's most endearing singer-songwriters , and here 's his new , five-song EP , which provides solid evidence that the development of his craft is moving faster than release schedules can represent . ' New Day ' , musically , is the best evidence of this ; it 's a genuine pop song , with real drums and synthesisers and a melody you could almost sing . It 's even an iPhone app , for goodness sake . ' Young And In Love ' is a nice strum that perfectly balances the poignancy of the experience of falling head over heels with a reflection of sarcasm . ' Here I Go Again ' is another love song , of sorts , a close-up and somewhat pragmatic admission of extended immersion , with a lost-in-womb-liquid section that reflects the deep drift . ' Twin Insomniacs ' is a piece of nearly instrumental dirge-rock with a slightly nightmarish feel . You can imagine two estranged lovers wriggling unhappily beside each other through a long night/torment of the soul . Finally , a cover supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Car ' , the simplest and most carefree of songs on the EP . Comber 's voice is n't what you would call a virtuosic instrument , and comes perilously close to off notes at times , but he makes the most of his limitations , turning the humdrum into a thing of beauty and candid expression . His music , similarly , could easily succumb to the perils of jangle folk/pop , but never does , due to the transformative effect of studio graft . Best of all are his lyrics , which are n't complex , but are incisive and insightful . Oh , and
