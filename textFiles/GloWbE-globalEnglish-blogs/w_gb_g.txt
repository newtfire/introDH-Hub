I suspect we lost some ' none of the above ' voters to Ukip and some left-leaning liberals to Labour ( and many others who just did n't vote ) . To forfeit our deposit by barely more than a dozen votes added an extra ignominy ( although revived an old Liberal tradition ) . Though there is something practical we can do to lend a hand there ... <h> PCCs -- Lib Dems draw a blank <p> As for the Police and Crime Commissioner elections , well these were never likely to be Lib Dem success stories . According to the Police Federation there were only two areas out of 41 which the party would have won even if we had polled at the level we did at the 2010 general election : Avon &; Somerset and Dyfed-Powys ( where the party did n't field a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't manage even a solitary second place -- based on the 2010 results we would have been in second place in 20 regions . However , the extremely low turnout , combined with the presence of strong independent candidates , makes it impossible to extrapolate any useful data about a future Lib Dem general election performance . <p> The Police Federation estimated , based on recent opinion polling , that the Tories would win 21 PCC elections , Labour 20 . However , the current scores on the doors are Tories 15 , Labour 13 -- and 12 Independents ( Devon &; Cornwall has yet to declare ) . This truly was a day for Independents , especially when you add in the success of new Bristol mayor George Ferguson . <p> Now I have to say I have a general suspicion of ' Independents ' -- many of them are anything but , are often disappointed renegades who feel they 've not had the recognition they deserved from the political parties they used to belong to . Just slapping the label ' Independent ' on a formerly partisan person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( whatever that means ) . <p> HOWEVER ... I have to confess to being left just a little bit impressed by the success of so many independents in these elections . Yes , some of the public probably just put a cross next to the box marked ' independent ' in an unthinking knee-jerk kick against the mainstream parties . <p> But it does n't seem to me that 's the best explanation for their success -- rather that small proportion of the public which voted seems to have taken the time and trouble to look up the backgrounds of the candidates in order to vote for who they thought would be the best qualified candidate . We may disagree with their choice , but I 'm actually quite heartened that it was n't a case of voters automatically picking their usual party . <p> What seems to have happened is that the mass franchise electorate was whittled down to a perfectly formed selectorate : a few voters taking an active interest not being drowned out by the larger number of voters with minimal interest . I 'm conflicted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so few citizens used their right to vote ( even if to spoil their ballot ) . On the other hand , encouraged that many of those who did engage have taken their responsibility seriously . <p> Of course come the next general election , when voters face the choice of electing their local MP and national government , we will almost certainly see a reversion to the norm : the public will return to mainstream parties . But every election which unwinds their usual partisan certainties stretches voter allegiance a little more thinly than before . And that 's a big , big challenge to the main three political parties . <p> The majority of high-achieving A-level students at comprehensive schools and colleges do not apply to top universities , often due to a lack of confidence in their academic abilities , a major government-commissioned report suggests . <p> Good students who choose less prestigious institutions are also often concerned about the cost of living , distance from home and the job prospects associated with a course , the study found . <p> Researchers analysed the university applications of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , and interviewed a sample to find out their motivations . Only four in 10 comprehensive pupils applied to research-intensive Russell Group and 1994 Group universities . The report revealed that pupils who had not applied to top institutions because of a lack of confidence in their abilities often came to regret their decision . <p> Here 's a date for your diary ... On 17th December , all LibDemVoice readers are invited to join us for festive drinks at 5pm in London , followed by ( for those who wish ) seeing Steve Richards ' Rock ' n Roll Politics Christmas Special . <p> Award winning BBC broadcaster and columnist , Steve Richards , takes you behind the scenes of British Politics and the media , the characters , the absurdities , the tragedies . Laugh and cry as you are taken on a whirlwind tour from Harold Wilson and David Bowie in the 1970s to David Cameron , Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband , via Paul McCartney and Tony Blair . A hit show at the 2012 Edinburgh Festival : Politics and the media all shook up ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to meeting up with LibDemVoice readers for a festive drink at 5pm before the show starts at 7pm . It 's all happening at Kings Place in London ( near Kings Cross / St Pancras ) . Members of the LibDemVoice team are currently undertaking the arduous task of testing which of the nearest hostelries would be best . <p> A reminder of how to let us know you 're attending ... You can sign up for drinks on our Facebook page here , or via FlockTogether here . Looks like there will be a merry throng of us there , but always room for more <p> To book tickets for Steve Richards ' Rock ' n Roll Politics Christmas Special please click here . There 's still a fair few free , but I guess they 'll sell out before the night so book early to avoid disappointment ! <p> Here 's a few reviews of Steve Richards ' Edinburgh show to whet your appetites ... <p> ... in a wide-ranging , relaxed hour , which kicks off with the question " is the coalition dead ? " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving together lobby gossip , acute analysis and autobiography with questions from the floor.Topics change daily depending on the news and interests of the audience . It 's like Question Time without the annoying tub-thumping . <p> At a time when public outrage and displeasure with those from the world of journalism is growing , here is a seasoned political reporter telling it like it is . Others should follow where Richards is leading . When ever more young comics are trotting onto stage with nothing but hackneyed pseudo-banter ( what is it you do ? ) or uninteresting self-analysis ( like they 're are the only person ever to have a 2 year old , or to feel aged before their time ) , Richards is a breath of fresh air -- someone with something to say and the charm to say it well . It 's non-threatening but neither is it edgeless . <p> In his show , Richards -- who spurned the opportunity to form a double act with the comedian Harry Enfield when the pair were at York University together -- argues that comedy is widening disengagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of bastards , ho ho ho , are n't we funny ? ' is dangerous , because it fuels an anti-politics mood . " He also believes the relationship between politics and comedy has changed fundamentally since the 1960s satire boom . " I do n't think the old dynamic works any more , because the satirists are wealthier and more powerful than the politicians they are taking the piss out of . You know , ' John Prescott 's fat and ca n't speak English very well , ' from somebody who earns 20,000 an appearance on Have I Got News For You ? and edits Private Eye , and so is more powerful than Prescott ever was , that 's not very funny . " <p> And just for the record -- here 's how I voted last night . First time I 've ever had opportunity to use the ' supplementary vote ' to add a second preference -- and I found it very hard to decide . I was almost tempted just to vote Lib Dem only ( John Howson ) -- but feel that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end voted Labour second ( Tim Starkey ) because of his belief in restorative justice ( ie , the stuff that works rather than the right-wingers ' ' just lock em up ' belief ) . <p> Lib Dem Voice polled our members-only forum recently to discover what Lib Dem members think of various political issues , the Coalition , and the performance of key party figures . Some 550 party members have responded , and we 're publishing the full results . <h> 61% support -- with reservations -- Coalition 's economic policies <p> LDV asked : The UK economy recorded growth of +1.0% in the third quarter of 2012 , officially bringing the recession to an end . However , many economists including the governor of the Bank of England have warned that recovery will be a slow , faltering process . Which of these is closest to your view : <p> 61% -- The Coalition Government 's economic policies , though not perfect , are the best option available for sustained economic growth in the UK in the long-term 32% -- The Coalition Government 's economic policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession , and will mean the recovery is more painful than it needed to be 8% -- Do n't know <p> By an almost 2:1 majority Lib Dem members back the Coalition 's economic policies -- though not without reservations . A sizeable one-third , however , believe the Coalition has been mistaken , jeopardising the UK 's recovery . It 's worth remembering that Lib Dem members in previous surveys have backed a ' new approach ' to boosting economic growth , broadly continuing with public spending cuts but investing in capital infrastructure . <p> Here 's a sample of your views : <p> The coalition government policies have aided growth , but they are not the best option available . However , neither have they contributed to the double-dip <p> Our lack of investment in areas with economic multipliers i.e education and infrastructure is worrying but the rate of cutting has been fine . <p> I 'm in between the two options ; but I think more could have been done much faster for building , the voluntary sector could have been better protected and not enough was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . <p> BUT -- could do so much better . And recent policy strands being floated suggest policy will get worse not better . Our influence seems to be waning fast . <p> They should use the low borrowing rates to invest in the future . All it is good at the moment is helping people with tracker mortgages and destroying peoples savings . <h> 92% of Lib Dems oppose Osborne 's shares-for-rights scheme <p> LDV asked : In his speech to the Conservative party conference , George Osborne announced a new equity ownership scheme , targeted at small companies . It would offer employees shares in their business ( from 2,000 to 50,000 , Capital Gains Tax free ) in return for giving up certain employment rights . This will not apply to existing employees , but both established companies and new start-ups can choose to offer only this new type of contract for new hires . Some key protections like those against discrimination will remain as well as the wide range of reasons for unfair dismissal , such as refusing Sunday work . What is your view ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I support the proposed new scheme but only if it is entirely voluntary for employees to opt in to 65% -- I oppose the proposed new scheme 4% -- Do n't know <p> Despite Vince Cable 's best efforts here on LDV to persuade Lib Dems that George Osborne 's shares-for-rights scheme is a good ' un , the view of members is clear-cut : two-thirds oppose it outright , and a further quarter would only support it if it were truly voluntary for all employees to be able to opt in . Just 1-in-20 party members support the scheme as proposed . Here 's a sample of your views : <p> I am totally opposed to this scheme . It will affect many young and economically unaware people who will only discover the value of the ' certain employment rights ' they gave up much later when it is too late to do anything about it . <p> If a company is going to make someone redundant , it 's likely that this is because the company is n't doing so well , what sort of cushion is shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making it entirely voluntary for employees to opt in , when the job market is this thin . Also the scheme does n't even work -- the people who would make pernicious claims have plenty of other legislation to make them under anyway -- only people who would be making legitimate claims would suffer . <p> Employees should have the opportunity to buy into the company they work for and they should not have to give up other rights to do so . <p> Wider ownership is a good thing but it 's not a quid pro quo for employment rights <h> 2:1 majority of Lib Dems opposed to Council Tax relief cut <p> LDV asked : As part of the Coalition Government 's existing welfare cuts , Council Tax relief is being reduced and local authorities are being given the power to set their own eligibility criteria from April 2013 . The Government has earmarked 100m -- a quarter of the amount it had hoped to save in the first year of the scheme 's operation -- for councils that promise to limit the sums poorer people must pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , half of councils are proposing to set the minimum payment at 20% of the full Council Tax or more , while about another quarter plan to set it at between 10-20% . What is your view ? <p> 28% -- I support the Coalition 's proposals on Council Tax benefit 48% -- I oppose the Coalition 's proposals on Council Tax benefit 24% -- Do n't know <p> Though Lib Dems oppose the measure by an almost 2:1 majority interestingly 24% said ' Do n't know ' , which suggests that , at least for now , this issue is below the radar of many -- though not Lib Dem peers . Here 's a sample of your views ... <p> Once again it is the poorest being asked to bail out the rich who got us into the mess and still are not sharing the pain sufficiently . <p> I think this is going to get very messy -- Labour run authorities will do everything in their power to make sure the poorest will pay the maximum possible -- Blaming it on the coalition , while they spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this means more decision making is being devolved to local councils -- localism in action ? <p> The proposals to decentralise CT benefit , while at the same time dictating how it should be decentralised with certain ring-fences is a dangerous combination . <p> Devolution should n't be a cost-saving measure , but done because it 's a good idea in itself . <p> Over 1,200 Lib Dem paid-up party members are registered with LibDemVoice.org . Some 550 responded to the latest survey , which was conducted between 28th and 31st October . <p> Please note : we make no claims that the survey is fully representative of the Lib Dem membership as a whole . However , LibDemVoice.org 's surveys are the largest independent samples of the views of Lib Dem members across the country , and have in the past offered accurate guides to what party members think . <p> Election day is usually a day when , if you 're at all interested/involved in politics , the pulse quickens , the blood pumps faster , the adrenaline kicks in . With all due respect to the sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and naturally with very best wishes to those Lib Dems flying the party 's flag in England ) today just does n't feel right. * In fact , it feels like a damp squib . <p> I think that 's a shame for two reasons . <p> First , voting matters . It 's perhaps the purest , most powerful way in which an individual can show their commitment to engaging in society -- because while my vote on its own almost certainly wo n't matter , our collective votes will . There is a humility and respect in voting , a recognition that all citizens are equal and that those who govern us have legitimacy only once they have persuaded a critical mass of their peers . Lots of people use lots of excuses for not voting . I 've heard them all and have zero time for any of them . ' Decisions are made by those who show up . ' <p> Secondly , these posts matter . I 'm a rarity among Lib Dems : I support elected PCCs as a way of introducing clear public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a rarity ? Because our recent survey showed just 15% agree with my view . Yet agree or disagree with the principle , everyone accepts these posts will have real power , so we should -- all of us , not just the few of us who are weird obsessives inhabiting political blogs -- absolutely care what happens and who gets elected today . <p> Alas , turnout is predicted to be low , perhaps just 15% . If that forecast becomes reality expect plenty of people to question the democratic mandate of the elected PCCs , though I 'd be surprised if , once established , the posts were scrapped . There 's only one thing more controversial than introducing new forms of democracy and that 's abolishing existing democratic structures . <p> We can predict that low turn-outs will see fingers pointed at the Lib Dems -- it was our party , after all , who insisted on delaying the elections six months beyond the usual first Thursday of May , to mid-November , ostensibly to separate the vote from the more party political local polls taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thumbing our noses at the Tories ' insistence on the creation of these posts , though the shabby result is likely to be depressed turnout . <p> But the bigger slice of blame should attach to Tory ministers , who fearful these elections would be tainted as an extravagant vanity project , refused to permit freepost election addresses to candidates contesting these elections . I do n't suppose I 'm by any means alone in having received not a single leaflet from any of the six candidates standing in Thames Valley , where I live . There are certain basic requirements for a functioning democracy and allowing candidates the opportunity to tell voters their policies is a basic one . <p> * NB : voters in Corby , Cardiff South &; Penarth and Manchester Central at least have the excitement of a traditional British by-election to get their juices flowing , a prospect I 'm sure all denizens of said communities have alighted on with alacrity . <p> Lib Dem Voice polled our members-only forum recently to discover what Lib Dem members think of various political issues , the Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 550 party members have responded , and we 're publishing the full results . <h> 44% of party members back ' No more Page 3 ' <p> LDV asked : The ' No more Page 3 ' campaign was recently launched urging The Sun 's editor to drop pictures of topless women from the newspaper . What is your view ? <p> 10% -- I support the ' No more page 3 ' campaign and would also support government regulation ( either an outright ban or restrictions on the sale of newspapers/magazines publishing such pictures ) 44% -- I support the ' No more page 3 ' campaign but would not support any government regulation 29% -- I neither support nor oppose the ' No more page 3 ' campaign 15% -- I oppose the ' No more page 3 ' campaign 1% -- Do n't know <p> Overall , there 's clear majority support for the recently launched ' No more page 3 ' campaign : a total of 54% ( options 1 and 2 ) support it . However , there 's also a clear majority against any move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun and other publications : a total of 59% chose options 2 and 4 . A substantial minority , 29% , chose the option of neither supporting nor opposing the campaign . <p> However , it 's clearly a issue were the two sexes have different views , as this table reveals : <p> Women <p> Men <p> I support the ' No more page 3 ' campaign and would also support government regulation ( either an outright ban or restrictions on the sale of newspapers / magazines publishing such pictures ) <p> 21% <p> 8% <p> I support the ' No more page 3 ' campaign but would not support any government regulation <p> 52% <p> 43% <p> I neither support nor oppose the ' No more page 3 ' campaign <p> 18% <p> 32% <p> I oppose the ' No more page 3 ' campaign <p> 7% <p> 17% <p> Do n't know <p> 1% <p> 1% <p> I need to add a caveat to this data . Responses to our surveys are heavily skewed towards men . On most issues this seems to make little difference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of female Lib Dem members and male Lib Dem members do not appear to differ significantly on political issues . I suspected they might on this topic , though . However , the numbers of women who responded ( c.100 ) mean the data is more prone to sampling error than is the case with our overall sample size of c.550 . <p> That caveat inserted , it 's noticeable what a difference there is between the views of the women and men who answered . Women are far more likely to be in favour of banning/regulating Page 3-style material than men ; men are far more likely both to oppose the ' No more Page 3 ? campaign than women and far more likely to declare themselves neutral . <p> However , the single most popular option for both women and men is the position of the campaign : for The Sun voluntarily to drop Page 3 without formal government intervention . Here 's a sample of your views ... <p> I believe the paper needs to have a change of heart ; however I believe that change of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is not called for in this instance . <p> Page 3 has effects in society far beyond the issue of newspapers being able to print what they want . When we have a truly liberal society that does n't denigrate and subjugate women , we can then let national newspapers print pictures of bare breasts . <p> During an industrial placement as a young student I was constantly tormented by older man comparing my body with today 's page three girl . I was the only young woman brave enough to go on the shop floor . It was a hideous , terrifying experience and made normal work difficult . <p> page 3 is now more a quaint tradition than much else , a mature approach to accepting modern attitude to sex &; at the same time respect to each other , will not be achieved by banning a sexy type of picture , of either women or men <p> Another piece of silly nannying that treats voters like children . <p> Four countries in the world have nude models in their papers . I am not against topless modelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children to view ( b ) it 's contribution to the sexualisation and objectification of women and ( c ) it being considered news . Not to mention the dire dire misogyny and gender divides it breeds . <p> I think newspapers should be entitled to print pictures of topless women , but that the particular case of the Sun doing it and making them mouthpieces for their editorial opinions is repugnant . It is a matter for consumer pressure rather than for government regulation , however . <p> Page 3 = very bad . ( And one of many good reasons never to buy the Sun . ) But government banning/restricting it would be so much worse . We 're a liberal party , right ? <p> I am deeply disappointed that Nick Clegg has refused to sign up . The campaign is not calling for a ban -- it is calling for The Sun to decide of its own volition that public opinion is against this use of naked women . Nick has missed the point completely <p> Newspapers publishing ' page 3 ? pictures should be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adult ' categories . When their sales began to fall they would soon stop publishing such pictures . <p> Over 1,200 Lib Dem paid-up party members are registered with LibDemVoice.org .

Some 550 party members have responded , and we 're publishing the full results . <h> 7-in-10 say new fees system is fairer than old <p> LDV asked : Overall do you think the new tuition fees system introduced by the Coalition Government is fairer or less fair than the system it replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Do n't know <p> A substantial majority of Lib Dem members in our survey say the new system introduced by the Coalition is fairer than the fees system it replaced , introduced by Labour . <p> This finding comes with three important caveats . First , many of those who said it 's fairer than the old system were clear in their comments that they did not believe it was the fairest system possible ( although many acknowledged it may have been the fairest that was achievable within the constraints of Coalition ) . Secondly , many said the way the new fees system had been presented both by the Government and by its opponents meant that , even if it 's fairer , potential students may well still be put off going to university as a result . And thirdly , that regardless of its fairness the Lib Dems are long going to have the millstone of ' that pledge ' round our necks . <p> Nonetheless , that 70% of current members reckon the system is fairer suggests that the issue is less about the merits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's a sample of your views : <p> It genuinely does n't matter how it 's structured , it is a substantial debt with which to begin life ; meanwhile we need more skilled people in order to ensure our economy is viable . A deterrent has been inadvertently created and this is a tragedy . <p> The new fees are fairer , not that we 'll get any credit . The fact that we pledged to do something then immediately did the opposite has brought our party into disrepute . <p> Loaded question , it might be more affordable and is probably quite a reasonable system . Fair would depend on your own circumstances . <p> As someone who will be paying back my future tuition fees under the new system , it looks much better to me ! <p> It 's fairer -- but sold very badly . If it had been labelled as a tax , it would have gone down a lot better . <h> Majority of members say drop commitment to scrap fees <p> Current Lib Dem policy remains to scrap tuition fees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next general election as it will not be seen as credible to the public . Other members say the right to free higher education is a crucial Lib Dem policy and should be retained , even if it is unlikely to be implemented while in Coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour . What is your view ? <p> 51% -- I think we should drop the party 's commitment to scrap tuition fees 43% -- I think we should keep the party 's commitment to scrap tuition fees 6% -- Do n't know <p> A clear but narrow majority ( 51% ) of Lib Dem members in our survey think the party should drop its long-held commitment to scrapping tuition fees in the light of the U-turn on fees within Coalition . However , a very substantial minority ( 43% ) argue the party should keep the commitment . In effect , the party is split on the issue -- an issue which will become a major subject for debate at next year 's autumn conference ( somewhat ironically being held in Scotland , where the system does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anti-fees stance ) . <p> Interestingly , there is very little difference between the views of voting conference representatives and all other party members -- if anything , those who are eligible to vote appear to be slightly more inclined to drop the commitment : <p> Current voting representatives <p> All other party members <p> I think we should drop the party 's commitment to scrap tuition fees <p> 57% <p> 52% <p> I think we should keep the party 's commitment to scrap tuition fees <p> 43% <p> 45% <p> Do n't know <p> 6% <p> 6% <p> Here 's a sample of your views : <p> Keep it -- BUT , we must make it absolutely clear how it is to be financed AND that we will not be able to implement it unless we have an overall majority . NO PLEDGE <p> We should replace ' scrap ' with ' reduce in the long term , as affordable ' . That would be much more credible . <p> This is the biggest " red line " issue for me : scrapping fees should be our Number 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should keep it -- but doing so would make us look more like idiots than dropping it . It is too difficult to explain . Either way it is going to be an issue . <p> Definitely drop this . The problem was caused by going into the last election with an unrealistic policy which the leadership tried to change . <h> Nick Clegg 's apology : 81% say he was right to say sorry , but majority think it 'll make no difference <p> Before the Lib Dem conference , Nick Clegg apologised for making and then breaking the pledge not to vote for tuition fees . Do you think he was right or wrong to apologise ? <p> 81% -- Right to apologise 15% -- Wrong to apologise 4% -- Do n't know <p> And what impact , if any , do you think Nick Clegg 's apology will have on public perceptions of him ? <p> 32% -- It will make it more likely the public will listen to him 54% -- It will make no difference 10% -- It will make it less likely the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the downside , more than half ( 54% ) even of Lib Dem members think the apology will make no difference ; on the upside , almost one-third ( 32% ) say it might get Nick more of a hearing from the public in the future . Just 1-in-10 think it will have backfired . <p> What does come across loud and clear in the comments are those who say ( 1 ) Nick 's apology should have been for breaking the pledge rather than making it in the first place , and ( 2 ) that it was too little , too late . Whether these views are based on personal perceptions , or on the basis of what the public is saying on the doorstep , I 'm not sure . Here 's a sample of your views ... <p> He should have explained that the scheme is the graduate tax everyone wanted but described in such a way that is harder for the rich to avoid than tax . He should have explained what progressive means . <p> It lacked sincerity . Both he and Vince were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place . They should , however , made it a red line issue in the Coalition Agreement . <p> I do n't think it made much difference , but was too little , too late . It would have been better to have supported the recent comments about the current scheme costing more by pointing out that it was in fact a good deal for students it was . <p> I guess right to apologise but the policy on fees is the right one . The massive political problem was the pledge which should never have been made . <p> I think he would have been damned if and whenever he did , and damned if he did n't ! <p> Over 1,200 Lib Dem paid-up party members are registered with LibDemVoice.org .

##24852 <h> The End of the Holy Roman Empire <p> The Holy Roman Empire had survived over a thousand years , when it was finally destroyed by Napoleon and the French in 1806 . <p> It may not have been holy or Roman or an empire , as Voltaire remarked , but whatever it was , it had survived for more than a thousand years since the coronation of Charlemagne in the year 800 . A motley medley of more or less independent kingdoms , lay and ecclesiastical principalities and free cities , it was finally destroyed by Napoleon and the French . <p> The process began when the German territories on the west bank of the Rhine were annexed to France in 1801 under the Treaty of Lunville , which the Hapsburg Emperor , Francis II , had no choice but to accept after the French victories at Marengo and Hohenlinden the previous year . The treaty provided for the German rulers who lost territory west of the Rhine to be compensated elsewhere in the empire at the expense of the ecclesiastical states . <p> East of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostensibly carried out by a committee of imperial princes , which redrew the map of Germany , drastically reduced the number of petty states , secularized or destroyed the ecclesiastical ones and abolished most of the free cities . The French intention was to create a cluster of satellite states beyond the Rhine , organized in a more rational and controllable fashion , and the effect was to cut the number of the imperial states from more than 300 to fewer than 100 and severely diminish the authority of the Hapsburgs . <p> The larger German states were not at all unhappy to swallow their smaller neighbours . Both Austria and Prussia acquired some extra territory in the reorganization of 1803 , but Napoleon made sure that the main gains went to states like Bavaria , Wrttemberg and Baden , which were not big enough to pose any threat to France . <p> In 1805 Austria joined yet another coalition of European powers against the French and at the end of the year Napoleon smashed the Austrian and Russian armies in battle at Austerlitz . He went on to organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence in the following July under his protection and in military alliance with France . Its ostensible leader was Karl Theodor , Freiherr von Dalberg , who was both Archbishop of Mainz and Grand Duke of Frankfurt . Sixteen German states joined the Confederation , which stretched from the Elbe to the Alps . It was a French vassal state and Napoleon announced that the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation no longer existed . The confederate states formally proclaimed their secession from the empire on August 1st and on the 6th the Emperor Francis bowed to the inevitable , renounced the imperial crown which his forebears had worn in virtually unbroken succession for almost four centuries since Albert II in 1438 and retreated into being Hereditary Emperor of Austria . <p> The French diplomat Talleyrand recommended a French-Austrian alliance which would dominate Europe , but Napoleon was not interested . Later in 1806 he routed the Prussians at Jena and took Berlin , where he decreed a blockade of British trade . Saxony saw the light and joined the Confederation of the Rhine . The insatiable Bonaparte went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome and coax or bully all the German states except Austria and Prussia to join the Confederation , where they found themselves under a far more ruthless master than they had ever known before . Napoleon sarcastically remarked that Germany was always ' becoming , not being ' , but in the long run , ironically enough , the consequence of his policies would be the stimulation of German nationalism and the emergence of a united Germany

##43552 between people are nothing new . Neither is the idea that ' markets are conversations ' . <p> We Are Social across the pond This week 's big news is of course that We Are Social has opened in New York , our eighth office worldwide . Those who have been following us since the beginning know that this has been a long time coming , and we ca n't wait to start making a difference for US based marketers . <p> However , although Twitter 's user numbers should double by 2014 , it will still have only a fraction of the users that Facebook does . <p> What to watch for on TV Not sure what to watch on telly tonight ? A new study says nearly 40% of Brits turn to social media to help them find the must-watch programmes of the evening . It underlines the ever-growing trend for dual-screen viewing . <p> Facebook 's ' Interests ' , check-in API , animation on tabs , mobile comments Facebook now allows users to add their interests to lists , and then and follow collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to Twitter lists , but more clearly , Google+ Circles . Facebook has had an option for lists since 2007 , but most of its users have n't used the feature . With Facebook now promoting celebrity-curated lists , they 're clearly pushing the features , like they did with Questions early last year . <p> In the first sign of the results of their acquisition of Gowalla , Facebook also wants to become the backbone of your location data through updated APIs that will let the locations sent from other apps live as a layer on your Timeline . Check-in services will be able to pull your friend 's check-ins -- from other services , perhaps -- and therefore create more chance of meetups . Nice . <p> In an update to pages , brands can now have animations and video that play on apps and tabs without the user initiating it , a departure from pre-Timeline policy . With an animation already playing , it should be easier for brands to drive engagement . <p> On the mobile front , Facebook app users can now like or comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new design . <p> Big updates coming to Twitter brand pages Taking a few notes from Facebook and the recent launch of Timeline for brand pages , Twitter is plotting more visual page updates for brands that are spending with the network . Although Twitter is still being hush-hush about specifics , rumour has it that soon e-commerce , contests and sweepstakes will be available directly from the site . Twitter is also continuing to improve its language options , adding Arabic , Farsi , Hebrew and Urdu last week , as it continues to try and further grow the userbase . <p> Today we are welcoming a very talented group from Posterous to Twitter . This team has built an innovative product that makes sharing across the web and mobile devices simple -- a goal we share . Posterous engineers , product managers and others will join our teams working on several key initiatives that will make Twitter even better . <p> Posterous Spaces will remain up and running without disruption . We 'll give users ample notice if we make any changes to the service . For users who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another service , we 'll share clear instructions for doing so in the coming weeks . <p> Google exec says : Maybe you 're just doing it wrong Google+ is no ghost town according to Vic Gundotra , a senior VP of engineering at Google . He countered the no-man's-land claims with stats about the network 's rapid growth , trumpeting 100 million active users over 30 days . Ca n't see what people are posting ? Maybe it 's their privacy settings . We ca n't help but be a little dubious . <p> On the plus side , if you do use Google+ and people +1 your content , Google is now encouraging users to say thank you . How cute . <p> Converting the location app Muggles Foursquare and the like were unsurprisingly quickly adopted by dedicated tech geeks , but now Foursquare wants to reach out to the average Joe Smartphone through specials and deals . The service hopes that partnerships with ubiquitous , everyday companies , will lead non-techies to its side . <p> AddThis has also let readers peek into its site analytics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth from Pinterest continues to skyrocket : <p> How long until Pinterest is up there with the likes of Twitter ? <p> Social TV app Zeebox gains 22,000 users during ' Dancing On Ice ' Phillip Schofield , the host of ' Dancing On Ice ' , tweeted about Zebox four times during last week 's show , and it gained 22,000 users as a result . However , Zeebox has been adding as many as 15,000 users an hour since the launch of its TV campaign anyway ... <p> Channel 4 ? s new channel with schedule based on online conversation Last week 's FT Digital Media Conference in London saw Channel 4 announce the launch later this year of a new channel -- called 4seven -- which will give viewers the chance to catch up on the most ' talked about ' shows from the previous seven days . As well as traditional media , this will also include social media buzz . Considering Channel 4 say the new channel will help to increase engagement with viewers , it seems likely that programming will be strongly influenced by online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save . American Express is letting customers get money off a selection of stores , by tweeting special offer hashtags from retailers including McDonald 's , H &M; and Best Buy . With the mechanic to get the discount so easy -- simply to retweet -- it 's unclear whether this is actually any good for engagement , but it 's still an interesting step in the social commerce path . <p> Walgreens launch barcode redemption on Foursquare Without wanting to get over-excited , Foursquare just become genuinely useful . For so long , it was nigh on impossible to redeem a special because cashiers in any large chain did n't understand what was going on . <p> Now , that 's all changed . Walgreens ran a special which created a barcode on the phone screen , which could be scanned like a normal product by the cashier , and thus work together with normal checkout systems . It might seem simple but it 's a genuine game-changer as far as mobile check-in apps are concerned . <p> bmi launch Pinterest lottery Pinterest is all the rage right now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinterest Lottery just seems a bit 2010 . They 've created five boards featuring five different destinations , each with nine pictures on them . <p> Users can re-pin a maximum of six pictures , and whoever has re-pinned that pictures goes in a draw for the chance to win a free flight . The problem with this : ' re-pin to win ' shows no real engagement with the brand -- it 's like ' RT to win ' on Twitter . It does n't feel very social . <p> On the 29th of February , Fanta posted a status update saying that the leap year day had thrown Fanta time out of kilter and four Fanta characters , Gigi , Lola , Floyd and Tristan had been brought into the past and hidden in the timeline . The first character hidden was Gigi ; users were given the clues to identify the year she was in , and then had to ' like ' an image of her to bring her back to the present . <p> Fanta -- with their 2.6 million fanbase -- asked for 1,956 likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 . The key takeaway from this is that while there 's definitely cool stuff to be done with Timeline , it might not drive as high engagement as expected . <p> Heinz launch another ketchup via Facebook Last year , we launched Heinz Limited Edition Ketchup with Balsamic Vinegar on Facebook and it went down a treat . This year we wanted to go one better , so before their new Limited Edition Ketchup went into supermarkets , we created a game where fans could either win a bottle of the new ketchup , or buy one . Without any media support , 50,000 fans played the game . <p> Users landing on the microsite are challenged to write the highest scoring ScrabbleTweet from a set of 100 random characters . Once you 're happy with your entry , you can tweet it for judgment : <p> Mars found not guilty by the ASA The Advertising Standards Agency published its adjudication into the celebrity sponsored tweets Mars purchased -- and concluded that Mars did not need any action taken against them , as the ' #spon ' in the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the previous four tweets were also sponsored . As crazy as this judgement seems , it sets an interesting precedent . <p> Red Cross launches social media operations centre The Red Cross have launched a social media operations centre , which should help them find victims in times of trouble and offer them help , as well as recruit volunteers . <p> If you liked this post , why not subscribe to We Are Social by email or RSS ? <p> Hi @wearesocial , thanks for mentioning our campaign for bmi . I 'd like to come back on some of your conclusions . <p> Travel is as you know one of the main Pinterest categories . By featuring and encouraging the sharing of destination photos , the idea is to inspire people to travel , and more to the point fly to one our highlighted bmi destinations . <p> The destinations change regularly , and the boards link back to a Tumblr ( **26;6411;TOOLONG ) , which features more content around bmi destinations . <p> As a result , it is engaging , on-brand , and social . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way , with the lottery mechanic adding an element of fun into it . It is certainly different to standard re-pin to win type competitions . <p> The proof however is in the results , which in the first ten days alone have included articles in the likes of Mashable , The Wall , PSFK , Shiny Shiny and Simply Zesty . We 've had a reach of 500k on Twitter , with 
##47352 <p> Should of never have been done in the first place , that 's where they were heading in You Only Live Twice but stopped short of Connery lifting off into outer space , to boldly go where no Ian Fleming character has gone before . <p> Unfortunately some 12 years later they actually succeeded with this nonsense and Bond of all things , gets into a space shuttle and chases after bad guy and we end up with a ludicrous star wars type shot out in the heavens . <p> Lasers or not , this idea should never see the light of day again , bottom line is you ca n't have James Bond 007 going up in a rocket and whizzing around space or whatever , it just isi n't the thing to do . <p> It depends on where they take the franchise . If they continue to modernise Bond , adjust the settings to the technology of tomorrow , one day - who knows - Bond in space may be hardly more than normal . However , if they retro Bond to the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , it still is a no-no from me at this very moment . <p> I think it can be done tastefully , especially if we consider Bond as being on the cutting edge of technology . I think the space setting could also lend itself to an interesting plot point dealing with the information technology and satellites . Imagine a villain who was able to control all the satellite signals : we 're talking ALL transmissions that affect communication by the major powers <p> I have no problem with Bond going into Space , only if CGI is n't involved . Bring back the good old ' retro filmmaking with miniature work . Space yes , but with clever filmmaking that do n't rely on the easy CGI route . <p> I would have no problem with a realistic space mission ( like going to the International Space Station and NO laser guns ! ) . The problam is : it is probably impossible to write a realistic Bond story set in space . I mean , why would a secret agent realistically need to go to space ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P But seriously , i do n't see it hapenning in the near future . They 've done it already , it 's been experimented , it did n't work all that well , let it be . <p> Far from . I despise the film and dislike Moore 's Bond enough to send him to the bottom of my Bond listings . <p> Coindcidentaly .. he 's at the top of my list . So yeah .. but bond really should n't ever set his foot near space again . It just does n't work , especially not with a more serious bond like Craig . We 'd really have to get back to the heavy fantasy/super-spy angle to even consider something like this . <p> I would have no problem with a realistic space mission ( like going to the International Space Station and NO laser guns ! ) .

Pah . <p> or yes this Bond should go into space in B23 and get sucked in by a big black hole . <p> What about a plot involving commercial space travel ? Or at least a villain doing it ? Bond villains are regularly written as billionaire industrialists , and Bond often meets them for the first time in a swanky location . What better model for a villain than Richard Branson and the meeting place to be a commercial spaceflight a la Virgin Galactic ?

##56152 <p> When you look at a cell under a microscope it is usually fairly easy to see its nucleus which shows up as dark body within the cytoplasm of the cell . The nucleus contains chromosomes made up of genes . The genes can be thought of as the " recipe book of life " because they determine the organism 's characteristics and all the chemical reactions which take place within its cells . <p> Accurate replication of the chromosomes is therefore vital if the new cells produced are to function effectively . <p> Unless a cell is about to divide , or is in the process of dividing , the chromosomes within its nucleus are not obvious . However , just prior to dividing , the chromosomes shorten and thicken and become more obvious . ( The name chromosome is derived from the Greek meaning " coloured body " ) . <p> Q. What do asexual reproduction , repair and growth in animals and plants all have in common ? <p> A. All produce new cells <p> Q. How are accurate copies of the cells made ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Single celled organisms often reproduce asexually by binary fission , or splitting into two . The two new organisms that are produced are identical to each other and to the parent cell . <p> In animals , growth takes place all over the animal 's body until it reaches full size . Cells in certain areas , such as the skin , still retain the ability to grow and divide . <p> In plants , growth occurs in specialised areas called meristems which are situated in the root and shoot tips . Cell division here results in increase in length . Meristem tissue between the phloem and xylem ( called cambium ) results in increase in the plant 's girth . <p> Mitosis is the mechansim involved in all these processes , it is the type of cell division 1 where 2 new cells are produced from a single cell .

##59451 <p> How do you know if you are ready to get married and more specifically if you are ready to marry that particular person ? <p> Do you really want to get married ? While there are some Muslims that do not want to get married most young single Muslims do . <p> Many young people want to get married because their friends are getting married or because " they are at that age " or because their parents are putting pressure on them to get married.Some want to get out of a difficult home life . <p> Some want to get married out of physical attraction , or because they are attracted to intellect , and money . Some young Muslims want to get married because they realize marriage was the tradition of Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings be upon him ) and they see marriage as a form of worship . Some who want to get married seek companionship , and the family stability that a healthy married life can provide . <p> There are of course those who at this point in their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be better to wait until they are ready rather than to marry prematurely . They want avoid living in an unhappy marriage or to end-up dissolving the marriage because of irreconcilable differences . <p> How do you know if you are ready to get married and more specifically if you are ready to marry that particular person ? <p> To get to know whether or not you are ready for marriage , it is important to get to know yourself . The first thing you must do is spend time conducting a personal self assessment to identify your personal strengths and areas that need improvement . It is important to get to know what kind of relationship you have with Allah , and what kind of relationship you expect to have with your future spouse . <p> Are you ready to share your life with someone else ? <p> Are you ready to take on the responsibility of building your family , sharing and compromising and working together to achieve your personal and family goals ? <p> It is important to know what you will contribute to the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful family life . <p> Getting Ready <p> Premarital education is essential to help us know if we really want to get married and if we are ready to marry . It also helps us learn the skills needed to develope a good marital relationship . In the United States many religious traditions require marriage preparation , and education prior to marriage . Some religious leaders have made a commitment not to perform the marriage ceremony of a couple that has not participated in a marriage preparation or education or counselling programme . <p> I recently met a young Catholic man who indicated that he and his fianc attended 8 weeks of premarital education as well as other programmes to educate and prepare them for family life . Other faith traditions have made major steps to prepare for marriage and family life . It is time that Muslims re-adopt the importance of marriage education that was part of the teaching of Prophet Muhammad during the early days of Islam . <p> I recommend that single Muslims participate in a marriage preparation and education programme way before they start exploring prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know themselves better , develop their relationship with Allah , and identify their strengths and areas in which they need to improve themselves . Most people get married before they know who they really are . Few have taken the time to engage in a personal self assessment . A marriage education programme can also prepare the individual with skills to help them once they do marry . <p> Communication skills <p> Budgeting and finance <p> Anger management <p> Problem solving and conflict resolution <p> All of the above are essential skills in a marriage . Such a programme should also include a discussion of intimacy and sex in marriage . <p> A Likely Match ? <p> Once you meet the person you think you will want to marry I advise both of you to pray Istikhara prayer for guidance , and to seek the wise council of close family and friends . <p> I also advise that the engaged or soon-to-be engaged couple meet with a wise spiritual and professional advisor to help determine if they are compatible and suitable for one another . It is important to spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether or not that person has character , temperament , religious character , and behaviour that is compatible to yours . <p> A Premarital Advisement helps to identify the challenges a couple may face in marriage as well as strategies to help prevent or address the challenges before they present a problem . <p> Marriage is one of the most important things you will do in life . It is half of our religion and is the foundation of our society ; however we tend to spend more time preparing for our career than we do for our marital lives . Expect to spend real time learning about what it means to be married before you sign the marriage contract . Take time to learn whether or not you are really ready to lead a healthy married life . <h> Leave a Reply <p> XHTML : These are some of the tags you can use : &lt;a href= " " &gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt; <p> ? <h> muzmatch Blog <p> Welcome to the official muzmatch blog ! muzmatch.com is a fast growing UK Muslim Matrimonial site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

##59651 <h> Down on the farm : family fun at West Middlewick <p> Visiting my uncle 's farm is one of my happiest childhood memories , but like a lot of hard-up farmers he packed it in a few years ago . I wanted to show my seven-year-old daughter Thea how much fun it is to help out on a farm , if only for a few hours , but I did n't know how to go about it . Then I heard about John and Jo Gibson , and their farm in West Middlewick , near Tiverton in Devon . <p> Thea could n't wait to go . " I 'm going to be a proper farmer , not a pretend one , " she said , as we set off . It 's a proper working farm , all right . " It smells of poo , " she says , as we arrive . <p> John and Jo immediately make us feel at home , introducing us to all their animals . Milk is their main business , but they also raise sheep , pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six friendly cats . Their son Daniel looks after the chickens and turkeys . Their teenage daughters , Catherine and Abi , help out with almost everything . It feels wonderful to muck in with a family who love what they do and love doing it together . It is obviously a hard life , but they would n't swap it for the world . <p> Thea is thrilled to feed the hens and collect the eggs they are sitting on ( she is delighted when one of them pecks me as I try to steal an egg ) . She is enchanted by the tiny piglets , born only a few days before , but the highlight is the calves . Once we have fed a few by hand , we feel as if we know them . " All the animals are part of the family , " says Jo , but they ca n't afford false sentiment . In six months , these cute piglets will be sold for meat . <p> John and Jo have had plenty of practice at welcoming people to their farm . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's ) , and Jo used to come here on holiday as a child . If you can stay longer , West Middlewick has cabins and a campsite . The log cabins are new , but people have been camping and caravanning here since Jo was Thea 's age . Lots of visitors return every year , becoming firm friends with the Gibsons and their animals . <p> " Every day we just go about our work , " says Jo , " and people join in if they want to . " <p> After our spell playing farmhands , we go for lunch in the local pub . By the time we return , one of the cows has given birth . Jo asks Thea to name the newborn calf . After some deliberation , she decides to call her Polly . Polly is already on her feet , and Abi shows Thea how to feed her . They go off to help with the milking , Abi leading the way , Thea following close behind . " I was so scared of them before , " says Thea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now I love them . " <p> We 're having so much fun on the farm that we decide to stay here for the night . After a delicious supper of pork burgers ( from the Gibsons ' farm , of course ) and some of Abi 's homemade cakes in our log cabin , we fall into bed , happy but exhausted . <p> Next morning , we eat fresh eggs for breakfast ( " they taste completely different , " says Thea ) and then we walk across the meadows and down to a little river in a hidden valley . Finally , it is time to leave . It feels strange to feel so familiar with these animals , less than a day after we have first met them : Jellybean the gentle old cow , Martha the naughty lamb . Before we go , Thea takes a last look at Polly , already walking on her first morning . " She 's got the pinkest nose , " says Thea , but there is more to this trip than petting baby animals .

##62351 <p> The word ' genocide ' was coined in 1944 to name a particularly shocking and horrific crime of violence which it was then believed could never happen again . That it has been put into practice so many times in one century is even more shocking . <p> The human race is the only species that can and does think itself into anger and violence . ( ' The more I thought about it , the angrier I got . ' ) We ought to be able to think our way out of it too . ( ' Later I realised that violence did n't achieve anything . ' ) <p> One much-practised way of thinking one 's way to violence is developing beliefs to back it up ; some of them may head towards the absurd . ' Violence is the only way to get respect . ' ' Violence is the only language they understand . ' ' I 'm good , you 're evil , ' ' We 're peaceful , they 're brutal . ' ' I was n't going to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' If I took it lying down , I could n't hold my head up again . ' And so on . There may have been a time in the early history of the human race ( a time when the natural world was the chief threat to survival ) when this kind of primitive thinking served a purpose . But it 's nothing but a handicap now . <p> Genocide is not a wild beast or a natural disaster . It is mass murder deliberately planned and carried out by individuals , all of whom are responsible whether they made the plan , gave the order or carried out the killings . Whatever its scale , genocide is made up of individual acts , and individual choices to perform them . So human individuals need to make the commitment , as early in life as possible , that they will have no truck with it . To do that , the way genocide becomes possible has to be understood . <p> There follow outline histories of eight 20th century genocides . You may want to research some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues they raise , particularly in respect of their causes . Prejudice , racism , grievance , intolerance , aggression , injustice , oppression - they all start small , and we need to spot and stop them in our own local orbits before they grow and get out of control . This means looking at the often long prehistory of genocide , as well as its symptoms in the present . Understanding these will help to avert future horrors . <p> Genocide , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war , is of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethical , racial or religious group as such : killing members of the group , causing serious bodily or inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part , imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group , forcible transferring children of the group to another group . <p> The following acts shall be punishable : genocide , conspiracy to commit genocide , direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complicity in genocide .

##62950 <p> ? If an Islam-West divide is to be avoided in our time , Modood suggests , then Britain , with its relatively successful ethnic pluralism and its easygoing attitude toward religion , will provide a particularly revealing case and promising site for understanding. ? <p> Such optimism would have struck some people as foolish at any time , but after the London bombings of 7 July and the abortive bombings of 21 July , it must strike many more as completely misguided . In particular , the fact that most of the individuals involved were born and/or brought up in Britain ? a country that had given them or their parents a refuge from persecution , fear or poverty and a guarantee of freedom of worship ? has led many analysts , observers , intellectuals and opinion-formers to conclude that multiculturalism has failed ; even worse , that it can be blamed for the bombings . <p> To take just four examples from a waterfall of commentary over the last ten-to-twelve weeks : <p> William Pfaff states that ? these British bombers are a consequence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster of our own making ? , Observer , 21 August 2005 ) <p> Gilles Kepel observes that the bombers ? were the children of Britain ? s own multicultural society ? and that the bombings have ? smashed ? the implicit social consensus that produced multiculturalism ? to smithereens ? ( ? Europe ? s answer to Londonistan ? , openDemocracy , 24 August 2005 ) <p> Martin Wolf concludes that multiculturalism ? s departure from the core political values that must underpin Britain ? s community ? is dangerous because it destroys political community ? ( and ) demeaning because it devalues citizenship . In this sense , at least , multiculturalism must be discarded as nonsense ? ( ? When multiculturalism is a nonsense ? , Financial Times , 31 August 2005 ) <p> Trevor Phillips questions , in the context of a speech concerned with ? a society ? becoming more divided by race and religion ? , an ? ? anything goes ? multiculturalism ? which leads to deeper division and inequality ? In recent years we ? ve focused far too much on the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ? After 7/7 : Sleepwalking to segregation ? , Commission for Racial Equality , 22 September 2005 ) <p> Even those who don ? t directly regard multiculturalism as the cause of the bombings tend to believe that we need to review the concept , often concluding that it needs to be replaced by ? integration ? . Indeed , this current of thinking predates 7/7 ( and , for that matter , 9/11 ) ; it became prominent with David Blunkett ? s arrival at Britain ? s Home Office in June 2001 and his response to the riots in some northern English cities in the early summer that year . <p> Also in openDemocracy on questions of British Muslims and British identity , citizenship and democracy , in the aftermath of the London bombs : <p> If you find this material valuable please consider supporting openDemocracy by sending us a donation so that we can continue our work and keep it free for all <p> The argument against multiculturalism and for integration has , needless to say , an even longer lineage in critiques from both left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new in a crucial respect : it came from the pluralistic centre-left , and was articulated by people who previously rejected polarising models of race and class and were sympathetic to the ? rainbow ? , coalitional politics of identity and the realignment and redefinition of progressive forces that it implied . <p> By 2004 , it was common to read or hear that the cultural separatism and self-segregation of Muslim migrants represented a challenge to Britishness , and that a ? politically-correct ? multiculturalism had fostered fragmentation rather than integration . Trevor Phillips , then as now chair of the Commission for Racial Equality ( CRE ) , declared that multiculturalism had once been useful but is now out-of-date , for it made a fetish of difference instead of encouraging minorities to be truly British ( see Tom Baldwin , ? I want an integrated society with a difference ? , Times , 3 April 2004 ) . <p> Throughout 2004 , a swathe of civil-society forums , journals and institutions of the centre-left or liberal-left ? Prospect , the Observer , the Guardian , the CRE itself , Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or produced special publications with titles like ? Is Multiculturalism Dead ? ? , ? Is Multiculturalism Over ? ? , and ? Beyond Multiculturalism ? . <p> This line of argument has acquired even more vigour and force after the events of July 2005 . But despite all that ? s happened in the last few months and the gathering chorus of belief to the contrary , I continue to think that multiculturalism is still an attractive and worthwhile political project ; and that indeed we need more of it rather than less . <p> This , however , does not mean that those calling for integration do not have a point ; multiculturalism and integration are complementary ideas . What it does mean is that integration should take a multicultural rather than an assimilative form . At the same time , we in Britain do probably need to work harder to develop a national identity , and forms of belonging to each other , that can win the imaginations and hearts of minorities and majorities alike . <p> Assimilation , integration , multiculturalism <p> It is widely said by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused concept whose different meanings to different people render sensible debate and policy orientation difficult . There is some truth in this , but the same is true of its rival ideas or models , ? assimilation ? and ? integration ? . <p> Thus , a useful debate and reasoned action requires first some conceptual ground-clearing . The meanings I offer below are not , I believe , arbitrary ; rather , they arise out of the public discourses in which these terms are used , and pitted against each other . The way I define them and establish their inter-relationship are however my own , and I am aware that others may prefer to work with other meanings ( see Bhikhu Parekh , ? British Commitments ? , Prospect , September 2005 ) . <p> Examples of alternative use of these words include ? assimilation ? in American sociology ( as in the ? segmented assimilation ? proposed by Alejandro Portes &; Min Zhou ) , which is similar to what is meant by integration in Britain . <p> In general , European ethnic groups in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assimilation ( see Peter Kivisto , Incorporating Diversity : Rethinking Assimilation in a Multicultural Age , Paradigm Publishers 2005 ) . Thus , Jews are taken to be a successfully assimilated group but the use of this term includes awareness that they have also changed the American society and culture they have become part of . When politicians in Britain and especially continental Europe speak of integration , the meaning they have in mind is what I define below as assimilation . <p> The principal social dimensions that relevant analysis and policy on these ideas needs to engage with are threefold : <p> socio-economic opportunities and outcomes <p> socio-cultural mixing <p> civic participation and belonging <p> A brief consideration of how these three dimensions might differently operate can help to define and distinguish between assimilation , integration and multiculturalism . <p> Assimilation is where the processes affecting the relationship between social groups are seen as one-way , and where the desired outcome for society as a whole is seen as involving least change in the ways of doing things of the majority of the country and its institutional policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state can play an active role in bringing about the desired outcome , as in early 20th-century ? Americanisation ? policies towards European migrants in the United States ? but the preferred result is one where the newcomers do little to disturb the society they are settling in and become as much like their new compatriots as possible . <p> Integration is where processes of social interaction are seen as two-way , and where members of the majority community as well as immigrants and ethnic minorities are required to do something ; so the latter can not alone be blamed for ? failing to or not trying to integrate ? . The established society is the site of institutions ? including employers , civil society and the government ? in which integration has to take place , and they accordingly must take the lead . <p> Multiculturalism is where processes of integration are seen both as two-way and as working differently for different groups . In this understanding , each group is distinctive , and thus integration can not consist of a single template ( hence the ? multi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy term either in relation to ? culture ? or ? ism ? ? refers to the understanding that the groups in question are likely to not just be marked by newness or phenotype or socio-economic location but by certain forms of group identities . The latter point indeed suggests that a better , though longer , term might be ? pluralistic integration ? . <p> In the perspective of multiculturalism , the social requirement to treat these group identities with respect leads to a redefinition of the concept of equality . <p> Let us take these two points , multiplicity and equality , in turn . <p> Multiplicity <p> Multicultural accommodation of minorities is different from integration because it recognises the social reality of groups ( not just of individuals and organisations ) . This reality can be of different kinds ; for example , a sense of solidarity with people of similar origins or faith or mother tongue , including those in a country of origin or a diaspora . Such feelings might be an act of imagination but may also be rooted in lived experience and embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alive . <p> This form of accommodation would also allow group-based cultural and religious practices to be fitted into existing , majoritarian ways of doing things . These identities and practices would not be regarded as immutable , but neither would there be pressure either to change them ( unless a major issue of principle , legality or security was at stake ) or to confine them to a limited community or private space . <p> Multicultural accommodation works simultaneously on two levels : creating new forms of belonging to citizenship and country , and helping sustain origins and diaspora . The result ? without which multiculturalism would not be a form of integration ? is the formation of ? hyphenated ? identities such as Jewish-American or British Muslim ( even if the hyphenated nature of the latter is still evolving and contested ) . These hyphenated identities are in this understanding a legitimate basis for political mobilisation and lobbying , not attacked as divisive or disloyal . <p> The groups in Britain for whom questions of integration arise ? those formed out of the ? new Commonwealth ? immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities combine elements based on origins , colour , culture , ethnicity , and religion . They are not just a plurality but differ in kind . Moreover , they have diverse socio-economic positions and trajectories , and experience both advantage and disadvantage in British society ? some of these groups have incomes above the national average . <p> The ? multi ? aspect of multiculturalism must apply to the analysis of racism also . There is not a singular racism but multiple racisms that include colour/phenotype forms but also cultural forms building on ? colour ? , or on a set of antagonistic or demeaning stereotypes based on alleged or real cultural traits . The most important such form of cultural racism today is anti-Muslim racism , sometimes called Islamophobia . <p> A good example is Martin Luther King Jr ? s civil-rights movement . He said black Americans want to make a claim upon the American dream , to achieve American citizenship in the way that the constitution theoretically is supposed to give to everybody . But Taylor also posits the idea of equal respect , which I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Taylor ? s formulation , of the politics of ? recognition ? , which consists of giving group identities a public status . <p> The American feminist scholar Iris Marion Young has explained why this is necessary : any public space , policy or society is structured around certain kinds of understandings and practices which prioritise some cultural values and behaviours over others ; no public space is culturally neutral ( see Iris Marion Young , Justice and the Politics of Difference , Princeton University Press , 1990 ) . <p> In so far as subordinate , oppressed or marginal groups claim equality , what they are claiming is that they should not be marginal , subordinate or excluded ; that they too ? their values , norms , and voice ? should be part of the structuring of the public space . Why , they ask , should we have our identities privatised , while the dominant group has its identity universalised in the public space ? The issue , then , is about the public/private distinction and what is ? normal ? in a society , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , many gay people have ? especially since the 1960s ? argued that they do not want to be tolerated merely by being told that homosexuality is no longer illegal and acts between consenting adults done in private are fine . They want people to know that they are gay and to accept them as gay ; and for public discussion about gayness to have the same place as discussions about heterosexuality . <p> The consequence is that when public policy is made ? for instance on widows ? benefits or pensions ? we should not assume an exclusively heterosexual model of society . This argument for equal respect is central to multiculturalism . <p> Ascribed and chosen identities <p> This equal-respect approach to multiculturalism has two important aspects . First , it takes race , sex and sexuality beyond being merely ascriptive sources of identity , merely categories . Race is of interest to liberal citizenship only because no one can choose their race and so should not be discriminated against over something over which they have no control . But if equality is about respecting previously demeaned identities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness rather than in accepting it merely as a ? private ? matter ) , then what is being addressed in anti-discrimination or promoted as a public identity is a chosen response to one ? s ascription . <p> Exactly the same applies to sex and sexuality . We may not choose our sex or sexual orientation but we choose how politically to live with it : do we keep it private or do we make it the basis of a social movement and seek public resources and representation for it ? <p> The second aspect of this approach is that it undermines a frequently-made distinction : that being a woman , black or gay person is an ascribed , unchosen identity while being a Muslim is about chosen beliefs , and that Muslims therefore need or ought to have less legal protection than these other kinds of identities . Rather , the position of Muslims in Britain today parallels other identities of ? difference ? as Muslims catch up and engage with the contemporary concept of equality . <p> No one , after all , chooses to be or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one chooses to be born into a society where to be or to ? look like ? a Muslim creates suspicion , hostility , or failure to get the job you applied for . <p> How Muslims respond to such circumstances will vary . Some will organise resistance , while others will try to stop looking like Muslims ( the equivalent of ? passing ? for white ) ; some will build an ideology out of their subordination , others will not ( just as a woman can choose to be a feminist or not ) ; some Muslims may define their Islam in terms of piety rather than politics ( just as some women may see no politics in their gender , while for others their gender will be at the centre of their politics ) . <p> In this light , multiculturalism can be defined as the challenging , the dismantling , the remaking of public identities in order to achieve an equality of citizenship that is neither merely individualistic nor premised on assimilation . <p> Institutional inclusion and secularism <p> What are the implications of this approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British experience ? David Hayes suggests that a choice is available : he rightly recognises that moving forward with multiculturalism requires giving Muslims sanctioned public recognition and respect , which taken to its extreme means a corporatist set of structures that includes a Muslim parliament ; alternatively , we could move towards a radical secularism that would banish religion from all civic structures ( see ? What kind of country ? ? , openDemocracy 29 July 2005 ) . <p> The choice before us , however , is not so stark . Corporatism would not be my own preference for it would not represent the British multicultural experience and its potentialities at its best . A corporatist inclusion would require Muslims and their representatives to speak in one voice and to create a unified , hierarchical structure when this is out of character in Sunni Islam , especially the south Asian Sunni Islam espoused by the majority of Muslims in Britain , and in the contemporary British Muslim scene as a whole . <p> Corporatism would in practice be a kind of controlling secularism ; it would very likely consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing upon Muslims its own template , plans , modes of partnership and chosen imams and leaders . This is a form of control that is being experimented with across the European Union but has not yet eliminated the mutual distrust between Muslims and European states . <p> A Board of Deputies model of community representation offers a better illustration of a community-state relationship . The Board of Deputies of British Jews is a body independent of , but a communal partner with , the British state ? a federation of Jewish organisations which includes synagogues but also other Jewish community bodies . Its leadership typically consists of lay persons whose standing and skill in representing their community is not diminished by any absence of spiritual authority . <p> It is most interesting that while at some local levels Muslim organisations in Britain have chosen to create political bodies primarily around mosques ( for example , the Bradford Council of Mosques ) , the Board of Deputies model seems to be more apparent at a national level . This is certainly the case with the single most representative and successful national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , whose office-holders and spokespersons are more likely to be chartered accountants and solicitors than imams . <p> Most mosques in Britain are run by local lay committees , and the mullah or imam is often a minor functionary . Very few of those who aspire to be Muslim spokespersons and representatives have religious authority , nor are they expected to have it by fellow Muslims . So the accommodation of religious groups is as much if not more about the recognition and support of communities rather than ecclesiastical or spiritual representation in political institutions . The state ? s role here is as much to help ensure that Muslim civil society is drawn into the mainstream as it is to enable its representation within state structures . <p> The above example is merely illustrative ; the general point is that multicultural political representation implies some element of collectivity but not necessarily corporatism . It can be about pressure groups , consultations , political-party influence and targeting of votes ; it can also include autonomous organisations like black or women ? s sections in political parties , trade unions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of means to enhance multicultural representation and the majority of them have to take place in the varied sites of civil society , not simply within the state . Most of the burden of remaking the public space lies with civil society and should not be left with the state . <p> David Hayes , however , has helpfully highlighted that a programme of racial and multicultural equality is not possible today without a discussion of the merits and limits of secularism . Secularism can no longer be treated as , as President Chirac put it , ? off-limits ? . Not that it ? s really a matter of being for or against secularism . The status quo is a largely secular political culture but one in which established churches , religious ceremonies and faith schools continue to have a place . <p> openDemocracy writers debate secularism as idea , experience and social model : <p> We should let this evolving , moderate secularism and the spirit of compromise it represents be our guide . Unfortunately , an ideological secularism is currently being reasserted and generating European domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflicts that entails for European societies ( on this issue , see Tariq Modood , TA Triandafyllidou and R Zapata-Barrero , eds. , Multiculturalism , Muslims and Citizenship : A European Approach , Routledge 2005 ) . <p> The development by some people in Britain of secularism as an ideology to oppose Islam and its public recognition is a challenge both to pluralism and equality , and thus to some of the bases of contemporary democracy . This trend has to be resisted no less than the radical anti-secularism of some Islamists . <p> Islamist ideologies , no less than extreme secularism , can be a problem ? not because they are religious but because they divide people into two ( Muslims and non-Muslims ) and because they tend towards absolutism ( namely , one identity always trumping all others ) . In both these aspects , Islamist ideologies are inimical to multiculturalism . <p> Just as earlier exclusivist dichotomies of British/alien , or even the political blackness that divides us into black/white , had to be challenged , so similarly some versions of Islamism are not sufficiently respectful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In search of national belonging <p> Multiculturalism in Britain has I believe been broadly right , progressive and beneficial in its principles and practice ; it does not deserve the desertion of support from much of the centre-left I described above , let alone the blame for the present crisis . Its articulation has , however , overlooked or at least underemphasised the other side of the coin , which is not just equally necessary but is integral to multiculturalism . <p> This is that we can not have strong multicultural or minority identities and weak common or national identities ; strong multicultural identities are a good thing ? they are not intrinsically divisive , reactionary or ? fifth columns ? ? but they need a framework of vibrant , dynamic , national narratives and the ceremonies and rituals which give expression to our common citizenship . <p> We ? in Britain and in Europe generally ? have overlooked that where multiculturalism has been accepted and worked as a state project or as a national project ( in Canada , Australia and Malaysia for example ) it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to creating Canadians , Aussies , Malaysians ) . Even in the United States , where the federal state has had a much lesser role in the multicultural project , the incorporation of ethno-religious diversity and the welcoming of hyphenated Americans has been about country-making , civic inclusion and nurturing a claim upon the national identity . <p> Just as integration is a two-way process , so is the pluralising and remaking of citizenship and national identity . This goes to the heart of social policy , where ( for example ) the phenomenon of residential segregation has many causes beyond ethnic minority groups themselves : including structural conditions such as poverty , racist exclusions , ? white flight ? , benign neglect by local authorities , and estate-agency discrimination . <p> In the same way , we must recognise that the lack of a sense of belonging to Britain able to withstand the ideological call of jihad against fellow Britons also has several causes , including those belonging to the majority society and not the minorities . <p> The source of this lack can be found in arguments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even racist notions of Britishness that hold that non-white people are not really British and that Muslims are an alien wedge . On the left is the view that there is something deeply wrong about rallying round the idea of Britain , about defining ourselves in terms of a normative concept of Britishness ? that it is too racist , imperialist , militaristic , and elitist ? and that the goal of seeking to be British in the present and the future is silly and dangerous , and indeed demeaning to the newly settled groups among the population . <p> But if the goal of wanting to become British , to be accepted as British and to belong to Britain is not a worthwhile goal for Commonwealth migrants and their progeny , what then are they supposed to integrate into ? And if there is nothing strong , purposive and inspiring to integrate into , why bother with integration at all ? <p> Do we just take the view that if inspiring and meaning-conferring identities can be found elsewhere ? in some internationalist movement ? that ? s just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and its citizens , well they don ? t really matter all that much in the ultimate scheme of significance ? That being British is small coinage in the light of the real struggles between good and evil ; between the dross and misery of the present and the imaginative and redemptive futures that beckon ? <p> We can not both ask new Britons to integrate and go around saying that being British is , thank goodness , a hollowed-out , meaningless project whose time has come to an end . This will inevitably produce confusion and will detract from the sociological and psychological processes of integration , as well as offering no defence against the calls of other loyalties and missions . <p> Perhaps one of the lessons of the current crisis is that multiculturalists , and the left in general , have been too hesitant about embracing our national identity and allying it with progressive politics . The reaffirming of a plural , changing , inclusive British identity , which can be as emotionally and politically meaningful to British Muslims as the appeal of jihadi sentiments , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiculturalism as a whole ? this is not a minority problem . If too many white people do not feel the power of Britishness , it will only be a legal concept and other identities will prevail . <p> A path to renewal <p> British involvement with the United States ? s geopolitical projects ? including the creation of Saudi-backed jihadism in Afghanistan in the 1980s as well as those following 9/11 ? is certainly part of the current crisis and is putting great strain on multiculturalism . Yet , in the same period New Labour has been part of an evolving multiculturalism , not least in understanding that religious equality is a necessary part of multicultural equality . These developments of recent years should not be called into question in the name of integration , anti-terrorism or secularism . <p> What is urgently needed is not a panicky retreat from multiculturalism , but to extend its application by recognising Muslims as a legitimate social partner and include them in the institutional compromises of church and state , religion and politics , that characterise the evolving , moderate secularism of mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical , French-style secularism . <p> Moreover , this is not just a matter of state action , for the burden of multicultural representation has to be borne by the multitudinous institutions of civil society that constitute our public space , our public interactions and our plural , public identities . <p> Thus , the lesson from the current , post-7 July crisis of how to respond to the appeals and threats from salafi jihadism is that we need to go further with multiculturalism : but it has to be a multiculturalism that is allied to , indeed is the other side of 
##65651 <h> Spartacus Educational <h> Mobile Version <p> In the first five years of his reign Charles I summoned and dissolved Parliament three times . Charles now tried to rule England without Parliament . For the next eleven years no Parliaments were held . The king 's main adviser was William Laud , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Laud argued that the king ruled by Divine Right . He claimed that the king had been appointed by God and people who disagreed with him were bad Christians . Laud believed that Church reforms had gone too far . Anglicans tended to support the policies of Laud but the Puritans strongly disagreed with him . When Laud gave instructions that the wooden communion tables in churches should be replaced by stone altars . Puritans accused Laud of trying to reintroduce Catholicism . <p> William Laud also upset the Presbyterians in Scotland when he insisted they had to use the English Prayer Book . Scottish Presbyterians were furious and made it clear they were willing to fight to protect their religion . In 1639 the Scottish army marched on England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to agree not to interfere with religion in Scotland . Charles also agreed to pay the Scottish war expenses . <p> Charles I did not have the money to pay the Scots and so he had to ask Parliament for help . The Parliament summoned in 1640 lasted for twenty years and is therefore usually known as The Long Parliament . This time Parliament was determined to restrict the powers of the king . <p> When the king demanded to know where the Five Members were the Speaker , William Lenthall , famously replied : " May it please your Majesty , I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me , whose servant I am here ; and humbly beg your Majesty 's pardon that I can not give any other answer than this to what your Majesty is pleased to demand of me " . <p> Members of Parliament no longer felt safe from Charles and decided to form their own army . After failing to arrest the Five Members , Charles fled from London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form an army . <h> ( 1 ) The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes ( 1642 ) <p> About 3 of the clock we had notice that his majesty was coming from Whitehall to Westminster with a great company of armed men but it proved otherwise in the issue that they were only some of the officers who served in his majesty 's late army and some other loose persons to the number of about some 400 . <p> Mr. Pym and the other 4 members of our House who stood accused by his majesty 's attorney of high treason knowing that his majesty was coming to the House of Commons did withdraw out of it . The House leaving it to their own liberty whether they would withdraw or stay within , and it was a pretty whiles before Mr. Strode could be persuaded to it . His majesty came into the House with Charles Prince Elector Palatine with him a little after three of the clock in the afternoon , who all stood up and uncovered our heads and the Speaker stood up just before his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part of the way uncovered also bowing to either side of the House and we all bowed again towards him and so he went to the Speaker 's chair on the left hand of it coming up close by the place where I sat between the south end of the clerk 's table and me ; he first spoke to the Speaker saying " Mr. Speaker I must for a time make bold with your chair " ... when he asked for Mr. Pym whether he were present or not and when there followed a general silence that nobody would answer him he then asked for Mr. Holles whether he were present and when nobody answered him he pressed the Speaker to tell him who kneeling down did very wisely desire his majesty to pardon him saying that he could neither see nor speak but by command of the House to which the king answered ' well well this no matter I think my eyes are as good as anothers ' and then he looked round about the House a pretty whiles 
##71652 <h> Brain-damaged woman should not be allowed to die <p> A brain-damaged , minimally-conscious woman should not be allowed to die , a High Court judge ruled today . <p> A brain-damaged , minimally-conscious woman should not be allowed to die , a High Court judge ruled today . <p> The case is thought to be the first time that a judge has been asked to rule on whether life-supporting treatment should be withdrawn from a person who is not in a persistent vegetative state but is minimally conscious . <p> Mr Justice Baker , who heard legal argument during a Court of Protection hearing in London in July , described the case as unique and said it raised " very important issues of principle " . <p> Relatives wanted life-supporting treatment withdrawn and said the woman , who turned 52 earlier this month , would not want to live " a life dependent on others " . <p> But a lawyer appointed by the High Court to represent the woman opposed the relatives ' application for nutrition to be withdrawn - arguing that she is " otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for commissioning her care also opposed the relatives ' application and said the woman 's life was " not without positive elements " . <p> Mr Justice Baker heard that the woman , who can not be identified for legal reasons and was referred to as M in court , suffered profound brain damage in early 2003 after being diagnosed with viral encephalitis . <p> She was in a coma for several weeks and had been thought to be in a persistent vegetative state . Doctors later concluded that she was in a minimally-conscious state - just above a persistent vegetative state . <p> The judge said M had " some positive experiences ' ' and there was a " reasonable prospect ' ' that those experiences could be extended . A spokesman for M 's relatives ' lawyers said : " This is a very important judgment . The law has been clarified . ' ' <p> Yogi Amin , a partner with law firm Irwin Mitchell , speaking on behalf of M 's family , said : " All parties agree that M 's family have demonstrated their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they brought this application to court in what they perceive to be her best interests . " There can be no question that the past eight years have been extremely heart-breaking for them all . <p> " They love her dearly and want only what is best for her , and it has been desperately difficult for them to make this application to court for treatment to be withdrawn . <p> " They believe that M was clear that she would not have wanted to live in the condition that she is in . <p> " However , the judge has decided in this particular case , after considering all the evidence , that balancing the benefits and disbenefits to M , does not fall on the side of withdrawing treatment . <p> " This is a very important judgment . The law has been clarified and , going forward , in all such cases of patients who are in a minimally conscious state , the High Court does now have the power to decide on whether it is in that patient 's best interests for treatment to continue , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dignity . " <p> Mr Justice Baker said today : " The factor which does carry substantial weight , in my judgment , is the preservation of life . Although not an absolute rule , the law regards the preservation of life as a fundamental principle . " <p> He added : " M does experience pain and discomfort , and her disability severely restricts what she can do . <p> " Having considered all the evidence , however , I find that she does have some positive experiences and importantly that there is a reasonable prospect that those experiences can be extended by a planned programme of increased stimulation . <p> " Having weighed up all the relevant facts , I conclude that it is not in M 's best interests for artificial nutrition and hydration to be withdrawn and I therefore refuse the application . " <p> The judge added : " I realise that this decision will be a severe disappointment to members of M 's family who have endured years of anguish during which they have demonstrated their deep devotion to M. <p> " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M will continue to be looked after in her current nursing home , which I have visited during the course of the hearing . <p> " All parties , including members of M 's family , agree that the care given to M at the nursing home is of the highest standard . <p> " I urge everyone concerned with M - doctors , care staff , and her family - to work together to agree a revised care plan which gives her an opportunity of more positive experiences . " <p> The court heard evidence from M 's sister B and partner S. B broke down as she described M 's condition and told Mr Justice Baker why relatives wanted artificial nutrition and hydration withdrawn . " She can not enjoy a drink , a cup of tea or anything . She has got no pleasures in life , " B told the court . <p> " Just a daily routine of being taken out of bed , put in a chair and put back in bed . Shower , doubly incontinent . <p> " It is just awful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know she would not want that . " <p> Vikram Sachdeva , for relatives , said all parties involved accepted that relatives ' motives were based on " genuine respect for the interests of M " . <p> " This is an exceptionally sad case in which no one could doubt that M , her partner S , her mother W , and her sister B are deserving of the greatest sympathy , " Mr Sachdeva told the judge . <p> " The family are here because of the clearly and consistently expressed views of M , who was not religious , that she would never want to live a live dependent on others , even if she retained her mental faculties . But for that wish , the family would not be here . " <p> He added : " The issue in this case is whether M continuing to have medical treatment in the form of artificial nutrition and hydration is truly in her best interests ... <p> " The ( family ) does not contend that all those in a minimally conscious state result in the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply that in some individual cases , after meticulous consideration of all factors for and against , that might be the most humane course and in the individual 's best interests . " <p> But the Official Solicitor - the lawyer appointed by the court to represent M - said withdrawing life-supporting treatment could be the start of a " slippery slope " . <p> " It is fundamental in this case to note that M is clinical stable , " Caroline Harry Thomas QC , for the Official Solicitor , told the judge . <p> " She has no need for other life-sustaining treatment . M 's life expectancy is 10 years ... M is not at the end of her life . " <p> Miss Harry Thomas said M showed a " range of behaviours and responses to external stimuli " and experts agreed that she had " awareness of herself and her environment " . <p> " Where , as in M 's case , a person is in a minimally conscious state and is otherwise clinically stable it can not , as a matter of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw life sustaining treatment , including artificial nutrition and hydration , " said Miss Harry Thomas . <p> " If it is not in M 's best interests to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment , including artificial nutrition and hydration , were such treatment withheld or withdrawn , this would amount to the actus reus of murder . " <p> She added : " It can not be in the best interests of an otherwise clinically stable person in a minimally conscious state to have life-sustaining treatment , including artificial nutrition and hydration , withdrawn . To do so would be to embark on a slippery slope ... <p> " On the evidence , it is not in M 's best interests to withdraw and withhold life-sustaining treatment . " <p> Bridget Dolan , for the primary care trust ( PCT ) responsible for commissioning M 's care , said M had been in a care home since 2008 after being treated at specialist hospitals . <p> " On the factual evidence it appears to the PCT that M 's life is one that is not without positive elements , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reports of staff that M can express emotion and appears at times to experience pleasure . " <p> She added : " It does not appear to the PCT that M 's condition is such that her life has no positive aspects to weigh against the discomforts she may at times experience ... <p> " The PCT therefore wishes to continue to commission a comprehensive package of care for M and , in doing so , is

It is physical , as physical as Christ 's resurrection body . It is personal , as personal as our Christ . It is as physical and personal as walking with Jesus upon the earth , as accepting his invitation to ' come and have breakfast ' . I 'm not sure it was bacon sandwiches and fresh coffee , but the company was good and whatever Jesus served them that morning was surely the best breakfast they 'd ever eaten . <p> This hope reshapes our grieving for Christians who have died . Through our tears we can believe that they are merely asleep , awaiting their resurrection . We grieve the tearing apart of relationships , as with CS Lewis reflecting upon the death of Charles Williams : <p> In each of my friends there is something that only some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not large enough to call the whole man into activity ; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets . Now that Charles is dead , I shall never again see Ronald 's reaction to a specifically Charles joke . Far from having more of Ronald ' , having him ' to myself ' now that Charles is away , I have less of Ronald . <p> We weep for the loss of those in whom we 've found our identity , we rage at the curse of death . Our grief makes us long for deeper relationship with the Father , Son and Holy Spirit , in whom we find our life with all God 's people , and long for a brand new day to come . <p> Death reminds us that people are not just iPhone Apps that enhance our brief lives , but persons given by Christ so we need not be alone -- and one day we wo n't be . When someone who has faith in Jesus dies we know they will rise , and they will do so before those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blazing the trail for us in pursuit of Christ . We will rise with him , we will come to him , and we will be with him forever . <p> Although our existence is like the morning mist , our solution is not to live smaller lives , satisfied that for today we are the new . Our answer is not to detach ourselves from relationships so that death wo n't hurt so badly . The world can cease to be a place we plunder to get ahead of others , instead we can start celebrating it as a gift to be enjoyed with other people . Christians live lives of great earthly usefulness , knowing that this is our home . One day when the curse is fully lifted we 'll live here with Christ . Peter says Christians are strangers and aliens , ( 1 Peter 2:11 ) not because we do n't belong here but because we are citizens of Jesus ' renewed creation . This will be our home , it just does n't feel like it yet because it 's straining under the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's return to this world expands our horizons . King Solomon wrote that the eye is not satisfied with all it 's seeing , yet that does n't mean there is n't great beauty to appreciate as we look out over the ocean , walk through an art gallery or just observe people living around us . Likewise , the ear is never filled up with hearing , but that does n't mean we wo n't continue to enjoy wonderful music from a live symphony orchestra or through our headphones . From popular culture to high art , it 's all a foretaste of the magnificence we 'll taste when Jesus returns . <p> In the meantime , we 'll watch as the sun rises and the sun sets with metronomic monotony . We share its frustration at having to shine on such a dark world . We hear it preaching the gospel as its daily light triumphs over darkness . We hear its love song as it marches through the sky . We lament the arrival of darkness as the sun sets , only to rise again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

This video is unavailable from your location . <p> Thompson House on the Antrim Road has been refurbished to house 19 offenders and is due to reopen . <p> The hostel is run by the Presbyterian Church and Lindsay Conway from the Board of Social Witness said the new facility is the result of a public safety debate and he claims that it will help " reduce risk " . <p> " We are better to know where sex offenders are , that they are being monitored and that they are being kept to the special conditions of their settlement plan and that that is built into the technology and to the staffing levels in Thompson House , " he said . <p> We would never pretend to say that there is zero risk .

The hostel is on a prominant corner site and 1000 's of people , especially schoolchildren , have to walk past it every day . The very presence of the hostel on the main road in North Belfast in full view of families with young children and older schoolkids is very disturbing as it unsettles people and is extremely disconcerting for them ; this should never have been allowed to happen . Once again North Belfast politicians especially Sinn Fein , the SDLP and DUP have abandoned ordinary , decent people to their fate ; shame on them ! They do nothing for us

Any kind of intentional action , whether mental , verbal or physical is regarded as Kamma . Inherent in kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effect , which operates in its own field without the intervention of any external , independent ruling agency . Kamma produces results ( Kamma vipaka ) which the doer has to experience . This is a reaction in accordance with the natural law of cause and effect . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> What are good and bad kamma ? <p> The words good and bad are subjective and relative terms , very much depending on the society in which one lives . For example , Buddhists regard animal sacrifice as bad , while in some belief systems , this is regarded as good practice producing beneficial results . Therefore , in Buddhism , an action ( performed with intention ) that produces a beneficial result is described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action that produces a negative or detrimental result is described as an unwholesome ( unskilful , unfavourable ) kamma . <p> In general , any act which is harmful to oneself and to others is unwholesome kamma . Wholesome or skilful kamma is the development of virtue ( sila ) , concentration ( samadhi ) and wisdom ( panna ) . To develop virtue , one should practise at least the five precepts ( panca-sila ) . Concentration is developed by meditation , and wisdom arises when the above two qualities are developed and with the practice of insight meditation . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> ( a ) If I run over a dog accidentally , do I have to suffer the kammic consequences ? ( b ) I had to put down my dog as a result of a severe illness , will I suffer from bad kamma as a result ? <p> I n the first instance , there was no intention to run over the dog , hence it would not produce unwholesome kamma . <p> In the second case , there was a definite intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if the action was motivated by compassion , and not to get rid of a troublesome pet , the resultant unwholesome kamma may be lessened due to the thoughts of compassion . <p> A similar situation is when a doctor or a relative of a terminally ill patient has to make a decision to switch off the life support system . In this case , one could say that the patient was being prevented from undergoing the natural and inevitable process of death by maintaining the life support system . Therefore it is probable that no unwholesome kamma would result by letting the natural process take its due course .. <p> Q. <p> A. <p> I see many people doing evil things such as cheating , robbing others etc , and living a good life , while there are some who have been very religious but have lost their fortunes or been struck down by a terrible disease . How do you explain this ? <p> The working of kamma is so complex that only a Buddha can fully comprehend it in all its details . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular kamma may undergo change or may be cancelled out altogether due to a previous or a subsequent opposing kamma . The result of kamma may not manifest immediately , or even in this lifetime , but may produce a result in a future life . <p> If a person is born into favourable circumstances , enjoys wealth and good health , this is indeed due to his wholesome kamma from a past life . The results of a particular kamma will surface when the conditions for its manifestation are appropriate . So if a person considered to be good is struck down by a terrible disease , it could be the result of a past unwholesome kamma coming to the surface . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> If one kills another person , does he get killed in return in a future birth ? <p> This is a common misconception . As stated before , kamma operates in a complex manner , and may not necessarily operate in a straightforward way which we can understand . Following are some of the probable consequences of unwholesome kamma as described in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill health , frequent grief due to separation from the loved , and frequent fear . <p> Stealing : poverty , misery , disappointment and dependent livelihood . <p> Sexual misconduct : having many enemies , union with undesirable husbands and wives , birth as a eunuch . <p> Lying : being subject to abusive speech and vilification , untrustworthiness , and a smelly mouth . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> Is there a difference in kamma between harming a human and an animal ? <p> T he intensity of the kamma depends on the level of existence of the being affected . Humans are on a higher plane of existence than animals , hence harming a human produces more intense kamma . Similarly , harming a virtuous person produces even greater intensity of unwholesome kamma . The effects of wholesome kamma are also intensified if the recipient of our action is a person of high virtue . That is why Buddhists like particularly to perform acts of generosity towards virtuous monks . <p> Q. A. <p> What proof is there of past life ? <p> In attaining enlightenment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings pass from one life to another . The ability to recall past lives can be acquired through meditative practice . In recent times , there have been a number of authenticated cases of spontaneous recall among very young children . The Buddhist explanation for ? gifted ? children is that they are only experiencing memories from a previous existence . Differing kammic inheritance , brought from previous lives , may also explain the differences between identical twins . <p> Are the personality and physical characteristics of a person determined by previous kamma ? <p> A being is born into particular circumstances as a result of his previous kamma . Other factors such as inherited genes and the environment are physical factors necessary for the manifestation of the individual ? s kamma . Buddhist belief is that , in general , a thought , volition , or desire which is extremely strong during lifetime becomes the predominant factor in determining the subsequent birth . <p> Frequently , strong mental traits are carried over . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> Is kamma carried by the soul during reincarnation from one life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit that reincarnates from one life to another is fundamental to the Buddha ? s teachings . A permanent soul can not exist in the ever-changing , interdependent process of mind and matter which constitutes a living being . However , the momentum of accumulated kamma results in a new existence . The individual so born is neither the same nor different from the previous being . Buddhism , therefore , describes this process as ? rebecoming ? or ? rebirth ? in preference to reincarnation which implies a resurrection of the same entity . It is the force of one ? s accumulated kamma which drives life onward from one existence to another . Only an enlightened being ( arahant ) creates no more kamma . <p> Q. <p> A. <p> Are animals subject to rebirth and can humans be reborn as animals or plants ? <p> According to Buddhist teachings , animals are sentient beings , just as humans . Although their mind functions at a lower level , they experience feelings and possess conciousness . Therefore they are subject to the same laws of existence including kamma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kamma as a result of unskilful activity may be born as an animal . <p> Animal plane of existence is below that of humans and classed as one of the unhappy states . Beings born into lower planes are unable to engage in skilful activities to aquire wholesome kamma due to the nature of their existence . Therefore they may remain trapped in this state for a long time , until such time that the unwholesome kamma which resulted in that birth is exhausted . They will then be reborn into a higher plane such as human . <p> The belief that a human being could be born as a plant or a tree is not supported in Buddhist teachings . A plant does not have the same type of conciousness ( vinnana ) as a sentient being . <p> Buddha emphasised the importance of human existence that gives the best opportunity to develop the mind to the highest level , and to attain Nibbana . <p> If the present life is the result of past actions , is a person ? s life already predetermined ? <p> The present life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the immediate past life but from preceding lives as well , depending on the intensity of the particular kamma . However , life is in a state of flux and the results of past kamma can undergo change due to subsequent actions . Hence , to that extent , everything is not predetermined . On the question of freewill , the whole existence is relative , conditioned and interdependent , hence there can not be absolute freewill . It is important to understand that how

##116752 <h> Sexual Selection <p> In order to leave an evolutionary legacy survival is not enough . Individuals must also reproduce . Over 90% of species reproduce sexually , meaning two individuals from each sex must mate in order to produce offspring . Reproduction is expensive and can exert an additional evolutionary pressure . Darwin defined this pressure as sexual selection . Sexual selection operates through some members of a species having an advantage over others in terms of mating . It is the selection for traits that are solely concerned with increasing the mating success of an individual . <h> Darwin and Sexual Selection <p> Darwin ? s findings in relation to sexual selection were published in his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 . Darwin observed that there are some characteristics that do not appear to help an organism adapt to its environment and are thus not explained by natural selection . He suggested that they feature in the process of sexual selection . He defined the process by saying that it ? depends on the advantage which certain individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in exclusive relation to reproduction ? . His observations and analysis lead to the reasoning that sexual selection works in two main ways : either through competition among members of one sex for access to members of the other sex ( combat ) or through choice by members of one sex for certain members of the other sex ( display ) . <h> Combat <p> In terms of combat , males within a species compete with each other for access to the females . This leads to larger and stronger males and to the development of male ? weapons ? in order to give them the advantage when in combat with other males . Darwin referred to many examples of this . Elephant seals and walruses are examples of the increased size and strength of males . Elephant seals annually migrate from their foraging ground to their breeding ground . The males arrive roughly two weeks before the females and they then fight to gain the best breeding site and thus attract the most females . Only the largest and strongest males are able to dominate in this competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male ? weapons ? include the horns of male beetles , the antlers of stags , the large canine teeth of male baboons and the tusks of male wild boar . In addition , male competition can also be more subtle . For example , when some male insects mate with a female they remove the sperm that is already present in the female as it is from previous males . <h> Display <p> ? Display ? refers to the exhibition of ornate male features to potential female mates , such as the striking , brightly coloured plumage of many male birds . Darwin suggested that this process of selection operates through female choice , whereby females choose the most striking males to mate with . This theory proposes that male ornaments are thought to be a genuine indication of the male ? s vitality . The presence of a costly ornament on a male tells the female that he is genetically exceptionally healthy and thus her offspring will inherit his vitality . <p> A classic example , and one used by Darwin , is the flamboyant tail of the peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival and may actually be a handicap - a disadvantage in terms of survival for existence - as the tail makes it more difficult for the bird to escape from predators . The explanation in terms of sexual selection for its presence is that peahens are attracted to it , and there are various suggestions as to why they like it . Generally sexually selected traits either signal fitness directly , as their development depends on good health or a good diet , or indirectly when they signal the ability of the male to survive despite the large cost imposed by the fancy plumage or what have you . <p> Darwin proposed that this process of sexual selection would work in the following way . In the past when peacocks had ordinary colour and length tails , peahens ( for some reason ) showed a preference to mate with males with slightly longer and more flamboyant than average tails . Thus , the characteristic of slightly longer , more brightly coloured tails would be passed on to the next generation and over many generations the peacocks ' tails would become longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advantage in terms of mating success that it is selected for despite being a disadvantage in terms of general survival . Darwin thus argued that these flamboyant male characteristics were not , as believed at the time , due to a designer who had an aesthetic sense , but due to the need to attract a mate . Other examples where males are more striking than the females are found in fish , lizards and spiders . <h> Sexual Selection in Man <p> In the final chapter of The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex , Darwin discuses sexual selection in man . He states that any deliberate mate selection is of women by men , not the other way around . Therefore , it is female features that are important in mating success , such as beauty , red lips , shapely breasts , as well as artificial means such as jewellery and make up . Darwin also identified that different cultures have different views on human attractiveness . <h> Darwin ? s Evidence for Sexual Selection <p> Darwin ? s main evidence for sexual selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great number of species , that there is a greater difference between the sexes ( greater sexual dimorphism ) in polygynous species than monogamous . A polygynous species is a species where one male mates with several females , whereas in monogamous species a single male pairs with a single female . Darwin reasoned that in polygynous species secondary sexual characters will be more developed to enable the males to gain access to more females ( via combat or display ) . Therefore , polygynous species should , and were indeed found to , have greater sexual dimorphism . <p> Darwin also carried out various experiments to test sexual selection . These included plucking game cocks ? tail feathers , cutting the ? eyes ? out of a peacock ? s tail and shortening or artificially enhancing tail length and then ,

His power over illusions no doubt , used to mask who he truly was ? or perhaps hide from the wards the fact that he was there at all . <p> ? She is ? ? Dumbledore shrugged , ? I have no real basis for comparison here , but she is learning . Right now , we have decided her primary focus should be learning control in the hope that lesson will spill over into the control of her abilities ? <p> Jareth nodded , his hands wrapped around a steaming cup of tea as he considered this , ? if you are teaching her emotional control , then that would have an effect I suppose .

" <p> In a statement issued to the Daily Mail , Mr Werritty said : " While much of last autumn 's media coverage was often short on detail and substance , and in a minority of cases little more than innuendo , a serious allegation , of fraud , was made against me . <p> " I have always maintained that this allegation was baseless so I naturally feel vindicated , but unsurprised by the CPS 's decision . <p> " I owe a big thank you to my family and close friends for their unwavering support over

##141951 <h> Diuretics <p> Diuretics increase urine excretion and are commonly called " water tablets " . In general , they inhibit electrolyte reabsorption from the lumen of the nephron , increasing osmolarity and enhancing water excretion . <p> Diuretics have different clinical uses depending on their sites and mechanisms of action . The sub-classes of diuretics : <p> Thiazides ( bendroflumethiazide , chlortalidone , metolazone ) are used mainly in low dose in the treatment of hypertension but also , in combination with loop diuretics , to treat severe heart failure . <p> Loop diuretics ( furosemide , bumetanide , torasemide ) are widely used for the symptomatic treatment of heart failure . <p> Potassium-sparing diuretics ( amiloride , triamterene ) are weak diuretics , most often prescribed in combination with thiazides or loop diuretics to prevent hypokalaemia . <p> The use of indapamide ( +/- perindopril ) in those aged over eighty , to achieve target blood pressure below 150/80 , reduced all-cause mortality , heart failure and stroke with few adverse effects , providing evidence of the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) given as a slow IV injection offloads the pulmonary oedema causing the breathlessness associated with acute left ventricular heart failure ( LVF ) . Higher doses may be necessary if the patient has been taking large doses over the longer term . The rapid initial action is due to pulmonary vasodilation rather than the later diuretic effect . <p> Use the lowest dose of diuretic necessary to relieve fluid overload and breathlessness and adjust following the addition of other heart failure therapies . 6 Tolerance to long-term loop diuretics may develop . 8 Patients on long-term treatment may be able to adjust their own dose according to clinical status . <p> Thiazides can be as effective in treating oedema in those with mild heart failure with preserved renal function although , generally , loop diuretics are the preferred , more potent option . <p> Loop diuretics reduce symptoms but have not been shown to reduce mortality . <p> Spironolactone should be considered for those with moderate-to-severe heart failure ( New York Heart Association grades III-IV ) who are already on an ACE inhibitor and a loop diuretic . The Randomized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spironolactone daily in this group reduced mortality and hospitalisation. 9 However , the risk of hyperkalaemia with the combined use of an ACE inhibitor and spironolactone requires careful monitoring . <p> NICE guidance suggests that those with heart failure , who continue to have moderate-to-severe impairment despite otherwise optimal therapy ( ACE inhibitor , beta blocker , diuretic ) , should be considered for treatment with spironolactone and should be reviewed by a specialist . 6 <p> Do not use diuretics to treat idiopathic oedema 8 or that due to gravity , obesity , venous stasis or lymphoedema ) , as initial benefit is usually offset by tolerance and worsening oedema . <p> Spironolactone is particularly useful for the secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with hepatic cirrhosis and is the diuretic of choice to control resultant ascites and oedema . Treatment must be stopped if encephalopathy develops . <p> Spironolactone can also be used to treat malignant ascites . <p> Note : diuretics are sometimes abused by sportsmen and women who need to lose weight rapidly to make a weight class , eg in boxing or horse racing . <h> Combination therapy <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is an inadequate response to loop diuretic alone . This combination can cause dramatic diuresis with resultant dehydration , hypovolaemia , hyponatremia and hypokalaemia . In the past , it has tended to be initiated in hospital but Clinical Knowledge Summaries ' guidance suggests that it may be done in primary care under specialist supervision . 7 Dose titration should be gradual with adequate clinical and biochemical monitoring . Heart failure specialist nurses may be helpful in this situation . <p> Potassium-sparing diuretic and thiazides - the addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic may be useful in those who develop hypokalaemia on thiazide therapy . <p> Potassium-sparing diuretic and loop diuretic - a potassium-sparing diuretic can again be added to those who develop , or are at high risk of , developing hypokalaemia . <p> Spironolactone and loop diuretic - spironolactone can be used as a potassium-sparing diuretic for patients on loop diuretics at risk of hypokalaemia . <p> Combination products , for example co-amilofruse ( furosemide and amiloride ) , may be indicated where a patient is stable on a fixed dose of loop/thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less flexible - changing the dose of one component will alter the dose of the other component without necessarily producing the most optimal therapeutic response . Also , routine prescribing of combination products is poor practice : amiloride is frequently not required since as many heart failure patients will also be on an ACE inhibitor which has a potassium-sparing effect . <h> Common problems <h> Potassium loss <p> Hypokalaemia can occur with loop or thiazide diuretics. 8 The risk of hypokalaemia is related to duration of action as well as potency , so is actually greater with an equipotent dose of thiazide compared to loop diuretic . <p> Potassium-sparing diuretics are not particularly potent and should generally be avoided in heart failure patients where loop diuretics are more efficacious and patients are likely also to be taking ACE inhibitors . <p> Spironolactone can be used as a potassium-sparing diuretic in cardiac failure . <p> Only prescribe potassium-sparing diuretics where a patient has , or is at risk of , hypokalaemia . They offer a more effective alternative to potassium supplements . However , they are not a guarantee against hypokalaemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbances such as hyponatremia and hypomagnesaemia may occur , particularly at higher doses of diuretic therapy , due to increased renal excretion . Hyperuricaemia and metabolic alkalosis are also risks . <h> Metabolic disturbance <p> Hyperglycaemia and increased insulin resistance are associated with thiazide diuretic use : ALLHAT showed that use of chlortalidone was associated with higher fasting glucose levels and rates of developing diabetes than amlodipine or lisinopril. 10 Despite this , re-analysis of ALLHAT data and further studies have not shown any evidence of worse cardiovascular outcomes . 11 <p> Acute hypotension may be induced where aggressive diuresis has been undertaken , particularly with a loop diuretic or combination therapy : <p> Ensure a patient is not hypovolaemic before starting diuretics , since diuresis occurs from the intravascular space . <p> The diuresis associated with diuretics is dose-related . Excessive doses of diuretics can cause hypotension and dehydration without relieving oedema ( which is still in the extravascular space ) . <p> The usual maximum target rate of fluid loss is 1 litre per day . <p> Previous treatment with diuretics increases the risk of first-dose hypotension when starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where possible ) before starting an ACE inhibitor and give the first dose with the patient lying down . <p> Postural hypotension is common with both thiazides and loop diuretics and most likely in elderly patients . If possible , withdraw offending drugs or reduce dose . Advise the patient to stand up slowly and in stages . Compression stockings may assist if venous insufficiency contributes . <h> Renal failure <p> At high doses , diuretics may cause a pre-renal uraemia . <p> Renal toxicity with diuretics occurs frequently , especially amongst the elderly , via diminished renal excretion , altered plasma protein binding and interactions with other drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Remember that renal function may diminish over time or with concurrent illness . <p> High doses of furosemide may be required in moderate-to-severe renal impairment . <p> Patients with renal insufficiency are at risk of hyperkalaemia , so potassium-sparing diuretics are not usually indicated . <p> Patients with heart failure and concomitant severely impaired renal function often require very large doses of diuretics -specialist help is recommended . <h> Contra-indications and cautions <p> See individual drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairment - there is an increased risk of hyperkalaemia with potassium-sparing diuretics and spironolactone . Thiazides are ineffective with increasing severity of impairment . <p> Severe liver disease - thiazides and loop diuretics should be used with extreme caution , as hypokalaemia may precipitate hepatic coma . High doses of spironolactone are sometimes necessary in the treatment of cirrhosis - seek specialist help . <p> Elderly - use lower initial doses since the elderly are particularly susceptible to diuretic side-effects . Adjust dose according to renal function . Avoid long-term use of diuretics to shift gravitational oedema - increasing muscle pump activity , raising the legs at rest and use of support stockings are more appropriate . <p> Pregnancy - there is a risk of volume depletion and fetal/neonatal toxicity associated with diuretics . One study suggested that women using loop diuretics during pregnancy gave birth to heavier infants and had a higher risk of preterm birth , but there were confounding factors . 12 Methyldopa and beta blockers are used to treat hypertension in pregnancy and thiazides should be avoided . <p> Gout - both thiazides and loop diuretics can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable , consider prophylaxis with allopurinol . <p> Recheck renal function and electrolytes 1-2 weeks after commencing therapy and after increasing the dose . This should be done earlier ( within 5-7 days ) if there is pre-existing renal impairment or where the patient is already receiving an ACE inhibitor ( or AGT2 receptor antagonist ) or aldosterone antagonist . <p> Once stable , six-monthly should suffice unless there is any change in therapy , intercurrent illness or worsening renal impairment . However , more frequent monitoring is still advised in those at higher risk . 6 <p> A potassium ? 6.0 mmol/L or a creatinine level &gt;310 micromol/L , should prompt the immediate stopping of spironolactone and the seeking of specialist advice . <p> Eplerenone should be monitored in the same way as spironolactone . <p> Daily weights can help monitor fluid loss with cardiac oedema or ascites . With ascites , aim for a weight reduction of no more than 0.5 kg/day. 8 <p> Compliance - many patients find that diuresis interferes with their daily activity .

##159051 <p> I am seeking constructive comments on a theoretical new form of government I have been developing called Expert Government . <p> Its principal feature is that all policy is devised by experts that act only within their specialisations . Expert Government is a single entity with no politicians or parties , just experts and some administrative staff to help them . Otherwise it is dogma free to enable it to adapt to changing needs and circumstances . Structurally its experts are grouped according to their respective specialisations , and all experts have equal influence within their specialism , but none outside of it . Influence is not organised into hierarchies . <p> There are two significant observations that influenced the principal feature of Expert Government . Firstly , most problems that befall us seem to be within our ability to prevent , because they arise from our own actions . Take for example recent sovereign debt problems . Secondly , humans have constructed very sophisticated and necessarily complex systems that enable advanced civilisation . Those systems are based on the principle of collaboration between many experts acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how else such sophisticated systems could be organised . Now it is my opinion that a country is also a sophisticated system . I believe that the problems that befall us are because we do not use an organisation of experts for government . Instead the administrators are making decisions . These administrators are not sufficiently aware of all the sophistication and complexity in the system , so problems appear to them to come out of nowhere . <p> I would propose a government based on an exactly opposite philosophy . It would be called " non-expert government . " All the decision making would be based on the will of common , ordinary citizens . And they would rarely be experts in any specific field which might be influenced by their decisions . Oh , wait . That 's not called " non-expert government . " It 's called " democracy . " <p> I understand your desire and concern to want to replace these failed and conflicting forms of government . I appreciate those that wish to experiment with ideas that one day may supercede these greed-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live under today . I , too , have been working on a new form of political theory , I would like to confer with you and others that wsh to give a beautiful jewel of Freedom , Equality , Fairness , Happiness , Fortune , Liberty , Justice , and Consytructive and Compassionate Humanity . We all need to put th every best of ideas together and develop a balanced and harmonious system that will not bring the sufferings of the past upon our progeny . In doing so , there will have to be an easement into this system so we do not bring harm or horror to others as the systems that exist now have all come into existence . This easement also should be based on a popular vote of all citizens within a Society , as no matter how terrible of inefficient or unfair a system is to bring another " solution " to " problems " by force will lead to the same kind of problems once again . It is a mob=vement of Peace , not radicalism , not extremism , not a bilinear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Communist , etc . It is a dynamic system based on fundamentally proven and known laws of human nature , human interaction , and human happiness . I have spent the last 13 years on this research and now have more reason than ever to start revealing some of the ideas I have so diligently worked towards . The problem is that every form of government attempts to sell itself to the people and it is designed primarily to opearte the government that has less than a true invested interest in the people , hence we need a government that has a more natural and less restrictive form of serving the common good of all and no government official can be allowed special powers unless they are temporarily allowed by the people and only in the most dire of situations . No law will be made that any governemt official can bypass or ignore . I have a very dynamic projection of metascopic and macroscopic elements of this form of government and the sweet thing is that it is designed to appeal to human nature , intellect , dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of violence , shame , destitution , disparity , poverty , inopportunity , inequality , and injustice ? this is neither wish-thinking nor soem unrealistic utopia . Are we not yet tired of seeing the same problems cycle themselves over and over ? Let me know if you want to hear more . Thank you for your time . <p> I think we have problems with information , media and money particularly in our elections which can be fixed by the people . In my opinion , I think we 're too distracted by power hungry , drama-inducing , patronizing liars in media and the nonsense on the internet to do anything decisive . It sounds bad but its got to be activism that cant interfere with the schedule . <p> I think it would be much easier ( meaning less violence and quicker to happen ) to get beyond the influence of outrageous amounts of money in our elections by working within the system , ( which would also include pushing for an amendment to overturn Citizens United . ) <p> If demonstrations need to happen , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off when the campaign commercials come on or for bringing awareness to different organizations or companies that you want to promote , like bipartisan fact checking organizations . Just a thought anyway . <p> Are we not yet tired of seeing the same problems cycle themselves over and over ? Let me know if you want to hear more . <p> for myself , I could commit to listening to more , but I do n't know about an extended conversation . If you do n't get any other replies , you could try tumblr , or livejournal . <p> Your vague government suggestion seems pleasant enough but as sapienism would n't anyone opposing the government ( or even just competition within it ) be dehumanized ? <p> Experts are ordinary citizens . Most people know a lot about one subject , and that makes them an expert . Genius is not required , just ordinary people talking about what they know about . In a sense Expert Government is more democratic than representative democracy . One does not need an elitist education or membership of a political party to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is run . <p> When it comes to something important , like running a country , we should only consult people on matters they understand well . This is quite normal in everyday life and works extremely well . For example , most people would not ask a dentist to fix a car , or a plumber for investment advice . <p> Try to let go of the indoctrination that democracy is the only answer . Certainly democracy is an improvement on authoritarian leadership , but Expert Government is the next step . <p> This is meant as only a question , not a debate . so please don'y misunderstand my approach .

Thank you for you passion to want to see a better system established for mankind . <p> I am at the moment a Libertarian/Centralist and an advocate for a Free Market and laissez fair Capitalism . I am an American , but have seen the US Constitution trampled so badly it needs defense in the form of less ambigous language and at this point I do n't see this two party system allowing that as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both are drama parties , not really defenders of what is right or Constitutional . I think it is time ot move past Capitalism and into a Brighter Age of Thinking and Interacting with others . IMHO . <p> For example , most people would not ask a dentist to fix a car , or a plumber for investment advice . <p> That implies that people are smart enough to take a car to a mechanic , but not smart enough to elect good representatives . I disagree . I think most people are smarter than you think . And , collectively , they are smarter than any expert , or group of experts , you can imagine . <p> Certainly democracy is an improvement on authoritarian leadership , but Expert Government is the next step . <p> I disagree . Your " Expert Government " can only exist if someone decides who is , or is not , an " expert , " which weeds out anyone not deemed an " expert . " This leaves the decision making to those who write the pre-requisites and qualifications determining who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who may represent the people " entirely to those who determine " expertice . " This , in my opinion , would inevitably lead to the authoritarian and " elitist " system you think it would avoid . I would much prefer to trust the wisdom of the entire citizenry than trust some pre-requisite writing weed puller . <p> No need to apologise . I am trying to belittle you . But I am doing it to make a point . You see ... If the world adopted your system , but the world did not recognize you as an expert in governmental systems , your system would require us to ignore you . If you did n't pass muster on the " expert checklist , " your opinions would need to be disregarded . <p> I am the creator of Expert Government , so I would call myself an expert in it . <p> That sort of defeats the purpose of your system , dose n't it ? I mean , if anyone can declare themselves a " expert , " in any field they wish , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your system to work , there has to be a system to determine who is an expert , and weed out those who are not . However , in a democratic society , with freedom of speech as a cornerstone , you have every right to postulate whatever crackpot ideas you wish . You do n't have to be an expert . All you have to be is a person . And those who disagree can disagree in a belittling tone if they wish . <p> I think people often make the mistake of thinking freedom of speech means " all ideas are equally valid . " That is most certainly not the case . ( See any post from Solve . ) Freedom of speech means anyone has the right to voice an opinion , no matter how good , or stupid , it may be . And anyone else can support , or belittle , the idea , based on how good , or stupid , they believe the idea is . <p> I did look at your website . I did n't see anything in it that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will give you a specific example . I am an expert in a certain field ( wildlife management ) . I have the degrees and certifications to vouch for my " expertise . " And , I work for the government . And , I play a large role in setting laws that deal with hunting in my state . Under your system , my opinions should be passed into law unfettered by public input , because I am the expert . However , our democractic system does not work that way . My opinions are run through groups of other experts , then through the public , and finally , through a political commission ( consisting of people who are businessmen , lawyers , doctors , or whatever ) in a public forum where everyone has the right to speak . And , the commission passes the hunting laws , after listening to both experts AND the public . The commission has no expertise in biology . They are not experts . They are , however , representatives of the people . I applaud that system . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into law . There are other factors which need to be considered . That is where the public input is needed . <p> One more little tidbit ... Do n't think that all " experts " agree at all times . They do n't . <p> I agree with your assessment , I do n't really think an Expert form of Government is the way to go at all . But , perhaps we should have people in office that know more of what it is they are representing . Nobody can know it all , but perhaps a generalized and hands-on form of education for those aspiring to governmental positions could be required ? I am amazed at how many people in governmental position know zip or too little about the US Constitution or the State or Local Charters for which they claim they serve . Ignorance is n't bliss , it is a blight and never bright . <p> I agree with your assessment , I do n't really think an Expert form of Government is the way to go at all .

They do n't <p> By necessity , in a world where nobody can be an expert in everything , because humanity 's knowledge exceeds the amount of what an individual can keep up with . <p> Experts in one field are necessarily ignorants in other fields . The people who weigh the experts ' opinions should represent the average citizen ( or average expert , which is the same ) as much as possible . <p> If your area of expertise is wildlife management then you are not an expert in forms of government , so your views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an elected representative of the people on this forum , by your own measure I can ignore you . Having a dialogue on a forum also means to treat others with respect if you want it returned . As you find no value in this idea I suggest that you can stop wasting time on this thread . <p> Momo <p> As you identify , people can not be experts in many things . The correct response is not to get a few people together to talk about things they know little or nothing about . Rather , it is to get multiple experts to deliberate only in their specialism and arrange government into many specialisms . There is no such thing as an average citizen , they are all experts . In a sophisticated society we should have sophisticated government . We need to move on from government based on tribal ideas of a few powerful leaders . <p> If your area of expertise is wildlife management then you are not an expert in forms of government , so your views are worth no more than mine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-proclaimed , yours are worth no more than mine . But , it is in your " Expert Government " world that only the opinions of experts have value . In the real world of free speech , any idea has the value it deserves , no matter who proposes it . <p> As you are not an elected representative of the people on this forum , by your own measure I can ignore you . <p> Certainly . I have no problem with that . <p> Having a dialogue on a forum also means to treat others with respect if you want it returned . <p> I do n't expect you to treat me with respect . <p> As you find no value in this idea I suggest that you can stop wasting time on this thread . <p> If you think the only value in a thread comes from agreement with stupid ideas , I am indeed wasting time on this forum . <p> I think Alan is correct in pointing out that one glaring weakness in your sysetm is in deciding who is qualified to be an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term limited , but nothing is specified about who picks the experts who will be appointed . And they will be appointed , not voted in , apparently . Which leads to the conclusion that there will be some kind of panel -- or several panels -- with the power to determine expertise and the power to make appointments . How will the panel(s) be constituted ? How will the panelists be chosen ? Is there any democracy left in this system , where regular people -- read non-experts -- actually have a voice in who will run government ? <p> I also found this interesting : <p> " Expert Government is a single entity with no politicians or parties , just experts and some administrative staff to help them . " <p> " Some administrative staff " is another way of saying " bureaucracy . " In present forms of government -- all of them -- they are the real power , the ones who know how to get things done -- or not , as they so choose . I suspect your new government will be the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be up to the " administrative staff " -- the REAL experts -- to get things done . <p> You should also keep in mind that , in a very real sense , we already have the form of government you describe . In our democracies , elected legislators and agency heads ( or in Britain 's case , members of parliament and ministers ) rely on smaller committees of members and their staffers who have ( or quickly acquire ) expertise in their specific spheres of responsibility . Whether Senate or House committees or subcommittees in the U.S. or select committees in the U.K. , these panels provide the expertise -- or seek expert testimony or contract for expert services and advice -- in matters having to do with their areas of governing . <p> This way , we get the expertise I think we all agree is necessary as well as representative government , which , I 'll agree with Alan , is vital for the protection of the rights of individual citizens . Under your proposal , " expert " can all too easily be read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no seeming accountability under your system to those they make decisions for , would almost certainly come to abuse that power . <p> Checks and balances are vital to keeping any government doing its job with a minimum of corruption and absolutism . Who checks your experts ? Who do they answer to , if not to voters ? What 's to stop a " chief expert " from taking power ? <p> You should also keep in mind that , in a very real sense , we already have the form of government you describe . <p> Henry , <p> I thought about pointing out exactly the same thing . The difference , I think , between the current systems in place , and the system being proposed is the elevation of " experts " from advisors to policy makers . <p> gebyatt , <p> I have no problem with anyone proposing a new idea . But , since you were the one that proposed it , you must be the one who defends it and explains why your idea is better than " the old way " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explain it in detail , it 's dead in the water . A " better mousetrap " has to stand up to scrutiny and criticism . Do n't expect automatic approbation . <p> My project is not complete , it is a big undertaking . A large amount of complexity exists that is not fully worked out , although more material exists than is on my web site . I added some detailed material in the past and subsequently removed it because incomplete it raises more questions than it answers . Nonetheless , I feel it is important to get feedback on what I have so far to minimise the chance that I have missed something significant . Sadly , when I seek views on forums some seem to prefer to immediately criticise the effort rather than look for value in it . <p> Experts are appointed in a similar way to a job . The existing experts in the relevant specialism , i.e. the potential colleagues , along with appointments experts ( effectively a sub-role of the typical human resources role ) review the candidates and employ the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of government . It just needs a little adjustment . Your " regular people " comments make me suspect you are conflating two concepts here . This is quite common . I use the term expert as normally defined . I am not implying an elite or privileged member of society , which for example UK politicians typically are . Civilisation exists because almost everyone is collaborating as a specialist in some field . For example , cleaners are just as much specialists as particle physicists . An expert is simply a specialist who is good in their field . They need not be the best in the world , just good . Almost everyone is a specialist in something , and many are experts . What I am suggesting is that as civilisation based on specialisation works so well , why not use it for government . Indeed , if one were creating a system of government without the knowledge of any existing forms of government , why would anyone do anything differently than copy that very successful model ? One might argue for Specialist Government if one wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specialist Government would be more egalitarian as it would not exclude anyone . However , I feel that government is important because of its far reaching effects , so asking for good over random ability seems wise . I may be over optimistic about how much difference this would make . <p> Although Expert Government contains some elements of democracy , so far I have avoided calling it a form of democracy . There are three principle democratic elements . Firstly , people need not join a political party to get into government . As being in government is a job , everyone has the opportunity , and there are very many jobs . Thus more people have direct influence on government policy . As distributing power to many non-elite people is the foundation of democracy , in a sense Expert Government is more democratic than representative democracy . Obviously this is at the cost of losing a vote for a representative . I think what is lost in one vote is miniscule influence over government policy relative to what is gained in wider distribution of power . This combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people over time . Secondly , one of the detailed elements not mentioned yet on my web site is a citizen-government contract . This is notionally similar to a **25;3306;TOOLONG of rights . It is not immutable but changes to it may be proposed by government , individuals , and groups . However , due to its importance , proposed changes are voted on by all people . This is designed to make it difficult to change , but prevent inflexibility that would cause it to become anachronistic . Thirdly , another element that is not yet on my web site is an independent organisation that allows people and groups to challenge government if they feel that it has acted against the citizen-government contract . That organisation exists outside of government and the legal system and use of it is free . It only considers matters of conformance to the citizen-government contract . The people who assess the matters are drawn for the populace in a similar way to jurors appointed for court cases . <p> Your comments on " bureaucracy " are a fair observation . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a detail . I see no reason to believe the balance of power between experts and administrators would be worse under Expert Government than any other form of government . Indeed , as there are many more experts than elected representatives there should be relatively less administration staff and overall the administrators would wield less power . <p> I partially agree with your point about there being something similar in place in the form of special committees etc . This is a tacit recognition of the value of experts . However , while these experts have influence they do not have authority . Their advice can be ignored by politicians with other agendas . In addition , I would also suggest that some of the advisors you are talking about have their own agendas . They are very different from someone selected from the general public with an egalitarian agenda . <p> How can you tell that experts would abuse power any more than the politicians ? Many people are suspicious about the motives of politicians . I certainly believe that many are motivated by power and wealth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a limited time , further they are actively policed . People have an independent organisation to use to correct abuse , and open access to all information created in the course of government activity . A very important feature for limiting misuse of power is not having hierarchical power structures , which concentrates power in the hands of few and inevitably leads to abuse . Expert government is specialism structured . Influence is limited to one 's specialism and no expert has more influence than another . The importance of not having hierarchical power structures was recognised in the commune movement that was so popular in the US in the 1960 's and 1970 's . Unfortunately , while they had no hierarchical power structures they also had nothing to prevent abuse of personal influence . In specialism structured government members of a specialism may ask a policing unit to moderate an expert that they feel is exercising undue influence . Policing is also proactive , visiting specialisms even when not invited . <p> This is not about demolishing democracy . It is a rational re-examination of the design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigms I found an idea that is worthy of consideration , simply because it is so successful . <p> Dear gebyatt , I see that you have thought many things through and also know where certain limitations and potential exist wihin your ideas and in the spirit of that idea you ask others to chime in . So , here I go . I think that " in a way " I see you system as a proto-czar system .

I think the problem is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Government as a Business instead of a Family or Extended Tribal Influence .

As long as there is no love , there will be religions which will never be able to bring the human beings towards God . But when love will come , there will be no more religion . Religion will become internal and will show itself under shape of kindness , brilliance , sacrifice , sweetness and light . It is when love left the humanity that religion has come to compensate for it . But when love will come , religion will fade because it will have entered again the heart of the man . <p> SolveeCoagula , Thank you for posting the suggestede reading , , I am sure gebyatt like it too . I love that saying " When love comes , there will be no religion . " May I add , that " When Reason triumphs there will be no need for Wars . " <p> I would appreciate more comments just on the principal idea used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has advanced in a large part due to specialisation of human activity . As this paradigm is so successful I suggest government comprises only specialists . As government has far reaching effects , Specialist Government should be improved by only using experts , and so the idea became Expert Government . I may be overoptimistic about the value of my trade of some egalitarianism for ability , by moving from specialists who have random ability to experts with good or better ability , but I note that employers generally try to pick the best candidate . <p> Gebyatt , you use the comparison of employer and employes . If an employer is hiring , they tell the empployees what to do and they set the rules . This means that there will be Experts getting their isolutions knocked down simply because of Human Nature ... there will be at some point distrust and doubts about the Experts true Intentions . Also , the Experts basically can hold Society completely dependent on their Expertise and can use it to stomewall or negate improvement or policies that they do n't like . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do the same thing . I I do n't want to fully knock your ideas , I just think there is a critical element missing , , , how do Experts sitting upon a high board know the dynamics of the people on the ground ? There will be inevitable disconnect . I understand you want people making decisons about things in a well-informed manner , but I do n't see the answer in this idea of yours . May I ask you to go back to the drawing board and think of how you can achieve more positive and constructive dynamics with less controversay or possible injected contrivance from the people that would be ruled over this idea of yours . Do n't throw the baby out with the bathwater , don ; t loose spirit or hope . It is THINKERS that change this world with their IDEAS . <p> How can you tell that experts would abuse power any more than the politicians ? Many people are suspicious about the motives of politicians . I certainly believe that many are motivated by power and wealth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a limited time , further they are actively policed . <p> Why for a limited time ? Since the decisions these people are making will affect all of our lives , they will have power . There will always be interest in influencing those decisions . <p> <p> A very important feature for limiting misuse of power is not having hierarchical power structures , which concentrates power in the hands of few and inevitably leads to abuse . Expert government is specialism structured . Influence is limited to one 's specialism and no expert has more influence than another . <p> But they absolutely will . Trying to run an organization without anyone in charge is minimally an invitation for endless bickering . This government will never get anything done . Out of necessity leaders emerge . <p> <p> People have an independent organisation to use to correct abuse , and open access to all information created in the course of government activity . <p> How do the people correct abuse without a vote ? <p> The importance of not having hierarchical power structures was recognised in the commune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 's and 1970 's . Unfortunately , while they had no hierarchical power structures they also had nothing to prevent abuse of personal influence . In specialism structured government members of a specialism may ask a policing unit to moderate an expert that they feel is exercising undue influence . Policing is also proactive , visiting specialisms even when not invited . <p> What sort of influence would be considered criminal ? If one person in these specializations stands out above the rest what power are you giving competitors or even jealousy ? Who watches over the police ? <p> Would the police be the independent organization the people use to correct abuse - the one you also said was outside of the legal system and free ? The lack of individual personalities being recognized legally as authorities does n't remove the potential for corruption . <p> You 're replacing the ability to vote and the presence of authority figures in government with excessive policing . This would turn your expert government into a front for a police state which couldnt possibly be more democratic than representative democracy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before being replaced by another expert . This serves two purposes . Firstly , this reduces the opportunity to become corrupt . There is an assumption here that the appointments committees have done a good job in ensuring that candidates do not enter the job already corrupt . Secondly , it gives more people a chance to influence government policy . In doing so it is enhancing the democratic principle of distributing influence/power . One of my observations is that the influence the average person has over government policy in one vote every few years is negligible . It is better to drop votes and politicians in favour of more ordinary people having a direct influence on policy by taking jobs in government . This is partly done by subdividing government into more roles , but also by changing the people in them often . You could look at this as an improved balance of power . In a representative democracy almost all the power is wielded by a few politicians . Very little power is then distributed among everyone else as votes . In my scheme all power is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cost of votes of negligible value . This is closer in an important sense to the most fundamental democratic principle of influence in the hands of the ordinary people . I know that some people will say the vote is not worthless as it excludes poor politicians and parties from government . However , there is plenty of evidence that it does not do a good job , such as UK politicians in prison for corruption , and effectively a choice between just two parties for government . There is a constant sequence of problems caused by incompetence that risks throwing the UK into a disaster situation . It is only a matter of time before it happens . We should act to change this crazy system before it happens , not after . We need evolution , not revolution . <p> You also ask " How do the people correct abuse without a vote ? " <p> Policing units are empowered to investigate and remove members of government who are abusing their influence . Anyone from the government or outside of government can request that a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government are acting correctly by examining the meetings and output of government , as all activity in government is open to examination by anyone . Multiple independent policing units divide this important power up , so that even if corruption gets into one policing unit , multiple others can be asked to check it . Many detailed rules must apply to policing units to ensure their integrity , but this scheme is less corruptible than the current system where politicians are just about untouchable . UK politicians even have parliamentary privilege to escape the laws that apply to the rest of us . The current system certainly is very much more open to abuse . <p> You ask " What sort of influence would be considered criminal ? " <p> A lot of detailed guidelines need to be created on this . My current thinking is that a range of measures are required from feedback that behaviour is unsuitable , for example being seen as aggressive or overly assertive , thought issuing guidance and reprimands , eventually culminating in exclusion or even criminal proceedings . I believe in early and staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not aware that they are not acting as they should be , and the feedback will stop an escalation to a more problematic scenario . As described above , the police are subdivided into separate units that can be called upon to moderate each other . One of the important principles of policing is well defined and narrow influence . This helps prevent them from becoming corrupt . So the police I have been discussing so far only deal with matters of behaviour of government members . I see a role for a distinct policing unit to enforce changes in policy that does not conform to the citizen-government contract . They would have power to dismiss all members of a specialism that were shown to have created policy that was intentionally against the contract . At the other end of the scale they could simply require a policy to be changed where for example a technical infraction occurred . <p> You say " ... replacing the ability to vote and the presence of authority figures in government ... would turn your expert government into a front for a police state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Remember these policing units only have influence over members of government and in very well defined and narrow circumstances . They have no influence over anyone else . It is essential to restrict their power to prevent any abuse of it . They are distinct from the criminal police and have no influence outside of government . I certainly want to avoid creating an authoritarian police state . I have an egalitarian and liberal agenda . <p> I recently told my kids ( I have two teenagers and two that are almost there ) that the computers are going to be shut off during the day this summer . I 'm also starting something next week that is going to be time consuming , so I hope to get back to this by Sunday night , or more like early Monday morning ( I 'm in PST ) <p> You ask " Why for a limited time ? " I am suggesting that an expert has a limited tenure before being replaced by another expert . . <p> I must have read that wrong . I asked why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that is what you were suggesting . <p> <p> Secondly , it gives more people a chance to influence government policy . In doing so it is enhancing the democratic principle of distributing influence/power . One of my observations is that the influence the average person has over government policy in one vote every few years is negligible . It is better to drop votes and politicians in favour of more ordinary people having a direct influence on policy by taking jobs in government . <p> The influence you can have in government if any at all , will be in one area and for a brief amount of time . Your life is going to be affected by more than what your specialty is . You will have nothing to say about most of what is being decided in government . The people with the real influence will be the hiring committees and the policing units . Who 's whispering in their ears ? Who is paying them under the table ? <p> <p> You also ask " How do the people correct abuse without a vote ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government who are abusing their influence . Anyone from the government or outside of government can request that a member of government be investigated . <p> Remember that these members of government are also ordinary citizens that are supposed to be exercising there most likely one chance at having an influence in government policy . If anyone feels this person is abusing " their influence " they will be harassed and possibly lose that opportunity . What kind of influence is that really ? Who would want this job ? <p> <p> People can check that members of government are acting correctly by examining the meetings and output of government , as all activity in government is open to examination by anyone . <p> That 's a lot of activity to examine with all of those people coming and going . If you do n't like " output of government " , what can you do ? File a complaint about someone and their abusive influence ? How many complaints are these police units going to see in a year ? Why would some complaints be given attention and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What agenda do they have to be pestering some person who had their symbolic influence in government , avoided making waves and is now in trouble ? lawsuits upon lawsuits <p> <p> Multiple independent policing units divide this important power up , so that even if corruption gets into one policing unit , multiple others can be asked to check it . Many detailed rules must apply to policing units to ensure their integrity , but this scheme is less corruptible than the current system where politicians are just about untouchable . UK politicians even have parliamentary privilege to escape the laws that apply to the rest of us . The current system certainly is very much more open to abuse . <p> The current politicians are just about untouchable , so to fix that in your new government , citizens will give up their vote for some one time low paying job in an expert government for a threat or reality of being harassed by policing units if they exercise influence , are overly assertive , or do n't conform to the citizen-government contract ? <p> <p> I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in policy that does not conform to the citizen-government contract . They would have power to dismiss all members of a specialism that were shown to have created policy that was intentionally against the contract . <p> How long do you think it would it take to prove that it was a justifiable dimissal ? <p> It will much easier to hide corruption in a crowd with endless chains of non authority/authority decision making.There 's going to be so many people here and gone in this government how is the citizen that is n't involved or not supposed to know who is responsible for anything ? What power would we have to do about it anyway ? Do nt worry the policing units will take care of everything ? <p> <p> You say " ... replacing the ability to vote and the presence of authority figures in government ... would turn your expert government into a front for a police state which couldnt possibly be more democratic than representative democracy . " <p> Remember these policing units only have influence over members of government and in very well defined and narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is essential to restrict their power to prevent any abuse of it . They are distinct from the criminal police and have no influence outside of government . I certainly want to avoid creating an authoritarian police state . I have an egalitarian and liberal agenda . <p> The people the policing units will have influence over will be regular citizens that gave up their vote to supposedly exercise direct influence in government policy where in reality they will be forbidden to have any real influence . <p> gebyatt , <p> That is going to have to be it for me for awhile . I do n't like to leave a conversation in the middle here but I need to . Maybe someone else will pick up . Nice chatting with ya . <p> " Remember these policing units only have influence over members of government and in very well defined and narrow circumstances . They have no influence over anyone else . " <p> If they have any power , in any form , over the governing body of the people then they have absolute power of everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . That has been proven over and over , with every single government ever to be recorded . You could not implement enough layers and enough restrictions to prevent them determing social outcome <p> " I certainly want to avoid creating an authoritarian police state . I have an egalitarian and liberal agenda . " <p> Are you aware that Egalitarian ( or let us just use the normal English word Equal ) and Liberal agenda are mutually exclusive ? It is impossible to have both , liberal agenda is by its very nature intended to be discriminatory and every group in modern history that has embraced that doctrine has succeeded to the demise of the peoples of the societies . <p> " Are you aware that Egalitarian ( or let us just use the normal English word Equal ) and Liberal agenda are mutually exclusive ? It is impossible to have both , liberal agenda is by its very nature intended to be discriminatory and every group in modern history that has embraced that doctrine has succeeded to the demise of the peoples of the societies " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course you are right . <p> Clayton is correct , that is why there is so much confusion and disorder throughout the world as Liberalsim is really neither Fair nor Realistic . Equality is pushed down the more the Liberal Agenda is propagated . <p> I think the problem with your concept is more complicated because excluding economics which truly should never be moderated from a central location , nothing that a government faces should be a known . That means you would not know what experts to have in place . <p> If a country is ran correctly every single situation is new , and be definition no expert could be found . Government in its oldest meaning was spiritual leading . Over time our dictionaries have recorded as a more literal controlling of people but it was never intended to be that . I bring that up because no government has civil duty , mean they should not be involved in things like social programs or the like . <p> In the real use a Governments job is to provide military security , make certian that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be them maintaining it ) and that a normalized form of trade is established and maintained . There is really is very little need for an experts in a government that sticks to its purpose . <p> But , that never happens does it ? So we need to realistic here . The worst case situation would be if all the people making decisions felt they were better at it than everyone else , and were in a position to hide any evidence to prove otherwise . Where I believe your idea sounds great , when I think about human nature I can see where it would have no chance of long term success . <p> I suspect this is another problem - and do not take this as a slight on the UK . ( I have lived here half my life ) . I suspect you have a sort of democracy in mind but unless I am wrong you are from the UK and have never lived in a democracy or encountered one . The UK is definitely not a democracy and does not even uphold democratic ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the US , which definitely does uphold democratic ideals but oddly is a federal republic which means the powers that be have far too much power . <p> I think your idea is a good starting point but in truth is just a reflection of exactly what the US has right now . Legally their politicans are restricted in everything they do - if it is not defined as their job in the constitution they can not do it . That is legally . In practice their politicans do anything they want and that is exactly what I mean by human nature . Also , worth nothing that their politicans all rely on experts in the field for every decision <p> So in realtiy your Expert government is just the US Federal Republic but I guess more regulated , and minus a President . <p> I could respond to each of your points , but I want to discuss the critical point . Details can be adjusted . <p> Many governments are conspicuously failing to manage their countries . <p> I suggest that while issues like corruption remain very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing problem that dwarfs them all . <p> Civilisation is much more complex now than it was when existing forms of government were devised , and it will get progressively more complex . Consequently , failures in managing countries will become more common and more severe unless government is rethought to accommodate that progression . The obvious answer is all around us . Civilisation advances because of the specialisation of people . Government too should be based on that undeniably successful principle . <p> I recognise what you say about some of the people who comment on OD , but by saying that you sound like a person who must be more open-minded . In which case consider my ideas fairly . <p> There are two important questions arising from your statement : <p> 1 Are experts the best we can do ? <p> 2 How do we appoint the correct experts ? <p> Consider 1 <p> Partitioning government into many specialisms with many collaborating specialists in each is the critical factor . <p> Example : I imagine that if you wanted something important done well that you would seek out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a dentist , you would not seek out a geezer who tries his hand a lot of things and does not know much about any of them , but says he really wants to have a go as long as you pay him very well . Politicians are geezers . <p> I think events are demonstrating the problems with trusting these geezers - politicians . They are making a mess of running our complex societies . <p> The old issue of ensuring corruption is checked was improved by earlier forms of democracy and is still important . Indeed , my proposal makes every effort to reduce the chance for corruption from the levels we have now . However , the increasingly important issue is that politicians are ineffectual because of the design of government . Nobody , regardless how clever they are , can make sensible policy decisions on such a broad range of complex issues . We need many experts in each of many narrow specialisms collaborating to develop the best policy . <p> The longer we wait to do this , the bigger the problems will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get simpler , so the problem will get worse . <p> Consider 2 <p> If we accept that partitioning government into many specialisms is the critical factor , employing any specialists will be enough to improve government . However , we should aspire to use experts , not just specialists . <p> I propose that selection is just like interviewing people for a job . Find out their experience and references . This is done by the people from the specialism one will be working in . They are best placed to understand if a candidate knows what they are talking about . Naturally , there will be a need for rules that prevent people being employed that are known in any way to the existing members of the specialism . These are details that can be improved over time . It is important not to let this selection issue prevent the important idea of specialism structured government . <p> ' Otherwise it ( Expert Government ) is dogma free to enable it to adapt to changing needs and circumstances . ' <p> A worthy goal for sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias , etc. , is a part of the human condition . Curious that you do n't understand this considering you are trying to craft the next ' evolutuionary ' step in human affairs . <p> Your analogy of not seeing a dentist for repairs to your car is a faulty one . Car repair and dentistry are both fields in which there are clearly defined steps for sucessfully carrying out car repairs or dentistry . Government is not like that , what works in one place may not work in another . Good Governance also requires competing ideas and a environment where anyone can put forward an idea , not just ' experts ' ( whatever that is ) where ideas would become homoginized . <p> ' Civilisation exists because almost everyone is collaborating as a specialist in some field . ' <p> The clashing of ideas had been more benificial to our civilization that collaborating . <p> ' cleaners are just as much specialists as particle physicists . An expert is simply a specialist who is good in their field . ' ' <p> This is perhaps one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards . <p> I fully understand the difficulties concerning the human condition . Indeed , specialism structured government contains a number of measures to hinder as much as possible the less egalitarian and otherwise unhelpful characteristics inherent in human nature . Firstly , specialism structured government devolves influence into many narrow independent specialisms , each with multiple experts that have equal influence . Secondly , each member of government only has influence within their narrow specialism . Thirdly , each member of government is only allowed one limited term which can not be concurrent in the same specialism with anyone they are associated with . Fourthly , if a policy created by a specialism is considered to break the strategic direction given in the Covenant , which is controlled by the people as a whole by referendum , then it is repealed . Fifthly , if any member of government is found to be acting inappropriately they may be removed from government . To expedite the last two points there is complete open access to all information created in the activity of government , and there are multiple independent policing units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lastly , there are two independent specialist courts of citizen jurors that can be convened at the request of any citizen to consider matters of deviant policy and misuse of office . If you can think of any extra measures I could take I would be glad to consider adding them . Also , if you think that the current system has better features in some way I would be glad to hear why you think that is . <p> Your second point seems to be framed to contradict my ideas , but on closer examination contains elements that endorse it . I think it is disingenuous to say that a specialism can be resolved to following a set of predefined steps . I suspect that most people who specialise in anything would say this would be very unsatisfactory . There is a huge amount of extra value in experience and practice that adds points of skill and hard to communicate understanding that makes the difference between a specialist and someone with a manual . If I were to go to the dentist and the dentist told me that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will be fine because I have some instructions to follow , I would refuse treatment by them and go to find a specialist with experience . One of the other important features of Expert Government is that anyone can make a policy suggestion . Naturally , it is unlikely that it will be helpful unless they are making a suggestion on a subject they specialise in , but the right is there to be used . I think you may be assuming that experts agree on everything . This is certainly not the case . I am sure that a number of experts asked to deliberate on a matter will come up with a range of ideas and have to thrash out an agreement . Having a number of experts in each specialism is intended to ensure that all possible understanding and the full range of possibilities are discussed . <p> Your penultimate point is a philosophical difference . I doubt we could survive without either collaboration or competition , but in government at least I am inclined more to the collaborative style rather than the combative . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government being based on contrariness . Even if each party has equally valid views on policy , the change in policy is disruptive , as many people are now experiencing . The current system requires that each party differentiate themselves . Even if by chance a party has the perfect set of policies , there would be others telling us that they do not . Given that running a country is a complex task , in my view it would be better if all people worked together rather than hindered each other . PM questions plays out this immature practice of contrariness in a very public way . <p> Concerning your last comment ; I know some very clever people , and I have to tell you that they are not great at everything . That is the nature of being specialised . The more time one spends at being good at something , the less time one has to spend on other things . Which one values most depends on what one wants doing . For example , I would not ask a particle physicist for advice on the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialised people to give the best possible advice , so it is necessary that we only obtain their views only in their specialisms . <p> " I think it is disingenuous to say that a specialism can be resolved to following a set of predefined steps . I suspect that most people who specialise in anything would say this would be very unsatisfactory . There is a huge amount of extra value in experience and practice that adds points of skill and hard to communicate understanding that makes the difference between a specialist and someone with a manual " <p> What do I care if people are unsatisfied with the truth ? Ask a hundred Physicians how to treat a cold and you 'll get very similar answers . Ask 100 mechanics how to change breaks on a car and you would get almost identical answers . <p> Government on the other hand includes philosophy , social science , political science , legal theory , etc. , all things that are in constant change . There is no straight line to determine which way is the best way , it occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process ( to thedegree that that 's possible ) . <p> Also , you claim to value experience and practice , as you should , but you then limit everyone to one term . Not sure how that squares . <p> ' I would not ask a particle physicist for advice on the best method of cleaning an oven . ' <p> You are taking my simple analogy too far . The important point is that deliberation on any important matter is best done by people who are specialists in that matter . Clearly you believe that government is something that is not well understood . This is because we have a few generalists considering matters instead of many specialists . I am not saying that specialists will know the answer to everything , just that they must inevitably be better than the generalists . <p> Limiting people to one term means that more people get the opportunity to influence policy ; this conforms better the principal idea in democracy than representative democracy . <p> AHA ! Exactly what I have been saying ... Human Nature must be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Beings tend to do when given a power such as this ' Expert System " . I think it is time for you to breathe new air and rethink the issues that compell you to want to develop a solution to these percieved problems . <p> I would n't call this " Foolish " , as I am sure Gebyatt is no fool nor wishes to be ; I would call it restrictive in process and I ask him to loosen up a bit a get more fluid in his thoughts and to think more deeply about the solutions for the problems . I have offered some advice and even a chance for others to scllaberate with me on my theories and pehaps all of us find a workable solution that once presented would gain notariety and acceptance , even if not successful we could

##173150 <p> ZOE was found outside the shelter on Samos at the end of June . She was sick and extremely malnourished ( definitely the thinnest dog I have ever seen ! ) , with every bone visible through the skin . That she had survived for as long as she had was a miracle and it was her will to live which prompted the shelter volunteers ( but Zoe was cared for in the house ) , especially Carolien , to do everything they could to save her , preparing for her special foods , with supplements etc . For a while it appeared that she would pull through , but sadly her stomach and intestines had shrunk too much and while she had a good appetite , her body could n't process the protein , which meant that she could n't gain weight . Zoe became weaker as days went by and on 10 August she tragically lost her battle for life ... <p> Carolien 's obituary to Zoe .... <p> " It 's difficult for me to write about Zoe , because she touched my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her illness , the treatment we gave her etc , but that is now not important . I want to tell you about her -- Zoe -- so that you too will get to know her and understand why I was so touched by this courageous soul . <p> It all began when she came walking ( which she barely could ) to the shelter -- the skinniest dog I have ever seen ! <p> The pads on her paws were damaged due to walking on rough ground and there were open sores on her hip bones . She was so thirsty and hungry , it was clear it had been a long time since she had any food or water . <p> We took her home for a leishmania test , which was negative and we put her on a drip for a few hours , to rehydrate her body . We also gave her vitamin injections . <p> The first 3 days she did nothing but eat , drink and sleep . She did n't seem to gain any weight , her weak body could no longer digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . <p> I know that the day of having to make a decision to put her into sleep was drawing closer , but every time I thought ' today is the day ' , she appeared to pick herself up and give the impression that she was n't ready to stop fighting . <p> I took her home and I spent many hours with her on my bed , comforting her and letting her know how much she was loved . That 's what she craved most ... love ! <p> For a while it seemed that she was getting stronger , if only slightly and she even tried to come with me and George ( my adopted dog ) for a walk . <p> She was always happy when I came home , tapping her bony tail gently .... but gradually she became weaker and for a few days she could n't walk at all . <p> I could feel she was still happy and that she just could n't let go of the love and happiness she had just found . She really wanted to get well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would dispel them by eating her next meal with great appetite , as if to show me she was still fighting . <p> So I fought with her . But after a while her body temperature fell far below normal and did n't go up again . <p> She had diarrhoea , this time with blood .... she almost did n't eat anymore . I felt that if I really was a true friend to her , I would have to say good-bye to her . <p> My friendship with Zoe was short , but it will be forever . She taught me that sometimes you have to listen to your heart instead of your head . <p> When I first saw her , I knew that there was little chance she would make it , but her will to live was so strong , she was n't ready to die . There are times when we must try to ' tune in ' to how an animal may feel before making decision about their future . <p> I can only hope that she was ready to let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coming into my

##187951 <h> Frequently Asked Questions <h> Frequently Asked Questions <p> A player is injured . In the contract the following provision has been made : The club is allowed to terminate the contract immediately if the player gets injured . <p> A player signs a contract with the following clause : if the player will not pass the medical tests of the club , the contract will be null and void . <p> Answer : One of the principles of the FIFA-regulations is the contractual stability . In article 18.4 of the FIFA rules is explicitly provided , these clauses are not valid . <p> 2 . Validity of a contract dependant from performances <p> Is the following clause valid ? <p> A contract has been signed with the following clause : If the coach issues a bad report on the player 's performance , the club has just cause to terminate the contract without any further financial duties . <p> Answer : According to the firm jurisprudence of the DRC , the principle of contractual stability , a contract can not be dependant on the performances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily abused . This is not a valid clause . <p> 3 . Just cause and non-payment of the player <p> A club has not paid a player for 5 months . Does the player have a just cause to terminate the contract <p> Answer : The player has just cause to terminate the contract . The DRC has well established jurisprudence in which is decided , that just cause at least can be assumpted if the player has not been paid for 3 months . Under special circumstances this also can be 2 months . Before the termination the club has to be put in default advisably in writing by registered mail . <p> 4 . Are unilateral options valid ? <p> A contract contains the following option : A contract has been signed for a year . The contract will be automatically extended for one year , unless the club has informed the player 2 months before the termination of the contract , that the contract will end . The salary will be raised automatically with 10% if the contract has to be prolonged . There are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not valid . According to the Bueno-Rodriguez-case and more recent in the Almiron-case , the CAS and the DRC decided that a unilateral option of a club is not compliant with the principle of the stability of contracts . However there can be special circumstances at hand that will lead to another outcome . <p> 5 . Validity of long contracts with younger players <p> A 17-year old player has signed a contract for 5 years . After three years , the player signs a contract at another club . In the FIFA regulations is established , that only 3-year contracts are permitted if a player is younger than 18 years old . What is the consequence of the 5-year clause ? <p> Answer : A contract for 5 years is not in compliance with FIFA Regulations . The contract converts to a 3-year contract and expires after the third year . No compensation has to be paid by the new club or the player . <p> 6 . Compensation for the education of players <p> In France a player was educated by a professional club . In the CBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign a contract with his club if offered . This player however did not sign the contract , but decided to go to a club abroad . The club has asks for a compensation for the breach of contract . Is the player 's new club obliged to pay this compensation ? <p> Answer : The European Court of Justice has decided that the player ca n't be forced to stay at the club , that educated him if the agreement is not signed . The compensation for training and education has to be fair and a compensation for the real damage the club has suffered . This will be the costs of the education . The FIFA Regulations have a provision for training compensation . This system is likely to meet EU requirements . <p> 7 . When are young players allowed to make an international transfer ? <p> A 14-year old boy plays in his home country . He has been asked to come and play in another country . For his mother a job is arranged . The contract is signed , but the national association refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly by not issuing the international certificate ? <p> Answer : In the FIFA Regulations a special provision has been made for young players to protect them from going abroad too young . Only 3 exceptions are made . At first the players are allowed to go abroad if parents move to another country for another reason than football . The second exception is if the player lives only 50 kilometres or less from the border of the country he wants to play and the new club is domiciled also within 50 kilometres from the border on the other side . The third exception is only applicable for EU players between 16 and 18 years . The clubs can sign contracts with these players if they are properly housed and get proper football and academic education . <p> In this case none of the exceptions apply . The national football association was right not issuing the transfer certificate . <p> 8 . Does the contract of a player end if the player is not granted a visa or a working permit ? <p> Answer : According to the FIFA regulations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working permit or visa . The validity of the contract is not affected by these permits . <p> 9 . Are the WADA-doping rules applicable for footballers ? <p> Answer : Doping is forbidden in sports , also in football . In each country the national doping authority and the national football association have to implement the WADA-rules . <p> 10 . Are WADA-whereabouts applicable in football ? <p> Answer : The whereabout-rules apply for all athletes in an elite pool . Also football players have to report their 24/7-activities as well as the availability to undergo doping tests even at home . In professional football FIFPro and its members are pleading not to implement this harsh procedures in football , because in team sports the players can undergo the test at the club . Apart from that , according to FIFA figures doping hardly exists in football . If any players are tested positive , in almost all cases party drugs are involved and no performance enhancing drugs . <p> 11 . Is a National Dispute Resolution Chamber ( NDRC ) always competent to decide on football-related issues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always competent on international football-related issues . If a NDRC is established it has to meet the conditions as provided in the # 1010 and 1129 circular letters of FIFA . <p> The most important issue is the composition of the deciding body . It has to be equally composed by players- and clubs-representatives . If the NDRC does not meet these ( and other ) criteria , the NDRC is not competent to decide in international matters instead of the FIFA DRC . If the case implies an international transfer the FIFA DRC remains the competent body . <p> 12 . Is the DRC competent on all football-related international matters ? <p> Answer : The FIFA DRC is not competent to deal in all football-related matters . The FIFA DRC is only competent on matters with an international dimension . Sometimes this can be hard to determine . Furthermore , the FIFA DRC is not competent if the parties have the opportunity to lodge the

##198251 <p> We thought you 'd be interested in finding out about someone whose job is to repair cellos and other stringed instruments . So this month 's e-letter is an interview with luthier Sarah Peck from Stringers instrument shop in Marylebone , London . <p> Sarah welcomed us into her workshop beneath the shop . There are bridges hanging up to dry in the window , cellos and violins in different states of repair and tools wherever you look , but not tools you 'd recognize , " What are these ? " we kept asking . On the walls are posters of Stradivarius instruments . Sarah told us , " Stradivarius started making instruments when he was 8 or 9 years old - that 's why the instruments from that time are so beautiful , they started to learn from such a young age . " Sarah herself is lovely - warm , personable and really interesting to talk to . It felt a real privilege to be given a glimpse into her world . <p> We began by asking her , <p> What is a luthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes instruments or mends them . It comes from the word for a lute maker but over the years it 's come to mean an instrument maker . <p> But your work here is repairing instruments rather than making them ? <p> Yes , repairing and restoring . Repairing is when it 's something simple . Restoring is where you get an instrument that has n't been played for a long time - it can have any number of problems - and you put it back into playing condition . Restoration is usually something that takes a long time . Sometimes instruments come to me in pieces - that 's a restoration . <p> How did you train to be a luthier ? <p> I trained for three years in making viola de gamba and early string instruments in Massachusetts , then for a further three years at an instrument making college in Sussex . Since then , I 've made a violin , viola and several viols . <p> Are there many female luthiers ? <p> There are a fair number - not as many as there are men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent ( in Europe ) than in England . <p> Did you want to be a luthier when you were a child ? <p> No , I wanted to be a marine scientist ! I studied marine biology but then I switched to instrument making . Whatever I did , I wanted to be hands-on , so I transferred that to my love of music . There must be something about marine scientists and cellos ! Did you see our April Fool e-letter about the scuba diving cellist ? <p> What skills do you need to be a luthier ? <p> Well , it helps if you have woodworking skills . When I started , I learnt woodworking and repair and restoration at the same time which was difficult . I think the skills are patience and problem-solving and it 's good to have a musical ear . <p> Do you play an instrument ? <p> I play the guitar and the viola de gamba . I could be a better violin player if I practised and I 'm trying to become better on the cello - I can play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've seen to a cello ? <p> One cello came into the shop after a girl had left it on its back in front of the sofa and her little brother jumped off the sofa and both his feet went through the front of the cello . <p> I also saw a cello that was completely riddled with woodworm . It had holes in the ribs and everything was cracked . I did put it back together . Sometimes you have to look at an instrument and decide whether it 's worth working on . But it 's up to the customer too - some people are very attached to their instrument and they 'll do anything to keep it together . <p> If the soundpost falls down , can you stand it up again ? <p> Yes , you can , there 's a special tool for doing that called a soundpost setter . I remember when I first started , it took me all day to put a soundpost up and I still had n't managed it . It took me about a year to become proficient at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With children , the most common thing is letting the bridge warp forward . It can be prevented if you push the bridge back - but people find that a scary thing to do . A much more serious thing is the neck snapping - often that happens because a cello has been left standing upright instead of being laid on its side . It can be mended but the instrument loses all its worth because it can be repaired but it might not last . <p> Amongst professional cellists , it tends to be soundpost adjustments and other minor things . Cellos also come in with open seams - that 's when the top plate and / or the back plate come away from the ribs ( the sides of the cello ) . It happens with age and with the changing weather - the glue will go - it 's a completely natural thing . In America , a lot of cellists have a summer bridge and a winter bridge and a summer soundpost and a winter soundpost because the humidity changes so drastically . <p> You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? <p> When I first started , I cut myself a lot - not so much now . <p> What 's your favourite part of the job ? <p> I guess it must be finding out what the instrument sounds like at the very end of a restoration . <p> Do you get nervous when you are repairing a very valuable instrument ? <p> Yes ! <p> Is it a bad idea for people to try to repair instruments themselves ? <p> Yes - because there 's so much stuff that is specific - the type of glue and how much glue to use and if you do it wrong you are damaging the instrument and when it does come in to me it takes twice as long . We use reversible glues - that 's the whole idea of repair and restoration - you want to keep the instrument going . So if I have to take the top of a cello off , when I put that top on again , I do n't want to use a lot of glue because the next person who has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to be permanent and some things you want to be reversible . <p> Which of the string instruments is the most fragile ? <p> The cello - they 're all fragile but cellos can be damaged more easily . It 's difficult with cellos because they are big instruments and the cases are very heavy to carry but the covers are n't sturdy enough to really protect the instruments . <p> Do you have a message for little cellists ? <p> Yes - practise ! It pays off ! When I was a kid , I played the trumpet and of course I did n't want to practise . I wanted to go outside and play . So I used to forge my parents signature because they had to sign that I 'd practised for half an hour .

##207452 <h> The First English Family Letters <p> Maurice Keen chronicles a set of 15th century letters - the product of everyday communication between English gentry and officialdom - and suggests how their contents may change the reader 's views of the late middle ages . Helen Castor offered her own contemporary historiographical account in 2010 . <p> The fifteenth century is withut any great chronicle ; it has no Froissart , no Mathew Paris to tell its story once and for all . The chronicles of London or of the White Rose are disjointed and fragmentary ; many of the most famous incidents of the Wars of the Roses are known to us only through the writings of the Tudor historians . But if chronicle histories are less numerous and less comprehensive than before , in the fifteenth century a new source for historical study becomes for the first time important -- collections of private letters . The word private is important ; letters have survived from earlier periods , but they are mostly of an official nature -- the formal letters of public men about public business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who now begin to leave us their correspondence , although locally people of wealth and weight , were not in the forefront of political affairs . They were well-established gentry , the middle people , for whom political events had their sometimes terrible consequences but were were not themselves responsible for them . Their testimony is doubly interesting : not only are their letters a valuable record , they also give us a touchstone whereby to gauge thc reaction of the ordinary , prosperous individual to contemporary events . <p> Moreover , even in the simple matter of events the letters can furnish us with valuable evidence . Among the Paston letters there is one dating from 1440 that throws interesting light on the negotiations undertaken with France through the Duke of Orleans , who had been a prisoner in England since Agincourt , and on the Duke of Gloucester 's opposition both to his release and to the policy of peace : <p> " The Duke of Orleans hath made his oath on the sacrament , never to bear arms against England , in the presence of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proving my said Lord Gloucester never agreed to his deliverance , when the mass began he took to his barge . " <p> Throughout the letters , passages like this crop up , giving a sudden and more vivid glimpse of some event of the time . <p> The Paston letters do not really become important for the political historian until about the time of the fall of Henry VI 's favourite , the Duke of Suffolk . Although they had on occasion suffered at his hands , the Pastons were warmly on the side of their great neighbour ; the articles of his impeachment were interesting enough to John Paston for him to preserve a copy of them , and this reaction of his is almost as interesting as the document itself . William Lomnour 's letter to Paston -- " a little bill so washed with tears that hardly ye shall read it " -- is easily the best account of the Duke 's cruel death on his way to exile , at the hands of pirates . <p> " In the sight of all his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat ; and there was an axe and a stock , and one of the lewdest of the ship bade him lay down his head , and he should be fair fared with and die on a sword ; and he took a rusty sword and smote off his head with half-a-dozen strokes ; and they took away his gown of russet and his doublet of velvet mailed , and laid his body on the sands of Dover . " <p> Again , among the Stonor letters there is an excellent account of the first battle of St. Albans , the first pitched battle of the Wars of the Roses , the most detailed record of it that we possess ; while John Payn 's letter to Paston , telling of his adventures at the time of Jack Cade 's revolt , gives as clear an impression as any source of the hardships of that time and the miseries that the rebellion brought to many people of good standing who were involved . <p> Perhaps as interesting and important as any of the letters is the one that his brother Clement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1461 , when the Pastons were on the Yorkist side -- were , indeed , relying on its success for their good fortune in their litigation over the estate of Sir John Fastolf . " It is well do , and best for you , " writes Clement , " that ye would come with more men and cleanlier arrayed than another man of your own country would , for it lieth more upon your worship and toucheth you more near than another man of that country , and also ye be more had in favour with my lords here . " <p> Throughout this period the letters , especially those of the Pastons , are of first-class importance in tracing its tangled history . There is little enough news , it is true , of battles or of fighting , but the regular bulletins from London relations and the general tone show how deeply even a moderate country family was certain to be involved in the struggles of political faction . Sometimes the letters become a primary authority ; always they are invaluable in assessing the state of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the letters bring us into direct contact with great figures or stirring events -- into that kind of personal contact that no chronicle history can ever provide . One might instance the grumbling letter of an English soldier in France , impatient with Henry V 's negotiations with the Dauphin in 1419 : " Certes all these ambassadors be double and false . Pray for us that we may come soon out of this unlusty solder 's life into the life of England " -- it brings suddenly home the familiar home-sickness of the soldier abroad , and the human life and gossip of the camp in an army in times which , if romantic , are often too distant to come readily to life . <p> Or there is the letter written by the Duke of Suffolk to his son " giving him very good counsel , " the last letter that he ever wrote , and of which Paston kept a copy , a letter that brings us into touch with one of the greatest men of the time and that must sway any historian who attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , " as Lingard wrote , " that the writer could have been a false subject or a bad man . There is something pathetic in the ring of it ; in the devotion to the monarch who had turned against him : <p> " Above all earthly thing , be true liegeman in heart , in will , in thought , in deed , to the king our elder most high and dread sovereign . . . charging you , as father can and may , rather to die than to be the contrary , or to know anything against the welfare or prosperity of his most royal person , but as far as your body and life may stretch , ye live and die to defend it . " <p> Look , too , at the parting injunction , to live " in such wise that after the departing from this wretched world here , ye may glorify Him eternally among his angels in heaven . Written of mine hand the day of my departing from this land -- your true and loving father , Suffolk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the finest types of the old chivalry that was passing away " ; his last words in his letter lay bare the tragedy of the servant loyal still in spite of exile and disgrace , a tragedy standing out in all its personal poignancy from the dusty records of faction and intrigue that seem so often to be the stuff of fifteenth-century history . <p> In quite a different spirit , the letter of Robert Wennington , the West Country pirate , which also comes from the Paston collection , brings us up against a personality ; a pirate of the same bold , confident stamp as the adventurers of Elizabeth 's time , Hawkins , Drake or Oxenham , who did not care overmuch for odds when booty was at stake : <p> " I and my fellowship said , but unless he will strike down the sail , that I would oversail him by the grace of God , and God will send me wind and weather ; and they bade me do my worst , because I had so few ships and so small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday last was , we had a good wind , and then we armed . . . and made us ready to oversail them . . . and there yielded all the hundred ships to go with me to what port me list . " <p> It is only when one comes across such a letter as this that one is reminded that the Tudor age grew directly out of the fifteenth century ; the spirit that brought it to its greatness was growing up in the years after Agincourt , the battle which more than any other event had awakened a new national consciousness . <p> Yet if every now and again they illumine some great event and bring it close to us , the general tone of the letters is in a minor key . If they can be at their most useful when they throw light on the incident of politics , the bulk of them do far more to enlighten us about social and economic history , the story of the everyday life of men and women . It would be hard to work up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for a nineteenth-century novel of the good bourgeois brought up in comfort and in the most conforming of homes , yet every once in a while confronted with the horrid pains of life , mental and physical , face to face -- this would be less hard . Their foci of interest are never earth-shaking . <p> In the time of William Paston the main theme of the letters is the lawsuit between the old judge and the so-called Prior of Bromholm , John Worte . In the next generation , interest still centres very often in litigation ; after the death of Sir John Fastolf in 1459 , concern as to the disputes over his inheritance monopolizes more and more attention -- indeed John Paston 's interest in politics in this period is very largely governed by regard for his lawsuit . John needed to take good care for his own , especially in the ungoverned period of Edward IV 's struggle with Warwick and the readoption of Henry VI -- in 1469 the Duke of Norfolk , pursuing a claim to the Fastolf property , besieged Paston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curiously enough , the other collections are less important for the political historian than the Paston letters . The Stonors were bigger folk ; one of them , John Stonor , had been Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas for more than twenty years under Edward III , while the last of them , Sir William Stonor , was with Lord Lovell one of the most important figures in Buckingham 's rebellion against Richard III in 1483 . Yet the majority of their letters relate to family affairs and business ; the most interesting are those to and from a relative William , who was a merchant of the Staple in the years 1475 to 1480 . The main matters of the Plumpton correspondence ( the letters of an old Yorkshire family ) are again lawsuits and family disputes . The Cely papers come from a family of London merchants and wool-mongers ; their greatest interest is for the light they shed on commercial relations with Flanders and on the garrisoning of Calais , where the Celys had a place of business . The letters of John Shillingford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit between the citizens and Edmund Lacy , the bishop , which arose between the years 1447 and 1450 . The round of everyday affairs and business is the main concern of all the important collections . <p> Even thus , out of the limelight , the letters bring the life of the times closer than mere records or accounts ever could , for the personal element is always there . The Celys lay aside affairs when the married merchants of Calais challenge the bachelors to a shooting match . <p> " And it would please you for your disport and pleasure upon Thursday next coming to may with us . . . ye shall find a pair of pricks of length between the one and other 13 tailor 's yards met out with a line ; there we underwritten shall may with as many of you , and shoot with you at the same pricks for a dinner or a supper per 12d a man . " <p> These kind of details , almost modem in tone , abound ; Margaret Paston writes to her husband that he will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife ; Jane Stonor writes that she " would rather break up household than take sojournants , for servants be not so diligent as they were wont to be . " On the other hand , there is an endless host of little items to testify to how different a world it was , and with what different assumptions . Shillingford writes home to his fellows , full of nave and innocent exultation in his own good handling of the justices in their case : <p> " as my lord Chancellor bade the justice to dinner against that same day saying that he should have a dish of salt fish ; I hearing this , I did as methought ought to be done . . . and sent thither that day 2 stately pickerells and 2 stately tenches , which my lord Chancellor made right much thereof . . . for it came in good season , for my lords the Duke of Buckingham and the Marquess of Suffolk and other dined with my lord Chancellor that day . " <p> This is an unfamiliar way of administering justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out of place . <p> Likewise , when we come to marriage , it may startle us for a moment to find Margaret of Anjou , as a girl of barely twenty , writing to Dame Jane Carew , a widow of thirty-six , <p> " for as much as our trusty and well-beloved squire Thomas Burneby , as well for the great zeal , love and affection he hath to your person , as for the womanly and virtuous governance that ye be renowned of , desireth with all his heart to do you worship by way of marriage ; we , desiring the furtherance and preferment of our said squire . . . pray you right affectuously that at reverence of us you will have our said squire towards his said marriage . " <p> There is plenty about marriage in the Paston letters , but it is nearly always the economic side that looms largest ; when Margery Paston married below her station for love , there was a family outcry and the Bishop of Norwich was even called in to dissuade her from this appalling msalliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle in the end ; her love letters are among the most appealing in the whole collection . <p> The arrangements for a normal marriage were endlessly complicated in the effort to secure the maximum advantage ; a marriage agreement in the Trevelian papers even provided compensation in the case of the death of a party before full value had been obtained . " Furthermore provided if it hap the said Elizabeth to decease within twelve months next after the said marriage , that then the said Thomas ( her father ) shall repay to the said John ( Trevelian ) 100 marks . " <p> Even in the smaller , everyday things there is a strange unfamiliarity . Growing up was a much tougher process for children of both sexes than it has since been . Elizabeth Clere writes to John Paston of his young sister , " she was never in so great sorrow as she is now-a-days , for she may not speak with no man how so ever he come . . . and she hath since Easterne the most part been beaten once in the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her head broken in two or three places . " Agnes Paston 's delicate request to her son 's tutor , " that he will truly belash him , till he will amend , " is only less surprising . All these details , small as they are , remind us that we are moving in a world of quite different conventions ; they help the historian to think himself back into a past that is gone beyond recall . <p> Much of the dead past lies embedded in the letters like fossils in the rock ; yet , if there is one feature of them that must be stressed , it is their newness , for they are the first private letters of English people that have survived . This is important ; it brings out a side of the century 's history that is often enough forgotten . We are so accustomed to thinking of the middle of the fifteenth century as a period of wild political disorder that we are apt to assume automatically that the arts and learning were also in decline . This impression is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater part of them are autograph , even those written by women ; and they bear witness to a surprisingly high standard of literacy among the merchant classes and the country gentlemen . <p> Excited by these suggestive facts Kingsford and others have brought together a clear body of evidence pointing to the steady spread of education , particularly among laymen , during the fifteenth century . It is the period of the foundation of numerous schools and colleges , of Eton by King Henry VI and of Magdalen by Waynflete . In 1446 an ordinance was passed in London limiting the licensed schools to five , but there were in fact many more , and the reason for the measure was the eagerness of parents to send their children to schools , regardless of whether the education they received there was good or bad . The universities of the fifteenth century have been called dead , but this seems to be very far from being exact ; if an Italian visiting scholar in 1422 could write that Oxford scholars delighted more in scholastic disputation than in the new learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtaining his degree should seem to have been that his guests were satisfied with the banquet that he provided for the occasion , one must not lose sight of men like Flemming of Lincoln or Sellyng , said to have been a fellow of All Souls , both diligent collectors of manuscripts of classical authors , or Thomas Chandler , the Warden of New College , who invited Cornelius Vitelli to come and lecture in Greek at Oxford . Grocyn , who was a student in the college under him , lived to be the friend of Colet , More and Erasmus . <p> Throughout the period of the Wars of the Roses , the seeds of English culture were growing ; there was a new avidity for books in the English tongue . Trevisa 's translation of the old Latin Polychronicon found a ready public ; it is significant that most of the contemporary chronicles are in English . John Paston had a dozen or more books of romances , poetry and heraldry , together with the De Senectute and Arnicitia of Cicero ; even before the advent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Humphrey of Gloucester or Tiptoft , brought together large and valuable collections . The new literacy of the fifteenth century was to flower a hundred years later in the writing of the English renaissance in Elizabeth 's time . Its own literary products , apart from Malory , are banal enough , it is true , but the seed time was necessary for the harvest . <p> Perhaps it is this attention they call to the fifteenth century as a germinal period that is the most important feature for the historian of the letters that have been here considered . They paint in the background of a period in which two civilizations overlap -- a function the more important since if one looks only at the foreground the scene is still altogether medieval . Henry V , sans peur et sans reproche , gallant , pious , " and above all , " says Chastellain , " the Prince of justice , " is the last great king of English chivalry , the pattern of all that was best in the medieval conception of the monarch . Henry VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our medieval history . The vassals , too , be they courteous and wise like Suffolk , or like Warwick , Kingmakers , are medieval figures . The letters show one what is going on beneath this surface ; the rise in importance , in education and in ambitions of the smaller folk ; their everyday life that continues , very little affected , while the wars rage in the land . The chronicles can spotlight for us the great political events , the falls of kings and princes . The letters do what neither chronicles nor accounts nor public records can do ; they bring us into direct contact with the people . They are , in a sense in which the other sources are not , alive , because they are personal records . Whether it is the young Paston at Eton , writing to his elder brother that , " I may come and sport with you in London a day or two this term time , " or Mayor Shillingford , writing to his fellows in the early morning , full of cheer as ever : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this right yarely , merrily singing a merry song " -- whichever it be -- it is part of the common human experience , and there is a kind of pleasure in reading it that is not to be sought in the chronicles , be they never so full of rhetoric or of gossip . They can describe the high deeds ; but the letters bring 
##208650 <p> If Hanif Kureishi 's new novel has a fault , it is that its secondary characters are often so full of life that they upstage the principals and this is a fault for which most writers would cheerfully kill . The hero , Jamal , is not only in a reflective profession - he 's a Freudian analyst - but also at a stage of midlife limbo . He 's still involved with his 12-year-old son Rafi ( ' We touch fists and exchange the conventional middle-class greeting , " Yo bro - dog ! " ' ) , but on terms of armed truce at best with his estranged wife , Josephine . <p> No wonder the eye of the reader , that magpie , is drawn to Jamal 's rough diamond of a sister , Miriam , overweight and much pierced ( ' parts of her face resembled a curtain rail ' ) , reigning over the semi-criminal disorder of her council house , as she starts a relationship with her polar opposite , Jamal 's prissy yet wild intellectual friend Henry , a famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is the supreme distillation of various brands of bad news into a single prospective partner . On the other hand , as ' a Muslim single mother with a history of abuse ' who has few taboos and ' sees straight to the centre of things ' , she 's practically perfect . <p> In addition to his practice , Jamal has a reputation as a writer of case studies , presumably of an Adam Phillips variety , aphoristic and philosophical ( ' Why do you want to fail ? Why is pleasure hard to bear ? ' ) . Paradox comes with the territory , since the territory is the human mind , secreting paradox incessantly . At one stage of his past , for instance , Jamal wanted to be with a woman he did n't want , a seemingly heartless television producer , out of mourning for lost love . <p> Yet he can see beneath the veneer of unfeeling : ' For Karen , if anyone suffered , it was their own fault ; even if you were a persecuted black South African with no human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while , her callousness stopped bothering me because I saw how unbearable it was to her that anyone would hurt anyone else . For her , because it was unbearable it was untrue and she did n't have to look at it . ' <p> Jamal 's first experience of the talking cure ( as a patient , naturally ) is cathartic beyond the normal . After that first session , his body puts on quite a show . ' To prevent myself collapsing , I had to hold on to a lamp post . I began to defecate uncontrollably . Shit ran down my legs and into my shoes . I began to weep ; then I vomited - vomiting the past . My shirt was covered in sick . My insides were on the outside ; everyone could see me . It was n't pretty and I had ruined my suit , but something had started . ' He is on his way to spilling his big secret . <p> The secret would have to be pretty extreme to live up to those gastric fireworks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his student days in ' the mid-1970s ' . In fact , it must be the late , late mid-1970s - or even later than that - if he and his friends are already watching Sylvester Stallone films on television ( and the establishment of theocracy in Iran seems to happen very soon ) . One day , a glamorous Indian girl , Ajita , sits down in his philosophy class , carrying not textbooks but magazines , cigarettes and car keys . The daughter of a successful businessman , she turns out to live near him and offers him a lift home . <p> The disastrous events that destroy this relationship , though , do n't quite live up to their billing in the novel . Jamal is left with a sense of guilt that never goes away , even when he confesses to that first analyst and gets some sort of absolution . Right to the end of the book , the supposed stain remains . ' It can never be worked through or forgotten ; there will be no resolution . ' It 's obvious that guilt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often find remarkably inventive ways of living with themselves and guilt in books and films is largely a narrative device , a way of signalling not that the character has n't finished with the past but that the past has n't finished with the character . There are works in which guilt finds none of the expected purchase ( Woody Allen 's Crimes and Misdemeanours , Monteverdi 's The Coronation of Poppaea ) but they 're certainly in the minority . <p> In effect , Hanif Kureishi recruits a genre element , the figure from the dark past who threatens present stability , but he does it in his own way . When Ian McEwan borrows a thriller dynamic , he does it wholeheartedly , so that ( in Saturday , for example ) he delivers all the required climaxes and confrontations , while Graham Swift ( in The Light of Day , for example ) slows everything right down , creating suspense but not excitement . Kureishi steers a middle course , letting his plot advance in little surges which are then allowed to dissipate . <p> If the plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with the disappearance of an Ingres drawing causing much routine consternation ) , then that is no doubt deliberate . It was never an end in itself but a way of tying together the things that Kureshi does best : the sharp observation , the skewed perspectives . Jamal 's son sits ' crosslegged , attached to the TV by wires , clicking away like a widow at her knitting . Isolated figures murdered one another in what resembled the deserted Roman cityscapes of de Chirico ' . The inner dialectic between Kureishi 's bad-boy and respectable-citizen selves is richly productive here . Jamal 's record in relationships is pretty poor , but he is touchingly attached to the precious debris of botched loves and the passages about fatherhood are luminous . Not that this new man has grown out of the joys of strip clubs and paid sex or the consolations of drugs - all the old ones , plus Prozac . <p> Something To Tell You is a return to the territory of his first and still best-loved novel , The Buddha of Suburbia , but it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , My Beautiful Laundrette . At a luxurious party in Soho , Jamal meets ' a plump Asian in a Prada suit with a lot to smile about ' . This is Omar Ali , the character played in the film by Gordon Warnecke - in fact the hero , though Daniel Day-Lewis got most of the coverage . Omar sold his dry-cleaning and laundrette business in the mid-90s to go into television , making programmes ' for , by and about minorities ' and is now a Labour peer who supports the Iraq war . <p> The page or two about Omar Ali jars for a number of reasons . One is that writing about a gay Asian peer called Lord Ali can seem to be a way of getting at the gay Asian peer Lord ( Waheed ) Alli , who was barely starting out professionally when Stephen Frears 's film was released . It 's not as if there are vast numbers of gay Asian peers to choose from . More important , these passages turn Jamal into something less than the narrator he is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that is charged for any reader who has seen the film , neutral for Jamal himself . Mostly , Something to Tell You is a splendid ride , but just for a

##217250 <h> F1T racing American style - a brief history of the US Grand Prix 13 Nov 2012 <p> Watkins Glen , Indianapolis , even the Caesars Palace casino car park in Las Vegas - these are just some of the venues to have hosted Grands Prix in the United States over the years . In fact , this weekend the all-new Circuit of The Americas ( COTA ) in Austin , Texas will become the tenth . <p> Formula One racing ? s association with the great country began at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway - or the ' Brickyard ' as it is affectionately known - which dates back to 1909 . The first Indianapolis 500 was staged there in 1911 on a track surface consisting over three million bricks , hence the nickname . <p> Bizarrely , the Indy 500 was actually on the Formula One world championship calendar from 1950 to 1960 . However , it was virtually unheard of for any of the Formula One teams or drivers to make the trip to the States to compete in what was such a specialised race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any other round of the championship . <p> Stranger still , it was only once the 500 had disappeared from the calendar did the Formula One fraternity truly take up the challenge of the great race . Jim Clark finished second in 1963 in a Lotus . Two years later he went one better to take victory , again for Lotus , and in 1966 he followed Graham Hill home in a British one-two . <p> By this time the US already had its own Grand Prix on the Formula One calendar , the inaugural event having taken place at the Florida airfield circuit of Sebring in 1959 . Bruce McLaren was the first US Grand Prix winner , the New Zealander inheriting the lead after Jack Brabham ran out of fuel on the final lap . Aged 22 , it made McLaren the youngest Grand Prix winner - a record not broken until 2003 by Fernando Alonso ) . The race also featured one Indy refugee : Bob Ward , who had won the 500 earlier in the year , entered his Kurtis-Offenhauser , but the dirt-track car stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retired with clutch problems after 20 laps . <p> The race made a one-off trip in 1960 to the Riverside circuit in California , where Stirling Moss triumphed , before moving to what was to become its home until 1980 , Watkins Glen in upstate New York . Innes Ireland won the first Grand Prix there for Lotus , while in the following six years , Hill and Clark took three wins apiece with BRM and Lotus respectively . <p> Jackie Stewart and Tyrrell continued the run of British triumphs in 1968 , before Jochen Rindt finally broke the cycle with Lotus in 1969 . Lotus 's success continued in 1970 with new boy Emerson Fittipaldi taking victory . <p> The circuit was extended for the 1971 event and it was Tyrrell 's Francois Cevert who overcame team mate Stewart to take his one and only Grand Prix victory . Tragically , though , the circuit also claimed the Frenchman 's life in practice two years later . <p> Ferrari clinched their first US Grand Prix victory in 1975 , courtesy of Niki Lauda , and the Italian team were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Carlos Reutemann in 1978 and Gilles Villeneuve in 1979 . <p> James Hunt was a double winner at the track , taking back-to-back victories for McLaren in 1976 and 1977 , while Alan Jones and Williams claimed the final Watkins Glen win in 1980 . <p> By this time there was a second US race on the calendar . The United States Grand Prix West , or the Long Beach Grand Prix as it was also known , became part of the championship in 1976 , with Ferrari 's Clay Regazzoni the inaugural winner on the Californian street circuit . Then in 1977 Mario Andretti made history there by becoming the first and only American to win a round of the F1 world championship on home soil . <p> The confines of the walls that lined the Long Beach track meant that accidents were never far away , none worse than the 1980 shunt in which Regazzoni broke his back , ending his Formula One career and leaving him paraplegic . Nevertheless , the race continued until 1983 , after which organisers chose to switch to Indy cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Watson winning from 22nd on the grid , a feat not since equalled , and McLaren team mate Lauda finishing second having started 23rd . <p> In the meantime , another US race had appeared on the calendar in an even more unlikely venue - a car park at the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas . The make-shift track 's first race in 1981 , known not surprisingly as the Caesars Palace Grand Prix , was that year 's title decider , with Nelson Piquet 's fifth place enough to clinch the crown over rivals Reutemann and outsider Jacques Laffite . Alan Jones was the race winner . <p> In 1982 both titles were decided in Las Vegas , as it staged its second and last Formula One Grand Prix . Williams Keke Rosberg arrived as favourite , with his key rival Didier Pironi still hospitalised from his accident earlier that season . John Watson was his only potential threat , but a controlled drive to fifth was enough to make the Finn champion , while Ferrari took constructors ' honours . <p> Amazingly the Las Vegas event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1982 , along with Long Beach , the Canadian race and a new US round in Detroit , the traditional home of the American car industry . <p> The Detroit event - an a temporary street circuit - proved a relative success after Long Beach and Las Vegas , and remained on the calendar for seven years , providing several entertaining races . The first was particularly remarkable with Watson coming from a lowly 17th on the grid to take victory for McLaren . <p> The 1983 race saw a surprise win for Michele Alboreto and Tyrrell , while in 1984 an overambitious start-line move by Nigel Mansell triggered a first-lap pile-up and a restart . Nelson Piquet eventually won the race for Brabham . <p> Keke Rosberg was victorious in 1984 , before Ayrton Senna dominated the final three races in Detroit , winning twice for Lotus and the final time for McLaren . <p> The 1984 season saw yet another US venue added to the schedule - Dallas . A party thrown by the Benetton team at the Southfork Ranch ( made famous by the Dallas TV series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved less of a hit . Searing temperatures caused the surface to progressively disintegrate , with countless drivers crashing out after spinning on the marbles . Rosberg - aided by an air-conditioned skull cap under his helmet - won the race , but the enduring image was that of an exhausted Mansell pushing his stricken Williams across the line to take sixth . <p> Formula One racing in America finally re-settled in a single home in 1989 . With Long Beach , Las Vegas , Dallas and Detroit having all disappeared from the calendar , it was yet another street circuit , this time in Phoenix , which adopted the US Grand Prix . <p> And it was Senna who made Phoenix his home , winning two of the three races there . Alain Prost was the inaugural victor , finishing first ahead of only six other finishers . However , the 1990 event was the truly memorable one , with Senna having to fight hard to find a way past rookie Alesi to take the win . The champion passed the Frenchman once , but then had to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . <p> Formula One racing was then absent from US shores until Indianapolis put the series back on the map in 2000 , exactly 50 years on from the Indy 500 ? s first appearance on the championship calendar . In front of a sell-out crowd of 250,000 fans , Michael Schumacher was the first winner on the all-new track layout , a 4.2 kilometre ( 2.6 mile ) circuit combining the first corner and start-finish straight of the famous oval - run in the reverse direction - and a tighter infield section . Schumacher led home Rubens Barrichello for a Ferrari one-two , ahead of Heinz-Harald Frentzen ? s Jordan . <p> The 2001 race was overshadowed by the events of September 11 , but also provided a memorable Grand Prix as Mika Hakkinen took the final victory of his Formula One career . The 2002 event was memorable too , though for quite different reasons . Ferrari dominated the race , but when leader Michael Schumacher eased off on the final straight to set up a photo finish it didn ? t go quite to plan and Barrichello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second . <p> Schumacher and Ferrari went on dominate the United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis , winning five of the eight races held there up to 2007 , including the infamous 2005 event , which saw just six cars compete after all seven Michelin-tyred teams withdrew on safety grounds following the formation lap . <p> Now in 2012 , as Formula One racing returns to the United States for the first time in half a decade , it looks like it has finally found a permanent home at the Circuit of The Americas , the country ? s first track purpose built for F1 competition . And as COTA ambassador ( and 1978 F1 champion ) , Mario Andretti , puts it , ? it

So making people understand where they fit in to all that and what the value is to them . " <p> Describing Singapore as " the unofficial centre of ASEAN and becoming a kind of Asian trading hub for a lot of asset classes , " Nelson says the session will look at the huge changes happening there , with increased interest from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taiwanese banks starting to become members of the SGX . <p> " So , what is the client perception of all this ? There is a view that the SGX is trying a lot of things but some of them are struggling to get traction , " suggested Nelson . <p> " One of the things we 'll be looking at is the regulatory landscape in Singapore in juxtaposition with Hong Kong -- what is it like to be a broker based in Singapore compared with five years ago , and it 's changed radically in terms of how the Monetary Authority of Singapore manage and supervise you , and also how much capital they require from you . It 's a very different place and I think now is a good time to take stock and look at what it means for the average broker and whether it makes Singapore more or less viable as Asian hub . " <p> The ACC has just completed a survey of 150 brokers on the five biggest changes that have occurred for them in the last 12 months , with one theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers one , two , three and four , " says Nelson . " Collateral and liquidity were seen in the past as safe variables , and you could focus on issues such as operating costs and revenues , but now it 's another area through which everything has got to be viewed . " <p> Brokers in Singapore are having to behave like banks , from a capitalisation perspective , according to Nelson . " And that makes it interesting in terms of whether brokers will keep operating there , especially with the advent of remote trading , which hopefully will be coming next year . " <p> Looking to the future , the ACC seems unlikely to be short of topics . <p> " It will be difficult to do this for very long without doing a session on India , as there is so much market change going on there with the MCX being authorised and the Delhi Stock Exchange taking off as the high frequency trading exchange , and the Qualified Foreign Investors programme , " says Nelson .

##233152 <h> Living Room furniture <p> FONT= &quot]The; living room/FONT FONT= &quot]After; you are done with the living room in fresh wallpaper and paint , and are also through with the flooring and upholstery , how do you go ahead with buying the right furniture that goes with the colour and theme ? Is this a common picture you often encounter ? First of all , relax . You will most certainly come across a range of contemporary living room furniture that compliments your overall d ? cor and styling . But before you go out and shop for modern sofas , recliners and trendy entertainment units as everything else , here are a couple of things you might want to consider . <p> The Living room area <p> Ideally , the size of your furniture must be in proportion to the size of your living room . You don ? t want petite furniture for bigger spaces or something too bulky that occupies all the space . Work out on your personal taste and fit it with practical details like the room size and styling . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep in mind that heavy upholstery can make it look all crammed . You also get furniture that can function as day sofa and be transformed into a full-fledged bed . Do not forget to fashion the space in a manner that allows open room to move comfortably . For instance , a hi-tech spread out sofa would suit larger room settings . So , measure the area and try to buy furniture with size and details in mind . <p> Also pay attention to where exactly in the living room you want the furniture to be placed . Once you have decided , measure the area and then keep the dimensions in mind ( or jot it down on paper ) and keep it in mind while you make your selection . It is also important to take into account the space required between the wall and the furniture while measuring . <p> Styling and Upholstery <p> Depending on your taste and the furniture style , co-ordinate rest of the d ? cor in line with the furniture . Cushions , upholstery and curtains can be complimented in neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushions and curtains that do well with the theme , use them and also add something new that provides a resting space to the whole theme . A contrasting bowl , vase and even antique items in neutral shades do well to add a personal touch to your living space . <p> Sofas <p> There are a broad variety of sofa styles to boggle the mind , but once you discover your particular style , it will be easier . Your choice of sofa seating will depend not on your taste , but also on the number of people in the family and the available amount of space ( the measurements ) . A long sofa accompanied by one or two armchairs maybe all you need , and you will find many futon beds and modular sofa models that fill in the space with grace . The material should be chosen as per convenience and the time you can spend in cleaning . <p> /FONT FONT= &quot]Recliners; and Rocking Chairs <p> Reclining armchair or sofas make great luxurious furniture . With a built-in footrest , recliners provide superior comfort . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class to any living room . While recliners are mostly done in lush leather , you could add a contrasting wicker or wood rocker chair to add a more or unconventional feel . <p> Entertainment units/ TV Cabinets Modern day entertainment units combine features and functionality to offer great looking furniture units to stack , store and display . Depending upon the space , you can have a unit that compliments the theme and fits the space . <p> Coffee Tables <p> The coffee table makes a focal point for family and friends . A good coffee table should also offer convenient storage space to help reduce living room clutter . There are different styles and shapes that come with a choice of colour and finish . You can also add a contrasting coffee table to create a great corner for relaxation and play time . Solid oak coffee tables are a good choice . <p> my point of view is a bit modern , perhaps too modern to be acceptable by the majority but i think anyone who encourages people to treat living room furniture ( or any other furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than they are completely worn out , should have a week in the town stocks or a flogging ... <p> every piece of furniture has a great deal of energy invested in it from manufacture , through wharehousing to distribution ! that energy represents CO2 emissions and in the case of plastics , varnishes and paints represent much other pollution ! <p> nothing . absolutely nothing should be thrown away until it is totally without use or function ! every piece that is saved means another need not be manufactured to replace it ! <p> by all means it is acceptable to sell or give away to friends , neighbours or charity but too many people can not be bothered and just take stuff to their local tip . not a word of encouragement did jazmin2309 say about this ... <p> what is wrong with making your decor . suit your furniture ? in today 's world functionality is much more important than form . <p> people needing furniture should initially seek their rquirements from secondhand or charity shops , recyclers or small ads. after a few small repairs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ... <p> this is the only way we will save the planet ! <p> i do agree that solid

But personally I do find it strange that some people are offended by what I wrote . <p> And personally I do n't find anything in this thread to be in any way political .

So how will impartiality work , and who 's going to believe in thier so-called impartiality for a single second ? <p> There 's a conservative guy I really did n't like , an elderly ex-police officer who comes across a little fruity , and a labour candidate who did n't feel the need to answer all the questions defining what he 'd aim to do . <p> Not only do I think the position is a joke , but the candidates in my area at least are absolutely pathetic ! <p> To return to the subject of PCC 's . What real use are they ? None . I 've read the manifestos of those in my force area that could be bothered to write them , and frankly they are in lala land . Most are making promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do n't have the power to do what they claim . Some of the policies would be illegal for police to carry out ( breach of PACE , abuse of powers ) , even if they had the ability or power to insist they did . Will it bring more democracy to policing ? Nope , it will just be yet another Politician to pay tax to support , not to mention the undoubted growing entourage that will follow . The money this farce is going to cost should be spent on more police , not on a fantasy role . <p> I 've voted in every election since I was 18 &; have always been of the opinion : - <p> " If you do n't vote , you cant complain " <p> However , in this particular election I ca n't decide whether to abstain from voting or deliberately spoil my vote <p> I think this whole business is just increasing our tax bill to pay for another layer of " suits full of bugger all " <p> Quite agree . Must admit to having a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / Lab / UKIP and an " independent " who in my opinion looks a little dodgy .... Read through what they are going to do ... yeah right .. <p> Did n't vote , complete waste of time . We received only one leaflet , clearly titled - " your Conservative candidate for police commissioner " - so that would n't be at all political then ? I did see a little piece on Meridien news last week , where they filmed a bit of a debate with our candidates , fielding questions from the public . Quite frankly they all came across as total idiots , with three of them saying that they did not intend to claim their 80K salary if elected - why ? This to me , seems like another attempt by government to totally undermine the confidence of the police , to put in place some " police tsar " who knows nothing about policing , but will have a lot of say in how policing is carried out . <p> Seems to me it was easy enough to find details about the candidates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been an even greater outcry about that . <p> My reasons for voting were twofold . Like Garry , I personally feel a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices to give us the right to vote . We like to get in enough wars in the name of democracy so I might as well use one of its main " features " . Of course , this does not imply that anyone not voting is not appreciative of aforementioned sacrifices . They are simply using another feature of democracy ! <p> Secondly , my vote was to try and prevent someone ( party political ) that would state this as part of their policy , quote : <p> ? If elected every police station in xxxx will proudly fly the Cross of St George and will promote xxxx 's celebrations of St George ? s Day . " <p> Two candidates here . One tory , one labour . Both said roughly the same . Neither were worth voting for . Unless there is a ' none of the above ' option then if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate your displeasure with the options . Only thing left is to not vote . So I did n't . I did n't want either of them . The whole PCC thing is a stupid waste of money , like elected mayors . <p> The people of Bristol voted for an elected mayor . This is probably due to the uselessness of Bristol City Council and their inability to make decisions or do anything . The campaigning for the mayor yes/no vote was interesting - I summarize : <p> Against : The mayor will be an elected dictator , this is bad ! For : The mayor will be an elected dictator , this is good ! <p> Living just outside Bristol , I did n't get to vote on the mayor , but there was a steady stream of voters at the polling station I was at yesterday evening and when I went into my local polling station at 9.30pm on my way home last night to vote , another 5 people came in while I was there . It 's only a small village so all of us arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a total pretence of democracy if no one has any idea who is who and what is what . All the more reason to cast a vote of ' no confidence ' and void the vote , 80% like that and surely that would void the election ... or something similar . <p> It may have been ' organised ' in a shambolic way , and it may be a great pity that the system allows and even encourages political control of the police , but it is n't pointless and it is n't a sham . <p> If the new PCC 's do their jobs properly , they will hold the police accountable , for the first time . If they do n't do their jobs properly , they will be held accountable by the electorate . <p> In the past , the various police forces were ' supervised ' by committees made up almost entirely of local councillors and the like . A decision that turned out to be a bad one would end up being the responsibility of nobody - the Chief Constable is n't responsible if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he strongly advised them to make that decision . The committee is n't responsible either , as they simply followed the advice of an expert ... <p> Typical possible scenario from the past : A decision is made to contract certain work to a private Company , let 's call it G4T . The Chairman of the old police authority wants that to happen , for whatever reason , if he is n't actually a director or shareholder of G4T he can probably get away with not declaring his interest , whatever that interest may be . If he needs to declare his interest but ' forgets ' then he can put that right at the start of the next meeting , when the decision has already been made . <p> So , first he proposes that certain police functions should be outsourced to a private sector Company . Once that has been accepted , various private Companies are invited to tender . Only one does , probably because only one wants it , or only one was provided with all the info they needed to submit their tender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job so did n't go to the expense of tendering - so he proposes that G4T get the contract . He might organise for the decision to be taken when certain other committee members wo n't be present and so ca n't vote against it . <p> Over time , it all goes pear shaped - not his fault , it was n't anything to do with him , he was just the Chairman and he did n't even vote for it personally ... <p> In the future , only one person will make major decisions on this kind of thing . If the PCC leaves it to the Chief Constable , it will still be the responsibility of the PCC , just as it will be his/her responsibility if he makes the decision himself/herself . <p> " In the future , only one person will make major decisions on this kind of thing . " How is this more democratic than having a police authority made up of members from various poilitacal parties ? <p> Because democracy involves choice . By choosing to vote for the candidate of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a majority . That has to be better than a committee that nobody voted for surely ? <p> I wonder if there is any correlation between the perceived efficacy of a force and the number of candidates standing/turn out ? Where forces are doing well I 'd expect few candidates and low turns out as many will think it is n't broke so there 's nothing that needs doing . With lots of candidates standing in certain places it makes me assume that there must be something wrong in those force areas to warrant such an interest . <p> There were only 2 candidates in Staffs . Turn out was about 10-12% so the population really did n't have any kind of axe to grind anyway . <p> But we did vote for the members of police authority . Not directly granted , but the authority is made up of elected councillors . So we do away with a group of people making decisions and replace that with one person elected by 15% of the population and people think that is more democratic . <p> Well , even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by voting we can influence the result . <p> If we have political affiliations then we can vote for the political candidate of our choice . <p> If we are able to vote for a non-political candidate then we can try to keep politics out of the police in our area , if that 's what we want to do . <p> It 's possible , because of the shambolic ' organisation ' of this election , that the turnout will be extremely low . This means that every vote that is cast becomes much more significant . People have fought and died for the right to vote , it seems to me that we should not waste a right that people have fought for us to have . <p> By voting you give the process legitimacy , however I acknowledge your comment about people 's sacrifices to ensure we have a right to vote . <p> If this was a true democracy , there would always be a ' none of the above ' or similar choice on the ballot paper . <p> In this instance HMG have basically said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give a stuff , here are your options ' . <p> By not voting people have said that they wo n't be bullied , even under the pretence of ' choice ' . <p> If we had a choice then ' maintenance of the status quo ' would have been one of the options - and people could have voted accordingly . <p> Again , if we lived in a democracy then HMG would acknowledge the meaning of the low turnout and reconsider this policy . They wo n't , however , as they are not listening . <p> How on earth can these hypocrites say they are not worried by the low turnout and that the process still has legitimacy but that a workforce can not strike due to not ' having the majority mandate ' . <p> A spoilt ballot is an option but not the solution . If it is necessary that a workforce has to demonstrate a majority mandate then surely such a low turnout for these PCC elections

##280351 <p> Osama Bin Laden is dead , President Obama will announce , according to multiple news organizations . The U.S. is in possession of his body , a person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press late Sunday . <p> President Obama is scheduled to address the nation on the developments Sunday night . <p> It was unclear where how bin Laden was killed and how the U.S. captured his body . <p> Congratulations to SEAL Team 6 for a professionally executed raid that dispatched Bid Laden without hesitation or excess . No parading the body , just gather intel , blow the compound , and dispose of the body to deny Islamo-fascists their holy relics and shrine . Well done . <p> However , I 'm surprised that this bit of filth was living in a large compound in the centre of a city . I do not believe that the Pakistani intelligence service did not know he was there , or that this compound was rather ' surprising ' . Lots of questions need asking and answering . <p> why obama said that their is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with may be his wife . let obama chast netanyahoo. and all israeli criminals and kill them as also they are terrorists and killed so many palestinians and innocent one . <p> why justice only brought to any person who is muslim and not to any one who is criminals of israel and USA ! ! ! ! only a question needed to be answerd . <p> This man is responsible for the INTENTIONAL murder of thousands and thousands of civilians . Not just in New York , or only in the US , but around the world . <p> My first thought , when I saw this last night , was ... My god , I hope this does n't provoke an immediate attack of some sort , by an extremist group ( or individual ) in response . <p> My second thought was ... They just arrested some suspected terrorists on information of an planned attack in Germany , I hope the Germans are saved frome an attack because they were able to make those arrests . <p> My thrid thought was ... If extremists feel the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target , and I fear for Europeans . <p> Then , this morning , I read Momo 's comments , and all I see is another opportunity for her to call the US evil . To call us butchers . To accuse of of killing innocent civilians . <p> Momo , <p> A few days ago , you said you did n't think I said things to intentionally hurt people . Well , here 's a change of course . Go to hell , lady . <p> This man is responsible for the INTENTIONAL murder of thousands and thousands of civilians . Not just in New York , or only in the US , but around the world <p> Right . A terrible mass murderer . <p> For several reasons I would have preferred if he had been captured and put on trial . His death does n't trouble me , but I find the excitement exaggerated , and joy over any man 's death ( that so many people express just now ) repulsive . Relief that he ca n't commit more crimes , yes : I can share that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what has changed ? <p> My first thought , when I saw this last night , was ... My god , I hope this does n't provoke an immediate attack of some sort , by an extremist group ( or individual ) in response <p> I think you are overrating his importance . My first thought was : Oh this solves the mystery if he is hiding somewhere without the opportunity to do much harm or if he is already dead . The world had already moved on . <p> My second thought was ... They just arrested some suspected terrorists on information of an planned attack in Germany , I hope the Germans are saved frome an attack because they were able to make those arrests <p> Proper policing helps , but it is no guarantee . These arrests have triggered off a debate about the laws that took several of our freedoms away and that expire this year . They come under the name " anti-terror-laws " . You gueesed it : our hardliners want to prolong them . Our minister of justice ( definitely not a lefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the investigation that led to the arrests . I guess our hardliners will make the most out of this news . <p> My thrid thought was ... If extremists feel the need to attack quickly in response , Europe is probably an easier target , and I fear for Europeans <p> Possibly . You ought to know what policies I find useful in order to fight terrorism . Military means are not on my list , they increase our risk . <p> Then , this morning , I read Momo 's comments , and all I see is another opportunity for her to call the US evil . To call us butchers . To accuse of of killing innocent civilian s <p> And as long as the butchering goes on , I will go on to accuse . <p> Did you note your own switching of the object from " the US " to " us " ? Well . <p> Go to hell , lady <p> What do you think where I am ? I am already in a country that is part of the evil and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its participation in these wars .

It is the West itself , a different civilization , whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power . <p> Do you notice the switch from an oppressive influence to entire culture and all people ? The insinuation that all these people want to impose their culture and try to increase their power at all costs , which makes each of them a legitimate target ? It is the justification for total war , is n't it ? <p> It could be an Osama bin Laden quote . It 's a misquote , though : <p> The underlying problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism . It is Islam itself , a different civilization , whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power . <p> Samuel Huntington , the hero of neocon warmongers . <p> Alan , do you honestly believe that one side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral ? <p> iam abdulksaida , i still did nt read any comment , but want to say that all of us will die one day according to God will and according to God time specified to us and i want to say after i heard that the body of OBL was berried in the sea that is very ugly and make me realize me and milyar of muslims that islam is the only relegion which encourage to respect the body of all sorts of people even if criminal . <p> i remember that one day prophet mohamed ( pbuh ) get up for a jewish funeral and his companions were astonished to that as jewish did auful things in his time , but propeht mohamed ( pbuh ) said why ? he is a soul and we have to respect that ! ! ! ! <p> where is islam from those people whom throw OBL in the sea , i think they are zionists as they want to humulate islam and its people and also to reming that the zionist will throw palestinians or everyone in the sea and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he is burried , it is not islam and immoral . They are also terrorists . <p> even any normal person will not celebrate like what people did in USA and dance . Death has its own respect wheather the person is innocent or criminal . <p> for me even if the most terrorists died whom as a palestinian they are the Israeli leaders and USa administrators whom never chaste any criminal in israel , i will not go and dance in the street . really islam is the only relegion whom have the power to forgive and respect death for all people <p> even if saudi arabai refused , but it shows how you and your friends are so ugly and have no morals for the soul . you and USA administration are not power in their morals . we have something in islam that when prophet mohamed win the war against the disbelievers and he was able to kill them all after what they did to him <p> you know what he told them ? go you all are free . you know why ? because our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest one and tender and because of that he was able to spread islam and day by day increasing . <p> it is not only power , but morals more influence <p> by the way God only decided what will be happende to his body . may be no one can approach it even if he is in the sea . God only knows and it is not for sure that crabs will eat him ! ! any way ants also will eat all of us one day so be humple iron mike and when you or any one die we do nt know which animal will eat our body <p> remember God only and do nt joy very much , you do nt respect even death . one day will come to you also and really even me i feel sorry for even criminals . <p> I hope the intellegent go to israeli jails and see how much tortures the innocent people are suffered while israel also occupy and steal their country . I do nt think the people in Guantanamo knows much as it is now 10 years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> why u do nt torture other than muslims e.g the stealer of our land and killing innocent people or they are arabs and muslims and do nt deserve life . <p> thanks God that he is watching us and he is the one who knows who start killing innocent people . The justice is with God almighty and not with obama or israel or the terrorists . <p> by the way OBL was a result of the terrorism of USA administration , terrorism of israel and killing innocent muslims and the international west whom till now did nt give the justice to muslims in palestine . <p> Also why they did nt capture him ? are they afraid ? they want to hide evidences . <p> they can berry him in any place without telling . they have the power , but they do nt respect islam and muslims and that is very ugly . he is a muslim man and even criminals before they hang them e.g if they commit any criminal one sheik must come and pray for him . <p> any way God is more mercy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where to go after death . <p> what makes us muslims angry the way he was berried without respecting the death as if they are afraid from him even when he is died . where is the braveness ? <p> i heard that al azhar said the berry is not according to islam and that is not acceptable . <p> what makes us muslims angry the way he was berried without respecting the death as if they are afraid from him even when he is died . where is the braveness ? <p> I think recycling is very respectful of the earth and God who made it . There was no desecration of the body , like Islamo-fascists are famous for doing , contrary to what you claim the prophet would have them do . <p> " The coffin and body of special agent Francisco Javier Torronteras were pulled from the tomb in Madrid Sur cemetery in Carabanchel and pushed 1,000 yards in a wheelbarrow before being doused with petrol and set alight . <p> " The body was found with a pick driven into its head and a spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immediately apparent , police speculated that it could be the work of sympathizers of the Moroccan terrorist group that carried out the train bomb attacks in the Spanish capital on March 11 , killing 192 people and injuring 1,900 . <p> " The interior ministry said the act of desecration could have been part of ' an Islamic rite of revenge . ' " <p> Etc . Again : just in case you forget . <p> Perhaps you should Google how the bodies of US soldiers and contractors were treated by your fellow Muslims who danced while bodies were burned and hung from bridges . While you are researching that , be sure to look up US Army General " Black Jack " Pershing 's example for dealing with Islamic terrorists in the Phillipines . He would have buried OBL in a fresh pig-skin ! <p> Frankly , a respectful burial at sea for a mass-murdering terrorist is quite restrained . If Muslims wanted OBL to have a proper funeral , they had 10 years to kill him and spare us the trouble and expense . <p> His body should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the Nazis executed at Nuremberg . I hope he burns in Hell for eternity . <p> You should perhaps consider all those thousands of people Bin Laden killed or caused to be killed , the majority of whom were your fellow Muslims . Personally I would sooner he had died at the end of a rope , but I am content that he is dead . And so should you . <p> It is not a moral way and that would increase the hate of muslims to USA administration . really shame on USA administration to throw his body from the sea ? <p> why they did nt throw the terrorist american who explode innocent people in USA ? <p> why the christian terrorists and jewish terrorists were not captured and killed without trial and thrown in the sea ? <p> it is a crime to throw like that and very ugly and give that the most terrorist country in the world are USA administration with israel administration . <p> All agreed on the awful and not respect of islam and muslim in the berry . I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt understand how the vatican said that obl increase the hate in the rejon. please tell the vatican that who start to kill muslims and arabs in palestine and steal the country and who invade afganistan and iraq for no reason and killed so many innocent muslim people is the one who is responsible for the hate . <p> never one time you said about the crimes of israel of killing so many innocent palestinains . you is never neutral . it seems you represent your church . also the vatican said something not correct . the one who is responsible for the hate is the one who first invade the country and kills innocent people <p> owly <p> before obl how many innocent muslims killed in palestine , somal , iraq and in many muslim countries and you did nt even mention them . i know why ? becasue they are not cristians like you . <p> owly <p> one day you will die and in our relegion we never said that person will go to hell or paradaze and i think even you are not abide to your pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition if one say that this person is going to hell , so Allah almighty will say who is that who said that . let him know that i will forgive to the person and that will enter hell . <p> so owly be caustion of telling that . who knows who will enter the hell ? <p> be humble you are from blood and flesh and one day all will be berried and be just and say the other people whom died from christian terrorists or jewish terrorist . be fair and just . <p> We are talking about Bin Laden . For your information I do not approve of many of Israels actions , but considering the terrorism of the Palestinians going back decades I do n't support your bloody soaked agenda . <p> so you are the army want to revenge from some ignorant people whom tortured some of your soldiers. ! ! is that wright so you are USA the goverment is the same terrorists and not better than others <p> that is the difference of the war and dignity in everything . no respect is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to revenge from the killer of their innocent people then America and israel will hit them from above with fatal weapons . how many civilians iraqi and afgani and bakistani and palestinians killed from raids of both terrorists countries . i cant count . why mike never give us the no of muslims innocent killed by your army and army of israel to be jsut . <p> so you are the army want to revenge from some ignorant people whom tortured some of your soldiers. ! ! <p> No . I am merely pointing what REAL disrespect of the dead truly is and where it comes from , those espousing your own religion . That kind of desecration of bodies does not come from my government or religion . I do n't want revenge ; that 's something Islamo-fascists want , including Palestinian . What I want is " justice " and since OBL refused to surrender , he received his justice on the spot---right in the head . <p> Consider the US knew where OBL was and could have bombed the entire compound turning it and everyone in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in commandos to attempt to capture and if unable to capture , then to kill the target . Mission accomplished . No revenge , but justice for the thousands of innocents killed by OBL and prevention of thousands more innocent deaths at his hands . <p> Yes , more Momoganda debunked . It took the killing of a mass-murdering , terrorist to bring Saida out of the shadows . I 'm not surprised that she still chooses to defend OBL . The enemy of my enemy ... yadda , yadda . <p> i was not of the shadow and i do nt think like you or others . iam not like what you try to portray , only as a muslim and we are proud to be muslims , i hate that you whom you do nt even believe in God or Allah the almighty try to teach us justice and who is the actual killer . Even if i hate the killing of innocent people and even many muslims are not with OBL , but they are angry that the west did nt respect his body as a dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn what America did of throwing the body in the sea and that is antiislamic way . <p> Iti is a crime to do that . The body of the dead has to be respected . <p> by the way mike . you said that he did nt serender and of course he will not . He left the living as kings with servants to its people and live in caves . He knows he will die like others , but american army can catch him without killing , and they killed also with him a women and 2 civilians , reporters said that they are his sons . so america like always killed innocent people . but who to punish america for that ? no one now , but justice will come as those innocent people whom died by the hand of America and israel is precious to God and to humanity . <p> I hate when Sutan as US Administration with israel administration breach us for democracy and for telling us about terrorists and do nt see themselves as terrorists also . really ironic <p> always u defend them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with her kids . they can capture them but they did nt any way we have God and really if America and israel are not involved in blood of innocent muslims we can agree with them against OBL , but they are also involved in blood shed of innocent people.that is my last word and i feel justice will not prevail as long as israel occupy muslim country . <p> i did nt understand what u want to say . are you mocking ? this is not a suitable place or time to mock on others . it seems you are not serious u and owly <p> the terror starts since israel occupy palestine and killed muslims there and then the cycle of hate start . if you want the cycle of hate to be ended give justice to palestinians and stop terroring them and never obl will appear . He is a reaction to murdering muslims all over the world . Stop murdering muslims and give palestine back to her people then peace will prevail all over the world . No body wants blood shed especiaaly innocent ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care at all for Palestinians Abdulksaida . He has shown callous contempt for poor people wherever they are . The Palestinian cause ( and it is a just one ) is better off without the support of people like him . <p> Yes , abdulksaida , I was mocking your sadness over bin Laden 's killing , and the fact that " innocents " died along with him . He apparently used his wife and two other women as human shields . Killed along with him were two of his couriers and his son Khalid . <p> As to your contention that the U.S. could have captured him , he was apparently offered the opportuntity to surrender and would not , and instead fired at U.S. Navy SEALs . He was then shot in the head , then once more to ensure he was dead . <p> Also belying your " they threw his body in the sea , " his body was apparently washed and wrapped in a shroud , in accordance with Muslim practices , words were spoken over him by a religious person and translated into Arabic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . This was more respect than he ever showed any of his victims , including those he sacrificed in the last moments of his life . <p> Your embrace of terrorism and hatred in furtherance of your stated aims of kicking Jews out of the middle east is pathetic . Bin Laden , who voiced much the same aims -- and who sacrificed thousands of innocent lives , mostly Muslims , in furtherance of his deluded goals -- has gone the way almost all tyrants go , to ignominious death , a coward to the last , hiding behind the skirts of poor women he had duped into believing in him . <p> Here 's hoping you wake up from your own dreams of hatred and vengeance before someone like bin Laden takes you with him . <p> we are not naive to beleive USA administration in every thing , but even though they said that OBL did nt take the women as a shield . if you do nt want to beleive , it means you are not logic and sense and really you are under the normal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cabability. any way even if you said he was behind the women , who knows may be she wants to protect him as she loved him , for me e.g if my lover husband will be shot i will come to take pullets instead of him as he is my lover . that which come to my mind as i know how the wife can love her husband which occured to me. why u cant take this story ? let us see the video ? shame on america and its criminals to kill a person with no weapons . you know why they did nt show the video ? because it will show them so small and cower . <p> It 's interesting to note that there have been no spontaneous outbursts of flag burning and other expressions of anger in the Muslim World . As Obama pointed out , Muslims have suffered at least as much as anyone else from this dreadful movement . <p> It 's possible that I 'm being premature here but I think this confounds the claims both of those Islamists who claim there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to use such a threat 
##285651 <h> A quick guide to what 's on this page <h> Curing early cervical cancer <h> Treatment for very early stage cervical cancer <p> For some very early cervical cancers , it may be possible to treat the cancer with a cone biopsy or an operation to remove just the cervix . This operation is called a radical trachelectomy . This type of treatment is not possible for everyone . If it is very important for you to be able to have children , your specialist will do it if they can . But your doctor can not guarantee that you will be able to have children afterwards . <h> The main treatments <p> Early cervical cancer can usually be cured with surgery or radiotherapy or both . Surgery usually means that you have your womb and cervix completely removed ( hysterectomy ) . For stage 1A2 cervical cancer and above , you will also have the lymph nodes in your pelvis taken out ( lymphadenectomy ) . This is because there is a risk the cancer may have spread from the cervix to nearby lymph nodes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surrounding tissues . Sometimes specialists recommend radiotherapy after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer coming back . <h> Your choice of treatment <p> If you have to choose between hysterectomy and radiotherapy , it can be hard to decide which to have . There are benefits and drawbacks to both . We have more information about these treatments on our website . Understanding more about the different treatments will help you make the choice . <h> What early cervical cancer is <h> Treatment for very early cervical cancer <p> For some very early , small cervical cancers , it may be possible to treat the cancer with a cone biopsy or to have just the cervix removed . This operation is called a radical trachelectomy . You will need to talk to your specialist to find out if you can have this type of treatment . It is not possible to do this operation in everyone . But , if it is very important for you to be able to have children , your specialist will do it if they can . If you do have a trachelectomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to have children afterwards . <h> The main treatments <p> Early cervical cancer can usually be cured with surgery or radiotherapy or both . Surgery usually means that you have your womb and cervix completely removed ( hysterectomy ) . For stage 1A2 cervical cancer and above , you will also have the lymph nodes in your pelvis taken out ( lymphadenectomy ) . This is because there is a risk the cancer may have spread from the cervix to nearby lymph nodes . <p> Radiotherapy involves having treatment to the womb , cervix and surrounding tissues . If you have surgery and your specialist is not sure that all the cancer cells have been removed , they will recommend that you have a course of radiotherapy afterwards . This lowers the risk of the cancer coming back . <p> For stage 1B or stage 2A cervical cancer , your specialist may suggest combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy . This may be better for you if the cancer cells cover a fairly wide area of your cervix . <h> Choosing between radiotherapy and surgery <p> If you have to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide which treatment to have . There are benefits and drawbacks to both types of treatment . It may just depend on which suits you best . But your doctor might prefer you to have radiotherapy if <p> You are not fit enough to have a big operation <p> Your surgeon thinks surgery may not remove all the cancer cells and you may need radiotherapy afterwards anyway <p> If your doctor thinks you will need radiotherapy after surgery , it may be better for you to have radiotherapy straight away , rather than having surgery first . Having both treatments increases your risk of long term side effects . <p> You may have reasons of your own to choose one treatment over another . Some women feel <p> They want radiotherapy because they do n't want to have their womb removed <p> There is no right or wrong way to feel about this . You may not feel strongly either way . If so , you will need to look at the pros and cons of both treatments to make up your mind . <p> Your doctor may suggest combined chemotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chemotherapy drugs make the cancer cells more sensitive to radiation . So there is a better chance of your cancer being cured . But , having the two treatments together can cause more side effects and make them more intense . If you are at all worried about this , you can speak to your doctor or specialist nurse . <h> Surgery for early cervical cancer <p> Unless you have a very early stage cancer , this is usually quite a big operation , with two main parts . First , your surgeon will remove the cancer . And second , they will examine the surrounding lymph nodes for signs of cancer . In a radical hysterectomy , you will usually have your womb , cervix , the top of the vagina and all the nearby lymph nodes removed . There is more information about this treatment in our section on surgery for cervical cancer . <p> Around 1 in 5 women ( 20% ) need radiotherapy after surgery either because the cancer was not completely removed or cancer cells were found in the lymph glands . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to have radiotherapy if you have not had it before . In some cases , cervical cancer that has come back can still be cured in this way . <h> Radiotherapy for early cervical cancer <h> Internal radiotherapy treatment <p> Internal radiotherapy treatment gives a high dose of radiation to your cervix and womb . It can be given in different ways . <p> Your doctor may put a small radioactive metal object into your vagina . This may be left in place for 2 or 3 days , or put in 3 or 4 times for a few hours each time . Or , under anaesthetic you may have small metal rods put into the vagina . These are then attached to a machine that fills the rods with tiny radioactive metal balls . There is more information about internal radiotherapy treatment on our page about radiotherapy for cervical cancer . <h> External treatment <p> This radiotherapy is given as a daily treatment , five days a week for several weeks . This means you will have to travel to the hospital every day during the treatment period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is more information about this treatment in the section about radiotherapy for cervical cancer . But here are a couple of things to think about when making up your mind which treatment to have <p> You will not have a long stay in hospital as with surgery <p> You will not have to have an operation ( although you will have a short anaesthetic for internal radiotherapy ) <p> You will have to go to the hospital daily for about 5 weeks for radiotherapy <p> You will keep your womb <p> The treatment will cause an early menopause if you are pre menopausal <p> There are short term side effects of the treatment , such as diarrhoea and cystitis ( bladder inflammation ) <p> A long term side effect is that your vagina can become narrower , less stretchy and more dry <p> There is a risk of other long term side effects , although most of these are much less common than they were in the past <p> You are unlikely to be able to have radiotherapy to that area of the body again <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be possible for you to have some surgery to remove it . Long term effects of radiotherapy can affect your bladder or bowel . The bladder may become less stretchy and less able to hold urine . So you may find you have to pass urine more often . The bowel can become inflammed . If your bowel is affected , you may have bouts of diarrhoea . Sometimes the side effects of radiotherapy treatment do not show up until some months or years after you have finished your treatment . <h> Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy ( chemoradiation ) <p> Chemotherapy and radiotherapy together is a good option for many cervical cancers . The treatment lowers the risk of the cancer coming back ( recurring ) near to where it originally started and in other parts of the body . The combined treatment does have more side effects , mainly affecting your bone marrow or bowel , but these generally only last a short time . <p> There are different ways of having this treatment and it depends partly on the chemotherapy drugs your doctor gives you .

##290850 <p> The 20-year-old , currently in his second loan spell at npower Championship Hull under former United defender Steve Bruce , will start Wednesday night 's friendly against Greece at the Aviva Stadium after manager Giovanni Trapattoni handed he and fellow wide man James McClean a chance to make a name for themselves . <p> Brady , who made his first competitive start for his country in last month 's 4-1 World up qualifier victory over the Faroe Islands , has already made an impact on the international stage and O'Shea , who knows exactly what it takes to succeed at Old Trafford , is confident he has what it will take to do just that . <p> " He definitely does , but he also needs to get the run of games into him to show when he goes to Hull that he is more than capable of playing at that level and showing his talent , as he did last season , " he said . <p> " He got a few more chances then when he went back in , in pre-season and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those things . Look , Robbie is a very intelligent lad , he is under no illusions that he is facing a very difficult task . <p> " But he has got a lot of ability and he has got the talent to back it up , so if he did get a chance to get a run in the Manchester United team , I am sure he would take it with both hands . <p> " But as I said , he 's got a lot of competition . " <p> Brady shone in the September friendly victory over Oman as he announced himself in style , and O'Shea knows Wednesday night 's game is an opportunity for the youngster to grow in confidence . <p> He said : " It definitely helps you . He has got a fantastic left foot and he is very creative . He will get the chance tomorrow to show that , hopefully , and take another step forward . " <p> A few weeks short of a year ago , McClean embarked upon a similar journey when he was thrust into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made such an impact that he forced his way into Trapattoni 's squad for the Euro 2012 finals . <p> However , the 23-year-old has found the going a little tougher this time around with the Black Cats struggling as a team , although club-mate O'Shea has no doubt he will bounce back . <p> He said : " Look , he 's come on in leaps and bounds . He was the surprise factor last season . He came in when the manager took over , he got into the team and took everything right in his stride . <p> " You are obviously more aware of a talent like that and now teams are marking him more tightly , they are doubling up on him . <p> " The manager left him out for a few games there as well because of the quality of the squad we have . <p> " It 's up to us to get the ball to James in better positions , get it to him quicker . It 's up to us to make sure we are giving the ball to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he undoubtedly has . <p> " Any time any young player plays for their country , it 's going to give him a fantastic boost , and I am sure knowing the type of character James is , he will take it all in his stride . " <p> Wednesday night 's game will bring back memories for O'Shea - he made his first senior start for Ireland against Greece a decade ago - but is also the first fixture back at the Aviva since the 6-1 drubbing by Germany last month . <p> Asked what will be expected by the fans , the Sunderland defender said : " The game directly after Germany was the Faroes , which was a qualification game . <p> " I think the fans , more importantly , wanted to see a reaction in that game , and we gave a reaction with a comfortable victory in a game we should have won , and we did win convincingly . <p> " It 's the final game of 2012 , it 's a game at home and whether it 's against Greece , Brazil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's what we want to do on Wednesday night , not only for the fans , but for ourselves and for the management and everyone involved with Ireland .

##316250 <h> Indelible Ink : Ron Butlin 's ' The Sound of My Voice ' <p> Ron Butlin seems to be one of Scottish writing 's best kept secrets and I do n't quite know why . Scotland is lucky to have the writers we do , and Butlin can show his medals with the best of them . He is perhaps best known as a poet , he is Edinburgh 's Makar after all , but even in this field his fame falls behind that of Morgan , Lochhead , Kay and Patterson . How he should be best known is as the writer of ' The Sound of My Voice ' , for which he should be carried shoulder high . When people ask me to recommend a Scottish novel to them this is inevitably the one that I suggest . It is still ' The Greatest Scottish Novel You 've ( probably ) Never Heard Of ' . <p> The quality of writing is evident from the first page . The novel is written in second-person narrative throughout , what must have been a mentally exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader is disorientated , encountering a novel that is written in a manner that is not only unusual but , importantly , is uncomfortable . It allows self delusion in the narrator , and promotes confusion in the reader . There is no better way to explain what I mean than to give you an example , so here are the opening lines : <p> " You were at a party when your father died -- and immediately you were told a miracle happened . A real miracle . It did n't last , of course , but was convincing enough for a few moments . Then , an hour later , you took a girl home and forced her to make love . You held onto her as she cried and pleaded with you : even now her tears are still the nearest you have come to feeling grief at your father 's death . You are thirty-four years old ; everything that is happening to you is still happening " . <p> At first the reader is made to feel for this man who has had a traumatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling lost and confused , and has to be told what has happened to him . Then , as the picture of what is being described becomes clear , sympathy starts to disappear . It takes a couple of readings to realise that the above is the opening paragraph of a book in which the main character is describing how he raped a girl , there is no ambivalence about any acquiescence on her part ( and in the next chapter this scene is described in terrible detail ) and yet the only feelings of sympathy from the narrator are being directed towards the rapist . It is an understatement to call this a brave opening to a novel . <p> Butlin uses the narrator 's voice to report on the feelings and actions of his central character Morris Magellan , the chronic alcoholic whose story this is , and this gives distance from his life and how others may view it . It allows readers to have a rational , sensible voice to lead them through this story , but also a deceptively biased one . We are inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's narrative voice is separate not only from the reader , but apparently from himself . It also allows Butlin to portray what is happening in a calm and reflective way , disguising , at least at first , the chaos that is caused as Magellan 's drinking spirals out of control . <p> Butlin beautifully conveys the hold that drink has over Magellan , describing the need for alcohol as a life or death situation : " for you , alcohol is not the problem -- it 's the solution : dissolving all the separate parts into one . A universal solvent . An ocean . " It is difficult to write sympathetically about addiction , or to explain clearly what it feels like to be addicted . Butlin manages both ; but it is interesting and necessary for the reader to step back and attempt to have a clear picture of what is happening on the page . There is a crucial episode where Magellan has to rush from his wife and children , smash open his drinks cabinet , as there is no time to search for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the process ) , and then drink neat gin as if it was water and he had just crossed a desert . There is no thought for what his watching wife and children ( who he call ' The Accusations ' ) will think . We are dealing with a man whose addiction has destroyed his pride and the strength to continue any deception , all that matters to him at that point is drink , but the text itself appears to tell a different , more sympathetic , story . <p> I thought of appropriate songs that would not only reflect ' The Sound of My Voice ' , but that I actually listen to . There are plenty that deal with drinking , but few share the tone of the novel as well as this song from Arab Strap . Here 's the video for Here We Go : <p> It is difficult for me to imagine that a writer could create a central character that was completely abhorrent to them . There would have to be some aspects that were of the writer themselves . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathy , at least in some way , of the writer ? Even the most famous monsters in literature , such as Dracula , or a morally ambivalent ' anti-hero ' such as Joe in Alexander Trocchi 's ' Young Adam ' , still have qualities in them which , if they do n't endear themselves to the majority of readers , clearly do to the author . Of course there will be writers who may seem monstrous to others , but they will not see themselves in this way , at least not wholly so . <p> This creates a problem for Butlin as his main character , at least for the majority of the book , acts , especially towards those who love him , in a despicable and cruel manner . Butlin uses the second person narrative to make Magellan 's actions seem , if not reasonable , then perhaps understandable , in a way that would not have been possible if the novel were written in first-or third-person narrative . First person would leave the reader appalled at the actions of Magellan ; it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magellan 's story in third person and it having anything like the impact that Butlin creates . <p> The ' Sound of My Voice ' is all about a man 's ability to survive , even when faced with the greatest obstacles . It may seem as you read the book that this is a thoroughly depressing story , but stick with it . There are some lovely , magical , scenes , and the pay off justifies the journey as it is based around the feeling that where there is hope , even if it is the hope of others , there is a chance of a better life . But ultimately the hope of others is not enough ; change has to come from ' You ' . <p> Alistair <p> Further thoughts on Scottish books , film , music , comedy , theatre and the like can be found at scotswhayhae which now has a Facebook home . <p> Next month 's novel : Duncan McLean 's ' Bunker Man ' . To say this novel will not be for everybody is my understatement of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , but there are scenes of graphic sex and violence in the book which are genuinely disturbing , as McLean means them to be . They are not meant to be titillating . What we witness is the slow unravelling of Rob Catto ; it is his increasingly violent reaction to those closest to him that is under examination , and McLean goes to such lengths for that reason . <p> People have compared the book to Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner , but where later Welsh in particular shocked for shocks sake , I do n't think this is the case with ' Bunker Man ' . However , there are plenty of people who disagree with me , and strongly so . If you decide to go for it I 'd be fascinated to know what you think . <p> Next 5 books : <p> Duncan Mclean Bunker Man ( Mar ) <p> Kevin MacNeil The Stornoway Way ( Apr ) <p> Ali Smith The Accidental ( May ) <p> Robin Jenkins The Changeling ( Jun ) <p> Doug Johnstone The Ossians ( Jul ) <p> Congratulations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin Reid and Roz Davies who correctly stated that Stornoway is a burgh on the Isle of Lewis .

##316350 <p> Coldplay ? s latest album , Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends , has been an international success . The title track , ? Viva la Vida ? , was the first UK single to top the US music charts since the Spice Girls ? ? Wannabe ? in 1997 , and the album is the second fastest-selling album in UK history as well as being the best selling release in iTunes ? history . It certainly appears that it has struck a chord with album reviewers and music fans alike , yet the album focuses widely on disillusionment , disappointment and despair . Thematically and lyrically , the content of the album is very different from the current spectrum of bands and genres . <p> Conceptually , the album is very tight as it explores different thought processes about a common theme . After the hopefully-titled introductory track , ? Life In Technicolor ? , Coldplay set the scene of mystery and suspense with the eerie story told in the song ? Cemeteries of London ? , which tells the tale of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? searching to see God in their own way ? . As the story unfolds , the adventurers search on until they discover what they look for , but , apparently , were not prepared to encounter : <p> God is in the houses and God is in my head . . . and all the cemeteries in London . . . I see God come in my garden , but I don ? t know what he said , For my heart it wasn ? t open . <p> The results of this encounter with God pervade the entire remainder of the album , as the songs reflect upon the brevity of life , and the feeling that ? there must be something more ? ( ? 42 ? ) . This awareness of the temporality of life is most perfectly expressed in the single that has hit number one in the UK and the US , ? Viva La Vida ? , which tells a story ? about a king who ? s lost his kingdom ? ( Guy Berryman , bassist ) . The song juxtaposes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which that disappeared , emphasizing the fallibility of his systems of power and security : <p> One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt , and pillars of sand <p> This is very much like King Nebuchadnezzar ? s dream of a great statue that was destroyed . As Daniel interprets the dream , he emphasizes God ? s sovereignty over all earthly rulers , ? He changes times and seasons ; he sets up kings and deposes them ? ( Daniel 2:21 ) . <p> What Chris Martin communicates in these songs is a feeling of existential anxiety , a realisation of one ? s own insignificance in the scope of time and space . This generally leads to the sentiments of nihilism and worthlessness that appear in other songs on the album , as Martin sings , ? I ? m just waiting til the shine wears off ? ( ? Lost ! ? ) . The realisation that things are temporary , and that there is a greater reality after death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current structures of security in life , places where we 'd once put all our hope . The writer of Ecclesiastes shares this experience as he writes : <p> Utterly meaningless ! Everything is meaningless . What does anyone gain from their toil under the sun ? Generations come and go but the earth remains forever . ( Ecclesiastes 1:2 ? 4 , NIV ) <p> The reason he sees for this lack of meaning , is that ? God has put eternity in the hearts of men ? ( Ecc. 3:11 ) , which suggests that , compared to eternity , everything else is temporary and therefore useless . In the chorus of ? Viva La Vida ? , the thought comes to the displaced king that , despite all his time and effort constructing a great and powerful kingdom , with security and wealth , he has wasted his time , as all his work has not earned him a place in heaven : ?

##319552 <p> Contributors EJK , JDFH , MvB , and MEvL conceived the idea for the study ; MvB and ILV supervised the model simulations and data analysis ; SLG drafted the report ; AHCvR provided critical review of the report . All co-authors listed above were given an opportunity to comment on the paper . <h> Abstract <p> Objective The sensitivity and specificity of a single faecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) are limited . The performance of FIT screening can be improved by increasing the screening frequency or by providing more than one sample in each screening round . This study aimed to evaluate if two-sample FIT screening is cost-effective compared with one-sample FIT . <p> Design The MISCAN -- colon microsimulation model was used to estimate costs and benefits of strategies with either one or two-sample FIT screening . The FIT cut-off level varied between 50 and 200 ? ng haemoglobin/ml , and the screening schedule was varied with respect to age range and interval . In addition , different definitions for positivity of the two-sample FIT were considered : at least one positive sample , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being positive . <p> Results Within an exemplary screening strategy , biennial FIT from the age of 55 -- 75 ? years , one-sample FIT provided 76.0 -- 97.0 life-years gained ( LYG ) per 1000 individuals , at a cost of 259 ? 000 -- 264 ? 000 ( range reflects different FIT cut-off levels ) . Two-sample FIT screening with at least one sample being positive provided 7.3 -- 12.4 additional LYG compared with one-sample FIT at an extra cost of 50 ? 000 -- 59 ? 000 . However , when all screening intervals and age ranges were considered , intensifying screening with one-sample FIT provided equal or more LYG at lower costs compared with two-sample FIT . <p> Conclusion If attendance to screening does not differ between strategies it is recommended to increase the number of screening rounds with one-sample FIT screening , before considering increasing the number of FIT samples provided per screening round . <h> What are the new findings ? <p> Intensifying screening with one-sample FIT provides equal or more LYG at lower costs , compared with screening by means of two-sample FIT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseeable future ? <p> In order to improve the effectiveness of their CRC screening programme , decision-makers are recommended to increase the number of screening rounds with one-sample FIT screening , before considering increasing the number of FIT samples provided per screening round . <p> In industrialised countries colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and ranks second in women . 1 The majority of CRC cases are diagnosed later in life . Because life expectancy increases in many countries and the costs of CRC treatment rise rapidly , it is expected that CRC will place an increasing burden on national healthcare systems . <p> Screening for CRC and its premalignant lesions ( ie , adenomatous polyps ) can detect the disease at an earlier and more curable stage . Faecal occult blood tests ( FOBT ) have been developed to detect microscopic bleeding from colorectal neoplasms before there are any clinical signs or symptoms . At least three randomised controlled trials have proved the effectiveness FOBT screening , demonstrating a mortality reduction of 15 -- 33%. 2 -- 4 Subsequently , several screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIT ) screening over the more traditionally used guaiac-based FOBT ( ie , non-rehydrated Hemoccult-II test ) both with respect to attendance as well as the detection rate of advanced neoplasia. 5 -- 11 Most of these trials used screening strategies with a single FIT sample . <p> As not all advanced neoplasia will be detected by means of one-sample FIT screening , providing two FIT samples collected on consecutive days could increase the effectiveness of a screening programme . On the one hand , referring a screenee for a diagnostic colonoscopy when at least one sample is positive increases sensitivity because some colorectal neoplasms bleed intermittently and can therefore be missed with one-sample FIT screening . 12 On the other hand , referring a screenee when both samples are positive can increase specificity because only colonic lesions with a more consistent bleeding pattern will be detected , which will lead to fewer false-positive test results . However , either way , providing two FIT samples within one screening round will also increase screening costs because twice the number of samples need to be analysed . <p> The aim of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIT screening strategies with variable intervals , age ranges and cut-off levels in order to assess whether the increased performance of a second FIT sample outweighs the increased costs compared with one-sample FIT screening . <h> Materials and methods <p> We used the MISCAN -- colon microsimulation model to estimate the additional life-years gained ( LYG ) and costs of two-sample FIT screening over one-sample FIT for the screening strategy of biennial FIT from the age 55 to 75 ? years . This screening strategy has intermediate screening intensity and was previously found to be cost-effective . 13 Additional LYG can also be achieved by increasing the intensity of one-sample FIT screening instead of adding a second sample . We therefore also compared the costs and LYG of one-sample FIT screening with that of two-sample FIT for a range of screening strategies . <h> MISCAN -- colon microsimulation model <p> The MISCAN -- colon model and the data sources that inform the quantifications of the model are described in detail in supplementary appendix 1 , in previous publications , 14 -- 18 and in a standardised model profile available online only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulates the relevant life histories of a large population of individuals from birth to death . CRC arises in this population according to the adenoma -- carcinoma sequence . 20 21 More than one adenoma can occur in an individual and each adenoma can independently develop into a CRC . Adenomas progress in size from small ( ? 5 ? mm ) to medium ( 6 -- 9 ? mm ) to large ( ? 10 ? mm ) . Although most adenomas will never turn into cancer , some will eventually become malignant , transforming to stage I CRC and some may even progress into stage IV . In every stage , there is a probability of the CRC being diagnosed due to the development of symptoms versus symptomless progressing into the next stage . If CRC has developed , the survival rate after clinical diagnosis depends on the stage in which the cancer was detected . The 5-year survival rate is on average 90% if the disease is diagnosed while still localised , 68% for regional disease , and less than 10% for disseminated disease . At any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interrupted because a person dies of other causes . <p> With FIT screening lesions can be detected before clinical diagnosis ; a screened individual with a positive test result will be referred for a colonoscopy for the detection and removal of adenomas and early-stage cancers . In this way , CRC incidence and/or CRC-related mortality can be reduced . The LYG by screening are calculated as the difference in model-predicted life years lived in the population with and without CRC screening . <h> Study population <p> In this study we modelled the age distribution of the Dutch population in 2005 22 and all individuals were followed until death . The CRC incidence rate was based on the observed incidence rate in The Netherlands in 1999 -- 2003 , which was before the onset of opportunistic screening . 23 The observed CRC incidence in the population included cases from higher risk groups . Survival rates after clinical diagnosis of CRC was based on relative survival data from 1985 to 2004 from the south of The Netherlands , 24 since nationwide data were not available . The survival for individuals aged 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-increasing mortality/incidence ratio . 23 <h> Screening strategies <p> CRC screening was simulated in the population starting in 2010 . Individuals were offered FIT screening according to different screening schedules varying by : <p> Age to start screening at , respectively , 45 , 50 , 55 and 60 ? years <p> Age to stop screening at , respectively , 70 , 75 and 80 ? years <p> Screening interval with , respectively , 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 3 ? years <p> Separate simulations were performed in which individuals were invited for : one-sample FIT screening ; two-sample FIT screening with referral if at least one sample tested positive ; two-sample FIT screening with referral only if both samples tested positive ; or two-sample FIT screening with referral if the mean of both samples was positive . The cut-off level for a positive test result varied between 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 and 200 ? ng haemoglobin/ml . These different screening schedules with varying start and stop ages , intervals , cut-off levels and samples resulted in a total of 960 different screening strategies . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If no adenomas were found during the procedure , the individual was assumed to be at low risk of CRC and did not return to the screening programme until after 10 ? years . If one or more adenomas were found , they were removed and the individual entered a surveillance programme according to the Dutch guidelines for follow-up after polypectomy , 25 ie , a colonoscopy after 6 ? years in the case of one or two adenomas and after 3 ? years in the case of three or more adenomas . We assumed that surveillance colonoscopies would be performed until the stop age for screening . <h> Attendance rates <p> We modelled attendance rates in the first screening round as observed in two Dutch population-based CRC screening trials 9 11 12 ; 60% for both one and two-sample FIT screening , and we assumed these rates would remain stable over time . For subsequent screening rounds , we assumed that 80% of the individuals who attended the previous screening round would attend again . 26 27 Furthermore , we assumed that 10% of the individuals never attended FIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CRC than the general population ( RR 1.15 ) . 2 Attendance at diagnostic colonoscopies following a positive FIT and subsequent surveillance colonoscopies were assumed to be 85% and 80% , respectively . 29 <h> Test characteristics <p> Test characteristics of the one-sample and two-sample FIT tests were fitted to the positivity rates and detection rates of advanced neoplasia observed in the first screening round of two Dutch randomised trials ( table 1 ) . 9 -- 12 Advanced neoplasia included CRC and advanced adenomas , of which the latter was defined as adenomas of 10 ? mm or greater in size , with 25% or greater villous component , and/or high-grade dysplasia . <p> Test characteristics of one-sample and two-sample FIT used in the model <p> To estimate the two-sample FIT test characteristics the following approach was applied ; we used the average positivity rates and detection rates of the first and second test performed from the two-sample FIT group as reference and calculated the relative difference in performance when both samples were evaluated . Subsequently , we added this relative difference to the positivity rates and detection rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this method of calculation is presented in figure 1 . The main reasons for this approach were : ( 1 ) the larger sample size of the one-sample FIT group provides more statistical power for the estimates of test sensitivity and specificity ; ( 2 ) to avoid possible bias caused by the fact that the positivity rates and detection rates of the one-sample and two-sample FIT groups were calculated from different cohorts that were not 1:1 randomly assigned before invitation 10 12 ; ( 3 ) in this way we used paired observations , which gives a better estimate of the additional performance of a second FIT sample . <p> Example of calculation of the added performance of two-sample faecal immunochemical tests ( FIT ) compared with one-sample FIT screening . *This example provides the calculation of the positivity rate of two-sample FIT with at least one sample positive at a cut-off level of 50 ? ng haemoglobin/ml . The method of calculation is similar for both the positivity rate and detection rate , as well as for the different two-sample FIT positivity criteria ( ie , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both samples positive ) . <p> The sensitivity of diagnostic colonoscopies was assumed to be 75% for adenomas 1 -- 5 ? mm , 85% for adenomas 6 -- 9 ? mm , and 95% for adenomas 10 ? mm or greater and CRC . 30 <h> Costs <p> The analysis was conducted from a healthcare system perspective . In the base case analyses , we included screening and treatment costs as presented in table 2 . Base case organisational costs for one-sample FIT screening were based on the Dutch cervical cancer screening programme , adjusted for differences with FIT screening . Costs for the test kits were based on prices from the manufacturer . Costs for analysis of the tests included material and personnel needed during the process of registration , analysis and authorisation of returned tests . 34 The additional costs associated with two-sample FIT screening included double costs for FIT test kits and packaging material , and double costs for materials needed during the analysis of returned samples . Although double the number of FIT samples would need to be analysed , the costs of personnel needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because some tasks ( eg , patient registration ) do not require double the amount of work compared with analysing samples with one-sample FIT screening . Colonoscopy costs were based on an internal 6 ? months study at the Erasmus MC ( data not shown ) . Costs for complications after colonoscopy were based on diagnosis treatment combination ( DTC ) rates derived from the Dutch Health Care Authority . 35 <p> Summary of model assumptions of the base case and sensitivity analyses <p> Costs for treatment of CRC were divided into three clinically relevant phases of care : initial treatment , continuous care and terminal care . Initial treatment costs were based on DTC rates , except for oxaliplatin . The costs for oxaliplatin were derived from the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board . 36 We assumed that during the continuous care phase , individuals would follow the Dutch CRC treatment guidelines , 37 and costs for periodic control were based on DTC rates . Terminal care costs were based on a Dutch last year of life cost analysis . These were estimated at 19 ? 700 for patients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs increased with stage at diagnosis , at a rate observed for US patients . 39 40 Dutch terminal care costs for individuals who died from CRC were approximately 40% of the US costs . We assumed that terminal care costs of CRC patients who die from other causes were also 40% of the US costs . <h> Cost-effectiveness analyses <p> For all screening strategies we used the MISCAN -- colon model to estimate costs and compare the number of LYG due to screening with the situation without screening . Costs and LYG were discounted by 3% per year . 41 Strategies that were more costly and less effective than other strategies were ruled out by simple dominance . Strategies that were more costly and less effective than a mix of other strategies were ruled out by extended dominance . The remaining strategies are not dominated and are known as ' efficient ' . On a plot of LYG versus costs , the line that connects the efficient strategies is called the efficient frontier , which implies that all dominated strategies lie below this line . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its additional costs and effects with those of the next less costly and less effective efficient strategy . <h> Sensitivity analyses <p> We performed several sensitivity analyses on different parameters , which are summarised in table 2 . We started with sensitivity analyses with respect to the additional performance and costs of two-sample FIT over one-sample FIT . Furthermore , we adjusted for reduced quality of life due to screening as well as CRC treatment . Correlated FIT test results were assumed because individuals with a false-negative test result are likely to have a higher than average probability to have another false-negative test result at a successive screening round . We used the results of a population-based CRC screening programme in Italy to estimate the correlation between false-negative FIT results for cancers and advanced adenomas in subsequent screening rounds . 33 Effects of limited colonoscopy capacity were evaluated by only considering strategies in which colonoscopy demand did not exceed 40 , 20 , 10 , or five colonoscopies per 1000 individuals per year . In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different strategies for individuals who adhere to the CRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance to screening , diagnostic and surveillance colonoscopies . In addition , we performed sensitivity analyses on lower and higher values than the base case analysis for fatal complication rates with colonoscopy and for unit costs of FIT , colonoscopy , complications and treatment . We decided not to perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis after having weighed the limited added value against the computational effort required ( see Discussion ) . <h> Results <p> The strategy of biennial one-sample FIT screening from age 55 to 75 ? years yielded 76.0 -- 97.0 LYG per 1000 individuals aged 45 ? years and older , compared with no screening ( the range in LYG reflects different FIT cut-off levels ) . The associated costs ranged from 259 ? 000 to 264 ? 000 per 1000 individuals , corresponding with 2690 -- 3473 per LYG compared with no screening ( figure 2 ) . The two-sample FIT screening strategies with the mean of both test results being positive and at least one test result being positive provided , respectively , between ? 0.3 -- 2.6 and 7.3 -- 12.4 more LYG than one-sample FIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 -- 50 ? 000 and 50 ? 000 -- 59 ? 000 per 1000 individuals . The corresponding ICER ranged from 16 ? 818 -- 31 ? 930 and 4024 -- 8041 per additional LYG . The two-sample FIT screening strategies with two positive outcomes were less effective ( ie , fewer LYG per 1000 individuals ) and more costly than one-sample FIT screening , and were therefore dominated from a cost-effectiveness standpoint ( see supplementary appendix 2 , available online only , for detailed results on effects and costs for the different biennial FIT screening strategies with the age range of 55 -- 75 ? years ) . <p> Costs and life-years gained ( LYG ) compared with no screening per 1000 individuals in 2005 ( start of the programme ) for one-sample and two-sample faecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) screening at different cut-off values . All data points represent biennial FIT screening from age 55 to 75 ? years . *Per screening test ( ie , one or two-sample FIT ) , the data points represent the results at cut-off values of 50 , 75 , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , a higher cut-off level is associated with fewer LYG , that is the data point at the bottom represents the result at a cut-off value of 200 ? ng haemoglobin/ml , whereas the data point at the top represents the result at a cut-off value of 50 ? ng haemoglobin/ml. 1sFIT , one-sample FIT ; 2sFIT(both) , two-sample FIT , referral to colonoscopy restricted to subjects with both samples positive ; 2sFIT(mean) , two-sample FIT , referral to colonoscopy restricted to subjects for whom the mean of both samples is positive ; 2sFIT ( ? 1 ) , two-sample FIT , referral to colonoscopy of all subjects with at least one sample positive . The most efficient strategies , ie , those strategies which for a given amount of costs yield the largest number of life-years saved , are connected by the efficient frontier . The screening interventions were modelled from the year 2005 , all individuals were invited for screening until they reached the end age for screening , and healthcare costs for each individual were calculated until death . Costs and LYG were discounted at an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were considered ( ie , by varying not only the cut-off level , but also the screening age range and interval ) , the number of LYG compared with no screening ranged between 17.5 and 153.4 per 1000 individuals , and costs ranged between 105 ? 000 and 889 ? 000 per 1000 individuals ( figure 3 ) . The LYG and costs of the strategies on the efficient frontier are presented in table 3 . Although the ICER of biennial two-sample FIT screening between ages 55 and 75 ? years ( mean of both samples being positive , or at least one sample being positive ) compared with one-sample FIT seemed reasonable , table 3 shows that most two-sample FIT strategies are not cost-effective . When comparing the additional effect of providing two samples per screening round to the effect of providing one-sample FIT more frequently ( ie , with a larger age range and/or shorter interval ) , the latter provided more LYG at equal or less costs than the two-sample FIT strategies . This effect is also demonstrated in figure 2 , because the strategies of biennial two-sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIT screening strategies with the mean from both test results being positive or at least one positive test outcome were therefore ruled out by extended dominance and were considered not to be cost-effective compared with one-sample FIT screening . Although figure 2 demonstrates this effect for biennial FIT screening , the principle applies to all screening intervals , including annual screening . <p> Costs and life years gained ( LYG ) compared with no screening per 1000 individuals in 2005 ( start of the programme ) , for one-sample and two-sample faecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) screening at different cut-off values . The data represent all simulated screening strategies , which include various sampling strategies , cut-off levels , screening age ranges and intervals . *The numbers of the strategies on the efficient frontier correspond to the cost-efficient strategies presented in table 3 . 1sFIT , one-sample FIT ; 2sFIT ( both ) , two-sample FIT , referral to colonoscopy restricted to subjects with both samples positive ; 2sFIT(mean) , two-sample FIT , referral to colonoscopy restricted to subjects for whom the mean of both samples is positive ; 2sFIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonoscopy of all subjects with at least one sample positive . The most efficient strategies , ie , those strategies that for a given amount of costs yield the largest number of life-years saved , are connected by the efficient frontier . Strategies with the least intensive screening schedule ( ie , small age range , and long screening interval ) are located at the bottom left of the graph , whereas strategies with the most intensive screening schedule ( ie , large age range and short screening interval ) are located at the top right of the graph . The screening interventions were modelled from the year 2005 , all individuals were invited for screening until they reached the end age for that particular screening strategy , and healthcare costs for each individual were calculated until death . Costs and LYG were discounted at an annual rate of 3% . <p> Costs per LYG compared with no screening and ICER of the cost-effective screening strategies , in a population with realistic attendance * at the screening programme <h> Sensitivity analyses <p> The higher cost-effectiveness of more frequent one-sample FIT screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our model assumptions . However , decreasing the cost difference between one-sample and two-sample FIT by 50% resulted in multiple two-sample FIT strategies becoming efficient next to one-sample FIT . In addition , limited colonoscopy capacity did not affect the preference of one-sample FIT over two-sample FIT strategies , with the exception of the most stringent scenario . In case the colonoscopy demand was not allowed to exceed five colonoscopies per 1000 individuals per year , two-sample FIT strategies with both samples being positive were preferred over one-sample FIT . <h> Discussion <p> Our analysis demonstrates that given a screening schedule ( ie , age range and screening interval ) , two-sample FIT strategies with the mean from both test results being positive or at least one positive test outcome provide more LYG at acceptable costs than one-sample FIT screening . However , when all simulated screening strategies are considered ( ie , including varying age ranges and screening intervals ) , increasing the screening intensity of one-sample FIT testing ( ie , greater age range and/or shorter screening interval ) is more cost-effective than providing two FIT within one screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a randomised trial in which the attendance and diagnostic yield of one and two-sample FIT were compared . 12 Considering only the relation between the positivity rate and the detection rate of advanced adenomas it seems that to choose FIT screening with either one or two samples based on the available colonoscopy capacity should be recommended . However , the current analysis demonstrates that including the costs for the screening and treatment of CRC over multiple screening rounds affects the relation between one and two-sample FIT . Although a number of two-sample FIT screening strategies ( eg , with at least one sample , or the mean of both samples being positive ) are close to the cost-efficiency frontier , increasing the number of one-sample FIT screening rounds was found to be a more cost-effective way of gaining health benefits . <p> Other cost-effectiveness analyses determining the optimal number of FIT samples are limited . Two Japanese studies compared the costs of FIT screening with either one , two or three FIT per cancer detected in a single screening round . 42 43 In all three sampling strategies individuals were referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In both studies it was concluded that two-sample FIT screening with at least one test being positive would be the most desirable strategy from a diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness stand point . A more recent French study did include multiple screening rounds in their cost-effectiveness model and also evaluated the effect of different cut-off levels . 44 The authors concluded that three-sample FIT screening with a cut-off level of 50 ? ng haemoglobin/ml was the most cost-effective strategy to be preferred . The results of our current analysis do agree with these studies about the added value of multiple FIT sampling within a given screening schedule . More than one FIT sample can provide additional health benefits at acceptable costs . Unfortunately , these studies do not provide information comparing the added effect of multiple FIT samples per screening round with the effect of increasing screening intensity with one-sample FIT . <p> Several limitations need to be acknowledged . First , we based our analysis on data from one screening round . Therefore , we could not estimate the correlation of test outcomes between successive screening rounds . Individuals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not bleed ) in one screening round may have a higher than average probability to have another false-negative test result at a successive screening round . Therefore , we performed a sensitivity analysis based on Italian results , 31 in which correlation of systematic false-negative test outcomes was assumed for advanced adenomas and CRC . The analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of two-sample FIT decreased less than the cost-effectiveness of one-sample FIT strategies , but one-sample FIT screening remained dominant . Nevertheless , we need further data from repeat screening rounds in The Netherlands to get a good estimate of systematic false-negative rates in the population we modelled . Second , we assumed the screening attendance rate to be independent of screening intensity and the number of FIT samples performed . In the first screening round of one of the Dutch trials , 10 -- 12 the screening attendance rate was not significantly different between the two-sample FIT and one-sample FIT study arm ( 61.3% vs 61.5% ; p=0.837 ) . However , it could be hypothesised that , for example , adherence in the case of a more intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense screening schedules with two-sample screening . This would negatively affect the cost-effectiveness of more intensive screening strategies relative to two-sample testing and might alter our conclusions . Third , we based our analyses on a screening-naive population . Depending on the amount of previous screening , CRC incidence in the population and the resulting cost-effectiveness could be lower . However , this would affect the strategies we compared in a similar way . If anything , the effect of previous screening would make one-sample FIT screening more preferable , because a lower CRC incidence would reduce the added value of a second FIT sample . Finally , we did not perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis . Given the large number of strategies that has to be evaluated for each draw , such an analysis would require a huge computational effort . We believe that simulating the range of varying strategies is one of the strengths of this analysis , because we were primarily interested in the comparison of different FIT screening strategies with varying numbers of samples provided , FIT cut-off levels , screening intervals and age ranges . Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parameter values are lacking , which makes the interpretation of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis difficult and the outcome of limited added value . One of the most uncertain assumptions of the model is that all CRC arise from adenoma precursors . For FIT screening , this assumption will have limited impact because FIT has a low sensitivity for adenomas . In addition , the assumption of non-bleeding ( and therefore for FIT undetectable ) adenomas was evaluated in the sensitivity analysis by assuming correlation between false-negative results . <p> In conclusion , our analysis provides new insights for decision-makers ; in a situation in which attendance to screening does not differ between strategies , intensifying screening with one-sample FIT was found to be more cost-effective than providing two FIT samples within one screening round . It is therefore recommended to increase the number of screening rounds with one-sample FIT screening , before considering

##334751 <p> I wanted a second dress for my wedding . I did n't get one . Why ? Well , budget issues aside ( I could have sold a kidney or something ) a lot of my friends and family suggested it would be diva-ish of me to have a costume change . Well , after my wedding , I can honestly say that my one biggest regret was not getting that second dress -- and I 'll tell you why ! <h> Five reasons to have a second dress <p> ? The obvious reason -- practicality . I know -- who wants to be practical on their wedding day , right ? But hear me out . I talked myself out of that second dress because I figured if I was going to pay so much for the first one I should get full use out if . But what ended up happening ? Me desperately trying to dance with a full-length ballerina gown , trailing it along the floor -- and the amount of times it got stepped on does n't bear thinking about . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once-glorious gown . That damage could have been avoided , and I could have danced like I wanted to at my wedding . Instead I was confined to the side of the room , clapping like an idiot ( minimum damage exercise ) and watching everyone else have fun . Boo . <p> ? The diva-ish reason -- because it makes an impression . I 'm not going to lie , the initial impact of my dress was great -- but that first impression melted pretty quickly ( along with my make-up , it was the hottest day of the year after all ) and after an hour or two , people were pretty used to seeing me in my dress . A quick outfit change would have been really refreshing at that point -- and would wow your groom for a second time . <p> ? It opens up a whole range of possibilities for the rest of your look . You could have lovely loose curls during the day that sweep up into an evening ' do , or vice versa -- make-up can be taken from light day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of minutes . As a bride it can be so hard to choose how you want to style things -- so why pass up the opportunity to do it twice ? <p> ? I had the most beautiful wedding heels by Rachel Simpson . Nobody saw them . Case closed . <p> ? You probably wo n't want to miss a minute of your wedding party -- but actually it could be really helpful to use the outfit change as an excuse to take a breather from the hectic party for a minute . The day can go by in such a blur it could be really nice to step back with one of your best girls and have a moment of calm . <p> Are you wearing more than one dress ? Or

##349351 <h> Simplicity is not always best <h> From a customer perspective , what use is a product that stops paying benefits when you still need them ? <p> By Russell Higginbotham Published Nov 14 , 2012 comments <h> Article Tools <p> Recommend <p> The insurance industry broadly welcomed the Sergeant Review interim report of simplified products . " Welcomed " in the sense that it is a step in the right direction , but the industry also recognised that the scope of the review is very limited in some important ways . <p> First , it focused on setting out what a simple life insurance product would look like , but not how to make it simple to buy and easy to access . As a result , the product recommendations taken in isolation will likely fail , which is something of a missed opportunity . <p> Second , the product scope was very narrow . The omission of income protection was surprising , particularly in what is now a defined contribution pensions world . For many , income protection should have a higher priority than pure life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a " starter for 10 " and that there will be further government-endorsed consideration on a wider range of simpler products that are easy to buy and easily accessible . <p> On a fundamental point , I wonder whether " simple " is always the best answer for the consumer . To draw on an analogy , we could also develop a simple car . It would have four wheels , an engine , get you from A to B reliably and , hopefully , keep you dry in the process . <p> Contrast this to my wife 's Mercedes A-Class , which she uses to take our children to school , do the shopping and so on . It has automatic central locking , ABS and tells the driver that the rear passenger seatbelts are engaged for safety . It has electric windows all round , air-conditioning and a half-decent stereo , recognising that hot or bored children can be a bit of a pain . It has an automatic gearbox , rain sensing windscreen wipers and light sensitive headlights . <p> My wife is not driving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straightforward and efficient driving experience . At the same time , the important things like safety and comfort are assured . It is not necessarily the cheapest car -- but it is in no way expensive . <p> Now think about that in terms of an income protection product . We could also produce a very simple income protection product such as in Figure 1 . <p> After an appropriate deferred period , the product pays a pre-defined benefit sold in 1,000 annual income units with an overall cap . Benefits increase over time , in line with a pre-defined index and cease at normal retirement date . Underwriting for such a product would be simple as benefits are relatively modest and the replacement ratio is reasonable . <p> This could be the right product for many people . It is easy to understand and pays a benefit that will maintain a good standard of living during any period of disability . Higher earners tend to be more sophisticated buyers and can opt for

##361251 <p> Cairo 's Tahrir Square , the focus of Egypt 's revolution , is the scene of celebration on Sunday after Mohamed Morsi is confirmed as president . Link to this video <p> My people of great Egypt , who today celebrate democracy in our country ; those of you standing in the public squares , in Tahrir Square , and all the public squares of Egypt ; my dear people , big family , brothers and sons , you who are awaiting the future , who want security and safety , goodness and revival , and development and stability for our country , I turn to you praising God for having brought about this historic moment . <p> This is a shining course written by the hands of Egyptians , by their will , their blood , their tears and their sacrifices . I would never have been able to stand before you today as the first elected president by the will of free Egyptians in the first presidential elections after the revolution of 25 January , nor I would have been able to stand before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of our beloved country without the support of God almighty and the sacrifices and precious blood of our noble martyrs and the noble , wounded citizens . <p> I give my thanks and greetings to the martyrs , to their souls , to the mothers and fathers of the martyrs , and all my people who lost their dear ones and sacrificed for Egypt . I offer my sincere prayers for them and for the wounded who watered the tree of freedom with their blood and cleared the way for us to arrive at this moment . <p> We are grateful to the families of all , who taught their sons the meaning of patriotism and true martyrdom . They have shown steadfastness and courage in confronting the great loss of their own flesh and blood , the price of freedom . <p> I renew with them the pledge that this sacred blood would not be lost in vein . I salute the great Egyptian people , and salute the army , the best soldiers on earth , our armed forces , wherever they are . I offer my heartfelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am keen to strengthen and secure them and their esteemed institution which we all love and value . <p> I also extend similar greetings to the honourable police , whose role many people wrongly perceive that I appreciate less than others . This is not true . Whoever committed a crime would be held accountable before the law . As for the honourable policemen , who make up the majority among the police in Egypt , they are entitled to the highest expressions of appreciation . They have a great role in the future to maintain internal security and peace in our nation . <p> We are duty bound to acknowledge the judges of Egypt who supervised the elections of revolutionary Egypt . Even those who did not participate in the electoral process , we equally hold them in a position of esteem and love . Our judges make up the third source of authority , which would always remain strong and prominent . Our judiciary owns its will ; it is separate from the executive and it must remain so in the future , to be independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I affirm to all segments of the Egyptian people that I have today , by your choice and your will , through the favour of Allah , become the president of all Egyptians , wherever they are , at home or abroad , and in all the provinces of Egypt , on its eastern borders and the west , and in the south and north and central Egypt . <p> I turn to you all on this historic day , in which I have become president of all Egyptians , equally . Everyone will be afforded due respect , without any privilege , except that rendered by their service to our nation and their respect for the constitution and the law . <p> It is not possible to forget the members of the diplomatic corps , and those who work in it , as well as the members of the general intelligence ; I will not forget any of them . <p> My beloved Egyptians who astonished the world with their revolution and whose youth surprised the world by standing in long lines to vote -- whether in the referendum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consultative assembly , or the presidential elections -- Egypt today is the Egypt of the entire nation . Our country is in urgent need at this moment for the consolidation of ranks and unity of purpose so that our great and patient people would reap the rewards of their sacrifice to live with dignity . <p> Social justice , freedom and human dignity are our basic slogans . These are the main goals for which the revolution was started in all the squares of Egypt on 25 January 2011 and the strong voices which demanded them still do so in every expression of our ongoing revolution . <p> The revolution will continue until it realises all its objectives . Together we will complete this process . The Egyptian people have been patient for long , enduring tyranny , oppression , marginalisation and forgery of their will and elections . <p> We used to look around us and say : when will Egypt and its people become the owners of their destiny ? Today you have become the source of authority and the world bears witness to your endeavour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have bestowed upon me a heavy trust and great responsibility . I say to all of you , by the grace of Allah and your will , that I have been entrusted with this and I am not best of you . I will sacrifice all my efforts to be loyal to the duties and pledges which I made before all of you , and that all would be equal in rights and duties . <p> As for myself I have no rights but I have duties ; so I call upon you my people to support me as long as I establish justice and righteousness among you , and as long as I obey God in your affairs . If I do n't do so , and I disobey God and I do not adhere to what I promised , you are not obliged to obey me . <p> At this historic juncture , I call upon you the great people of Egypt to strengthen our national unity and close our ranks and stand together . We are all Egyptians . Even though we differ in our views we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are different . There is no room for the language of confrontation and there is no room to accuse each other . <p> National unity is the way to lift Egypt out of the present situation and to embark upon a broad project of renaissance , one that is truly Egyptian , leading to real development of our resources . God has blessed us with much , but as you know our wealth was squandered and not put to proper use . We are today about to use these resources to realise our interests . <p> I call upon you to begin this renaissance project . We Egyptians , Muslims and Christians , are harbingers of development and civilisation and we will remain so . We will meet the trials and schemes which are aimed at undermining our resolve and national unity as we did during the revolution . I am determined with you to astound the world with the Egyptian revival that realises prosperity , dignity and stability . <p> I am determined , with your help , to build a new Egypt , a civil state , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this great project . I will work to preserve Egypt 's national interests on all fronts , Arab and African , regional and international . <p> We will respect the international treaties and conventions we signed , and we will work to have a system of Egyptian values , especially in the area of freedom and human rights , and women 's and children 's rights , and to remove all forms of discrimination . <p> We will establish balanced relations with the entire world community , relations based on mutual interests and respect between equal parties . <p> We will not allow ourselves to intervene in the internal affairs of any country and we will not allow interference in our affairs . <p> We will preserve our national sovereignty and the borders of the Egyptian state and everyone must know that Egyptian decisions will come from within and by the will of its people . <p> Egypt is capable with its people and its forces and history to defend itself and to prevent any hostility or anyone from contemplating aggression against it or its people , wherever they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognise the challenges of the moment . I am convinced that with help of God we will together be able to pass through this phase quickly so that Egypt becomes stronger and assumes its leadership role . This is the destiny of Egypt and what awaits it in the future . <p> We all are happy and we celebrate this great democracy , the elections and triumph of the will of our nation . I reaffirm what I announced before , that I will never betray Allah in your affairs , or disobey Him in the affairs of my nation . I place before me His saying , " Fear a day when we will return to Allah " . <p> Therefore , say with me together my beloved people , by our will and our unity and our love for each other , we will be able to make a great future .

Well , he has cut yet another deal with SCAF . The Revolution is well and truly over . <p> Politically , what we know about Morsi is this . Much play has been made of the supposed tension between the " hardliners " in the Muslim Brotherhood and the " reformers " . Well , Morsi was the guy who purged the " reformers " from the Muslim Brotherhood . <p> He was also closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood 's " Draft Platform " , which proposed to give Imams a veto over " un-Islamic " laws , Iran-style . It was described as " an assassination to the civic state . " <p> So , that 's the future for Egypt . <p> Since the Revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the Muslim Brotherhood would n't stand .

It was obvious that this was the gathering place for the MB 's supporters . They only showed the shocked response of the few that were inside the headquarters of the losing opponent . Nothing about the huge gathering that was taking place in Nasr City , which represented lots of professionals , Copts , and women . We can only guess , what are the motives of the army officers .

Shame because it 's one of the most hilariously ignorant things I 've read in months . <p> Contrary to her uninformed assertion , the Muslim Brotherhood was created by Egyptian radical Hassan al-Banna in 1928 . It derived - no , stole - its political ideology from European fascism and National Socialism and bolted these ideas onto Islamic traditions . <p> Which is why Islamism is totalitarian , messianic , militaristic , imperialist , chauvinistic , utopian-reactionary and anti-Semitic in character . Al-Banna openly admired Hitler , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation : " Who would believe " he gushed approvingly , " that that German workingman , Hitler , would ever attain such immense influence and as successful realisation as he has ? " <p> The Nazis , meanwhile , went considerably out of their way to court the Brotherhood ( and those in broad sympathy with it ) , so as to enlist them in their war against the scourge of perfidious world Jewry . <p> All of which explains why " Islamofascism " , far from being a hysterical slur , is in fact the most accurate and fitting label to paste onto the Islamist movement . <p> But let us not be detained by such trivialities in our hurry to lay the blame for everything at the feet of the West , irrespective of the evidence . <p> I bet none of the commentators above have ever been to Egypt or know anything about the country beyond what everyone knows thanks to media coverage . Yet they somehow know exactly what will happen in Egyptian politics and society in years to come . <p> " I bet none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about the country beyond what everyone knows thanks to media coverage .

Do not assume that all readers commenting here are all ignorant or fed their knowledge by the media . In general , people tend to comment because they have an emotional vested interest in a subject , real life experience or just are more wordly than you . Some are Egyptian nationals , or used to be , or people who follow what happens in the world and are weighing in with their opinions . Nothing wrong with that . <p> If you know the majority of the Egyptians , who by the way happen to be Muslim , you would not be surprised about this . This happens all the time . There is always some type of reference to Islam or God or Islamic verses in every mundane daily conversation . Spirituality , or what I call religiousity , has a 100% presence all aspects of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratically elected President of the United Arab Republic of Egypt in his first paragraph mentions ' brothers and sons ' not ' sisters and daughters ' but later mentions ' mothers ' yet still worrying . Quotes from the Quran are expected but will worry Christians let alone Humanists , if they dare to raise their heads ! <p> Still , better than expected from a party that tried to overthrow President Nasser that was punished and persecuted for its pains , including torture ( both indigenous and that apparently taught by the Americans ) imprisonment and execution . <p> Egypt 's biggest problem is of course poverty and the Muslim Brotherhood claims to have a good record dealing with their own . No reduction in poverty will be possible without reducing the economic resources controlled by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces while on the other hand they have forced President Mohammed Morsi to respect all international treaties including the one with Israel . <p> One of my colleagues was a Copt who came to Britain because although he was a graduate engineer his line manager was a non-graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nile ' now hopefully with free parliamentary elections ' Egypt is the gift of Democracy ' too . <p> To be fair . I think that giving platform to Morsi before the elections can be objected to . After all , it can be seen as an endorsement of a right-wing theocratic party . This is different . This is an acceptance speech , you have to see it as a piece of news . <p> This is n't the first time they have been a mouthpeice for Islamism though , in recent months they have had a suicide bombers wife , the Hamas leader and Moazzam Begg just to name a few.The only logical conclusion for me is either it will be someone from Al-Shabab 's or Al-Qaeda on here next . <p> I 've been very critical of the Guardian 's support for the most religious inclined parties when it comes to Muslims , and their betrayal of secularism . But I think this occasion is different . You have to see this one as a historical document ... even if it 
##363051 <p> Are yellow back covers of The Saint books worth any money ? Well , these editions of the Leslie Charteris The Saint novels were cheaper reprints of the originals and whilst reprints usually get a bad rap from book collectors some of these are , in my opinion worth getting . Some of the earliest Saint novels are incredibly rare and expensive so these are often your only real chance of getting close to the hardback original . That said , the edition below dates from 1939 , printed just after the publication of the Happy Highwayman so it 's got to be worth having in its own right . <p> Featuring the characters Patricia Holm and Inspector Teal this is one of the earliest Saint novels , full of charming pre-war anecdotes and a nice insight into life of a sort in the 1930 's . <p> This is a later reprint ( eighteenth impression ) from 1948 , a ' story of international pace ' as described by the Daily Telegraph . The number of reprints shows how popular the Saint novels were , Charteris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books sold worldwide . <p> The yellow back editions can still be found relatively cheaply , they are worth picking up to have a hardback Saint novel with , more often than not some great artwork on the dust jacket . <h> 4 Comments <p> Great covers and great books . There 's a great deal to be said for reading a period or vintage copy as well . It 's difficult to explain but reading and 1930s book such as The Last Hero in hardback is different to a modern paperback - the read feels different <p> It 's great to see these books and the woderful artwork and I 'd agree they are keenly sought

##374350 <h> Prolific Striker Confirms Desire to Sign for Chelsea <p> Vitesse striker Wilfried Bony has welcomed speculation Chelsea could make a move for his services in the January transfer window . <p> Chelsea are reported to have scouted Wilfried Bony during Vitesse 's draw with Twente at the weekend <p> Bony , 23 , has made a significant impact in the Eredivisie since leaving Sparta Prague in January 2011 , and has scored 12 goals in 11 appearances so far in the league this season . <p> Earlier this month , the player 's agent , Francis Kacou , told Sky Sports : " There is interest in the player from the Premier League -- Chelsea , Aston Villa included . " <p> In an interview with Czech newspaper Pravo , the Ivory Coast international has confirmed he would relish the chance to move to Stamford Bridge . <p> " I ca n't tell you much about that , but if it 's written that I am going there , that 's a good thing , right ?

##379150 <h> The number e <p> One of the first articles which we included in the " History Topics " section of our web archive was on the history of ? . It is a very popular article and has prompted many to ask for a similar article about the number e . There is a great contrast between the historical developments of these two numbers and in many ways writing a history of e is a much harder task than writing one for ? . The number e is , compared to ? , a relative newcomer on the mathematics scene . <p> The number e first comes into mathematics in a very minor way . This was in 1618 when , in an appendix to Napier ' s work on logarithms , a table appeared giving the natural logarithms of various numbers . However , that these were logarithms to base e was not recognised since the base to which logarithms are computed did not arise in the way that logarithms were thought about at this time . Although we now think of logarithms as the exponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required number , this is a modern way of thinking . We will come back to this point later in this essay . This table in the appendix , although carrying no author 's name , was almost certainly written by Oughtred . A few years later , in 1624 , again e almost made it into the mathematical literature , but not quite . In that year Briggs gave a numerical approximation to the base 10 logarithm of e but did not mention e itself in his work . <p> The next possible occurrence of e is again dubious . In 1647 Saint-Vincent computed the area under a rectangular hyperbola . Whether he recognised the connection with logarithms is open to debate , and even if he did there was little reason for him to come across the number e explicitly . Certainly by 1661 Huygens understood the relation between the rectangular hyperbola and the logarithm . He examined explicitly the relation between the area under the rectangular hyperbola yx = 1 and the logarithm . Of course , the number e is such that the area under the rectangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the property that makes e the base of natural logarithms , but this was not understood by mathematicians at this time , although they were slowly approaching such an understanding . <p> Huygens made another advance in 1661 . He defined a curve which he calls " logarithmic " but in our terminology we would refer to it as an exponential curve , having the form y = ka x . Again out of this comes the logarithm to base 10 of e , which Huygens calculated to 17 decimal places . However , it appears as the calculation of a constant in his work and is not recognised as the logarithm of a number ( so again it is a close call but e remains unrecognised ) . <p> Further work on logarithms followed which still does not see the number e appear as such , but the work does contribute to the development of logarithms . In 1668 Nicolaus Mercator published Logarithmotechnia which contains the series expansion of log ( 1+ x ) . In this work Mercator uses the term " natural logarithm " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e itself again fails to appear as such and again remains elusively just round the corner . <p> Perhaps surprisingly , since this work on logarithms had come so close to recognising the number e , when e is first " discovered " it is not through the notion of logarithm at all but rather through a study of compound interest . In 1683 Jacob Bernoulli looked at the problem of compound interest and , in examining continuous compound interest , he tried to find the limit of ( 1 + 1 / n ) n as n tends to infinity . He used the binomial theorem to show that the limit had to lie between 2 and 3 so we could consider this to be the first approximation found to e . Also if we accept this as a definition of e , it is the first time that a number was defined by a limiting process . He certainly did not recognise any connection between his work and that on logarithms . <p> We mentioned above that logarithms were not thought of in the early years of their development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equation x = a t , we deduce that t = log x where the log is to base a , but this involves a much later way of thinking . Here we are really thinking of log as a function , while early workers in logarithms thought purely of the log as a number which aided calculation . It may have been Jacob Bernoulli who first understood the way that the log function is the inverse of the exponential function . On the other hand the first person to make the connection between logarithms and exponents may well have been James Gregory . In 1684 he certainly recognised the connection between logarithms and exponents , but he may not have been the first . <p> As far as we know the first time the number e appears in its own right is in 1690 . In that year Leibniz wrote a letter to Huygens and in this he used the notation b for what we now call e . At last the number e had a name ( even if not its present one ) and it was recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we have not started our article on the history of e at the point where it makes its first appearance . The reason is that although the work we have described previously never quite managed to identify e , once the number was identified then it was slowly realised that this earlier work is relevant . Retrospectively , the early developments on the logarithm became part of an understanding of the number e . <p> We mentioned above the problems arising from the fact that log was not thought of as a function . It would be fair to say that Johann Bernoulli began the study of the calculus of the exponential function in 1697 when he published Principia calculi exponentialium seu percurrentium . The work involves the calculation of various exponential series and many results are achieved with term by term integration . <p> So much of our mathematical notation is due to Euler that it will come as no surprise to find that the notation e for this number is due to him . The claim which has sometimes been made , however , that Euler used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is ridiculous . It is probably not even the case that the e comes from " exponential " , but it may have just be the next vowel after " a " and Euler was already using the notation " a " in his work . Whatever the reason , the notation e made its first appearance in a letter Euler wrote to Goldbach in 1731 . He made various discoveries regarding e in the following years , but it was not until 1748 when Euler published Introductio in Analysin infinitorum that he gave a full treatment of the ideas surrounding e . He showed that <p> e = 1 + 1 / 1 ! + 1 / 2 ! + 1 / 3 ! + ... <p> and that e is the limit of ( 1 + 1 / n ) n as n tends to infinity . Euler gave an approximation for e to 18 decimal places , <p> e = 2.718281828459045235 <p> without saying where this came from . It is likely that he calculated the value himself , but if so there is no indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of 1 + 1 / 1 ! + 1 / 2 ! + 1 / 3 ! + ... will give the accuracy which Euler gave . Among other interesting results in this work is the connection between the sine and cosine functions and the complex exponential function , which Euler deduced using De Moivre ' s formula . <p> Interestingly Euler also gave the continued fraction expansion of e and noted a pattern in the expansion . In particular he gave <p> and <p> Euler did not give a proof that the patterns he spotted continue ( which they do ) but he knew that if such a proof were given it would prove that e is irrational . For , if the continued fraction for ( e - 1 ) /2 were to follow the pattern shown in the first few terms , 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , ... ( add 4 each time ) then it will never terminate so ( e - 1 ) /2 ( and so e ) can not be rational . One could certainly see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rational . <p> The same passion that drove people to calculate to more and more decimal places of ? never seemed to take hold in quite the same way for e . There were those who did calculate its decimal expansion , however , and the first to give e to a large number of decimal places was Shanks in 1854 . It is worth noting that Shanks was an even more enthusiastic calculator of the decimal expansion of ? . Glaisher showed that the first 137 places of Shanks calculations for e were correct but found an error which , after correction by Shanks , gave e to 205 places . In fact one needs about 120 terms of 1 + 1 / 1 ! + 1 / 2 ! + 1 / 3 ! + ... to obtain e correct to 200 places . <p> In 1864 Benjamin Peirce had his picture taken standing in front of a blackboard on which he had written the formula i - i = ? ( e ? ) . In his lectures he would say to his students : - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation means , but we may be sure that it means something very important . <p> Most people accept Euler as the first to prove that e is irrational . Certainly it was Hermite who proved that e is not an algebraic number in 1873 . It is still an open question whether e e is algebraic , although of course all that is lacking is a proof - no mathematician would seriously believe that e e is algebraic ! As far as we are aware , the closest that mathematicians have come to proving this is a recent result that at least one of e e and e to the power e 2 is transcendental . <p> Further calculations of decimal expansions followed . In 1884 Boorman calculated e to 346 places and found that his calculation agreed with that of Shanks as far as place 187 but then became different . In 1887 Adams calculated the

And if their first look is anything but to swear by , they both look fabulous together . Plus , the movie will also include veteran actors Pankaj Kapur and Shabana Azmi in the supporting cast . Now that 's some strong , powerful star cast . <p> While the bold &; seductive look of Anushka has created some waves on the internet , Imran too is being appreciated for his all-new rustic , rugged look that 's a 360 degrees change from his normal , chocolate-boy image ! The first trailer , in fact , has created enough buzz that 's required to elicit curiosity and interest among the audiences . <p> Coming back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Matru . While Anushka plays his love interest named Bijli ( electricity ! ) , followed by Pankaj Kapur with a reel name Mandola ! So going by the title , all three characters appear connected in some way . <p> Classified as a comedy-drama , Matru ki Bijli ka Mandola is the first movie in Imran 's career that is handled by an experienced director . Whereas prior to this he 's done movies with newbie 's only ! And this being the first time with Anushka too , she responded in this way , " This is the first time we are working together . I never thought we would look like this . But Imran has looked the hottest in the film , " <p> Hot Gossip -- During the initial rehearsals of the movie , Imran Khan wanted to back out as he thought the character of Matru was too difficult for him to play !

At times , getting too much on the stereotypical side ! But the pros , weighing more , elicit a smile here , a laugh there and finally tickle the sentimental bone of yours . An actor who has returned to silver screen after fifteen years , English Vinglish makes for a perfect comeback for Sridevi . Someone who earned the tag of first female superstar in Bollywood somehow seems to reinvent herself in the second innings and is just as beautiful and charming as before ! <p> As for a quick glance at the story , Sridevi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve her family . Albeit one drawback -- she 's not as well-versed in the English language as the rest of the family , making her a piece of embarrassment and mockery for her husband and kids . <p> Gauri Shinde ( the Director ) brings such real instants beautifully alive in the movie , like when the daughter is hesitant to flaunt Sridevi as her mother . I believe most of us could relate there in some way or the other ! Or be it Sridevi coping with the language when she lands to New York for her niece 's wedding ! <p> Once in New York , she finds an opportunity to learn English in simply four weeks through a course there . And so from there her vehicle sets in motion while she interacts with the other fellow students . She finds a friend in the French Chef ( Mehdi Nebbou ) who in turn is smitten by her simplicity and indeed helps her in gaining self-confidence . Either one being oblivious to each other 's language , their inept English suffices well for the communication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil the charm of the movie , we wo n't spill anymore beans !

##393351 <h> The Bismarck <p> The Bismarck , probably Germany ? s most famous battleship in World War Two , was sunk on May 27th 1941 . The Bismarck had already sunk HMS Hood before being sunk herself . For many , the end of the Hood and Bismarck symbolised the end of the time when battleships were the dominant force in naval warfare , to be replaced by submarines and aircraft carriers and the advantages these ships gave to naval commanders . <p> Survivors from the ' Bismarck ' <p> The Bismarck displaced over 50,000 tons and 40% of this displacement was armour . Such armour gave the Bismarck many advantages in protection but it did not inhibit her speed ? she was capable of 29 knots . Launched in 1939 , the Bismarck carried a formidable array of weaponry ? 8 x 15 inch guns , 12 x 5.9 inch guns , 16 x 4.1 inch AA guns , 16 x 20mm AA guns and 2 x Arado 96 aircraft . The Bismarck had a crew of 2,200 . <p> In comparison , HMS Hood ( built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crew of 1,419 and was faster than the Bismarck with a maximum speed of 32 knots . The Hood had been launched in 1918 and was armed with 8 x 15 inch guns , 12 x 5.5 inch guns , 8 x 4 inch AA guns , 24 x 2 pounder guns and 4 x 21 inch torpedoes . However , the Hood suffered from one major flaw ? she did not have the same amount of armour as the Bismarck . The fact that the Hood was faster than the Bismarck by 3 knots was as a result of her lack of sufficient armour . Within two minutes of being hit by the Bismarck , the Hood had broken her back and sunk . <p> On May 18th , 1941 , the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen slipped out of the Baltic port of Gdynia to attack Allied convoys in the Atlantic . Grand Admiral Raeder had already had experience of large warships attacking convoys at sea . Ships such as the Graf Spee , Admiral Scheer ( both pocket battleships ) , Hipper ( a cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at sea but had found that their power was limited by the fact that they were so far from a dock/port that could carry out repairs if they were needed . Such a difficulty meant that mighty ships such as the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were loathed to take on a convoy if that convoy was protected by any naval ship . In 1940 , both the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau came across a convoy returning from the UK to Halifax , Canada . However , the convoy was protected by HMS Ramillies and neither German ship could risk being hit by a ship that in other circumstances would easily be outgunned by both German ships . <p> To overcome the fear of damage at sea , Raeder ? s plan was for the German Navy to concentrate a powerful naval force in the Atlantic so that there would not be a concern about convoys and their protection . He intended for the Bismarck , the Prinz Eugen , the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau to operate in the Atlantic fully supported with supply and reconnaissance ships ? with such a force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection ships they had . However , Raeder ? s plan , code-named ? Exercise Rhine ? , was severely hampered from the start when the Gneisenau was hit by bombs while in Brest and the repairs needed for the Scharnhorst would take much longer than Raeder had anticipated . Regardless of this , Raeder ordered the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen to sail as planned . The ships sailed on May 18th ? but on May 20th , they were spotted by the Swedish cruiser ? Gotland ? off the Swedish coast and the admiral in command of both ships ? Ltjens ? knew that such information would be received in London before the 20th was out . He was right . <p> On May 21st , both ships docked at Kors Fjord , near Bergen . The Prinz Eugen needed to refuel . At night both ships left , and not long after this the area around Kors Fjord was bombed by the British . <p> To get into the Atlantic , both ships had to pass north of Scapa Flow ? one of Britain ? s largest naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George V ? , the newly commissioned ( but not battle ready ) battleship ? Prince of Wales ? , the battle-cruiser ? HMS Hood ? and the aircraft carrier ? HMS Victorious ? . With these ships were nine destroyers and four cruisers of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron . At sea in the vicinity were the cruisers ? Norfolk ? , ? Suffolk ? ? Manchester ? and ? Birmingham ? . The battleship ? Rodney ? was also on convoy duty in the Atlantic . <p> When the new reached the Admiralty that the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen had left Bergen , Admiral Sir John Tovey , Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet , ordered the ? Hood ? and the ? Prince of Wales ? to sail accompanied by six destroyers . The fleet left Scapa Flow on May 22nd . All other ships in Scapa Flow and some on the Clyde were put on short notice . On the same day , German reconnaissance for Ltjens , informed him that all the ships that should have been in Scapa Flow were still there . <p> This was incorrect as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltjens thought otherwise . He was also convinced that the weather was on his side as fog obscured many areas to the west of the Norwegian coast and Ltjens became satisfied that he could get into the Atlantic unseen . Such was his confidence that he failed to keep an appointment with a tanker , preferring to steam ahead to the Atlantic . To boost his fleet , Tovey ordered the ? Victorious ? to sail on the 22nd May and on the following day the battle cruiser HMS Repulse sailed . <p> At noon on May 23rd , the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen entered the Denmark Strait , between Iceland and Greenland . Here , Ltjens met problems . The fog he had expected to cover his fleet did not materialise and his ships were squeezed between the Greenland ice field that extended 80 miles out from south-east Greenland to the north-west tip of Iceland itself . Ltjens was well aware that this whole area had been mined by the British and he had to select his course well . The Royal Navy also knew that the Germans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at 19.22 on May 23rd , the cruiser ? Suffolk ? spotted both the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen . The ? Suffolk ? reported her sighting and HMS Norfolk picked this report up . At 20.22 , the Norfolk spotted both German ships . <p> The ? Suffolk ? s report had reached the ? Hood ? and Admiral Holland , on the ? Hood ? concluded that there were 300 miles between his ship and the Bismarck . Holland ordered that the ? Hood ? should steer a course to the exit of the Denmark Strait and the battle cruiser steamed off at 27 knots . At this speed , the ? Hood ? should have come into contact with the ? Bismarck ? at 06.00 on May 24th . The ? King George V ? and ? Victorious ? also picked up the message but were both 600 miles away and would have been unable to support the ? Hood ? on the following day at 06.00 . The Admiralty remained concerned for the safety of the convoys in the Atlantic as there was always the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Renown ? , ? Ark Royal ? and ? Sheffield ? were ordered to sea from Gibraltar to give further protection to the convoys . <p> The ? Bismarck ? had darkness on her side and for a couple of hours , the ? Suffolk ? and ? Norfolk ? lost touch with the Bismarck . Without their positioning information , the ? Hood ? could easily have lost contact with the Bismarck . However , by 02.47 on May 24th , the Suffolk had regained contact with the Bismarck . The information sent back by the ? Suffolk ? led the Hood to believe that she would be just 20 miles from the Bismarck at 05.30 on May 24th . At 05.35 , the lookout from the Hood made out the Prinz Eugen and the Bismarck at a distance of 17 miles . <p> Holland ordered the Hood to turn to the German ships and at 05.45 they were only 22,000 metres apart . At 05.52 , the ? Hood ? opened fire and shortly afterwards was joined by the ? Prince of Wales ? . At 05.54 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily against the ? Hood ? . <p> The Prinz Eugen hit the Hood and set alight some anti-aircraft shells kept on deck . The fire this caused was not particularly dangerous for the ? Hood ? even though it produced a great deal of smoke . At 06.00 a salvo from the Bismarck hit the Hood . The Bismarck had fired from 17,000 metres and the elevation of her guns meant that the shells that hit the ? Hood ? had a high trajectory and a steep angle of descent . The Hood had minimal horizontal armour and one of the shells from the Bismarck penetrated the Hood ? s deck and exploded in one of her magazines . A massive explosion tore the ? Hood ? in half . Those who saw the explosion said that the bows of the ? Hood ? were raised out of the sea before they sank . The ship sank extremely quickly and only three men out of a total crew of 1,419 survived . <p> After the destruction of the ? Hood , the Germans turned their fire onto the ? Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the best course of action was to turn away under the cover of smoke and , along with the ? Suffolk ? and ? Norfolk ? continue to tail the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen . <p> However , the Bismarck had not escaped untouched by the battle . One shell had pierced two oil tanks . The damage it did to the ship was minimal but it did mean that 1000 tons of fuel was no longer available to the Bismarck as the shell had cut off this supply . Other senior officers on the Bismarck advised Ltjens to return to Germany buoyed by the success against the ? Hood ? . This advice was not listened to . <p> Ltjens decided to split up the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen . He had hoped to split up the Royal Navy that was doggedly pursuing him alone . In this he failed . As the Prinz Eugen steamed away , the pursuers targeted only the Bismarck . At this point the battleship King George V was only 200 miles away and closing fast . Accompanying the ? King George V ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 24th , nine Swordfish torpedo-bombers left the ? Victorious ? to attack the Bismarck . Using directions from the ? Norfolk ? , the planes attacked through the cloud and found themselves attacking an American coast guard ship . By midnight the planes had found the Bismarck and attacked . Eight torpedoes were fired at the Bismarck and one hit home amidships . It did no damage to the ship but it may well have undermined Ltjens ? self-confidence as he announced to the ship ? crew that 27 aircraft had been shot down . He also informed Berlin that it was impossible for him to shake off the Royal Navy and that he was abandoning the task in hand to sail to St Nazaire as his ship was short of fuel . <p> As the Bismarck sailed , she was tailed by the Suffolk , Norfolk and Prince of Wales . Just after 03.06 on May 25th , the Suffolk lost contact with the Bismarck and it was assumed that she was steaming west into the Atlantic . In fact , the Bismarck was doing the opposite ? sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swordfish from the Victorious were sent up to look for the Bismarck but found nothing . The Norfolk and Suffolk also drew a blank . What gave away the Bismarck was the Bismarck itself . <p> For reasons not known , Ltjens sent Hitler a message about his contact with the Hood which took 30 minutes to send by radio . This message was picked up by the Royal Navy . However , the information sent to Tovey was misleading as he was not in a position to interpret the bearing given to him by the Admiralty . The Admiralty also made another error . It failed to use gnomonic charts for its bearings and the King George V was given the position of the Bismarck but it was 200 miles out . This led Tovey to believe that the Bismarck was trying to return to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroes Gap . Through no fault of his own , Tovey was wrong . <p> The Admiralty did realise its mistake and informed Tovey that the Bismarck was , in fact , making for the Biscay ports . At 18.10 the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , the Royal Navy was given the correct course to follow but the Bismarck had a lead on them of 110 miles . The weather also favoured the Bismarck as it was deteriorating and visibility was reduced as the cloud as low . The Admiralty used Catalina flying boats to search for the Bismarck . On May 27th , the Catalina ? s finally spotted the Bismarck . This information was given to the Swordfish crews from the Ark Royal which was steaming up from Gibraltar . They took off at 14.30 in rapidly deteriorating weather . <p> The lead Swordfish spotted a large ship on its radar and fourteen planes dived through cloud for an attack . Unfortunately , they attacked the ? Sheffield ? as no-one had told them that the ? Sheffield ? was in the same area as the Bismarck shadowing the giant German battleship . Luckily no damage was done to the ? Sheffield ? . <p> The Swordfish returned to the ? Victorious ? to be re-fuelled and re-armed . By 19.10 , they were airborne once again . At 19.40 they spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the ? Bismarck ? -12 miles to the south-east . Fifteen planes attacked the ? Bismarck ? and there were two definite torpedo hits and one probable . One of the torpedoes did considerable damage to the battleship by damaging her starboard propeller , wrecking her steering gear and jamming her rudders . Two observation planes saw the ? Bismarck ? literally sailing in circles in the immediate aftermath of the attack and at less than 8 knots . The attack had crippled the ? Bismarck ? . The only saving grace for Ltjens was that the night had come and the darkness gave him some hint of cover . However , throughout the night the stricken battleship was harassed by destroyers under the command of Captain Vian . <p> The destroyers shadowed the ? Bismarck ? and fed her position back to the ? Norfolk ? . The ? Norfolk ? was joined by the battleships ? Rodney ? and the ? King George V ? . On May 27th at 08.47 , the ? Rodney ? opened fire on the ? Bismarck ? . At 08.48 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ? Bismarck ? fired back but a salvo from the ? Rodney ? took out the two forward gun turrets of the ? Bismarck ? . By 10.00 all her main guns had been silenced and her mast had been blown away . By 10.10 , all her secondary armaments had been destroyed and the giant ship simply wallowed in the water . At 10.15 , Tovey called off his battleships and ordered the ? Dorsetshire ? to sink the ? Bismarck ? with torpedoes . Three torpedoes were fired at the ? Bismarck ? and she sank at 10.40 . Out of her crew of 2,200 , there were only 115 survivors . Only 2 officers out of 100 survived . <p> The ? Prinz Eugen ? returned to Brest on June 1st and all but one of the supply ships sent out with the ? Bismarck ? and ? Prinz Eugen ? were sunk . ?

It is also home to the magnificent Virunga Volcanic Mountains , whose dense high-altitude forests protect about half the world 's remaining mountain gorillas . <p> Standard game viewing is especially good in A'Kagera National Park in eastern Rwanda . The park is a mixture of woodland , open grassland and papyrus swamps . It boasts healthy populations of lion , leopard , plains game , hippo , giraffe , elephant , as well as many bird species . <p> Nyungwe National Park contains the largest remaining single tract of montane forest in Africa and is home to a phenomenal number of birds and primates , including chimpanzees , the Ruwenzori colobus monkey and the endangered golden monkey . <p> Lake Kivu , on the other hand , offers quite a contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any trip around Rwanda ; beautiful beaches , jutting peninsulas and an archipelago of islands , busy with traders and local fishermen in their dugout canoes , can be found here .

##414251 <h> Tips for the telephone interview <p> You might think that the best thing about a telephone interview is that , like a radio presenter , you do n't have to worry about how you look . <p> But , an interview is still an interview even if you do n't have to go to their offices . You need to be as prepared and well presented as you would be for a face to face interview . <p> Initial interviews by telephone are more common than they used to be . It 's an inexpensive way to screen candidates in the initial stages of a recruitment campaign . The recruiter may just be looking for a confident manner and intelligent responses to some set questions . But do n't take anything for granted . You may find you are on the phone for an hour and a half and are expected to answer detailed questions about previous roles and achievements . <p> Do n't allow yourself to be caught on the hop . If you 're not able to make some quiet time when they call then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to be a bit more organised about the telephone interview because it 's on your home turf . Make sure you wo n't be interrupted and be sure to charge your phone in advance . Keep a copy of your CV by the phone and all the other relevant information you might need . Prepare and compose yourself in advance . If you sound confused and disorganised you might not get a second chance . <p> You should have some information from the prospective employer about the role and company . Think about answers you might give to their questions , particularly with regard to competency based questions . Do your research and prepare some questions to ask them exactly as you would for a regular interview . <p> Smile when you talk on the telephone . You 'll be more relaxed , you 'll sound more confident and assertive . Seriously think about using a headset for telephone interviews . Apart from the fact that it will make it much easier to take notes you 'll be able to concentrate on the conversation rather than on balancing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen . <p> In all other respects treat the interview as you would a one to one but remember that time tends to be limited for a phone interview . It 's a good idea to ask at the start , if not before the interview , about the structure or sequence of the interview process so you know what to expect . If part of the process is going to be that you are offered a choice of topics to brainstorm you do n't want to be taken by surprise . <p> A phone interview is likely to feel less spontaneous and flexible than a one to one . The interviewer may well have a set script of questions and while you may feel rushed , at some points , if the interviewer thinks they have the information they need they will want to move on . <p> This is the tricky thing about the telephone interview - you ca n't judge reactions in the same way as when you are face to face with an interviewer . It 's a little harder to engage the interviewer in a two-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of tick boxes . As you do n't get the feedback or body language information that help in the face to face situation , it might be useful to ask questions such as " is that what you needed to know ?

Pace yourself , a good interviewer knows you may need a little time to compose a good response , so do take time to think about answers . Be aware that they may be pushing you to answer as part of their interview technique . Listen carefully and if you do n't fully understand the question , ask for clarification . Do n't allow yourself to become flustered , especially if some of the questions seem either irrelevant or overly-specific . And remember the interviewer may need some time to make notes between questions so do n't worry unduly about short silences , be patient . <p> Make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview ends you can write them a thank you note , so as to reiterate your interest in the role and outline key points discussed and what you think you bring to the table . <p> Helen Menhenett 
##421852 <h> No light at the end of the Heart of Darkness <p> An annual return to the home my grandfather retired to and a rifle through the rump of his library sparks off a reflection on the way in which the main questions raised by Conrad 's " Heart of Darkness " are answered - far from optimistically - in his " Lord Jim " <p> Jesus , who 's name is pronounced like the monkey , ' rhesus ' , not like the Messiah and who had been my grandmother 's gardner , came by the other evening - our second evening at La Vina , the small house at the end of the dirt track that I 've written about before . He sat down at the terrace with the mushroom table above the vaulted Moorish water cistern . My mother - who 's known him for ages - since her teens here in Menorca , anyway - asked him about his health , his family , his garden , his house . He was happy to talk about all that , and as I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reminded me of her father , the man who retired here , who pretended , along with Omar Khayam whom he tried to translate better than Fitzgerald , that heaven was a garden , a book of verse , a glass of wine and " her " , whoever she was , whatever she was for in this particular vision of contented bliss . Indeed , here is that very verse from the rump of his library in the little house . <p> These summers at La Vina become moments to think about generations for me . My grandfather retired here in the late 1950s . He is present - mainly through his library now , but a few other touches here and there as well . Like the welcoming tile encrusted next t o the front door . He was no Arabist - he always loved Persian culture but had never become one of those Foreign Office lovers of Arabia . But maybe he thought the protection of Allah felt right , given the Moorish past of the island . The cistern that is at the heart of livability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from before the expulsion of the Arabs . <p> My mother was a teenager here ; we - my siblings and I - came as children , as teen-agers , as adults ; we come now as parents . And even my grandfather 's time here , to judge from his library , was a time of remembering and of trying to understand . According to my mother , he had said , in retirement , that " I have spent my whole professional life working for the British national interest , and no one has been able to tell me what that is or why it 's of such importance . " <p> Judging by the library , he spent at least as much time , here in the summer heat , pondering his adventurous , " great game " professional life as he did trying to honour his allegiance to the noble hedonism of the Rubayat . <p> One of the books I picked up in the rump library this year - I was struck at first by the name of the editor , Marion Miliband ( wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Observer book of the 19th Century " - a 1966 compilation of Observer articles written between 1800 and 1900 that tells the story of how t he immediate post-colonial period chose to understand the rise of British power across the globe . JPP - my grandfather - did not buy a lot of new books in the 60s . This one 's not a bad place to start for someone troubled by what the British Empire turned out to have been and troubled by their own role in the story . <p> Austen Henry Layard , whose classic 3 volume history of Nineveh is also in the library , well-thumbed , is quoted in the Observer anthology in 1857 on what Marion Miliband still calls the Indian Mutiny : <p> What has taken place in India is horrible , but are our hands clean ? From the very beginning our empire was founded upon fraud ... Hitherto , you Britain have done nothing to reconcile the feelings of the people of India to the Government which rules them . If you tell them you are a peaceful , a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of those who are not Christians , but will take possession of their property and their country , that would be honest ; but you must be prepared to carry out your doctrine by force . But by practically acting upon that doctrine , while pretending to respect the rights of the Indian people and professing a regard for their interest , you have so weakened your moral power over them that the whole country is against you . <p> Layard is impressively radical in his assessment of the time . Unusually so . And thumbing Nineveh myself , I get a real sense of the indignation of the man as he tells the story of the Chaldeans - the ancient Iraqi Christian community - and its betrayal by all before his very eyes . Almost 100 years before , he seems to share the sensitivity of Orwell , quoted by Pankaj Mishra , who continues his excellent , indignant series against the new apologists of empire in the Guardian . Orwell 's judgement was that the empire was " despotism with theft its final object " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagines is the Whiggish view of the day . Here , for example , is a report of a speech by Asquith in 1898 : <p> We should never allow ourselves to forget that in the course of history Russia and ourselves had become what might not extravagantly be called " trustees of the Asiatic world " ( cheers ) . There we stood , in that vast continent inhabited by an enormous population , some of which had relapsed into a barbarism from which a large part of the remainder had never emerged , and upon the cordial cooperation of these two greater civilising agencies of the West depended not merely our own industrial future , but the whole development of the continent of Asia itself ( cheers ) . <p> This is certainly a wonderful example of the move that Mishra notes , in the words of the Indian nationalist , Aurobindo Ghose , that the notion of the trusteeship was a " Pharisaic pretension ... especially necessary to British imperialism because in England the puritanic middle class had risen to power and imparted to the English temperament a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoliation except under a cloak of virtue , benevolence and unselfish altruism . <p> Mishra quotes Conrad twice in his piece , both times , unsurprisingly , from Heart of Darkness - the haunting story of the narrator 's ( Marlow 's ) expedition to recover Kurtz , the brilliant ivory trader who has not just gone native - he has " gone divine " . Alongside his trading duties , Kurtz had agreed to help <p> the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs who had intrusted him with the making of a report , for its future guidance . And he had written it too . I 've seen it . I 've read it . It was eloquent , vibrating with eloquence , but too high-strung , I think . Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for ! ... it was a beautiful piece of writing . The opening paragraph , however , in the light of later information , strikes me now as ominous . He began with the argument that we whites , from the point of development we had arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of supernatural beings -- we approach them with the might as of a deity , ' and so on , and so on . ' By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded , ' &c.,; &c.; From that point he soared and took me with him . The peroration was magnificent , though difficult to remember , you know . It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence . It made me tingle with enthusiasm . This was the unbounded power of eloquence -- of words -- of burning noble words . There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases , unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page , scrawled evidently much later , in an unsteady hand , may be regarded as the exposition of a method . <p> Conrad 's prescience is in the method that he saw was required for the ends of the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs to really be met . Hand-scrawled by Kurtz on the lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes . " If they refuse the message of ' civilisation ' - and who does not , when delivered by " Gods " like Kurtz - you turn them to your side by extermination . <p> That is in fact exactly what had been happening in the Congo . Known , perhaps to Conrad the sailor and sea-captain , but not to the Observer , whose 1895 comment on the annexation of the Congo by the Belgian crown , says : <p> ... there is no reason to doubt that a philanthropic desire to benefit the native races , to assist in the suppression of the slave trade , and to spread the blessings of civilisation , did actuate the promoters of the movement to an extent which is , perhaps scarcely sufficiently recognised today . <p> It was not , however , long before other motives , equally legitimate it may be , came into play ... by slow degrees European statesmen awoke to the fact that the greater part of a continent was to be had for the taking , and then began that scramble of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving communications , in developing the natural resources of the country , in introducing new industries , and in teaching the elementary lessons of civilisation to the millions of savages that occupy the basins of the Congo and its tributaries , Belgium will have a task that will try her to the utmost ... <p> Poor little Belgium , thinks the Observer ... will it ruin itself in its noble endeavour ? But Conrad gets it right : Kurtz 's initial motivation in going to the Congo on his ivory mission is , as far as we know , mainly about status and wealth . Kurtz , like the newly created Belgian monarchy , has a mother who is half English and a father who is half French . This is meant to mean he is " a good sort " . Conrad saw no need to fill in those blanks about his ancestry in his account of the kind of " good sort " Kurtz really is . <p> Here is Marlow recomposing the story of his extraordinary passenger by talking to his fiance back in Brussels : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproved by her people . He was n't rich enough or something . And indeed I do n't know whether he had not been a pauper all his life . He had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there . " <p> But once Kurtz had gone out - even made a success of himself as an ivory trader - he became hooked on something much more destructive , on straight power , on that immense power that he talked about in his report : <p> ' I was on the threshold of great things , ' he Kurtz pleaded , in a voice of longing , with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold . ... I tried to break the spell -- the heavy , mute spell of the wilderness -- that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts , by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions . This alone , I was convinced , had driven him out to the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires , the throb of drums , the drone of weird incantations ; this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations . ... I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low . ... There was nothing either above or below him , and I knew it . He had kicked himself loose of the earth . Confound the man ! he had kicked the very earth to pieces . He was alone , and I before him did not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air . ... He struggled with himself , too . I saw it , -- I heard it . I saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint , no faith , and no fear , yet struggling blindly with itself . I kept my head pretty well ; but when I had him at last stretched on the couch , I wiped my forehead , while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only supported him , his bony arm clasped round my neck -- and he was not much heavier than a child . <p> There is many a darkness at the heart of Kurtz 's story . One of them is simply narrative - we have no idea what maintains Kurtz in his position as deity in his bend on the shallow river . We have no idea what transforms the noble sentiments of the report into " the horror , the horror " of what transpires , of the final recommendation for implementation , the only possible and final solution : extermination . After all , Kurtz might just have been a bad apple ... who is to say that the Whiggish optimism of the Observer was an impossibility ? Why should we take Kurtz 's disposition - " a soul that knew no restraint , no faith , and no fear , yet struggling blindly with itself " - as emblematic of what happened to the powerful colonialist ? <p> The answer , in Conrad 's work , comes from a strange quarter . The really pessimistic account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty dark - is to be found in Lord Jim , in which the best colonialist imaginable - the endlessly devoted , self-sacrificing servant of his bend in the river - nevertheless abandons " his " people and forces them into a sad exile . At the end of the book , the information about the last days of Jim 's life is recomposed , nth hand , from the accounts of a sad group of lost , ghost-like Malaysians whom he should have stood by , to whom he pretended to be pledged . <p> Jim shows us how Kurtz might have gone about achieving supreme power and he shows us that , at least temporarily , the colonial intervention might have been seen to conform to the Observer 's hopeful picture . <p> Jim starts out his colonial experience with a great dereliction of duty . He is a vicar 's son . He leaves home , in Essex , with the conviction that " when all men flinched , then he alone would know how to deal with the spurious menace of wind and seas . " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If " , Jim would stand firm . The test comes , eventually , in the form so characteristic of Conrad - the boat as microcosm . The Patna is a picture of the late colonial enterprise - a rusty old hulk , being driven by its owner for maximum profit , it happens to be transporting hold-full of Muslim pilgrims from East Asia to Mecca . There is a sort of special trust that the mysteriously primitive pilgrims have placed in the officers of the Patna - a trust which is broken in Jim 's first act of cowardly abandonment . <p> The Patna was a local steamer as old as the hills , lean like a greyhound , and eaten up with rust worse than a condemned water-tank . She was owned by a Chinaman , chartered by an Arab , and commanded by a sort of renegade New South Wales German , very anxious to curse publicly his native country , but who , apparently on the strength of Bismarck 's victorious policy , brutalised all those he was not afraid of , and wore a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a red moustache . After she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside , eight hundred pilgrims ( more or less ) were driven on board of her as she lay with steam up alongside a wooden jetty . <p> They streamed aboard over three gangways , they streamed in urged by faith and the hope of paradise , they streamed in with a continuous tramp and shuffle of bare feet , without a word , a murmur , or a look back ; and when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck , flowed forward and aft , overflowed down the yawning hatchways , filled the inner recesses of the ship -- like water filling a cistern , like water flowing into crevices and crannies , like water rising silently even with the rim . Eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes , with affections and memories , they had collected there , coming from north and south and from the outskirts of the East , after treading the jungle paths , descending the rivers , coasting in praus along the shallows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through suffering , meeting strange sights , beset by strange fears , upheld by one desire . They came from solitary huts in the wilderness , from populous campongs , from villages by the sea . At the call of an idea they had left their forests , their clearings , the protection of their rulers , their prosperity , their poverty , the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers . They came covered with dust , with sweat , with grime , with rags -- the strong men at the head of family parties , the lean old men pressing forward without hope of return ; young boys with fearless eyes glancing curiously , shy little girls with tumbled long hair ; the timid women muffled up and clasping to their breasts , wrapped in loose ends of soiled head-cloths , their sleeping babies , the unconscious pilgrims of an exacting belief . <p> There is meant to be decency in the professionalism of seamen in Conrad . In Heart of Darkness , just after the dying Kurtz murmurs his final and terrifying " The horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all his honesty , can not bring himself to tell the fiancee back in Brussels ) , we have a reminder of the possibility of basic human decency that the microcosm of the boat offers . Marlow is comparing the death of Kurtz to the death of his pilot that the mission has cost : <p> I am not prepared to affirm the fellow Kurtz was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him . I missed my late helmsman awfully , -- I missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house . Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara . Well , do n't you see , he had done something , he had steered ; for months I had him at my back -- a help -- an instrument . It was a kind of partnership . He steered for me -- I had to look after him , I worried about his deficiencies , and thus a subtle bond had been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly broken . And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory -- like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment . <p> In Lord Jim , we again get a sense of the decency that arises out of the role of seaman . This is meant to be the basic value that civilises the every-day of colonial life : <p> We 've got all kinds amongst us -- some anointed scoundrels in the lot ; but , hang it , we must preserve professional decency or we become no better than so many tinkers going about loose . We are trusted . Do you understand ? -- trusted ! Frankly , I do n't care a snap for all the pilgrims that ever came out of Asia , but a decent man would not have behaved like this to a full cargo of old rags in bales . We are n't an organised body of men , and the only thing that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then - hangs around various South Asian ports in shame . In his own eyes , and in the eyes of anyone who knows , he failed in that basic colonial virtue of decency . He picks up odd jobs and does them with diligence - even recklessness abandon . But he ca n't forget his cowardice . He knows that he will never be able to return home to Essex - the shame precludes that . <p> Marlow - the wise captain of both novels , the man who really does represent decency - is himself about to return home , but he feels he has somehow to ensure Jim 's redemption . Here is how he puts his own motives for becoming involved in the story : <p> I was about to go home for a time ; and it may be I desired , more than I was aware of myself , to dispose of him -- to dispose of him , you understand -- before I left . I was going home , and he had come to me from there , with his miserable trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden in a mist . I can not say I had ever seen him distinctly -- not even to this day , after I had my last view of him ; but it seemed to me that the less I understood the more I was bound to him in the name of that doubt which is the inseparable part of our knowledge . I did not know so much more about myself . And then , I repeat , I was going home -- to that home distant enough for all its hearthstones to be like one hearthstone , by which the humblest of us has the right to sit . We wander in our thousands over the face of the earth , the illustrious and the obscure , earning beyond the seas our fame , our money , or only a crust of bread ; but it seems to me that for each of us going home must be like going to render an account . We return to face our superiors , our kindred , our friends -- those whom we obey , and those whom we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , lonely , irresponsible and bereft of ties , -- even those for whom home holds no dear face , no familiar voice , -- even they have to meet the spirit that dwells within the land , under its sky , in its air , in its valleys , and on its rises , in its fields , in its waters and its trees -- a mute friend , judge , and inspirer . Say what you like , to get its joy , to breathe its peace , to face its truth , one must return with a clear conscience . All this may seem to you sheer sentimentalism ; and indeed very few of us have the will or the capacity to look consciously under the surface of familiar emotions . There are the girls we love , the men we look up to , the tenderness , the friendships , the opportunities , the pleasures ! But the fact remains that you must touch your reward with clean hands , lest it turn to dead leaves , to thorns , in your grasp . <p> Marlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and every seaman 's , every European colonialist 's . If Jim 's crime can not be made good , if that breach of trust is irreparable , then Marlow 's own homecoming will turn to thorns . By this point , Jim 's act of betrayal has become emblematic of late colonialism . There may be no redeeming of Kurtz - except through a lie , to his fiancee - but Marlow can still make the whole business all right if only Jim can redeem himself . As Marlow remarks as he goes to Jim 's sentencing for the abandonment of the Pilgrims , " the real significance of crime is in its being a breach of faith with the community of mankind " , and Marlow needs that faith to be restored for his own impeccably decent life to afford a good homecoming . <p> He talks with Stein , a wise and successful trader , a Swiss butterfly collector with a trading empire based out of Bangkok . Marlow explains the case , and the two men sense the imperative of finding some solution . It becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one remedy ! One thing alone can us from being ourselves cure ! " sic , to which Marlow assents : " Yes , strictly speaking , the question is not how to get cured , but how to live . " Stein 's strategy is the one that almost works : <p> " A man that is born falls into a dream like a man who falls into the sea . If he tries to climb out into the air as inexperienced people endeavour to do , he drowns -- nicht wahr ? . . . No ! I tell you ! The way is to the destructive element submit yourself , and with the exertions of your hands and feet in the water make the deep , deep sea keep you up . So if you ask me -- how to be ? " <p> ... He sat down and , with both elbows on the desk , rubbed his forehead . " And yet it is true -- it is true . In the destructive element immerse . " . . . <p> There it is - redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element immerse , " a sort of existential turn-the-other-cheek . What destroyed Jim was his failure to live up to the standard expected of the vicar 's son . The destructive element was Jim 's cowardice and betrayal of the pilgrims . Only an immersion , a confrontation with that destructive element will allow Jim 's crime to be made good . <p> High moral standards also play their part in leading Kurtz over the edge . Here is Marlow contrasting Roman imperialism to Victorian colonialism in Heart of Darkness : <p> They The Romans were no colonists ; their administration was merely a squeeze , and nothing more , I suspect . They were conquerors , and for that you want only brute force -- nothing to boast of , when you have it , since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others . They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got . It was just robbery with violence , aggravated murder on a great scale , and men going at it blind -- as is very proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves , is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much . What redeems it is the idea only . An idea at the back of it ; not a sentimental pretense but an idea ; and an unselfish belief in the idea -- something you can set up , and bow down before , and offer a sacrifice to . . . . <p> In Kurtz 's case , the high morality is never abandoned , never betrayed - it is taken to one extreme of its inexorable logic : " exterminate all the brutes . " " Civilisation " is the surpreme good , the justification for the plunder ; so if it is refused , if the seed is sown and falls on barren ground , then there is nothing there to value . The method of extermination has all the justification it needs : its result , its end , is the thing of value : the end of brutishness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans . Kurtz is faithful to the great power he identifies , to the " White man 's burden " . But as Conrad sees , it is the unquestioned belief in that destiny which allows Kurtz to embrace the excess , to become himself that being before whom one bows down . He becomes the idea , the God , that allows the extermination of brutishness ; and the pleasures of divinity may just blind the God to the brutishness the method itself is perpetrating . That , perhaps , is the final realisation of the dying , hallucinating Kurtz , whose verdict is another epitaph , one to come after " Exterminate all the brutes " : " The horror . The horror . " <p> As Conrad tells it , there is something especially corrupting in the righteousness of empire - something that Orwell 's unsentimental reduction of empire to theft does not capture . Orwell sees the exercise as no more than Roman-style plunder ; Conrad reminds us of the utterly corrosive nature of plunder armed with righteousness . <p> Jim abandons the pilgrims of the Patna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he almost wishes they had been exterminated - that would have give n reason for his c owardice . But he is aware that his action was a complete betrayal of the idea , of the destiny of White Man as seen by Kipling . Jim 's betrayal is the empire 's betrayal . Here , then , is the dilemma at the heart of Lord Jim : in the face of the knowledge of the great betrayal , of treating those humans as if they were cattle , is redemption possible ? Marlow can not go home with a clear conscience and enjoy the fruits of his years of decent work without trying to clear that guilt . He recognises Jim 's guilt as his guilt , as the breach of trust that he too , for all his decency , has been complicit in . Jim is the ideal vehicle for redemption : he was directly guilty , his shame never left him , he will do everything possible to make good . He is Messianic in his desire for self-sacrifice . <p> Jim earns himself the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt-induced self-sacrificing devotion to the general good of Patusan . He indeed " immerses himself in the destructive element " , in his old cowardice and failed service to the natives . He is given a chance - not to reach for the sky , but to make the deep , deep sea " of his guilt and crime support him . Extreme courage in the service of the natives is meant to right the cowardice of his youthful abandonment of the pilgrims . <p> It almost works . Patusan thrives economically ; he delivers justice wisely ; he stands up to bullies ; and he regularly , ritually , shows that he is prepared to die for the good of all . It could all be a commentary on Kipling 's poem . Conrad is as prescient in his account of the good intentions and motivations of guilty Europeans as he is in his account of the monstrosities that were going to be perpetrated , for the century ahead , by a humanity trapped in " a soul that knew no restraint , no faith , and no fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation , Stein gets the Dutch government to allow gunpowder to be stored in Jim 's compound . He may be prepared to die for all the natives ... but he also has overwhelming force behind him . So at the denouement , when the worm enters from the world " out there " , Jim is at the centre of the fight against the destruction of the good society he has created . He is like the best-intentioned of the neo-cons today . He has never shared the beneficent power that he monopolises with his subjects . In other words , he has constructed the wrong kind of Arcadia , and that he has done so is inevitable given the reason he had for building it . He is the all-controlling power - that is what redemption requires . How could he actually share that power ? It was the status quo he found in Patusan , the uneasy , trade-destroying balance between the Malays , The Bugis and the Arab that needed his attention in the first place . The selfishness of Jim 's selfless justice is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denouement is that Brown , the vile Australian renegade who disturbs the peace , has the canny ability to figure out that Jim 's own unquenchable need for forgiveness leads him to always try to forgive others . And so it is that the everyday nastiness of " out there " destroys the attempt to make good the world Jim has charge of : <p> It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which , after twenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying , refused him the tribute of a common robber 's success . It was an act of cold-blooded ferocity , and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an indomitable defiance . <p> The colonial world has made Brown - will always make Browns - the selfish adventurer whose resentments and failures are all-consuming . That is just a part of human society . Patusan before Jim has characters like this - the vile Cornelius , the Portuguese trader , whose hatred of Jim plays its own part in the destruction of the ill-conceived idyl . But Brown and Jim are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and a sniper ; Jim has gunpowder and the overwhelming desire for self-sacrifice . Their confrontation is inevitably going to bring down much more than their own lives . <p> It is the idea of moral superiority leads Kurtz to his excesses . It is the thorough application of ' moral superiority ' that leads Jim inexorably to his own sacrifice and to abandon " his people " . The tragic irony is that it is the original dereliction of the pilgrims on the Patna that leads to Jim 's self-sacrificing virtue in Patusan . And yet it is that very conception of virtue that leads him to his second abandonment - morally more glorious , but just as bad for " his people " who are forced into their sad exile . Brown disturbs the carefully constructed balance of forces - a something or other from " out there " always will - a need for oil , a geopolitically important location ... whatever it is that makes pragmatism trump virtue ... and you just jump ship again . <p> Sunder Katwala asks , about the opening ceremony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermath is still not admissible in the company of the world 's nations . Pankaj Mishra asks why the new apologists of empire are so popular . And I rifle through the library of a decent ageing man who tried to have the sort of homecoming that Marlow hoped for , that Omar Khayyam lyricises , but whose library shows all the traces of someone who needed to understand why that blissful reward was simply not available . <p> Conrad - between Kurtz and Jim - seems to me to offer the keys to an understanding of the European part of this story : the worst result of self-righteousness is now well-known and Heart of Darkness is its rightfully acknowledged chronicle ; and Lord Jim shows that the best

##433052 <h> A quick guide to what 's on this page <h> Breast cancer tests <p> You usually start by seeing your GP . Your GP will examine you and if necessary refer you to a specialist breast clinic . <h> At the breast clinic <p> The doctor or specialist nurse will take your medical history and examine your breasts . They will also feel for any enlarged lymph nodes under your arms and at the base of your neck . You may also need some of the following tests . <h> Mammogram or ultrasound <p> A mammogram is an X-ray of the breasts . If you are under 35 you are more likely to have an ultrasound scan instead of a mammogram . You may also have it if you have a lump that does n't show up on the mammogram . <h> Having a biopsy <p> A biopsy means taking a small sample of cells or tissue from your breast and looking at them under a microscope to see if they are cancerous . Often your biopsy can be done with a local anaesthetic . But sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anaesthetic . There are different types of biopsy . <h> Waiting for results <p> Waiting for test results is always an anxious time . While you are waiting it may help to talk to a close friend or relative about how you feel . Or you may want to contact a cancer support group to talk to someone who has been through a similar experience . <h> Going to your GP <p> In some situations the GP may ask you to go back again in a couple of weeks time . This is because some non cancerous breast tissue changes naturally disappear after a menstrual period . Waiting a couple of weeks may make you anxious . But your GP would n't suggest this if there were any obvious signs of cancer . <h> At the hospital or breast clinic <p> The doctor or breast care nurse will take your medical history before doing a physical examination . They will <p> Examine your breasts <p> Feel for any enlarged lymph nodes under your arms and at the base of your neck <p> After your examination , you may need some tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . You may have these tests on your first visit to the hospital or breast clinic . Or your nurse may arrange further appointments for you . <h> Mammograms <p> A mammogram is an X-ray of the breasts . <p> Mammography is useful for finding early changes in the breast , when it may be difficult to feel a lump . It is n't as helpful in younger women though . If you are under 35 , your specialist is likely to suggest that you have an ultrasound instead of a mammogram . <p> Mammography can be uncomfortable because the breasts are put between two metal plates and a little pressure is applied . But most women describe this as mild to moderate discomfort . It only lasts a few minutes . The pressure does n't harm the breasts . <h> Breast ultrasound scans <p> Ultrasound scans use sound waves to make a picture of the inside of the body . Breast ultrasound is painless and takes just a few minutes . It is usually used for women under 35 whose breasts are too dense or solid to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultrasound if you have a lump in the breast that does n't show up on the mammogram . <p> Ultrasound can also show if a breast lump is solid , or if it contains fluid . A fluid filled lump is called a cyst . <h> Having a biopsy <p> A breast biopsy means taking a small sample of cells or tissue from your breast . Your doctor sends the sample to a laboratory and a specialist doctor called a pathologist examines it under a microscope . The pathologist can see if the sample contains areas of cancer . <p> Needle biopsy is also called a core biopsy or Tru-Cut biopsy . You may have this test under a local anaesthetic . The anaesthetic numbs the area and allows the doctor to take a core of tissue from the lump . In this type of biopsy the pathologist can see the cells in place within the piece of breast tissue that has been removed . So it is possible to tell a non invasive cancer ( DCIS ) from invasive breast cancer with this test . <p> A Mammotome test uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breast . After giving you a local anaesthetic , the surgeon makes a small cut in your breast tissue . Guided by an ultrasound or X-ray , the surgeon uses a small vacuum assisted probe to take a biopsy from the suspicious area . A Mammotome biopsy removes a slightly larger sample of breast tissue than a needle biopsy . It can sometimes cause quite a lot of bruising . <p> A wire guided biopsy is also called a wire localisation . Doctors usually use this technique if you have calcium specks showing up on your mammogram , but no clear lump . In these cases , the surgeon ca n't really see or feel which area needs to be removed . So during a mammogram or ultrasound , the doctor puts a fine wire into the area containing the calcium specks . The doctor makes sure the tip of the wire is right in the centre of the abnormal area and then secures the wire firmly . <p> The wire stays in until you have your surgical biopsy , which is usually the same day . Your surgeon knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a biopsy of the tissue . <p> Excision biopsy is also called a surgical biopsy . In this biopsy , you have a minor operation to remove the whole lump under general anaesthetic . Most hospitals do this type of biopsy as a day case . In others , you may need to stay in hospital overnight . <p> A punch biopsy is when the doctor removes a small circle of skin tissue to biopsy . You might have this type of biopsy if your doctor thinks you could have inflammatory breast cancer or Paget 's disease of the nipple . <p> You may hear this called fine needle aspiration cytology or FNAC . You have this quick test in the outpatient clinic . The doctor uses a fine needle and syringe to take a sample of cells from the breast lump . They may also use this test to drain fluid from a benign cyst . <h> Getting your test results <p> Waiting for test results is always an anxious time . Some breast clinics now offer a same day service for the basic result -- whether there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , 48 hours , or longer . <p> Specialised tests to find out the type of cancer can take quite a few days to carry out . So you may have to wait longer for these results . Each clinic has a standard for waiting times . You can ask the breast specialist or breast care nurse when you should expect your results . <p> While you are waiting for results it may help to talk to a close friend or relative about how you feel . Or you may want to contact a cancer support group to talk to someone who has been through a similar experience . <p> If you want to find people to share experiences with online , you could use CancerChat , our online forum .

##433450 <p> The key here is good balance . In a good backswing the weight remains under the middle of the feet and the player is balanced and ready to rip it . If the weight is forward then the arms are in a weak position and must jump back in front of the body to get back to the ball . <p> The ideal top of the backswing shows another big difference to conventional theory - the club should NOT point at the target . This is a familiar , comforting checkpoint but actually it bears no relation to hitting the ball well . In fact , if the club is on plane it will point left of the target , still parallel to the original plane . This is the simplest and most powerful way to swing . If the club is on plane it is in front of the turn in the backswing and the downswing can just unfold simply and powerfully . From here you can rip into the ball with your whole right side and ' freewheel ' through the shot . <p> KEYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft should still be parallel to the original plane line ( this is more apparent with an iron where the backswing is often shorter . With a wood the shaft will likely reach parallel making the club ' appear ' to point more down the target line ) . <p> * Spine angle maintained -- It may be getting boring but that balance is crucial throughout the swing so you want to ensure that your spine angle has not changed from address and that your weight is still under the middle of your feet . Good balance at the top of the swing allows you to fire into the ball powerfully in the downswing and your body wo n't have to back out of the shot . <p> * Hands left of head -- From face on your hands should be left of your head and not above it . This is a consequence of the right arm staying ' long ' and creating width earlier in the backswing . It is also evidence of the arms being in front of the turn . You want to feel here like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible -- but remember this is only a checkpoint not a position to create ! <p> * Shallow arm swing -- From down the line the left arm should lie ' deep ' across the chest ie. Be at a shallow angle . This helps create a powerful downswing , one where you are not chopping into the ball . <p> * Right hip inside right foot from face on -- if you make a stable turn then your weight at the top should be on the inside of your right foot , NOT the outside . Keeping this discipline in your right hip position is a good way to ensure backswing stability . <p> * Keep your right leg flexed at the top - This again ensures that your posture and body angles are maintained and that you have made a strong turn off the ball . <p> COMMON FAULTS <p> * Weight forward onto toes -- This classic fault stems from the set-up and first move but shows up here as an ungainly looking top of the backswing position . From here you will be starved of room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and back out of the shot . It just makes the downswing so much more complicated and you 'll have to make lots of compensations to square the club . <p> * Shaft across the line -- When the shaft is across the line it leaves the club head with a long way to travel to get back to the ball and it makes the downswing unnecessarily complicated . In the slicer it leads to the arms being ' lifted ' weakly back in front of the body in the downswing , creating the overtly steep attack . For those prone to the odd hook it causes an excessive late hit action which creates a violent wrist action to square the club . A ' laid off ' position presents far fewer problems in the downswing but again , work on the set-up and takeaway to address an across the line position at the top . <p> * Arm swing too steep -- This is again very common and is almost always caused by a tilting action of the shoulders in the backswing . A steep arm swing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slicer , or for the better player , an overly shallow downswing where the arms ' drop ' in behind the body during the change in direction . Either way this fault again makes for a complicated route to impact vs the more preferable shallow arm swing ( as utilised most famously by Ben Hogan ) . <p> * Reverse pivot -- This fault is where too much weight is on the left foot at the top , or at least where the upper body leans left at the top . The problem with this fault is it makes it almost impossible to shift your hips to the left when starting the downswing ( the natural and desirable way to change direction ) . Instead , the body is forced to stop and back out of the shot to create room for the arms to swing . This robs the swing of power and also causes excessive wrist action through the hitting area . Again look to sequence the takeaway properly to eradicate this fault . <p> * Weight on outside of right foot -- This is less common but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body has too far to travel to get back to the ball and balance is usually compromised . This all makes the timing of the downswing inconsistent and leaves the player relying too much on good hand action to make an effective strike . This seemingly big weight shift does not in fact provide additional power and the player would be much better off looking for stability in the backswing so he can hit harder in the downswing . <p> * Body angles straighter -- The spine often straightens in the backswing , particularly in slicers . This results in a serious loss of power coming down as the legs are unable to work properly in this extended state . The player is left with mere arm power to hit the ball . This player would benefit from feeling that they maintain the 
##436751 <h> Physical Urticarias <p> This leaflet gives a brief account of urticaria in general , then deals with physical urticaria in more detail . Urticaria is an itchy rash . Physical urticaria is when the rash is triggered by a physical stimulus such as pressure , cold , sweating , sunlight , water , etc . Treatments include avoiding the trigger ( where possible ) , and antihistamines . <h> What is urticaria ? <p> Urticaria ( sometimes called hives ) is an itchy rash caused by tiny amounts of fluid that leak from blood vessels just under the skin surface . Urticaria is classed as : <p> Acute urticaria - if it develops suddenly and lasts less than six weeks . Most cases last less than 48 hours . It can affect anyone at any age . Some people have recurring episodes of acute urticaria . Physical urticaria ( described below ) is one cause of recurring episodes of acute urticaria . <p> Chronic urticaria - if the rash persists longer than six weeks . ( Chronic means persistent or ongoing . ) This is uncommon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does the rash of acute urticaria look like ? <p> The rash usually appears suddenly and can affect any area of skin . Small raised areas called weals develop on the skin . The weals look like mild blisters and they are itchy . Each weal is white or red and is usually surrounded by a small red area of skin which is called a flare . The weal and flare rash of urticaria looks similar to the rash caused by a nettle sting . <p> The weals are commonly 1-2 cm across but can vary in size . For example , in cholinergic urticaria ( described below ) they are much smaller . There may be just a few weals but sometimes many develop on the skin . Sometimes weals that are next to each other join together to form larger ones . The weals can be any shape but are often circular . As a weal fades , the surrounding flare remains for a while . This makes the affected area of skin look blotchy and red . The blotches then fade gradually and the skin returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What causes acute urticaria ? <p> A trigger causes cells in the skin to release chemicals such as histamine . The chemicals cause fluid to leak from tiny blood vessels under the skin surface . The fluid pools to form weals . The chemicals also cause the blood vessels to open wide ( dilate ) which causes the flare around the weals . The trigger is not identified in about half of cases . Some known triggers include : <p> Physical urticaria . This is when a rash appears when the the skin is physically stimulated . <p> Allergies - for example : <p> Food allergies such as allergies to nuts , strawberries , citrus fruit , egg , food additives , spices , chocolate , or shellfish . Sometimes you can develop an allergy to a food even if you have eaten it without any problem many times before . <p> Allergies to insect bites and stings . <p> Allergies to medicines such as penicillin , aspirin , anti-inflammatory painkillers , etc . <p> A viral infection such as a cold or flu can trigger an urticarial rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) A mild viral infection which causes few other symptoms is probably a common trigger of an urticarial rash that develops without an apparent cause . <p> Skin contact with sensitisers causes a local area of contact urticaria in some people . For example , chemicals , latex , cosmetics , plants , ointments , nettle stings , etc . <p> The rest of this leaflet deals only with physical urticaria . There are separate leaflets called ' Acute Urticaria ' ( for a general overview about all types of acute urticaria ) , and ' Chronic Urticaria ' . <h> Different types of physical urticaria <p> There are different types of physical urticaria . The reason why a rash appears in affected people is not clear . The physical stimulus somehow causes a release of histamine and other chemicals , which causes the rash . <p> The main types of physical urticaria include the following : <h> Dermographism <p> Dermographism means skin writing . People with this condition develop the rash on areas of skin that have been firmly stroked . ( Because of this , you could ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a finger or other object . The rash follows the line of the writing on the skin . ) The affected area of skin is usually very itchy but in some mild cases it does not itch much . Although any part of the skin can be affected , the palms , soles of the feet , genital skin and scalp are less commonly affected . Dermographism is more prone to occur when you are hot . For example , it may develop more easily when you rub yourself firmly with a towel after a hot shower . The rash tends to last less than an hour . In many cases the pressure needed to be applied to cause the rash is quite firm . However , some people develop dermographism with just light pressure . <p> Up to 1 in 20 people will develop dermographism at some stage of life . It most commonly first develops in early adult life . In most cases , the condition tends to improve gradually over a few years and it goes or becomes less severe . However , in some cases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cholinergic urticaria is quite common . It is caused by sweating and is sometimes called heat bumps . The urticarial rash is quite distinct as the weals are very small ( 2-3 mm ) with a red flare around each one . The rash appears within a few minutes of sweating and tends to be worst on the chest , back and arms . The rash lasts from 30 minutes to an hour or more before fading away . Some people become slightly wheezy and short of breath for the duration of the rash . <p> The sweating that triggers the rash may be due to exercise , heat , fever , emotion or eating spicy food . It can be a real nuisance when trying to exercise . In severe cases , hundreds of tiny weals develop when you run or do other types of exercise . Sometimes the tiny weals join together to form larger ones . Cholinergic urticaria most commonly first develops in early adult life . In many cases the condition tends to improve after a few years and it goes or becomes less severe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . <h> Cold urticaria <p> Cold urticaria is a relatively uncommon condition . An urticarial rash develops after being exposed to cold , including rain , cold winds and cold water . It may be the cold that triggers the rash , or the re-warming of the skin after coming in from the cold . The rash affects the chilled parts of the skin . If a large area of skin has been chilled , the rash can be very extensive . For example , swimming in cold water may cause a widespread and severe rash over most of the body that can make you dizzy and faint . ( For this reason , if you are known to develop cold urticaria , you should never go swimming alone . ) <h> Delayed pressure urticaria <p> Delayed pressure urticaria is uncommon . It can develop alone but it commonly affects people who also have chronic urticaria ( see separate leaflet called ' Chronic Urticaria ' ) . In this type of urticaria the rash develops 4-6 hours after the affected area of skin has had deep prolonged pressure applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wearing a tight watch strap , or after gripping a tool such as a screwdriver for a reasonable period of time . The rash can be painful and tends to last several hours , or even a day or so . <h> Solar urticaria <p> This is rare . In this condition an urticarial rash develops on skin exposed to sunlight . <h> Aquagenic ( water contact ) urticaria <p> In this rare condition an urticarial rash develops on skin exposed to water of any temperature . <h> What is the treatment for physical urticarias ? <p> Once you know what causes the rash , it may be possible to avoid situations that trigger it . For example , dermographism can often be prevented by avoiding firm pressure against the skin as much as possible . In mild cases , no additional treatment may be needed . <h> Antihistamines <p> Many physical urticarias are helped by taking antihistamine medicines . ( However , these medicines may not help some cases of delayed pressure urticaria . ) Antihistamines block the action of histamine which is involved in causing urticaria . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from pharmacies . There are several brands . <p> Modern brands usually work well and are unlikely to cause side-effects . They sometimes cause drowsiness - particularly if you drink alcohol . <p> Older brands will often make you drowsy - but this effect may be welcome at bedtime if itch is troublesome . <p> Some people take antihistamines now and then when a rash flares up . If you take an antihistamine as soon as the rash appears , the rash tends to fade quicker than it would do normally . If the rash recurs frequently , then your doctor may advise a regular dose of an antihistamine to prevent the rash from occurring . If you have cholinergic urticaria and know that you get a rash on exercise , a dose of an antihistamine just before you do exercise may help to prevent or limit a flare up of the rash . <h> Steroid tablets <p> Unlike most other types of urticaria , physical urticaria is not usually helped by steroids . <h> Phototherapy <p> Treatment with ultraviolet light can cause a rapid improvement in symptoms but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What is the outlook ( prognosis ) ? <p> Physical urticarias most commonly occur in healthy young adults . You can have two or more different types of urticaria at the same time .

##443052 <h> FOOTBALL <h> ROBERTO MANCINI CHASING LUIS SUAREZ <h> By Paul Joyce <p> THE seed has been sown and , if nothing else , Roberto Mancini ? s interest in Luis Suarez demonstrates his ambitions for Manchester City are still smouldering . <p> The whispers that surround Mancini ? s long-term future at the Etihad Stadium may persist , but the Italian is clearly not prepared to compromise his planning in the short term . <p> It is no great surprise that the City manager would covet Suarez , presently the best player in the Premier League and an early candidate for Player of the Year if those voting can see past his reputation and focus purely on the stellar performances that quicken the pulse . <p> City ? s own complement of strikers has not proved as effective in practice as it should be when their lofty reputations are written down . <p> Mario Balotelli , without a league goal this season , primarily remains a headache and an even bigger one than Suarez , who carries considerable baggage himself . Mancini clearly does not trust Edin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace with Carlos Tevez will last . <p> The fight to keep Suarez , his long-term contract aside , is only just beginning <p> While Sergio Aguero has scored four goals , it is City ? s attack which has spluttered as much as their defence . <p> Yet the obstacles blocking what would be a sensational transfer deal are as sizeable as the fee that would be required to prise Uruguay striker Suarez from Liverpool . <p> First , there is the fact that Mancini ? s own position at City has been weakened by the club ? s impendingexit from the Champions League which could be confirmed if they fail to overcome Real Madrid next Wednesday . <p> City ? s new hierarchy , comprising of director of football Txiki Begiristain , and chief executive Ferran Soriano , could be seen as a positive for Mancini having replaced his nemesis Brian Marwood . But , equally , they have no loyalty towards Mancini , having arrived at the club via Barcelona , and will be mindful of just how Pep Guardiola ? s sabbatical is progressing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Financial Fair Play , before lavishing mind-boggling fees elsewhere . <p> SEARCH FOOTBALL for : <p> Complicating matters still further is Suarez ? s current happiness on Merseyside ? he signed a new contract in the summer ? as highlighted by manager Brendan Rodgers last Sunday . <p> ? At this moment I ? m safe in the knowledge that Luis had the chance to go in the summer , ? said Rodgers . ? There was probably no better time for him to do that with a new manager coming in . He could have had an excuse to go , but having spoken to him at length he committed to staying here . He gave us the opportunity to see how it was going to work . It ? s up to us as a club to add players who can help support him and move us on. ? <p> Suarez ? s form ? he has 11 goals ? and unstinting work-rate does not suggest someone disillusioned with the position in the same way that Fernando Torres was at this stage two-years ago . <p> What decreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the player was that the Spain striker wanted to leave in 2011 and the eventual 50 million fee , which matched his escape clause , was too good to turn down . <p> Liverpool ? s owners , Fenway Sports Group , would risk a riot if they contemplated cashing in on a player , whose 18.5m move from Ajax on the day Torres went through the exit door is the one piece of transfer activity during their time at the helm no one can question . <p> Yet the interesting part of Rodgers ? response to Suarez ? s future was that he prefaced his answer with the phrase ? at this moment ? . <p> Rodgers is tuned into the reality of the situation . He knows that Suarez ? s own talent transcends his squad at present , as highlighted by the fact that if his goals and assists were scrubbed off Liverpool would have just two Premier League points . <p> The manager is also acutely aware that January represents a month in which Liverpool can reaffirm their own ambition and prove to Suarez that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If they pass up the opportunity , then every twisting turn and sprinkling of stardust from their talisman will only increase the number of interested parties ready to circle and take their chance on signing the striker . <p> Whether that be City , Juventus , Paris Saint-Germain , Barcelona or Real , the battle lines are being drawn between Europe ? s big-hitters . <p> The fight to keep Suarez

##453851 <h> Civic Duty <h> By Denise Rajauski Part 3 <p> Joe gasped as he was spun around , and found himself face-to-face with an extremely large , extremely irate-looking security guard . He barely managed to keep Kate from falling . She clung to his leg , staring up at the angry stranger in mute terror . <p> " Goin ' somewhere , Lightfingers ? " the guard snarled in a murderous tone . <p> Joe floundered for a moment . " Er , ah -- look I um -- I can explain quite easily , I ... " <p> The guard grabbed his arm and began propelling him back to the store . A crowd was gathering . Joe dug in his heels . <p> " Wait ! " he shouted frantically , " This is n't what you think ... " <p> The guard cut his protest short . " I do n't think nothin ' , " he growled . " Tell it to the cops . " He shook his boulder-like head in disgust . " And in front of your kids , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As he was once again yanked towards the store with a now sobbing Kate in tow and an equally squalling Paulina on his chest , Joe twisted his head around to signal Jameson and Ms. Crowe that he was in a bit of a jam . He thought they must not have seen the commotion , or surely they would have intervened by now . <p> His mouth dropped open . They were n't there by his car anymore . He scanned the snickering crowd desperately . No sign . He began to feel decidedly nauseous as the sick realization dawned on him . Either the pair were waiting for him in the security office to get him off the hook , pat him on the back , and congratulate him on his sense of civic responsibility , or he was about to get caught with several hundred dollars worth of stolen jewelry in his child 's diaper bag . <p> The scene at the store 's security office was long and for Joe , extremely depressing . He sat , white faced , on a cold metal folding chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her alert brown eyes quietly taking in the scene over the bobbing pacifier . On the opposite knee sat Kate , who was calm now but hiccuping somewhat . The diaper bag had been overturned onto a table-yielding up its sparkling loot amongst the diapers , bottles and wet wipes . <p> The salesgirl , Rhonda , had been escorted in to identify him , and had done so with a short nod and a disgusted " Yeah , that 's him . " <p> A search of his pockets had produced the list of stores and merchandise , much to the amusement of the assembled store personnel and police . <p> " You know what we call people like you ? " one of the cops had asked . " Job Security . " <p> They 'd all dissolved into laughter as Joe reddened . The explanation he 'd given had brought on a level of hilarity in the room that he had n't thought humans were capable of . And worst of all in Joe 's mind , they 'd called his wife . <p> He 'd had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and get the children before carting him off to jail . Although he 'd almost rather have preferred thumbing through a telephone directory and picking a name at random , he 'd given them Frankie 's pager number . <p> Twenty minutes later , Kate 's eager shout of " Mom ! " brought Joe 's head up from its resting place on his chest . She scrambled down from his lap and leapt into the arms of the slim , regally tall woman who had just stepped into the room . <p> Frankie Thompson wrapped her arms tightly around her daughter and smiled . Joe had half a grin on his own face until she turned her gaze to him . His whole face withered as he realized that the reassuring smile had been purely for Kate 's benefit . He opened his mouth to explain , to say something , but she held up a slender hand and turned to the policemen . <p> The sergeant snorted . " Accused ? Caught with , you mean . " He pointed at the bracelets laid out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaper bag . <p> Frankie walked over with Kate wrapped tightly around her and stared down , open-mouthed , at the jewelry twinkling under the overhead light . She turned to the sergeant , shaking her head . " There must be some mistake , " she said , disbelief coloring her words . " We have plenty of money-my husband does n't need to steal . " <p> The other policeman , the one who 'd passed the remark about job security shook his head vehemently . " No , ma'am . Those bracelets were discovered in that bag , " he said , gesturing at the diaper bag . " And what 's more , we got him on camera taking ' em . " <p> Frankie stared over the table at Joe in shocked silence . Finally , she shook her head as if to clear it and spoke to him directly for the first time since entering the room . " I ... am sure ... there must be a logical explanation for this , Joe . " <p> Joe nodded , looking acutely embarrassed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered . <p> Frankie lowered her brows , pursed her lips , and opened her mouth to snap . Suddenly she closed her eyes for a moment . Every person in the room could practically see the numbers one to ten moving through her mind . Then she turned to the sergeant . " Is there any way I could be alone with my husband for a few minutes ? " she asked . <p> The cop shook his head . " I 'm afraid not ma'am . " he replied . <p> Frankie swept her hand around the room , taking in the security guards , store manager and several off-duty salesclerks . " Then is it necessary to your investigation for all of these people to be in here ? " she asked shortly as she put Kate down and grasped her hand . <p> The sergeant looked meaningfully at the store manager , who clapped his hands . <p> He shouted " Okay people ! Everybody who 's not involved , back to work . All others , wait for my summons . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare pointedly at Joe . " I 'll be right next door in my office . " he said as he jabbed a finger squarely at him . " I AM pressing charges . You foreigners got to learn to respect our laws sometime . " <p> Frankie sighed as the door slammed shut . She pulled up a second folding chair and sat next to Joe . Paulina squirmed as she recognized her mother , and Joe handed the baby to her . Frankie patted the infant 's back softly as she stared at her husband , her expression unfathomable . Suddenly her eyes narrowed and moved up to stare at the Santa hat still perched on his head . Without taking his eyes from her face , Joe slowly reached up and removed it . He began wadding it up over and over as he spoke . <p> " Frankie , I know this looks bad , but ... " <p> " Did you steal those bracelets ? " she asked quietly . <p> Joe took a deep breath . " Yes . " <p> Frankie 's brows shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands in a helpless gesture . " I was only trying to help ... " <p> " Help ? ! " <p> Frankie 's raised voice made the two policemen , who had decorously turned their backs , jump and peer over their shoulders . She lowered her tone . " ' Help ' . How did I know that word would come into play at some point tonight ? I would have thought you 'd run screaming in the opposite direction upon hearing it uttered by now . " <p> " Kate can verify everything I 've said , but they wo n't listen to her , " Joe began , but skidded to a halt at Frankie 's angry gesture . <p> " Kate should not have been in a position to verify anything in the first place . Do you never think , Joe ? " she ground out . <p> " But Mom , Daddy was teaching me a lesson . " Kate piped up helpfully . <p> Frankie heard the two cops snort derisively at this , but she forced herself to smile at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She returned her gaze to Joe . " And now Daddy is going to tell me all about it . " <p> The next few minutes saw an interesting display of incredulous facial expressions on Frankie 's part as Joe described how he came to be in his current predicament . Once or twice she looked at him as if she expected a cuckoo to pop out of his forehead on a small spring , but she made no comment until he 'd finished . <p> " And that 's how ... it ... I just wanted to buy you something nice for ... " He trailed off , risking an apologetic grin . For a long moment , not a muscle on Frankie 's body moved except for the hand patting Paulina 's back as she digested the story . <p> Finally , she spoke . " Let me see if I understand ... you were approached by two complete strangers claiming to be mall security , and you took them at their word . " <p> " Jameson had a badge , " Joe interjected defensively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Well , yes . But he also had an I.D . card , " he countered . <p> " Which had ' Identification Card ' on it ? " <p> " Erm . Ah . " <p> Frankie continued . " You then let yourself be talked into consulting a list for committing acts of petty larceny on their behalf . " <p> " I thought the things would be returned . " <p> Frankie nodded thoughtfully . " It never occurred to you to ask for some sort of card or letter to carry with you in case you were caught with these stolen goods ? " <p> Frankie smiled humorlessly at that statement , then ruthlessly pointed out the most obvious aspect of the whole scenario . " And lastly , it never crossed your mind even once to question why a Head of Security would use an individual right off the street to accomplish this task instead of employing someone trained in loss prevention ? " <p> Joe could only shake his head , slack-jawed . Now that he knew it had all been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortified in the extreme that he 'd been taken in . But at the time , it had seemed so much like a good thing to do . He looked down at the crumpled Santa hat clenched in his fists . God , he 'd done it again . He looked up into his wife 's dark , penetrating eyes and sighed heavily . <p> " I 'm sorry , Frankie . I 've really ballsed it up this time , have n't I ? " he asked resignedly . <p> Frankie 's eyes softened , and she reached for his hand . She was about to reply when the sergeant cleared his throat . Joe swiveled his head around to see both policemen approaching him purposefully . <p> " Christ , " he whispered . " I hope my cellmate does n't snore . " <p> Joe had just been told to stand up and place his hands behind his back when the cavalry in the form of the thunderstruck store manager rode in to save his hide . Just as one cop was about to slap a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office opened and the manager stuck his head in . He beckoned the sergeant over , and the two of them held a brief whispered conversation punctuated by a few muffled snickers . The door slammed shut once again , and the sergeant held up a hand . <p> " Hold it Charlie . " he said to the other cop . Joe spun around to face the pair as both Frankie and Kate appeared at his side . The sergeant shook his head and chuckled in amazement . " I never would 've believed it in a million years , but the manager says they just nabbed a man and a woman out in the parking lot . They were going up to people and claiming to be in charge of security . " <p> Joe let out a deep breath , unaware until that moment that he 'd been holding it . His face lit up . <p> " Then I can go ? " he inquired hopefully . <p> The sergeant grunted . " Yeah , well , as of right now the manager says he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing , but he also says he does n't want to see your face in his store anymore . As for us , you 'll be called to come down to the station and make a statement . Probably have to testify eventually . " <p> Joe urged again , " But I 'm free to go ? " <p> The sergeant nodded . " Yeah , you can go . Lucky for you we do n't prosecute for stupidity in this country . " <p> Joe opened his mouth to lob a retort , but Frankie grabbed his arm . " Never mind Joe , " she said . " let 's just go . " He saw the wisdom in her words and gathered up the baby 's things , stuffing them back into the diaper bag . <p> Later that night , after the girls had been fed and put to bed , Joe and Frankie sank gratefully onto the sofa . All of the lights had been turned off except for the multicolored strings illuminating the massive Christmas tree in the corner . Joe stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair with gentle fingers . He allowed himself to be lulled by it for awhile , then a morose thought tugged at him and he sat up . <p> " Why do you put up with me , Frankie ? Always interfering , always being so bloody naive ? " he asked quietly . <p> In response , she moved closer to him and kissed his lips gently before responding . <p> " Because everything you do is motivated by love . You wanted to help Paul and Linda out of love , and the desire to give them what we have . You wanted to help tonight out of love for Kate and the desire to teach her right from wrong . Love centers your entire world Joe , and it centers me as well . " She laid her head on his shoulder . " I never thought I 'd say this , but I hope you never change . " <p> Joe pretended to be aghast . " God , I hope not . I have to acquire some sense sometime . " <p> Frankie laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your will to help . It makes you the person you are , and I love that person . " <p> Joe grinned . " I hope you remember this conversation the next time I do something daft . " <p> They cuddled in companionable silence for awhile , then Joe disengaged himself gently and walked over to where the shopping bag lay on the floor . He fished out a small gold box and returned to sit on the sofa , where he held it out to Frankie . <p> " What 's this ? " she asked , puzzled . <p> " The cause of all the trouble . Your Christmas present , " he said . " Go on , open it . " <p> " But it 's not Christmas , yet , " she protested . <p> " I know , I know . But I want you to have it now . I want you to know tonight did have a purpose . God knows I went through enough to get it home , " he said with an amused twinkle . <p> Frankie smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no move to open it , and after thirty seconds Joe asked " Is something wrong ? " <p> Frankie peered up at him intently . " Perhaps you 'd best put your shoes back on before I open the box , Joe . " she said . " Because if this is a gold bracelet , I 'm

##461450 <h> Download 2010 : COHEED AND CAMBRIA <p> Coheed and Cambria ' s slot at Download Festival this year feels like the end of an era . Not only did it complete a cycle of regeneration for a band almost torn apart by personal issues just a few years ago . With new album Year Of The Black Rainbow , the fictional story that underpins the lyrics of the band , that of Coheed and Cambria and their children , has finally been completed , leaving many fans wondering where the band goes from here . <p> Claudio Sanchez talked to Ruth about finally playing with a solid line-up again , bringing Peter David into the mythology of Coheed and Cambria , and the possible future of the band . <p> You 've always struck me as a great storyteller , so what makes a great story for you ? <p> " Ooh , I do n't know . Well , me being in science fiction , something that would certainly translate and relate to reality I guess . Something where you can kind of see the parallels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . Something that kind of echoes a universal theme and quality : A question that anyone can really ask themselves and hope to answer with personal gain and growth . " <p> So you 're into the idea that fiction can teach ? <p> " Maybe , yeah . Yeah , certainly . Like something that kind of echoes a feeling that the reader might have , a question they might pose for themselves , and might help them answer that . " <p> You 've always been a band with a great deal of emphasis on the experience and ambience live . How do you approach playing a festival , where you 're a lot more restricted in that sense ? <p> " Um , we just try to do what we do , and try to treat it as any other show . We try to keep it as comfortable as possible , because again it is n't our show , it 's a celebration of the music and everyone . So you just try to be as comfortable as possible and do what you do and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's really what this is for . " <p> Does it feel different now that you 're playing live an album that Chris Pennie has contributed to ? While Chris had been in the band prior to the making of 2007 album No World For Tomorrow , contracts had prevented him from playing on it - Ed . <p> " Is it different ? Yeah , it feels really good actually , and different because you know when the band was falling apart , it did n't feel so good to be a part of being in it , and now with the history behind us , and Chris into the fold , and Mic better , " Mic Todd had left the band to battle drug addiction - Ed . " I mean it just feels refreshing and exciting . It 's new , in a way , and to be able to have Chris on the album , and now touring as a full fledged member of the band , it feels great , without a doubt . " <p> What was it about Year Of The Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel rather than a comic this time round ? <p> " Well , one of the things I 've wanted to do is adapt the pre-existing comics into standard prose novels : and this being the first story , essentially , the origins of the characters Coheed and Cambria , I thought it 'd be nice to just start in that medium , and that way , in terms of novels , it 'll come , the story will come out and unfold in chronological form . As opposed to the comics , which are kind of mismatched and out of sequence . " <p> Do you ever regret doing the comics ? <p> " Oh no . Not at all , I do n't regret doing the comics at all . I 'm actually doing the story of In Keepign Secrets ... right now - the first issue came out last month , and the second issue comes out later this month - so no , not at all . I love comics . I mean , I love literature in general and any form of it , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but comics , that was my first introduction to reading as a kid , so I just enjoy it . " <p> So as someone who works in both comics and novels , did that influence your decision to work with Peter David on this novel ? <p> " Yeah , yeah . You know , I met Peter through our agency group , and I 've always known Peter 's work with Incredible Hulk , and some of his creator-owned titles like Fallen Angel . I thought why not ? My wife actually read a prose novel he wrote on called Tigerheart , which she really enjoyed and so I thought let 's give this a shot in this medium and if it works , maybe we 'll partner up and do future stories together , and we have . We 've started to collaborate on the In Keeping Secrets ... story . So Peter , after working on Year Of The Black Rainbow , I 've found a partner in , because he 's a tremendous talent , and he really helps bring a lot to the mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to broaden it . So yeah , I really enjoyed working with him on Year Of The Black Rainbow , so much that I brought him along for a few other stories . " <p> I was curious about whether he was going to be working on the technical aspect , or whether you would be bringing him deeper into the mythology . <p> " Mmhmm . He 's just there to really kind of strengthen it , you know . With Second Stage Turbine Blade , and those stories , those were my first kind of attempts at really kind of falling into the medium . Sometimes I 'm that kind of guy that likes to just throw a tonne of stuff at the wall , and see what sticks , whereas Peter 's certainly helping me kind of filter through that , and really strengthen the stories , you know ? So I 've certainly learned a lot from working with him and that 's why I want to continue to work with him . " <p> Now that the story of Coheed and Cambria has been completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens with the band now . <p> " Well , you know , it 's funny , ' cause we 've been getting that the band 's going to break up , or we 're gon na you know do albums without concepts . I mean , we 'll see . It 's tough to say at the moment . I 've been working out some ideas for the future , maybe ... " he pauses " but we 'll continue , figure it out . " <p> I was just wondering whether we 'd have to wait until that final counter on your official website ticked down . <p> When I heard Joe Barresi and Atticus Ross would be producing Year Of The Black Rainbow , I imagined it would be one person doing one half of the record , the other doing the other half . Then I saw the videos and saw they were sharing the duty . How did that work with their different production styles ? <p> " They played off of each other 's strengths and weaknesses , basically . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . Atticus was certainly more of the synth based fellow , and Joe was a tone kind of a guy , getting the right sounds for the right kind of performances . So again , they really played off of each other , and it felt seamless , it did n't feel clumsy at all . It was probably the best experience I 've had working with a producer . " <p> I noticed some co-writing credits with Atticus Ross . Was he quite hands on ? Was that how that came about ? <p> " Well , I brought the tune to Atticus and we actually worked on it in his house , in his home studio . And he brought so much of a different atmosphere to the tune that it kind of changed the tune . Originally ' Pearl ... ' " ... Of The Stars " was actually a Prize Fighter " The Prize Fighter Inferno , Claudio 's acoustic/electronica side-project - Ed. song , and so it was very acoustic heavy , and a lot of just different sounds , but again , when Atticus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song up , it just felt like a different song . He certainly had a hand in 
##470851 <p> I obviously have a longer memory than Hannan , and it seems to be memory-lane day today . The cheerful chappy is glibly talking of a Tory deal with UKIP , building on the piece yesterday , when Farage indicated that he was in the market . <p> The thing about deals though , is that they require trust -- and the thing about the Tories is that a minor party would be foolish to trust them . Furthermore , there are some in high(ish) places that you certainly ca n't trust . Hannan is one of them . <p> Here we go back to the year 2000 and the newly opened European Parliament in Strasbourg . UKIP had three newly-elected MEPs , Nigel Farage being one of them , and we were very keen ( as you might imagine ) for publicity . Enter young Daniel who presented himself as a eurosceptic and a potential ally , and a very useful one at that as he then had his own column in the Failygraph . <p> Through dint of much digging and good sources , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story -- for the life of me , I can not remember what it was about -- but we fed it to young Hannan , with some quotes from the newly-elected Farage , in the hope of getting some much needed publicity to show the folks at home we were earning our bread .. <p> Sure enough , the story was printed but , when we saw the copy we found that Farage 's name had been excised and the name of a Tory MEP had been substituted as the source of the quotes we had supplied . <p> At the time , we happened to be in the Strasbourg parliament , and I remember a very tense meeting on one of the bridges which span the interior ( pictured above left and below right ) , from the office block to the hemicycle -- almost in the style of Robin Hood meeting Little John . Angry words passed , and it was a long time before cordial relations were resumed . <p> It was then that I learned Hannan was a thief , and not to be trusted . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a revised version here ) , stealing my material without any attribution , he was acting entirely in character . Once a thief , always a thief . <p> And now the same Hannan is so supportive of a deal with UKIP , it seems Farage has forgotten about the nature of the beast he is dealing with . That perhaps illustrates how politicians as a breed tend to converge , finding more in common with their fellow travellers than they do their own electors . <p> But the fact is that UKIP , as a " junior partner " has nothing to gain from a deal with the Tories . Should they try for it , they risk being shafted by experts like Hannan , with absolutely no come-back . <p> Farage , once agan , is demonstrating the his lack of tactical acumen , throwing away his party 's one strong hand - the ability to deprive the Conservative Party of a victory at the polls , until its leaders change their policy on the EU . And this he seems prepared to do for no demonstrable gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlikely to be any deals . But even without them , UKIP has been weakened by a man who does n't have the sense to realise 
##483950 <h> Alternative Formats <h> The Other Side <p> Berlin producer Robot Koch is back for his third full length release , ' The Other Side ' . Although Robot Koch has an international reputation as being one of Europe 's finest producers of the beat generation , he is much more than just a beatmaker ... you could call his sound post-dubstep infused electronic hip hop , yet that still is far too constrained a label to understand what this producer is all about . Instead of simply following the style of his previous albums ' Death Star Droid ' and ' Songs For Trees And Cyborgs ' , Koch takes the genre defying ingredients from these records to another level . There still are some of those galactic ten-ton beats and space age melodies that made the previous albums staple drops in the playlists of Mary Anne Hobbes , Starkey , Daedelus and Gas Lamp Killer to name a few , but there is a new dimension to Kochs production and songwriting that are hitherto unrevealed . The cinematic vibe of tracks like ' Nitesky ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electricity of ' Tapedeck ' show how Koch more than ever manages to create intimate and timeless pieces of music that are soulful , deep , and mysterious , with appeal to fans of cutting edge electronica and modern pop music alike . <p> ' The Other Side ' is Robot Koch 's most personal record to date , and instead of going for big name features he teamed up with lesser know artists like Kansas-based vocal talent John LaMonica , long time friend and theatre composer Nielson and Mexican singer / songwriter Graciela Maria to find the right voices for his compositions . John LaMonica infuses his whimsical and heartfelt melodies that breathe an air of darkness and nostalgia with Koch 's fresh and forward thinking instrumentals to create something that fans of Radiohead , The XX and Jamie Lidell should not sleep on . John Peel already knew the right time in 2003 when he was an early admirer of Robot Koch 's productions , calling 
##494451 <h> Royal Profiles <p> Henry VIII was born at Greenwich on 28 June 1491 , the second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York . He became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother , Prince Arthur , in 1502 and succeeded in 1509 . <p> In his youth he was athletic and highly intelligent . A contemporary observer described him thus : ' he speaks good French , Latin and Spanish ; is very religious ; heard three masses daily when he hunted ... He is extremely fond of hunting , and never takes that diversion without tiring eight or ten horses ... He is also fond of tennis . ' <p> Henry 's scholarly interests included writing both books and music , and he was a lavish patron of the arts . <p> He was an accomplished player of many instruments and a composer . Greensleeves , the popular melody frequently attributed to him is , however , almost certainly not one of his compositions . <p> As the author of a best-selling book ( it went through some 20 editions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman Catholic church , in 1521 Henry was given the title ' Defender of the Faith ' by the Pope . <p> From his father , Henry VIII inherited a stable realm with the monarch 's finances in healthy surplus - on his accession , Parliament had not been summoned for supplies for five years . Henry 's varied interests and lack of application to government business and administration increased the influence of Thomas Wolsey , an Ipswich butcher 's son , who became Lord Chancellor in 1515 . <p> Wolsey became one of the most powerful ministers in British history ( symbolised by his building of Hampton Court Palace - on a greater scale than anything the king possessed ) . Wolsey exercised his powers vigorously in his own court of Chancery and in the increased use of the Council 's judicial authority in the court of the Star Chamber . <p> Wolsey was also appointed Cardinal in 1515 and given papal legate powers which enabled him to by-pass the Archbishop of Canterbury and ' govern ' the Church in England . <p> Henry 's interest in foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of alliances centred round the kings of Spain and France , and the Holy Roman Emperor . ( Henry was related by marriage to all three - his wife Catherine was Ferdinand of Aragon 's daughter , his sister Mary married Louis XII of France in 1514 , and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V was Catherine 's nephew . ) <p> An example of these shifts was Henry 's unsuccessful Anglo-Spanish campaigns against France , ending in peace with France in 1520 , when he spent huge sums on displays and tournaments at the Field of the Cloth of Gold . <p> Henry also invested in the navy , and increased its size from 5 to 53 ships ( including the Mary Rose , the remains of which lie in the Portsmouth Naval Museum ) . <p> The second half of Henry 's reign was dominated by two issues very important for the later history of England and the monarchy : the succession and the Protestant Reformation , which led to the formation of the Church of England . <p> Henry had married his brother 's widow , Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one surviving child - a girl , Princess Mary , born in 1516 . By the end of the 1520s , Henry 's wife was in her forties and he was desperate for a son . <p> The Tudor dynasty had been established by conquest in 1485 and Henry was only its second monarch . England had not so far had a ruling queen , and the dynasty was not secure enough to run the risk of handing the Crown on to a woman , risking disputed succession or domination of a foreign power through marriage . <p> Henry had anyway fallen in love with Anne Boleyn , the sister of one of his many mistresses , and tried to persuade the Pope to grant him an annulment of his marriage on the grounds that it had never been legal . <p> Royal divorces had happened before : Louis XII had been granted a divorce in 1499 , and in 1527 James IV 's widow Margaret ( Henry 's sister ) had also been granted one . However , a previous Pope had specifically granted Henry a licence to marry his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wolsey failed to gain the Pope 's agreement to resolve Henry 's case in England . All the efforts of Henry and his advisers came to nothing ; Wolsey was dismissed and arrested , but died before he could be brought to trial . <p> Since the attempts to obtain the divorce through pressure on the papacy had failed , Wolsey 's eventual successor Thomas Cromwell ( Henry 's chief adviser from 1532 onwards ) turned to Parliament , using its powers and anti-clerical attitude ( encouraged by Wolsey 's excesses ) to decide the issue . <p> The result was a series of Acts cutting back papal power and influence in England and bringing about the English Reformation . <p> In 1532 , an Act against Annates - although suspended during ' the king 's pleasure ' - was a clear warning to the Pope that ecclesiastical revenues were under threat . <p> In 1532 , Cranmer was promoted to Archbishop of Canterbury and , following the Pope 's confirmation of his appointment , in May 1533 Cranmer declared Henry 's marriage invalid ; Anne Boleyn was crowned queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Parliamentary legislation enacting Henry 's decision to break with the Roman Catholic Church soon followed . An Act in restraint of appeals forbade appeals to Rome , stating that England was an empire , governed by one supreme head and king who possessed ' whole and entire ' authority within the realm , and that no judgements or excommunications from Rome were valid . <p> An Act of Submission of the Clergy and an Act of Succession followed , together with an Act of Supremacy ( 1534 ) which recognised that the king was ' the only supreme head of the Church of England called Anglicana Ecclesia ' . <p> The breach between the king and the Pope forced clergy , office-holders and others to choose their allegiance - the most famous being Sir Thomas More , who was executed for treason in 1535 . <p> The other effect of the English Protestant Reformation was the Dissolution of Monasteries , under which monastic lands and possessions were broken up and sold off . In the 1520s , Wolsey had closed down some of the small monastic communities to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford and Ipswich ) . <p> In 1535-6 , another 200 smaller monasteries were dissolved by statute , followed by the remaining greater houses in 1538-40 ; as a result , Crown revenues doubled for a few years . <p> Henry 's second marriage had raised hopes for a male heir . Anne Boleyn , however , produced another daughter , Princess Elizabeth , and failed to produce a male child . Henry got rid of Anne on charges of treason ( presided over by Thomas Cromwell ) which were almost certainly false , and she was executed in 1536 . In 1537 her replacement , Henry 's third wife Jane Seymour , finally bore him a son , who was later to become Edward VI . Jane died in childbed , 12 days after the birth in 1537 . <p> Although Cromwell had proved an effective minister in bringing about the royal divorce and the English Reformation , his position was insecure . The Pilgrimage of Grace , an insurrection in 1536 , called for Cromwell 's dismissal ( the rebels were put down ) but it was Henry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to Cromwell 's downfall . Despite being made Earl of Essex in 1540 , three months later he was arrested and executed . <p> Henry made two more marriages , to Katherine Howard ( executed on grounds of adultery in 1542 ) and Catherine Parr ( who survived Henry to die in 1548 ) . <p> None produced any children . Henry made sure that his sole male heir , Edward , was educated by people who believed in Protestantism rather than Catholicism because he wanted the anti-papal nature of his reformation and his dynasty to become more firmly established . <p> After Cromwell 's execution , no leading minister emerged in the last seven years of Henry 's reign . Overweight , irascible and in failing health , Henry turned his attention to France once more . <p> Despite assembling an army of 40,000 men , only the town of Boulogne was captured and the French campaign failed . Although more than half the monastic properties had been sold off , forced loans and currency depreciation also had to be used to pay for the war , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 January 1547 . <p> To some , Henry VIII was a strong and ruthless ruler , forcing through changes to the Church-State relationship which excluded the papacy and brought the clergy under control , thus strengthening the Crown 's position and acquiring the monasteries ' wealth . <p> However , Henry 's reformation had produced dangerous Protestant-Roman Catholic differences in the kingdom . The monasteries ' wealth had been spent on wars and had also built up the economic strength of the aristocracy and other families in the counties , which in turn was to encourage ambitious Tudor court factions . <p> Significantly , Parliament 's involvement in making religious and dynastic changes had been firmly established . For all his concern over establishing his dynasty and the resulting religious upheaval , Henry 's six marriages had produced one sickly son and an insecure succession with two princesses ( Mary and Elizabeth ) who at one stage had been

But the construction completed until the second half of the 16th century was not really appropriate for all fortification needs and consequently it succumbed easily to the attacks of the French pirates in 1566 . ( See I7 on Funchal City Map ) . In the following years until up to the 19th century , many improvements , alterations and extensions to the original primitive construction were made so that the Palcio de Sao Loureno that has survived until today , belongs to one of the best-preserved examples of Portuguese fortification from the 16th and 17th century .

##501752 <p> Years went by at Lottie 's house . First Isabel , then Lottie , turned over in the sun . Tea bags bobbed silently in the glass jar of sun tea that Lottie was brewing on the corner of the patio . There was a smell of boiling apples ; they were making applesauce in the pressure cooker . They were stoned . They had the arm up on the stereo so that the first side of Court and Spark would play over and over . They were supposed to be watching Bettina , Lottie 's deaf sister ; Lottie had sent her out to the driveway with her basketball and turned the stereo up . Not that it would bother Bettina anyway . Lottie misted herself with the spray bottle . She encased herself in mist . Lottie had a thick scar that ran straight down between her breasts . It bisected her . On this side : Lottie . On that side : Lottie . She was a Libra ; everything had to be even . <p> Isabel retied the straps of the black bikini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel was a Gemini . She was all uneven , like fraternal twins . In that way she was very much like Joni Mitchell : no two sides of her precisely matched . One breast ( the left one ) was larger than the other . Her right foot was bigger than her left foot . Her hair was one color in the front , but a slightly different color in back , and a choppy blond streak fell across her eyes . She and Lottie had dyed it with some of Lottie 's mother 's peroxide . It did n't look right . Lottie did n't say so , but they both knew it was true . <p> Lottie was the rule giver . <p> Isabel was attentive . <p> Isabel had had hopes for the streak as some sort of unifying force , because when she looked at her face in the mirror , she found that it changed constantly It slipped from mood to mood : these Isabel eyes , those Isabel lips ( too big ) , the small Isabel ears assembled themselves differently when viewed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the back , the front . Some of the faces were the right ones ; others were n't . The streak did nothing to explain or enhance any of them . <p> " Are there any more cookies ? " said Isabel . <p> Lottie passed her the pecan sandies bag , damp and half full of crumbs . Isabel told herself she could only have five pecan sandies . Lottie had eaten just two , but she had also eaten almost an entire container of cottage cheese . Isabel was sure that Lottie had figured this into her calorie economy , because Lottie was very economical . She knew about coupons and discounts ; Isabel , Lottie sometimes implied , came from a family of wasters , of full-price payers . Lottie had built a little greenhouse for her room with her brother , Sam , who worked at a plant store downtown and had given Lottie a belt studded with turquoise medallions outlined in silver . She knew the names of all the plants . She knew how to balance soil pH , a checkbook , combinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how high to get . She knew how to freeze things , and how to thaw them . Even her beauties - her fine long blond hair , her long legs , her blue-green eyes - were balanced by her scar , her short fingers , her funny walk . Boys , adding Lottie up , could only manage a sex conclusion . Her blondeness , her bug legs . Lottie with her opal ring . Boys came up to Lottie at fairs and on the beach . Lottie always acted as if she already knew their entire personalities ; she never tried to cover up her scar , her flat chest . Never apologize , never explain , was her motto . <p> Early in their friendship , Lottie told Isabel that every child on her ward who had had the same heart operation she did had died , one by one , while she was waiting her turn . The nurses and doctors did n't tell her . The other children just disappeared . Lottie , sitting on her bed in her hospital gown , not knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , made a village out of paper cups . She wrote herself letters , although she could n't actually write . She sang little songs . She felt her heart lagging behind , like Peter Pan 's shadow , when she walked . The doctors took the chance ; she had the operation , then lay in the hospital in her enormous stitches for several weeks , humming to herself . She was the nurses ' favorite . After a while , she was sent home . She was a child then . She did n't know that her life had been risked . All she knew was that before the operation she could n't go five steps without sitting down and after she could walk and run , too , although there was still some question about how much she should , even now . Because the few other patients who had survived this childhood operation had then died before reaching twenty-one . Lottie , like Isabel , had made it to sixteen . She went running ; she went ice skating ; she danced . Isabel was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart to continue to beat . Lottie 's scar bisected her , but it also drew her together , like a seam . And it was also a flag . It marked the spot where one Lottie - a Lottie who could n't go five steps without sitting down - had disappeared , and a new Lottie - a Lottie who did n't apologize , did n't explain - had arisen . <p> Bettina , who had Lottie 's eyes but was thicker and already taller , came to the screen door , bouncing her basketball . Lottie flapped her hand : Get out of here . <p> Bettina wanted Lottie to drive her to the mall . Lottie said , " No , " soundlessly . That was the way they talked to Bettina so that her lip-reading would improve . Bettina was n't allowed to sign at home anymore . <p> " Not for a while " said Lottie . " She went to the pool . " Lottie 's mother went to the pool a lot . She was tall , and bitter , and smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making phone calls and listening to the classical station on the radio . She attended Parents Without Partners meetings and knew all about the life of Mozart ; she frequently made comments to the effect that her teacher 's certificate , like her marriage , had given her knowledge without power . <p> " Do you want to stay over after the dance ? " <p> " I ca n't , " said Lottie . " My father 's coming tomorrow " <p> After five pecan sandies , plus a half , Isabel had a cigarette . The smoke was rough and dark and grating ; smoking imparted the sensation that she was passing over to the other side of something , or that the other side of something was passing through her . It also made her feel thinner . <p> Lottie often told Isabel she should quit , pointing to her mother as an example of someone who had n't , as if divorce and general unhappiness were a consequence of smoking . But Lottie also , indulgently , gave Isabel a silver cigarette case for Christmas ; Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cigarettes , and flipped it open at parties . Isabel enjoyed smoking . Pot made her feel two-dimensional ; once she had crawled under a bed after smoking too much dope . Drinking made her depressed . But cigarettes made Isabel more Isabel to herself in a way that the peroxide streak had failed to do . Smoking , things began to match , or at least to fall into a rough order . First , a cigarette . Second , the conversation at hand . Third , everything else : the present , the future , the past . Lottie and Isabel were in agreement that the past was a dark corridor filled with freakish or sad incidents ( the door that mysteriously locked itself , the girl knocked right out of her shoes by a speeding car ) , the present was certain lines from certain books ( Nothing human is alien to me ) , and the future was fame . <p> The sun slowly traversed them . Isabel and Lottie moved their chairs around the patio like the hands of a clock . Joni worried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Paris , went to Germany Her anxious train ran forward and backward , up and down the track of Lottie 's scar , around and around the plume of Isabel 's cigarette smoke . Although neither of them could see it from where they were lying on their chaise longues , they both knew that Joni 's perch face was there on the inside of the album cover , the face of someone levitating . It was still their favorite record , even though it was three years old . Inside , Bettina , 
##502751 <h> MAOI Antidepressants <p> Monoamine-oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) antidepressants are a group of medicines that are used to treat depression . They can take up to three weeks to build up their effect to work fully . A normal course of antidepressants lasts at least six months after symptoms ease . You can not drink alcohol or eat food that contains tyramine ( for example , cheese , liver , yoghurt or Marmiter ) while you are taking an MAOI . You can not take some cough and cold medicines while you are taking an MAOI . <h> What are MAOI antidepressants ? <p> Monoamine-oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) antidepressants are a group of medicines that are used to treat depression . They include : moclobemide , phenelzine , isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine and come in various different brand names . <p> Phenelzine , isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine are older types of MAOI antidepressants that have been used since the 1950s , and they are n't prescribed very often any more . <p> Moclobemide is a newer MAOI antidepressant with fewer side-effects than the older type of MAOI antidepressant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as depression . <h> How do MAOI antidepressants work ? <p> Antidepressants alter the balance of some of the chemicals in the brain ( neurotransmitters ) . MAOI antidepressants prevent the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin . An altered balance of serotonin and other neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline is thought to play a part in causing depression . <h> When are MAOI antidepressants usually prescribed ? <p> MAOI antidepressants are usually prescribed when several of the newer type of antidepressants have been tried but have not worked so well , or caused troublesome side-effects . Some examples of newer types of antidepressant are fluoxetine , citalopram and sertraline . An MAOI may also be used if you have atypical depression . <p> MAOI antidepressants are normally prescribed or recommended by doctors who specialise in treating depression . For example , a consultant in mental health , or a GP who has a lot of experience of treating people with depression . <p> Most people who take antidepressants find that the newer types are easier to take because : <p> They have fewer side-effects and drug interactions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contain tyramine or cough and cold medicines . <h> How well do MAOI antidepressants work ? <p> About 5-7 in 10 people with moderate or severe depression have an improvement in symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment with an antidepressant . However , up to 3 in 10 people improve with dummy tablets ( placebo ) , as some people would have improved in this time naturally . So , if you have depression , you are roughly twice as likely to improve with an antidepressant compared with taking no treatment . But , they do not work in everybody . As a rule , the more severe the depression , the greater the chance that an antidepressant will work well . <p> Note : antidepressants do not necessarily make sad people happy . The word depressed is often used when people really mean sad , fed-up , or unhappy . True depression is different to unhappiness and has persistent symptoms ( which often include persistent sadness ) . See separate leaflet called ' Depression ' for more information about this condition . <h> How quickly do MAOI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days of starting treatment . However , it may take up to three weeks or more to build up its effect and work fully . Some people stop treatment after a week or so thinking it is not helping . It is best to wait for 3-4 weeks before deciding if an antidepressant is helping or not . If poor sleep is a symptom of the depression , it is often helped first , within a week or so . <h> When taking MAOI antidepressants <p> Some important considerations are : <p> Do not eat foods or drinks that contain tyramine . <p> Do not take certain other medicines . <p> Carry a special card at all times . <p> Rules when switching to other antidepressants . <h> Avoid tyramine <p> Do not eat food or drinks that contain tyramine ( including alcoholic drinks ) because this can cause a very large , sudden increase in blood pressure ( hypertensive crisis ) . This is very important if you are taking one of the older MAOI antidepressants such as phenelzine , isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine . Hypertensive crisis is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat or drink large amounts of food and drinks that contain tyramine.The first sign of a hypertensive crisis may be a throbbing headache . <p> Tyramine is found in cheese , liver , yoghurt , Marmiter , Oxor , Bovrilr , brewer 's yeast , flavoured textured vegetable protein , broad bean pods ( the beans inside can be eaten ) , protein which has been allowed to age , or ferment ( for example , hung game , pickled herrings or dry sausage such as salami or pepperoni ) , fermented soya bean extract and large amounts of chocolate . <p> Tyramine is also found in alcoholic drinks , including beer , lager or wine ( especially red wine ) . It is best to avoid all alcoholic drinks . It is also found in non-alcoholic beer . <p> Only eat fresh foods and avoid food that is stale or ' going off ' , especially meat , fish , poultry or offal while taking an MAOI and for two weeks after you stop . This is because these foods may contain tyramine . <h> Other medicines that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may take . So , make sure your doctor knows of any other medicines that you are taking , including ones that you have bought rather than been prescribed . Always check with your pharmacist before buying any medicines from the chemist or supermarket to see if they are safe to take with an MAOI antidepressant . Some medicines that you can buy for coughs and colds can also cause a very large sudden increase in blood pressure ( hypertensive crisis ) , or make you very excitable or depressed . In particular , avoid medicines for coughs and colds that contain dextromethorphan , ephedrine or pseudoephedrine while you are taking an MAOI antidepressant and for two weeks after you stop it : <p> Dextromethorphan when taken with an MAOI antidepressant may make you very excitable or depressed . <p> Ephedrine , pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine when taken at the same time as an MAOI antidepressant may cause very large increases in blood pressure . <h> Carry a card <p> If you are taking an MAOI antidepressant you will be given a small card that you must carry with you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks and over-the-counter medicines you ca n't take . Always make sure you show this card to anyone giving you medical treatment ( for example , a doctor , a dentist , a pharmacist or a nurse ) . <h> If you change your antidepressant <p> If your doctor wants to change your medication from an MAOI to another antidepressant , you must leave two weeks between stopping your MAOI antidepressant before starting your new antidepressant . <h> What are the possible side-effects ? <h> Phenelzine , isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine <p> The most common side-effect with these older MAOIs is feeling dizzy when you stand up ( postural hypotension ) . It is more likely to happen if you are older . Less commonly , some people have drowsiness , difficulty sleeping , headache , weakness and tiredness , a dry mouth , or constipation . Very rarely these medicines can affect your liver - for example , jaundice has been reported and a few deaths from liver reactions ( but these are very rare ) . Peripheral neuropathy ( weakness , cramps , and spasms , a loss of balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reported very rarely . <h> Moclobemide <p> Common adverse effects include , sleep disturbance , and nausea . Less commonly , agitation and confusion have been seen in people taking moclobemide . <p> Note : the above is not the full list of side-effects or interactions for these medicines . Please see the leaflet that comes with your particular brand for a full list of possible side-effects and cautions . <h> Can I buy MAOI antidepressants ? <p> You can not buy MAOI antidepressants . They are only available from your chemist with a doctor 's prescription . <h> What is the usual length of treatment ? <p> If you find that the treatment is helpful after 3-4 weeks , it is usual to continue . A normal course of antidepressants lasts at least six months after symptoms have eased . If you stop the medicine too soon , your symptoms may rapidly return . <p> Some people with recurrent depression are advised to take longer courses of treatment . <h> Who can not take MAOI antidepressants ? <p> It is normally recommended that you avoid taking MAOI antidepressants if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manic phase . <p> Experience excitation or agitation as a major part of your depression ( your doctor may prescribe a sedative medication such as a benzodiazepine for 2-3 weeks ) . <p> Have had a stroke or any other condition that affects the blood supply to the brain . <p> Are taking other antidepressants . <p> Have a growth on your adrenal gland which can cause high blood pressure ( phaeochromocytoma ) . <p> Have heart disease . <p> Are pregnant . <p> Are breast-feeding . <h> Are MAOI antidepressants addictive ? <p> MAOI antidepressants are not tranquillisers , and are not thought to be addictive . ( This is disputed by some people , and so this is a controversial issue . If addiction does occur , it is only in a minority of cases . ) <p> Most people can stop an MAOI without any problem . At the end of a course of treatment you should reduce the dose gradually over about four weeks before finally stopping . This is because some people develop withdrawal symptoms if the medication is stopped abruptly . If you have withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the the medicine , as other features of addiction such as cravings for the medicine do not occur . <p> Withdrawal symptoms that may occur include : drowsiness , anxiety and agitation , sleep disturbance , vivid dreams , slowed speech and a lack of muscle co-ordination . Rarely , some people may have hallucinations and delusions . These symptoms are unlikely to occur if you reduce the dose gradually .

##521250 <p> ' We 're not done yet , but we 're working on it ' , a rather annoyed-looking ECB present Mario Draghi more or less told the public after the last meeting of the Governing Council . The piece of work in question was , of course , the planned intervention to support government bond markets conditional upon ailing sovereigns being part of a formal bailout . ( Here 's looking at you , Spain . ) <p> The lack of detail initially underwhelmed markets that had expectations for greater granularity around the action plan . That eventually reversed , possibly when people realised what Draghi said was actually pretty daring when measured by the ECB 's own standards and stated mandate . <p> What this meatless announcement also did was give every analyst ( and ahem ... blogger ) something to write/speculate about in an otherwise quiet month . As FT Alphaville mentioned earlier , when discussing how the ECB might address seniority concerns , there has truly been no shortage of opinions . <p> Another popular facet of the discussion focuses on whether the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the markets where the ECB intervenes . Thursday morning 's roundup of the latest news coverage , provided by Eurointelligence , gives a sense of the latest rampant speculation state of affairs things . <p> First up , Shhh , it 's a secret ! : <p> Spiegel Online leads with an update to its news story on Monday , according to which the interest rate threshold is likely to be top secret . The story said that a majority of central banks have rejected the idea of transparent interest rate caps . The article also quotes Wolfgang Schauble as saying that such a solution was problematic . This is why the next option down the line will be an unofficial version of the above . <p> Next up , On reflection , we all suck at keeping secrets . Hmm . <p> Die Welt came out with a corroborating story this morning . It said the latest internal idea discussed in the ECB are s ecret interest rate targets , or alternatively spread targets , but there is also concern that these targets might be revealed ( which is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being revealed . ) <p> Finally , Errr , it 's really hard to agree on stuff with so many council members . Ugh . <p> Mark Schieritz , in his blog Herdentrieb , confirms that his sources have told him that there is no majority for such a radical plan . He said the operations department of the ECB , under Ulrich Bindseil , has made technical preparation , but this is just their job . They have done the same for the LTRO . Schieritz concludes that either the ECB leaked the story , in which case it was an own goal , or the Bundesbank leaked the story in order to build up sufficient opposition in Germany . He concludes that whatever is decided on Sep 6 , is likely to disappoint . <p> Huw Pill at Goldman Sachs has a particularly interesting note around this , wherein he relates future ECB bond market intervention to past foreign exchange interventions by central banks . He uses this to illustrate why it 's unlikely that there will be specific targets , in part because it 's better if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed by market participants . <p> Here 's Pill on the likely location of the invention : <p> To steer market rates towards that level , we expect the ECB to intervene opportunistically in the one- to three-year maturities in the manner of FX intervention , rather than announce ex ante mechanical intervention rules in the style of exchange rate target zones . <p> More colour on the parallel being drawn : <p> In our view , the new ECB measures will be more akin to foreign exchange intervention rather than the operation of an exchange rate target zone . The ECB will likely strive to avoid creating a target for the markets to speculate against : ensuring markets face a ' two-way risk ' rather than a ' one way bet ' situation will be central . This implies that the ECB would intervene on its own initiative so as to support and amplify market movements that it sees as moving yields towards the levels it sees as consistent with fundamentals . Such interventions need not be pre-announced , even if they are revealed ex post . And the amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interventions may be large ( indeed , potentially unlimited ) , but it would be the ECB itself -- rather than a need to fulfil a pre-announced commitment to the market -- that would determine their magnitude and timing . <p> And these interventions are likely to be effective . The markets of concern are substantially less liquid than the foreign exchange market -- indeed , the fundamental problem is that these markets are seizing up owing to illiquidity , thereby providing the rationale for the ECB to intervene in the first place ( so as to support market functioning ) . At any rate , the short end of the yield curve is the traditional realm of central bank actions and where central bank influence is normally high . Moreover , as we have argued repeatedly in the past , the ECB is a common institution with the power to create an unlimited stock of Euros : there need be no exhaustion of the stock of FX reserves , which ultimately led to devaluations in and withdrawals from the ERM in the early 1990s . <p> Another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could be seen as removing some of the desired conditionality on the sovereigns being supported -- something which would be very unpopular with core countries , most notably Germany . <p> Have your own take to 
##527051 <h> Sebastian Vettel : " I was fighting as much as I could " <p> Sebastian Vettel has kept his championship challenge firmly on track with a solid fourth place in Hungary , but the German felt he had the speed to do a lot better . <p> After starting third Vettel was passed by Jenson Button at the first corner , and having lost time behind the McLaren he was also jumped at the second pit stops by Kimi Raikkonen . <p> Later he made an extra pit stop to finish the race on fresh tyres , having got far enough ahead of Fernando Alonso to ensure that he would hold onto fourth even with a stop . <p> " I think it was probably not the result we could have had today , " said Vettel . " Our speed was a little bit better than that . Jenson was quite slow , and we lost quite a lot . But obviously you ca n't just pit and come out in clean air , there 's traffic . Other people were n't that much slower either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously it could have been the case that their tyres fall ' off the cliff ' , which was n't the case . So we 'll try next time . <p> " I think a two-stop would not have change anything , so it was just following Romain around . Trying to something different was I think the right thing . It was marginal coming out ahead of Fernando , but it was good . It could have been a different story , their tyres could have fallen off . <p> " It did n't happen this time . We did everything we could from a strategy point of view , which lost a little bit too much in the first corner and particularly to Jenson , who was very slow , and we lots too much time to the guys ahead . " <p> Vettel insisted that he was n't too disappointed . <p> " I 'm not frustrated , it was not a boring afternoon for me . I was fighting as much as I could , I was pushing hard . That 's what I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I win then I 'm happy . If you 're fourth -- today I have to accept it , but you 're not as happy as if you win . <p> " I finished ahead of Fernando , but not a lot .

##527551 <p> A lunch with Chuck Close gave me the idea for this column . After agreeing over pasta and wine that New York art in 2012 resembled the cultural flailing of the 1970s ( " the same lack of focus " ) , the seventy-two-year-old painter confided the following : " There are two things that scare the shit out of me . One is today 's post-studio art -- since people ca n't afford studios , they 're designing 10,000-square-foot exhibitions on the back of a cocktail napkin without the benefit of trial and error . Second , and scariest of all , is the movement towards deskilled art . Nothing ever got made without some kind of skill -- you would n't expect a musician to not know how to play the guitar ? " Plain words from a pioneering postconceptualist who learned his art history firsthand . Close 's comments stuck with me as I reconstructed the last year of art in New York . Putting aside the auction-house sprint towards the art-market cliffs ( they 're rocky and sheer , just like Dover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's two most epochal art events in Gotham appear as connected as bargain rooms at a Motel 6 . More than anytime since 2006 -- when youngish art spaces began migrating en masse to Chinatown 's cow lanes and the Bowery -- 2012 has proved to be the year ( or 15 minutes ) of the Lower East Side galleries . Their glittering apotheosis arrived , one area dealer proudly told me , at this year 's Whitney Biennial . He should be careful what he celebrates . Ephemeral , light as helium and ultimately ahistorical , the Whitney Biennial 2012 was above all -- pretentious twaddle about performance and genre-mixing aside -- a showcase for a new stripe of deskilled art . Touching down initially in New York as newfangled collage and unmonumental expression , this youthful style quickly assumed the exhibition-ready role of the latest ' new normal ' all over the Lower East Side . Predictably , the local branch of the arty-go-lightly crowd fell hard : when do they not ? With the biennial , this enfeebling tendency continued worming its way into the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Storm Worm computer virus , the new fashion operates like a self-replicating program . It piggybacks on other , older messages and cripples capacity for intelligent thought from the inside . Consisting chiefly of a decontextualised grab-bag of 1960s and 70s antiaesthetic , antiartisanal approaches to artmaking , much present-day deskilled art -- let 's call it Deskilled 2.0 or D'oh ! -- ignores or just plain flips off its original Duchampian premises . Rather than provide critique or ironical enlightenment concerning the supports underpinning the edifice of conventional art , recent deskilled art largely accepts its artlessness as the newest cool app . Put in the neo-Marxist lingo of John Roberts , author of 2007 's The Intangibilities of Form : Skill and Deskilling in Art after the Readymade , no substantial tradeoff takes place between ' traditional artisanal techniques ' and ' intellectual and immaterial labour ' with this new lot . Unlike its intellectualising conceptualist forebears , D'oh ! has nothing to do with a critique of aesthetics . Instead , it proves its opposite : just another quick and dirty style . Ignoring for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused and trivialised by subsequent generations ( shades of Che Guevara T-shirts ) , the most alarming thing about the new deskilled trend is the lack of general awareness of its aesthetic and critical limitations . ( You 'd think someone would have heard of Joseph Kosuth ! ) The equivalent of second-rate disco music made to fill dance-hall space , much D'oh ! art seems to be mostly about exhibiting for the sake of a yearly calendar . As such , it 's little more than a historical placeholder . Has no one noticed that -- just as the revolution was finally televised -- the antiaesthetic has just been aestheticised ? Sublimation -- the basic transformation of raw , untutored stuff into art objects , videos , films , happenings , whatever -- proved a remarkable challenge for many of the artists in the Whitney Biennial . That look , a habit of formlessness that turns even a picture tacked to the wall into an ' installation ' , has very much become the house style for some of the most popular galleries of the Lower East Side . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation last April , the great majority of the neighbourhood 's top artists are not at all interested in making " grand statements " . That , it seems to 
##531650 <h> Lackland : The Loss of Normandy in 1215 <p> Nick Barratt argues that Normandy 's loss in the reign of King John has had a far-reaching impact on Britain . <p> Britons are drawn to events when their independence and freedom have been under threat , yet overwhelming odds have been defied . The Second World War brought the evacuation of the Dunkirk beaches , the Battle of Britain and D-Day . Victories at Trafalgar and Waterloo safeguarded Britain from Napoleon . The defeat of the Spanish Armada cemented the reputation of Queen Elizabeth . The dates we remember most are usually linked with triumph , or at least the aversion of disaster . In contrast one of the most important dates in English history -- one which represents one of the greatest catastrophes ever to befall an English monarch -- has been airbrushed from national consciousness . <p> Eight hundred years ago , in 1204 , the political map of Western Europe was redrawn in the space of a few months when John , king of England and ruler of territories covering roughly two-thirds of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the French king , Philip Augustus . The consequences of this humiliating defeat still reverberate , particularly in relations between the English and their neighbours in the British Isles , attitudes to continental Europe , lingering concepts of British imperialism , and the significance of Magna Carta as a symbol of human rights . I believe this humbling defeat should be seen as a key turning point . <p> The kings of England from 1066 considered themselves first and foremost as landowners in Normandy and nominal subjects of the King of France but who , as a result of William the Conqueror 's invasion , had also acquired a royal title and access to England 's riches . The relative unimportance of England to them is illustrated by William 's division of his lands before his death in 1087 ; his eldest son Robert received the Duchy of Normandy , while his second son William Rufus took the secondary prize , becoming William II of England . Nevertheless , the fledgling Anglo-Norman realm was re-united under one ruler , when the Conqueror 's third son Henry I inherited England after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother Robert at the battle of Tinchebrai in 1106 . A cross-Channel aristocracy developed , holding lands in both territories and having a vested interest in keeping them united in one ruler . The wars of Stephen 's reign ( 1135-54 ) emphasised this ; he failed to win over the Norman aristocracy and thereby made the task of hanging on to England much harder . Unification was achieved under Henry II ( r.1154-89 ) , but now the Anglo-Norman realm became part of an even larger accumulation of titles . <p> Henry II , son of the Empress Matilda and Geoffrey of Anjou , was the nominal ruler of lands stretching from the borders of Scotland to the Pyrenees . He inherited England partly through conquest , partly through his mother 's birthright as daughter of Henry I ; Normandy had been conquered by his father and Henry was invested as duke of Normandy some time between November 1149 and March 1150 ; Anjou also passed to him on Count Geoffrey 's death in 1151 . Perhaps the most audacious acquisition was the strategically important duchy of Aquitaine when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gamble ; not only was Eleanor eleven years older than the nineteen-year-old Henry , but also she was the repudiated wife of Louis VII , king of France . One of the grounds for the annulment was that she had failed to produce a male heir , a serious issue when dynastic continuity depended on a brood of healthy sons . <p> Thus , through dynastic accident and shrewd marriage , within five years Henry had gained control of unprecedented resources , often referred to as the Angevin Empire . In 1158 he added lordship of Brittany , and claimed lordship of Ireland following an invasion in 1171 and subsequent settlement by English adventurers . To secure the borders of these lands , Henry forged a complicated network of alliances , paid for by a steady flow of money from England 's treasury . Indeed a cynic might argue that money from England 's cash-rich economy was more important to Henry than the prestige that its royal title brought . <p> Thus Henry was an international figure with multiple calls on his time ; England was only a constituent part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent most of his reign abroad . He was a French lord several times over ; his place of birth was Le Mans in the province of Maine ; his education was as a French nobleman , his first language was French and his leading advisers and courtiers were all French . He was naturally more concerned with affairs on the continent , and spent most of his life defending his acquisitions against external foes such as the King of France , and ambitious sons . <p> Henry had no intention of keeping the lands together , yet his policy of partially handing the governance of key territories to each of his sons without fully releasing control , led to bitter resentment and open warfare amongst his offspring . On Henry 's death in 1189 the vast conglomeration passed virtually intact to his son Richard , but this was down to the untimely deaths of Richard 's brothers Henry and Geoffrey . Only one brother remained -- Henry 's youngest son John , unkindly described by historians as the runt of the Angevin litter , whom Henry had only entrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Angevin territories . Henry 's last few years had been spent in open warfare with Richard , who was never a favourite of his father ; it was the news that John had joined Richard 's revolt in 1189 that broke the old king 's heart . Wearied by old age and treachery , Henry was forced to acknowledge Richard as his heir . His last words to his estranged son had a prophetic ring : ' May the Lord spare me until I have taken vengeance upon you . ' Henry 's time had run out -- he died a few days later on July 6th , 1189 , but Richard had inherited a poisoned chalice . <p> Arguably , Richard I was an even more famous figure than his father , winning renown and the nickname ' Lionheart ' as a Crusader in the Middle East and locking horns with Saladin . Whilst Richard 's fame as a warrior and general has endured , his reputation as a competent ruler has come under scrutiny , particularly in the context of the loss of Normandy , the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destabilised during Richard 's reign on a number of levels -- financial , political and structural -- through the excessive militarisation of Normandy 's frontiers . Furthermore the French king Philip Augustus , 1179-1223 , one of Western Europe 's most astute and opportunist monarchs , had constantly sought to exploit his position as Henry and Richard 's feudal overlord to undermine their position as Duke of Normandy . He had often acted as catalyst in the arguments between father and son . Despite little material success in the ensuing conflicts , the effects on the duchy of Philip 's constant military , political and diplomatic barrage was further to destabilise relations between the leading barons and their Angevin princes . The ambivalence of the Norman barons can be traced back to Geoffrey of Anjou 's conquest of Normandy , which had forcibly ended many years of open enmity between the two territories . For as long as Henry II and Richard remained successful , the Norman aristocracy proved loyal , albeit grudgingly . However , during Richard 's captivity on his way back from Crusade ( 1193-94 ) , Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key castles such as Evreux to the French king , allowing Philip to seize large sections of the French-Norman frontier . Richard spent the rest of his life trying to win them back , whilst the Norman aristocracy never forgot John 's treachery . <p> In the face of Philip 's aggression , Richard embarked on a massive programme of fortification along a disputed section of the Norman border called the Vexin . Castle after castle was constructed to provide a strategic network , at the heart of which was Chteau Gaillard -- literally the ' saucy castle ' . Built on Les Andelys , an island in the Seine , Chteau Gaillard was personally designed by Richard , who boasted that its defences were so well conceived that he could defend the castle even if its walls were made of butter . It protected strategic routes to the ducal capital of Rouen : whilst Chteau Gaillard stood intact , Normandy was safe . <p> Richard 's castle-building programme came at an enormous cost . The duchy 's finances were pushed to breaking point , and large drafts of cash from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues were insufficient to meet even the cost of garrisoning its defences and so , to fund Richard 's seemingly never-ending wars against Philip , England was subjected to unprecedented levels of financial exaction . Worst of all , Richard fatally undermined England 's fiscal base , namely revenue from royal demesne lands , at a time when Philip Augustus was vastly expanding the French royal demesne . <p> On Richard 's death in 1199 , the new king John faced an unenviable position -- committed to unsustainable levels of expenditure in Normandy that could only be funded by huge cash injections from England , drawn largely from politically sensitive sources . Contemporary chroniclers reveal a hitherto unrecognised level of resentment directed against Richard , and in contrast , the first years of John 's reign saw praise heaped on the new king as the bringer of peace to a people wearied from heavy taxation and constant warfare . Yet within a few years , John 's reputation was in tatters . <p> Amongst English monarchs , perhaps only Richard III can claim to have been vilified at a level similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's reign it is difficult to know where to begin . Here was a man who was alleged to have murdered his nephew with his own bare hands ; who lusted after and married a thirteen-year-old heiress , much to the disgust of her fianc , a key ally ; who lost territories that had been in his family 's possession for centuries ; whose actions in England brought the wrath of the Pope onto his God-fearing subjects during the great Interdict of 1208-14 , when all church doors were locked ; who managed to alienate so many leading English subjects that they declared war on him , having first attempted to tie him to written guidelines for good-government ; and who was so disliked that a foreign prince -- Louis , son of Philip Augustus -- with no legitimate claim to the throne was preferred as a potential monarch by the rebels , who offered him the throne . Even taking into account the difficult political and financial situation bequeathed to him , John was indisputably the architect of his own misfortune . <p> A chain of events was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella d'Angoulme , betrothed at the time to one of his leading vassals in Aquitaine , Hugh le Brun , Lord of Lusignan . The ensuing squabble quickly turned to full-scale revolt , and as supreme overlord of both John and Hugh , Philip Augustus was provided with an easy opportunity to intervene directly in Angevin affairs . His demands for John to grant justice to Hugh were ignored ; and thus , as a disobedient vassal , in 1202 John was formally stripped of all lands held of Philip except Normandy . Philip handed them to Arthur , John 's nephew , and promptly embarked on raids against Normandy 's borders . In an astonishingly decisive response , John won a victory more stunning than any achieved by his father or brother , and at the castle of Mirabeau captured Arthur along with all the leading Lusignan rebels . All were imprisoned , Arthur at Falaise ; but in the words of the Margam chronicler , ' after King John had captured Arthur and kept him alive in prison for some time , at length , in the castle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd , 1203 , when he was drunk and possessed by the devil , he slew him with his own hand , and tying a heavy stone to the body cast it into the Seine . ' Rumours of this barbaric act , and the treatment of other noble prisoners , sealed John 's fate . <p> The erosion of Norman confidence in their duke had been growing during Richard 's last years , but under John , loyalty sank to a new low . Sensing this , Philip continued his assault on John 's lands throughout 1203 , and quickly seized control of Anjou , Maine and large sections of Aquitaine . More significantly , he made heavy inroads into the Norman defences , seizing castle after castle . John acted like a rabbit caught in headlights and , ( correctly ) fearing treachery from the Norman nobles , fled the duchy on December 5th , 1203 . Philip had already begun his assault on Chteau Gaillard in August . In one sense Richard 's boasts about the defensive capability of Chteau Gaillard were proved accurate ; while opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this key defence held out until March 1204 . For as long as Chteau Gaillard held there was hope , as control of Normandy depended on its possession . However , John continued to cower in England , and by the time he had begun to make preparations for a return , it was too late . After a lengthy siege during which local residents were condemned to a horrific existence of depravation and starvation , trapped between the castle walls and the besieging army , Philip Augustus stormed the fortress on March 6th , 1204 . He then mopped up resistance in the south and west of the duchy , taking the symbolically important towns of Falaise and Caen , before heading east . He reached Rouen , the ducal capital , in May ; with the rest of Normandy in French hands and with no realistic hope of relief from John , resistance seemed futile and the city surrendered on June 24th , 1204 . The heart had been ripped out of the Angevin Empire . <p> John devoted the remainder of his reign to the recovery of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources to mount a campaign of re-conquest . Trapped in England , he traversed his kingdom selling royal justice , privilege and office , raising heavy taxes and imposing massive financial penalties on leading magnates to secure the King 's ' goodwill ' . This was particularly odious given the arbitrary nature of the exactions ; and John 's treatment of William de Braiose , who was hounded out of his lands and his wife and children starved to death in the dungeons of Windsor Castle on John 's orders , left few in doubt of the need for compliance . By 1214 John 's arbitrary exactions had secured an enormous war chest . He was risking everything on a military gamble to recover his lost lands . Succeed , and the means would justify the ends ; fail , and the consequences were unthinkable . <p> The funds bought an impressive array of allies , including John 's nephew and Holy Roman Emperor , Otto of Brunswick . John had planned a two-pronged assault , and led the southern attack himself . Predictably , he made little headway and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw . Nevertheless , a momentous encounter took place on July 27th , 1214 , at Bouvines in Flanders , where Philip squared up to Otto and John 's northern allies . In a pitched battle fought on a hot summer 's day , Philip 's victory was crushingly decisive ; God had delivered his verdict on the battlefield , and John slunk back to England to face the consequences . <p> The date of the battle of Bouvines deserves to be as famous as Hastings , mainly because it decided the direction of England 's future development as a nation . First and foremost , the floodgates of political protest in England were opened , leading directly to the creation of Magna Carta in 1215 . Although large sections of the document simply attempted to limit the financial exactions of the Crown , several key clauses still have significance as defining civil liberty : ' No freeman shall be arrested or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed , neither will we set forth against him or send against him , except by the lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ' ; and ' To no one will we sell , to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice . ' These statements of justice and the rule of law are enshrined in constitutions around the world , and have been used as rallying cries against oppression . Without John 's actions after the loss of Normandy , it is entirely possible that Magna Carta would never have materialised . <p> Secondly , Bouvines confirmed the end of the Anglo-Norman realm . The cross-Channel aristocracy were forced to choose on which side of the fence they belonged . Thus for the first time the English nobility focused solely on the acquisition and consolidation of possessions within England . Their attention to their English estates led to greater political and social integration , as well as the development of a sense of Englishness that hitherto had been largely absent . Within forty years , John 's son Henry III found himself facing a political crisis of his own because he had surrounded himself with non-English courtiers . Although the kings of England retained some continental lands , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident rulers , with a greater role to play in England 's development . <p> More ominously , the severance of the Anglo-Norman reign had left John free to turn his attention to Wales and Ireland . After successful campaigns , one chronicler remarked that ' Ireland , Scotland and Wales all bowed to his nod -- a situation which , as is well known , none of his predecessors had achieved -- and he would have thought himself as happy and successful as he could have wished , had he not been despoiled of his continental possessions and suffered the Church 's curse . ' Although the Angevin monarchs no longer had most of their Angevin lands , their grand dynastic visions had not diminished . John 's grandson Edward I undertook the conquest of Wales ( complete with a castle-building programme of which Richard I would have been proud ) , and an abortive attempt to establish sovereignty over Scotland . Similarly , the gradual extension of English rule in Ireland continued . Thus the tone for English imperialism within the British Isles was set in the early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1204 and the battle of Bouvines had created an enmity between the kings of England and France that remained until the nineteenth century . Although Henry III recognised the loss of Normandy , Anjou and Aquitaine under the terms of the Treaty of Paris in 1259 , the terms by which he was permitted to hold on to Gascony stored up problems for future generations . The impractical nature of one sovereign having to perform homage as a vassal to another , with ties of fealty that theoretically prevented an independent foreign policy , were unworkable and was a major cause of the Hundred Years War . It was only in 1801 that the British monarchy formally relinquished its claim to the French throne . <p> Thus without the ineptitude of King John , no modern debate that takes in British devolution , British sovereignty and role within Europe , trial by jury , civil liberty , or even sporting rivalry with the French would be possible .

##533950 <h> Art Around the World <p> Recently is seems that everyone is talking about China and rightly so as we are witnessing a once in a decade leadership change . In the last few years China has developed into one of the world 's leading economies ' with and estimated 1,347,350,000 citizens . It is seen no longer a land of oppression but one of prosperity , which is slowly filtering down the ranks . Among these 1.3 billion people , live many artists that until recently have felt restricted for much of their artistic lives . Many are cautious when it comes to being creative for fear of being labeled a " political activist " . Not so long ago the Chinese government in a crackdown on people imprisoned many artists they considered dissidents . Ai Weiwei is a well-known Chinese contemporary artist who has been classified as such . The 53 year old has recently appeared in the media spotlight after Chinese authorities demolished his newly built Shanghai studio located in the center of the fledging art district . It was torn down without prior notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies . Weiwei is not a stranger to the authorities ; prior to this , he spent time in prison and his movements were restricted under house arrest . He has also struggled to return back to China after spending time in neighboring Japan . Although Weiwei 's is classified as a political activist with his work , there are many more artists living in China that find the industry is becoming more acceptable and one with increasingly more value . Unlike the past it is now more common to see art in galleries and auctions in Beijing and Shanghai , although it is not given the same validation as art from the west . People are embracing it more as a part of their culture and heritage but picking pieces to buy can be a minefield especially to the untrained eye as there are not many curators available . <p> M50 is a thriving community in Shanghai where 100 or more artists choose to exhibit their art and is found to attract tourists and locals alike . It shows modern contemporary pieces of art in over 120 art studios or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouring Shanghai 's M50 district are amazing . The different use of textures and colors shows how much passion and creativity exists within such a vast country .

##535850 <h> Introduction : Understanding the value of the British Monarchy as a brand <p> In April 2011 David Haigh was interviewed outside Buckingham Palace about the value of the Monarchy as a ' brand ' and was asked to comment on the effect of the Royal Wedding on this . <p> In preparation for the interview , BrandFinance 's research team considered the issue as though the Monarchy were just any other branded business . In valuing ' The Firm ' , we researched what tangible assets are tied up in delivering the Monarchy ' experience ' and what intangible asset value is created for the United Kingdom by the Monarchy . <p> We pulled together a variety of facts and statistics and concluded that the Crown Estate ( which owns all the Royal Palaces andProperties ) was worth approximately 8 billion ( the tangible asset value of the Monarchy ) . We then looked for evidence of annual benefits to the UK and found reports from various sources which suggested that incremental benefits to the UK economy came to approximately 1 billion , which implied a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.067% of annual GDP ( 1.5 trillion ) this did not seem an unreasonably high number . <p> We identified three ways the Monarchy creates value for UK plc : <p> First , the general benefit to UK tourism andindustry ; with airports , hotels , restaurants , shops , homes and streets full of crowds celebrating the ' fairytale wedding ' 1 billionseemed credible . <p> Second , the incremental benefit to individual UK businesses of the Royal Warrant scheme ; there is compelling evidence that this scheme adds higher demand and higher prices to the 850 companies with a Royal endorsement . Brands like Fortnum and Masons and Berry Brothers clearly benefit from the luxury connotations of a Royal Warrant . <p> Third , the reputational benefit to individual UK businesses gained from having a Coat of Arms ; this is a mark of reputation granted by the Royal Household ( via the College of Arms ) to companies which can demonstrate their stability and high business standards . Brands like British Airways and Harrods wear their armorial bearings with pride because they produce business and financial benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monarchy might have an asset value as high as 20 billion proved both offensive and controversial when my interview was aired in April last year . Many people do n't agreewith the constitutional principle of a hereditary Monarch exercising power over the running of the country . The question is obviously highly political and elicits very emotional responses . Brand Finance employs Monarchists and Republicans in its ranks . So we decided for our own interest to revisit this thorny subjectin Jubilee year and get closer to a fair value for the Monarchy . <p> We were all surprised to find that we had under-estimated both the tangible and intangible value of the Monarchy . It is one of the most valuable of all British brands . Whatever one thinks about the constitutional principle , there seems little doubt that the institution of Monarchy adds significant annual earnings and long term economic value to the UK . We hope our report stimulates an amicable debate about one of the UK 's most valuable assets . <p> The Monarchy in 2012 <p> Our valuation of the Monarchy is based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from reputable sources . Some are more concrete than others , but we believe that as with other valuations we have produced a fair view overall . This year we estimate that the combined tangible and intangible asset value of the Monarchy is 44 billion . <p> In arriving at the tangible value , we have included the value of the Crown Estate , the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and the Royal Collection . By different , and inevitably arcane , ownership routes these assets all belong to the country as a whole . They are appreciating assets which , at current best estimates , are worth 18 billion . While the Monarchy employs these assets they belong to everyone . <p> In arriving at the intangible value we have included both economic benefits and costs . <p> Benefits include the revenue uplifts from tourism , products and industrial sales in addition to free global advertising and public relations . Finally they include the net increment to GDP created by the Royal feel good factor . <p> Costs include the Civil List , earnings from Royal tangible property ( ceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Manyof these ' costs ' are in fact incurred employing the Royal Household and Security staff , many of whom would remain if we had a President rather than a Monarch . <p> The net effect appears to be an economic uplift even in years like 2011 and 2012 when Royal occasions provide a good excuse to down tools and have a day off work . <p> It would be foolish to suggest that members of the Royal Family are not rich and privileged . The mystique of the institution relies on the fact that they are . Some are richer and more privileged than others and some flaunt the fact less tactfully than others . Is it a price worth paying ? <p> The fact is that great brands need highly paid stars . In sport , figures like David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson earn millions building British team brands like Manchester United . In media , actors and writers like Daniel Radcliffe and JKRowling become multi-millionaires building British entertainment brands like Harry Potter . In business , entrepreneurs like Lord Sugar and Sir Richard Branson become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question that the Royal Family is a team ofstars building a multi-billion dollar brand for the UK . Should they be reasonably paid for doing so ? <p> For most of her reign , The Queen has managed the Monarchy team as expertly as Sir Alex Ferguson manages Manchester United . She iscurrently doing a great job on an international stage . However while Ferguson has only been doing it for 25 years , she has been at it for 60 years . <p> The Monarchy is a powerful endorsement for individual and company brands and for the nation brand . We believe that it is making a significant contribution to the task of driving Britain out ofrecession . Republicans might argue that if the Monarchy brand is worth so much why do n't we just sell it to the highest bidder and reduce the national debt ? They might be right , but don'thold your breath for an IPO on Nasdaq ! <p> In conclusion , I would like to thank Clive Cheesman of The College of Arms , Charles Kydd and Liz Wyse of Debrett 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generously helped Brand Finance

##540251 You should email him story ideas . He 'll take anything . ) <p> Hosting the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup probably will bring tangible but small economic benefits to the SA economy . While stadium and transportation infrastructure construction provided the main boost prior to 2010 , we expect World Cup-related tourism inflows to boost this year 's real GDP by up to 0.5% . <p> Well , 0.5 per cent is nothing to be sniffed at compared to South Africa 's recent , and somewhat risk-prone , growth profile . But it 's rather hard to discern the blessings of Fifa elsewhere , according to Citi . Take infrastructure : <p> On balance , though , it appears that while non-negligible , the impact on the economy of World Cup-related investments should not be exaggerated . In particular , the size of these investments pales in comparison with the overall infrastructure build programme implemented in the public sector since 2006 , the bulk of which is carried out by the State and state-owned electricity utility Eskom . . . Equally important is the fact that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks of a sudden drop in construction and related activities now that pre-World Cup building is nearly over , are rather limited . <p> Shades of China in 2008 , of course . The Beijing Olympics were similarly a drop in the ocean of a far vaster emerging market and truly Olympian fixed capital growth . <p> As for the World Cup 's much-vaunted ' legacy ' -- unless a short-term jump in the rand from tourism inflows excites you , Citi 's note has relative disappointment in store for South Africa here , too . <p> None of this surprising , of course . Countries have long cared more for the symbolic capital and soft power of playing host to world sports

##564852 <h> Making contact <h> The email adviser <p> What do I write to someone I hardly know ? How can I tell whether we could be compatible ? And can you really flirt on email ? Here are some tips for your PARSHIP emails . <p> Well here we are , and there 's no gallant Cyrano de Bergerac on hand to take over the task of writing those delicate emails of courtship . But do n't worry , it 's not so difficult - and it 's lots of fun too . <h> It 's all about you <p> Focus on what it 's really all about . You want the recipient of your email to answer you and to find out whether the two of you are on the same wavelength . If you keep that in mind you will avoid major gaffes , such as an email of this kind : " Hi , sweetheart . Why not send me your photo ? " An in-your-face message of that kind is hardly like to elicit a positive response - and , what 's more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a PARSHIP survey of 800 members , the first emails you send should indicate that you are genuinely interested in the other person . For 43% of respondents this was much more important than the length or originality of the correspondence . Admittedly , the two of you do n't know each other yet , but if you take a good look at someone 's PARSHIP profile it can give you all sorts of starting points . Latch onto the details that catch your imagination and ask some questions . <h> More about me <p> Of course you should talk about yourself in your emails too , but if you are in any doubt it 's better to say too little than too much - and it 's better to make the person curious than to bore him or her . Avoid drawing attention to your real or imagined flaws and failings , but it 's also not a good idea to list all your life 's achievements . Standard emails that you send to various recipients are acceptable when you launch a correspondence - as long as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , a standard email could contain some more questions in the style of PARSHIP 's ' About me ' page , along with your own answers . You should keep ' streams of consciousness ' to a minimum ( " ... it would be nice to have a horse again , mmm , I 'm hungry now and I 'm going to make myself something nice to eat , though I would n't mind losing a bit of weight , not that I think I 'm fat or anything ... " ) They key is to think in terms of a dialogue rather than a monologue . <h> Enter into a dialogue <p> If two people are going to tune into each other online , a certain amount of intuition needs to come into play . You do n't have any expressions or body language to work with , just the written word . You should start off by playing things safe as you get a sense of each other . Keep things brief to start with , so , if it does n't lead anywhere , you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer before starting work on the next email . If you particularly like something in an email that you 've received , reinterpret it and re-use it in your own way . <p> Has the other person asked you questions ? Then it 's obvious how you should try and reply . If you think a certain question is jumping the gun , say why you do n't want to answer it for the moment . And if something the other person writes bothers you , ask them about it . It might just be a misunderstanding . A useful tip : draft your mails in Word rather than directly in the email format . Check the spelling and then just copy the text into the PARSHIP messaging system . <h> Flirting by email <p> If you really want to spoil the mood , express a lack of confidence in Internet dating or in yourself ... " Actually , I do n't think you can get to know someone over the internet . There 's something the matter with all the men/women on here , " while a sentence like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come from the heart , but also might prompt the recipient to wonder what the problem is , and it 's not so easy to get excited about someone you feel sorry for . Getting to know each other by email works in a similar way to real life ... Look for points in common , pay the other person compliments ( though do n't overdo them ) and adopt a tone that 's light and witty rather than heavy or suggestive . If you both enjoy cakes and Jodie Foster movies , those are better topics of conversation than past relationships of your sexual desires . The same would apply in a real-life context . <h> From the inside out <p> Another member appeals to you , but email banter is n't your thing , or maybe you 're at risk of throwing yourself too far into it and giving too much away . In both cases , you should look to arrange a meeting as soon as possible after your first exchange of emails . On the other hand , if you 've found a nice person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by email . Members have described the PARSHIP experience as ' getting to know someone from the inside out ' . You can enjoy telling your best stories again ( " Why I collect coffee pots , " " Why I teach physics " , " Why I called my daughter Alexandra " ) - you can expect the relevant questions to be asked . And check your email impressions of the other person by 
##569152 <p> The road from Cairo to Alexandria is lined with mega-farms growing strawberries , mangos and citrus fruit bound for foreign shores . In what was desert just decades ago , luxury produce now sprouts from the ground . <p> The greening of this arid landscape was part of ambitious government plans to sustainably increase Egypt ' s cultivated territory by turning swaths of sand into fertile earth . Water and other resources , which had sustained generations of farmers , were diverted away from the fields of the Nile Valley . <p> " But it 's not a question of just putting water on the desert and making it bloom , " says Richard Tutwiler , director of the Desert Development Centre at the American University in Cairo . " It takes a lot to make sand fertile . " It took the construction of canals from the river to carry billions of cubic metres of water and tonnes of fertiliser to make the desert green , and , Tutwiler says , " most of the expenses were incurred by the government " . <p> Eventually Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , the amount of food it produces . Despite this , most Egyptians still survive on cheap bread , not strawberries , and the country consumes near double the amount of wheat per capita as Italy . With a population of 85 million , Egyptians eat 15m tonnes of the grain each year . <p> In the 1960s Egypt grew enough wheat to feed its population of 26 million on the 3.5% of its land -- lining the banks of the Nile and north coast -- that is naturally arable . While the amount of cultivated land has increased by a quarter , the area seeded with wheat has decreased , and Egypt is now the world 's largest importer of the grain , buying 10m tonnes per year from the volatile international food markets . <p> Steered by the liberalisation schemes of the US Agency for International Development and the IMF in 1990s , Egypt implemented a plan to transform its farming sector from domestic supplier to competitive exporter . Some say this has come at the cost of food security . Instead of seeding the newly greened desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclaimed land was given to businessmen who cultivated cash crops for export . <p> In theory , the money earned from these exports would be used to buy less expensive goods , such as wheat , on the international market , while also creating jobs . Instead , investors built heavily mechanised mega-farms , providing few jobs and little food for domestic consumption . At the same time , allegations emerged that some international loans were being diverted away from development work . <p> " The economy at large was growing but it was not trickling down , " says Magda Kandil , of the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies . " The intention was to increase growth , and we did , but in the absence of regulation corruption prevailed and it made this growth very much clustered among a few individuals . " <p> Under Hosni Mubarak 's regime , corruption -- much of which involved land deals -- combined with aggressive economic liberalisation to favour the business class . This contributed to already increasing economic disparity , pushing the number of Egyptians who live on less than $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 . <p> When former Egyptian agriculture minister Yousef Wali was arrested in his Cairo villa last July , he joined other former officials to be detained and charged since Mubarak 's ousting . Wali is charged with illegally selling government land in a 2006 deal that saw thousands of hectares of public land near Luxor transferred into the hands of a businessman close to Mubarak . <p> Farmers ' unions , meanwhile , have been weakened to the point of futility , says Adel William , founder of Sons of the Soil , an organisation of farmers who joined anti-government protests last year . " We can not even fight for our rights because we are not allowed to organise , " he says . <p> The previous government offered minimal support to farmers , William says . Egypt 's agricultural subsidies are meagre , equalling 2% of national farm receipts , compared to OECD countries , whose subsidies average around 30% . Millions gave up on the land and searched for urban wages . A quarter of Egyptians who now live in cities were born in rural areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Migration Studies . <p> Sami Saleh is among the near 5 million people to migrate to Cairo . He once grew wheat and corn on his family 's land in Fayoum , about 130km southwest of the capital . Now , the 41-year-old father of four works as a labourer and night watchman at a construction site . <p> " The fertiliser and water became too expensive and too scarce and the profits too little , " says Saleh , standing outside the one-room , plywood shack where he now lives with his family . His monthly income of $80 is not enough to feed his family a simple diet of fava beans , bread and vegetables . Saleh says he borrows money to put food on the table . <p> Like 80% of Egyptians , Saleh and his family depend on subsidised bread . These subsidies cost the government as much as $2.3bn per year . To mitigate this expense , the government paid farmers too little for their wheat , says Kandil . Many farmers could not make a profit and stopped planting Egypt 's staple grain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the demand continued to increase and Egypt went from self-sufficiency to importing 60% of its wheat , hooking it into the unstable international market and eroding food security . In the end it was skyrocketing global wheat prices that exposed the flaw in the system . The international market price of wheat doubled between 2006 and 2008 and the cost of bread jumped when the Egyptian government did n't increase grain subsides to cover the difference . Riots broke out in bread lines and at least five Egyptians died in clashes . <p> When protesters took to the streets of Egypt in January 2010 , they had three key demands : " Bread , Freedom and Justice . " While none have been delivered , food prices have increased , putting basic staples out of reach for even more Egyptians . " Clearly there should be an incentive system in place . Food security has become a dominant factor in domestic issues in Egypt , " Kandil says .

##581151 <h> What to expect from the Czech presidential election <p> For the first time in their history , Czech citizens will directly elect their president next year , to replace the notoriously Eurosceptic incumbent Vaclav Klaus . The stakes are high in this election , for it will be a large-scale stress test for Czech democracy and European integration in Central Europe . <p> Vladimir Franz , one of the eleven candidates to run for the Czech presidency . Demotix/Frantisek Gela . All rights reserved . <p> In the first ever direct presidential election , the Czechs will head to the polls in January to elect their future head of state . The list of official candidates , who met the legal conditions to enter the presidential race , consists of eleven names , ranging from former prime ministers and members of parliament to an artist and an actress . However , as the powers of the president are limited , opinion polls show that the aptitude of the presidential candidate to represent the country abroad is one of the most important aspects in the decision-making of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle will replace the current president Vaclav Klaus , whose second and final term ends on 7 March . Klaus is a staunch Eurosceptic known for his rhetorical attacks on European integration , long reluctance to sign the Lisbon Treaty and his remarks about the non-existence of anthropogenic global warming - he also infamously declared that he " knew no dirty money " . The president 's cynical statements have upset many Czechs and some even claim to be ashamed of their head of state -- this partly explains why most voters seem to put so much emphasis on the " representativeness " capacity of the candidates . The presidential elections will indicate whether the Czechs want another EU-bashing president to represent them abroad or whether they wish to change the Eurosceptic tone that has emanated from Prague Castle for the last ten years . <h> The emphasis on the EU and foreign relations <p> The direct presidential election is an opportunity for Czech think-tanks and non-governmental organizations to initiate a wider discussion about the role of the president within the governmental structure and about the particular visions of individual candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to directly engage the voters in public presidential debates , where candidates presented their standpoints on various topics and then answered questions from the audience . <p> The first debate with candidates was prepared by Prague Pride , a non-profit association organizing the annual " queer pride festival " in the streets of Prague . The debate was dedicated to the discussion of human rights , social tolerance and LGBT rights . The second debate was organized by Glopolis , a think-tank devoted to the study of sustainable development , globalization and climate change . The focal point of the debate was Czech relations with the EU and Czech national interests . Candidates discussed their strategic views vis--vis the EU and their visions of Czech foreign policy . The same topics were at the centre of debates organized by the Association for International Affairs or by the anti-EU civic association Akce D.O.S.T . ( loosely translated " Action Enough " ) , of which the latter concentrated on the prospective loss of Czech sovereignty in the face of deeper integration in the EU . The Vaclav Havel Library also prepared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " The Czechoslovakian Presidential Tradition " , however most of the talking revolved , again , around Czech relations with the EU . The most publicized and latest presidential debate was prepared by the liberal think-tank European Values , which asked the candidates to present their " European visions " . The Prague Security Studies Institute in cooperation with Charles University is planning another presidential debate to take place at the end of November -- once more focused on Czech foreign policy . <p> The thematic focus of the debates seem to imply that foreign policy and Czech relations with the EU will play a vital part in the elections . However , such an assumption would be myopic . The reasons for the predominantly foreign relations-oriented debates are diverse . <p> First of all , the Czech president has limited influence on internal affairs . Although he holds more powers than his counterparts in Austria or Germany , the bulk of internal decision-making rests in the hands of the prime minister and his ministries . Nevertheless , the Czechs have a tendency to overlook some of the president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state . Yet , the president names board members of the central bank , judges of the constitutional court and ministers and accepts their resignations . In the democratic process , these powers may turn out to be decisive in many aspects . Czech history provides an example -- when postwar president Edvard Benes accepted the resignation of twelve ministers in 1948 , the act cleared the way for the Communist party to fill the vacated ministries and facilitated the takeover of the country -- the so-called Czech coup . Most recently , given the success of the Communist Party in this year 's regional elections , the Czechs are curious whether presidential candidates might potentially name a government which would include communist ministers . Some candidates have stated that not naming such a government would be unconstitutional , while others have rejected the idea . <p> Secondly , most Czech think-tanks are foreign-policy oriented and thus the debates are organized rather along the themes of the EU and national interests . In this sense , Czech civil society needs more think-tanks which actively focus on internal affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vaclav Havel . Havel was a well-known and respected figure around the world and helped the new country gain a firm posture in the international community . He emphasized the spread of democracy and the promotion of human rights , addressed a joint session of the US Congress and was a close friend of the Dalai Lama . Havel is the symbol of Czech statehood and , along with the first president of Czechoslovakia Tomas Garrigue Masaryk , he is considered one of the most prominent figures in modern Czech history . It seems that the Czechs will always have the tendency to measure their future presidents against the backdrop of Havel and Masaryk . But it is important to note that the two have assumed presidency in the midst of revolutionary moments fueled by national pride -- Masaryk became the president of a newly established Czechoslovakia , free from the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and Havel helped overthrow communist rule . Such historical moments commonly generate national symbols and outstanding personalities , whose actions become immortal and almost mythical . So , understandably , none of the current candidates has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future president has the opportunity to continue in the tradition of Havel and Masaryk and become a respected representative of the Czech Republic in the EU and the world . <p> So what are the perspectives of individual candidates on the EU and the world ? Perhaps the only candidate who would follow in the Eurosceptic footsteps of Vaclav Klaus is Jana Bobosikova , who in 2002 established the Eurosceptic party Suverenita ( Sovereignty ) . The party nominee of the Civic Democrats ( the former party of Klaus ) and former president of the Senate , Premysl Sobotka , seems to share some views with the current president . During the campaign , however , he appeared more moderate in tone . On the other side of the spectrum stand Jiri Dienstbier and Zuzana Roithova . Dienstbier , the nominee of the Social Democrats , claims that the remarks of Klaus are discrediting the Czech Republic in the eyes of the EU -- as a result , Europe perceives the country rather more as a " troublemaker " than a partner . He calls for deeper integration , supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU and proposed the creation of a second chamber of the European parliament . Roithova , Christian Democratic Union nominee and member of the European Parliament , is considered to be one of the most " euro-optimist politicians in the Czech Republic " . <p> The rest of the candidates seem to be between these two opposite poles -- they promote cooperation with the EU and do not oppose further integration if Czech national interests are protected . Former prime minister of the caretaker government Jan Fischer is proposing a concept of " flexible integration " , which aims to reconcile different views of individual EU member-states on the appropriate scope and depth of integration , while Minister of Foreign Affairs and candidate of the TOP 09 party Karel Schwarzenberg claims he will restore Czech dignity and respect within the EU . Former prime minister Milos Zeman , for example , asserted that he would support the idea of a European federation and a unitary European army , which , according to his words , would be more effective . <h> Challenges facing the direct election <p> The constitutional act which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally acclaimed by the public . As presidential campaigns gain momentum , however , certain unforeseen challenges face the election . Commentators argue that the legislation guiding presidential campaigns is shallow and vague . To be eligible to run for president , candidates were obliged to hand in petitions signed either by fifty thousand citizens , twenty deputies or ten senators . Critics claim that citizens ' signatures are easily falsifiable and that a sample of signatories should be personally contacted to confirm their signature . The law only orders the Ministry of Interior to prove the mere existence of the signatories on the basis of the census . ( At the time of writing , the Ministry is in the process of vetting the petitions . However , some sources have already reported that nearly half of all the signatures may be invalid . The Ministry will announce the final results of the vetting process on 23 November . ) <p> The main point of concern is the transparency of campaign funding . The law states that all candidates must create a transparent bank account and disclose all revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty million Czech crowns ( 1.6 million euros ) on their campaign in the first round and ten million ( 400 thousand euros ) in the second round . However , the law does not clearly specify as to when a campaign officially starts and does not pose clear sanctions for breaching the given rules . Some of the campaigns have set up their offices and begun renting billboards already during the summer , but the official start of the campaigns is often interpreted as the moment candidates handed in their petitions ( 6 November ) . Therefore , some of the candidates started disclosing their finances later than others . <p> One of the first candidates to disclose campaign contributions and spending was Jan Fischer , who has done so in July and was followed by others such as Vladimir Dlouhy and Milos Zeman . Nevertheless , speculations have arisen as to whether candidates faithfully disclose every donor and every crown spent . In reaction , the Czech office of Transparency International and the non-governmental organization Nasi Politici ( Our Politicians ) have decided to step in and closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar regulatory agency as for example the US Federal Election Commission . <p> According to current polling data , Jan Fischer and Milos Zeman will be the two candidates likely to advance to the second round . Both are estimated to have a 25-30 percent support among voters . Third place seems to be constantly shifting between Karel Schwarzenberg , Jiri Dienstbier , the candidate of Japanese descent Tomio Okamura and the eccentric artist Vladimir Franz -- at this moment all would receive around six percent of the vote . The Communist party , despite its success in the October regional elections , has not nominated a candidate from amongst its ranks . <p> The role of Vladimir Franz in the election is worth mentioning . For most Czech citizens he is an unacceptable presidential candidate -- his entire body , including face , is covered in tattoos . Franz has a law degree , but he is mostly associated with theatre and the arts . Most young voters , however , are poised to vote for Franz as a protest against the current political establishment tarnished by corruption scandals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political proclamations , but we are yet to see how his campaign evolves . He claims that it was not his proper intention to run for the office , but that he was persuaded by the massive support of the people . Tana Fischerova , an actress and former deputy , chose a similar approach to her campaign . <p> In fact , this is the model other candidates wish to offer to the Czech voter . Five of the eleven candidates are independents and distance themselves and their campaigns from political parties . Even the party-nominated candidates avoid mentioning their party affiliations and attempt to present themselves as disengaged from the party structure . The Czech voter is dismayed by the oscandals , political bickering and elitism of the ruling parties and in that sense a campaign which is independent from party politics appears as a logical step to attract voters . <p> The first direct presidential election in the Czech Republic will demonstrate how mature Czech democracy is after 23 years of freedom from communist rule . The election will be closely monitored by the press and non-governmental organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite its alleged vagueness . Still , future elections are needed to provide deeper experience with the processes of direct presidential elections . Knowledge of the mistakes from the first election will aid in enhancing future legislation guiding presidential elections . Think-tanks will develop skills to lead presidential debates and choose the right debating topics . Analysts and commentators will distinguish which aspects of individual campaigns need to receive more scrutiny . In addition , the distrustful public will simply need to get used to what is basically " American-style campaigning " ( i.e. ceaseless campaign fundraising ) -- a novelty in the Czech context . <p> Even before the race is actually over , one fact is certain . The ever-Eurosceptic Vaclav Klaus is leaving Prague Castle and the claims of all front-running candidates indicate that they will choose a

##587952 <p> The reigning RBS 6 Nations champions lost two more forwards from their autumn games - lock Alun-Wyn Jones ( shoulder ) and flanker Josh Turnbull ( knee ligaments ) - after prop Adam Jones and back-row star Dan Lydiate were sidelined last month . <p> Centre Jonathan Davies ' ongoing battle with groin trouble , meanwhile , means he is still unable to train fully with the Wales squad . But former Wales captain Ryan Jones and centre Roberts , who have 112 caps between them , could both make the starting line-up when it is announced on Wednesday lunchtime . <p> And that would be music to interim head coach Rob Howley 's ears as Wales target a first victory since they beat the Barbarians more than five months ago . <p> " I hope to play against Samoa , fingers crossed , but I have to go through the protocols , " said Roberts , who was concussed following a clash of heads with Argentina 's Gonzalo Tiesi midway through the first half of last Saturday 's 26-12 defeat gainst the Pumas . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken good care of me .

" <p> Wignall , still living just outside Nottingham after serving Forest and Derby either side of a prolific but brief Molineux career made up of 36 appearances and 16 goals , remains a keen watcher of the professional game , albeit mainly on TV . <p> And he has a fond memory of the time he played for Ronnie Allen 's Wolves against Forest near the end of the 1967-68 top-flight campaign . <p> " I recall driving towards Wolverhampton for the game and following a coach-load of Forest supporters , " he added . <p> " They were making various gestures at me and suggesting , with use of their fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But we had one of those days when everything seemed to go right and I got myself a couple of goals in a 6-1 victory . <p> On the prowl with Wolves in a game at Coventry in 1968 . <p> " Would you believe it -- I came up behind the same supporters ' coach on the way home ! <p> " They were n't quite as cocky then and let 's just say I took a little bit of revenge !

##590352 <h> Secondary menu <h> Search form <h> India at the UN Climate negotiations : back to the wall <p> Of all the baffling going-ons at the recent climate change conference in Durban , what bewildered me most was the position of India . As traditional alliances appeared to fade and new emerge , India appeared allied to the blockers rather than the movers . <p> During the weeks preceding Durban , it was clear that Brazil , South Africa , India and China -- often referred to as the BASIC countries -- would come under pressure from the European Union to agree to take on legally-binding commitments in the near future . This was one EU pre-condition for keeping the Kyoto Protocol ( and hence legally binding emission cuts by some developed countries ) alive . <p> In response , Indian Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan made it clear that India would push for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol for developed countries , but that it was opposed to any new treaty or agreement with cuts for developing countries . <p> At a media briefing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding agreement can not be a quid-pro quo for a second commitment period . Can not . Should not . A new legally binding agreement is not required for climate change talks to continue , because a framework based on the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities already exists in the form of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol . " <p> Equity was the basis of this position -- developed countries had not gone far enough to cover their share of responsibility , and developing countries like India needed space to grow . However , not all was clear with the Indian position at this stage . For instance , would India be willing to sign on to post-2020 commitments if developed countries agreed to a second commitment period for Kyoto , and if the commitments were based on an equitable framework ? <p> China , meanwhile , had a very similar position to India . It came out clearly in advance of Durban stating that if developed countries agreed to a second commitment period , it was not averse to legally binding obligations as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities written into the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , which calls for developed nations to act first and fastest . <p> India : poor communicator at Durban <p> This lack of clarity or poor communication , call it what you will , resulted in all the difference at Durban . While China was viewed as open and willing , India was painted the grim reaper who , along with US , Canada and Japan , was signing the death warrant for poor African countries . <p> The EU , meanwhile , teamed up with the vulnerable countries , including the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries . They sent out a joint statement calling for countries to develop a legally-binding instrument applicable to all countries , respecting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities . EU climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard held a press conference saying half of the BASIC countries were on board with this proposal . She made it clear India was not , and implied that the Indian position was unreasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these allegations . " India is asking for space for basic development for its people and poverty eradication . Is this an unreasonable demand ? " she rightly asked . " She said she could not " sign away the rights of 1.2 billion people and many other people in the developing world , " by agreeing to something that could limit their ability to grow . <p> But , given that Natarajan also said equity had to be " the centerpiece of the climate discussion and our negotiations should be built on it , " why did she agree to launch a process to develop another legal instrument or a legal outcome under the Convention applicable to all Parties , without a specific demand that this outcome incorporates equity or a reference to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities ? <p> The difference in legal terms between an agreed outcome with legal force and a legally binding instrument will be argued in the weeks , months and years to come , but if a legal outcome had to be conceded , why could it not at least include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused much of the pollution affecting the poorest countries like India -- to act first ? <p> The reference to the convention could be viewed as a very weak and roundabout reference to CBDR , but certainly not anywhere as strong as the Indian position on equity at the start of the Durban conference , and during the conference . Surely this was the time when a commitment to fairness and equity could be extracted in exchange ? What did India gain , in exchange for its concession to an agreed outcome with legal force ? <p> Slippery slope <p> As it is , the next four years during which the new outcome is to be negotiated will be extremely perilous for India 's 1.2 billion -- not to mention its poor , who number more than the populations of all the least developed countries put together . This is the slippery slope India feared . <p> What a far cry this is from the first climate conference in 1995 , when India cast her lot firmly with the countries most vulnerable to climate change and emerged a leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU . <p> Lack of clarity and poor communication has failed to highlight either India 's more vulnerable position , or limited contribution to emissions ( compared even to China ) to the global community . This , combined with the lack of proactively making equity central to the global negotiations , resulted in India 's isolation and defeat at Durban . <p> Sure , India 's emissions have gone up -- but as Sivan Kartha from the Stockholm Environment Institute pointed out , it still has much more in common with poor and vulnerable region of Africa than the other countries it was unfortunately identified with in Durban . If Africa 's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are only 1/6th of an Americans , then India 's are only 1/10th . If 17 Africans live on the income of one American , then India is not much better off -- 16 Indians live on the income of one American . Natarajan 's predecessor Jairam Ramesh stated in the Foreword to a recent book that " there is no country more vulnerable to climate change than India , on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , India missed a real opportunity to re-align itself with the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change at the UN Climate talks in Durban , as it has done in the past . Perhaps a more positive position that made it clear that India was not afraid of commitments in the future as long as they were grounded strongly in equity , responsibility and capability , would have resulted in a slightly different outcome . <p> Other than Natarajan 's sporadically splendid rhetoric , India had its back to the wall at Durban . It will continue to do so for the next four years or more , unless it can come up with a proactive , considered and workable proposal on how the outcome with legal force can still deliver the global equity 
##591452 <h> Get tips by email <p> In Lion there is a cool hidden setting to enable " Now playing " notifications that appear from the iTunes icon in the Dock . Every time a new song starts , a small popup containing the artist and the song name appears and then slowly fades out after a few seconds . <p> To enable this , start by opening Terminal ( located in Applications/Utilities ) , then paste in the following line and press Return . <p> defaults write com.apple.dock itunes-notifications -bool YES <p> For the changes to take effect , the Dock has to be restarted . The easiest way to do this is to type killall Dock into the Terminal and press Return . If you change your mind and want to disable the notifications , repeat the above commands , but replace YES with NO . <p> For those of you who have your Dock set to hide when not in use , you 'll notice that when the Dock is hidden the iTunes icon is added to the notification . If you want the icon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the following command in the same way as above : <p> As before , remember to restart the Dock with killall Dock for changes to take effect . <p> It 's not entirely clear why this setting is n't present in the iTunes preferences . It might still be under development -- there is still room for improvement . For example it would be better if it included the album artwork like Bowtie , Growl and DockArt already do . It could also be a sneak peak of future plans Apple has for a notifications framework for all apps in Mac OS X , much like Growl provides at the moment . <p> Every time Apple brings out a new version of OS X , we compile a list of our favourite Terminal commands for enabling hidden features and changing hidden settings ( here are the lists for Tiger and Leopard ) . <p> For those who are new to Terminal Commands , here 's a quick run down of how to use them . Do n't worry , it 's really easy . Start by opening up Terminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the window that appears , paste in one of the lines provided below , and then hit Return . For the changes to take effect , you need to restart the application concerned . For applications like the Dock or Finder , it is easiest to just type killall Dock or killall Finder into the Terminal to restart them . To reverse the changes , you just need to change the last word of the command and run it again . If the last word is YES , change it to NO , change 1 to 0 , and change TRUE to FALSE and vice versa for all . <h> 1 . Folder previews in Quick Look <p> This is my favourite hidden feature in Snow Leopard . When enabled , using Quick Look ( hit the space bar ) on a folder will show you a preview of the folder 's contents inside a translucent folder icon . The previews of the files inside the folder also cycle through so you can see all of them . Just use the following command : <p> &lt;code&gt;defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders 1&lt;/code&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by typing killall Finder into the Terminal or by Control-Option-clicking on the Finder in the Dock and choosing Relaunch . <h> 2 . Globally enable Text Substitutions <p> You may have realised that the new text substitutions feature in Snow Leopard is n't enabled in all applications by default , most noticeably in Safari . To enable it , you need to right-click on a text box and choose Substitutions then Show Substitutions . To globally enable text substitutions , use the following three commands one at a time . The first one will enable substitutions , while the second will enable dash replacement and the third will enable spell checking . <p> If you decide there are some specific applications where you want to disable these again , you can do it in the normal way . As always you will need to restart each application for the changes to take effect . <h> 3 . Bring back AppleScript Studio palette <p> As of Snow Leopard , AppleScript Studio has be deprecated in favour of AppleScriptObjC . You can still work on AppleScript Studio projects , but you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interface Builder is gone . To bring it back , use the following command : <h> 4 . Disable " focus follows mouse " in Terminal <p> In Leopard there was a Terminal command to make the Terminal 's window focus change with mouse movement . If you had previously enabled this , you will find things do n't work quite right in Snow Leopard when you use Command-Tab to switch between applications in different spaces . To fix this , you will need to disable the focus follows mouse behaviour using the following command : <p> defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -string NO <h> 5 . Force Dictionary to only use one window <p> If you are n't a fan of using Command-Control-D to quickly look up definitions , you might use the " Look up in Dictionary " contextual menu item or Services menu item . In Snow Leopard , each word you look up using these methods opens in a new Dictionary window , which gets a bit annoying . To make each word you look up open in the same window , just use the following command : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button in iTunes <p> With the release of iTunes 9 , Apple messed around a bit with the behaviour of the green zoom button in iTunes . Things are back to normal as of iTunes 9.01 , but briefly the green button maximised the window instead of switching to the mini-player . If you liked the temporary change , you can bring it back using the following command : <p> defaults write com.apple.iTunes zoom-to-window -bool YES <p> Of course , you can always get the alternative behaviour by holding the Option key and clicking in the green button . <h> 7 . Debug menu in Address Book <p> The debug menu has been available in Address Book for some time , but there are some new additions in Snow Leopard . If you do n't already have it enabled , the command is : <p> defaults write com.apple.AddressBook ABShowDebugMenu -bool true <p> Restart Address Book , and then click Debug in the menu bar to see the new options . You can enable reflections under contacts pictures , get to the " People Picker Panel " and enable a debug panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Autoplay movies in QuickTime X <p> One of the weird things about the new version of QuickTime is that it has no Preferences . Luckily you can still change things using the Terminal . To make a movie automatically start playing when you open it , use the following command : <p> defaults write **26;1722;TOOLONG MGPlayMovieOnOpen 1 <h> 9 . Keep QuickTime in full screen when switching applications <p> If you are watching a movie in full screen in QuickTime and you use Command-Tab to switch to another application then the movie will automatically exit full screen . To make it stay full screen in the background , use the following command : <h> 12 . Automatically show closed captioning and subtitles on opening <h> 13 . Make list view stacks work like grid view Stacks <p> This command slightly changes the behaviour in Stacks in list view . Once enabled , they act more like grid view Stacks , but with a single list of files and icons on the left . The main difference is when " drilling-down " through folders within the Stack . <p> defaults write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dock for changes to take effect . The easiest way is to use killall Dock in the Terminal . <h> 14 . Enable mouseover highlight in stacks <p> If you want items in grid view stacks to highlight when you move the mouse over them , use the following command . It 's slightly different from the equivalent in Leopard . Also , note that you can get the highlight behaviour in Snow Leopard without using this command by using the arrow keys to select items in a stack , or by clicking and holding on a stack before dragging the mouse up onto the grid . <p> defaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilite-stack -boolean YES <p> You will need to restart the Dock for changes to take effect . The easiest way is to use killall Dock in the Terminal . <h> 15 . Set a precise screensaver password delay <p> A useful new feature of Snow Leopard is the ability to set how long your Mac is asleep or how long the screen saver is on before it requires a password to wake up again . You can access this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to choose a time period from a drop-down menu , and you ca n't enter your own custom time period . To do this , use the following command . The number at the end is the time in seconds . For example 1800 is 30 minutes , which bizarrely is n't an option in the drop-down menu . <p> One of the great features of Safari on the Mac is the way it handles a network outage . If you ? re somewhere with an unreliable connection , say because you ? re using a distant wireless network ( or if like me you live in Africa ) , then Safari will give you a message if it can ? ' t connect to the internet with a button to click to open the network diagnostics window . What ? ' s more , it automatically loads pages if the network becomes reconnected . <p> The diagnostics window is great because it gives you clear red/green indicator lights that show what ? s working and what isn ? t so you can quickly diagnose connection issues and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with the network . <p> But what if your favourite browser is Firefox or if you have to deal with tricky or unreliable network issues without using Safari ? Well , you don ? t need to go and use Safari , you can just open the Network Diagnostics application directly . The problem is , it ? s not in the Applications or Utilities folder , it ? s buried in **28;1750;TOOLONG . For a quick convenience diagnostics tool this is not so handy . <p> To make the Network Diagnostics application more accessible , first navigate to **28;1780;TOOLONG . Look in this folder for Network Diagnostics , and drag it to the Dock . Now , whenever you have problems connecting to the internet via an application other than Safari , you can simply click on the icon in the Dock to find out what 's wrong . <p> If you don ? t like a whole dock space being taken up with it , then you could make a shortcut to the application and add it to a folder of other applications stored in a neat stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to divide the applications in your Dock into groups , the best way is to add spacers . A common method is to create " fake " applications with an invisible icon to fill the space , but that is a bit inelegant . A much better way , available in Leopard , is to use a Terminal Command . Each time you run the command it inserts a blank " space " into your Dock , which you can then drag around to where you like . <p> Start by opening up Terminal , located in Applications/Utilities . Type the following line and then hit enter : <p> For the changes to take effect you will have to restart the Dock , either by logging out and in again or by running the killall Dock command in the Terminal . The spacer appears at the end of the icons that are permanently in the Dock . You can then drag it along to where you want it . <p> The above command inserts the spacer on the applications side of the Dock . To insert a spacer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As always , you will have to run killall Dock for changes to take effect . To add multiple spacers just run the command again and again . Note that you can use the " up " arrow in terminal to automatically enter the last run command . <p> If you want to remove a spacer , treat it like any other icon in the Dock . Either drag it off and let go to get a nice puff of smoke , or right-click on it and choose Remove from Dock . <p> If you have you Dock set to automatically show and hide , you make have noticed that occasionally it refuses to appear when you are dragging an icon onto it . This drives me crazy when I am trying to eject disk images . I drag the icon down to the bottom of the screen , but the Dock simply does n't appear . Normally my solution is to give up , right-click on the icon and choose eject , which takes far too long . While looking for a better way , I found a brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard shortcut Command-Option-D , which turns on/off Dock hiding . You do n't even have to stop dragging your icon to do this , and it works whatever application you are in . <p> Next time the Dock fails to appear , while still dragging your icon , simply hit Command-Option-D and the Dock should spring up . Drop your icon onto the trash ( or eject icon , or whatever you want ) , and then just hit Command-Option-D again to make the Dock disappear again . <p> Just as desktops get cluttered because they 're handy , and an easy place to put and find things , the Mac OS X Dock gets easily cluttered with every application that you might want to launch at the click of a button . A cluttered dock means it may take so long to find the ( tiny ) icon you 're looking for that you may as well have opened your application folder and searched through . But come to mention it , the Applications folder gets rather cluttered too . You can move things around , but so many programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there in the Applications folder . Is there a better way to group applications sensibly , without using any special software ? <p> With Leopard 's new Stacks feature , I believe there is . <p> 1 . Keep only 2 or 3 icons in the dock for applications like iCal , Safari and Mail that you access most frequently . <p> 2 . Then create theme-based folders for every other application you want close at hand . A stack is just a folder dragged onto the Dock , so we 'll create the folders first . Create folders somewhere , like your Applications folder or Documents folder . I have folders for ' Utilities ' , ' Internet ' , ' Media ' , and document creation . <p> 3 . Fill these folders with aliases of the appropriate applications . Do this by holding the Command and Option keys as you drag a file from the Applications folder to put an alias/shortcut of that file in the destination folder , instead of moving or copying it . <p> 4 . When you have filled your theme-based folders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downloads Stack and Trash ( but not IN the Trash ! ) In the past you would have had a bunch of identical folder icons there , but now the Stack takes on a conglomeration of icons from the contents of each folder . <p> 5 . Click once on a stack and it opens out quickly . Click once and you launch the application . Click the wrong stack by mistake ? Just click the one you want without having to click the first one closed . It 's one more click than having everything in the Dock separately , but since icons are grouped more logically and icons can be bigger , it 's actually miles more efficient . <p> 6 . But what to do with the special Apple icons ? Time Machine , Spaces , Dashboard and Expose all have Dock icons which are not normal applications . The good news is that you can get hold of them from the Applications folder and drop them in a Stack , then remove them from the Dock . After all , Time Machine is almost automatic , Spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conveniently anyway ( with the F8-12 keys ) so they 're just extra clutter . But it might be nice to keep the icons around . <p> NB : You do lose a little functionality that the Dock icons provide in their contextual menus if you follow this method , but nothing really significant in my eyes . Control-click on the dock icons before you delete them and see if you 'd really miss any of the functions there . Since 10.5.2 there 's a Time Machine menu item now , which gives you back any functionality lost with the demise of the Dock icon . That seems to make more sense anyway . <p> Finally , you can control-click on the stacks to change the order the icons are sorted , which may be helpful , and affects the order of the conglomerate icon visible on the Dock . <p> Here 's a quick tip about a keyboard shortcut new to Leopard ( OS X 10.5 ) that I did n't know about . <p> If you normally have Dock magnification turned off , holding Control and Shift while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as you let go of the keys , the magnification will turn back off again . <p> The Dock will magnify based on the settings in the Dock section of System Preferences , which you can only change when magnification is turned on . As a result you 'll have to turn it on , choose your preferred magnification level and turn it back off again . <p> The keyboard shortcut works the other way round too . If you normally have magnification on , holding Control and Shift will temporarily turn it off . <p> I 'm not sure how useful this feature is , but it 's interesting none the less . <p> There are many applications on your Mac that do n't need a Dock icon . Having a Dock icon for applications that are accessed through a menu bar item or constantly run in the background would just waste space and clutter up your Dock . Many applications like this automatically hide their Dock icon ( Google Notifier , Quicksilver ) however some do n't ( Launchbar , HardwareGrowler ) . <p> Luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dock icon yourself . To see if it is possible , right-click ( Control-click ) on the application icon . If " Show Package Contents " is in the menu that appears , you can hide the icon in the Dock . <p> If this is the case , select " Show Package Contents " and look for the " Info.plist " file inside the Contents folder . Open this file using TextEdit by right-clicking on it and choosing " Open With - Other " from the menu . <p> In the file , paste the following two lines just after &lt;dict&gt; on the 6th line : <p> **34;1810;TOOLONG **30;1846;TOOLONG <p> Save the file and close it . For the changes to take effect , you need to move the application to the desktop and them back to its original location ( OS X keeps a cache of the file , so you need to trick it into checking it again ) . <p> Now when you open the application , no icon will appear in the Dock . I would n't recommend doing this with your regular applications like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabling the menu bar . This means that you will have to quit the application using the keyboard shortcut Command-Q . If the application does n't have any windows , you will have to quit it from Activity Monitor ( in Applications/Utilities ) . <p> To bring back the Dock icon , simply open up the Info.plist file and remove the lines you added . <p> If you are too lazy to do this yourself , FoggyNoggin Software has created an application called Dock Dodger that automates the process . <p> You probably know that you can drag and drop chunks of text around Mac OS X. For example you could select and drag a paragraph from Safari to TextEdit . It 's also fairly well know that you can drag files onto application icons in the Dock to open them in that application . Less well known is what happens when you drag bits of text onto Dock icons . <p> Doing this with different applications will produce different results . If the application will accept the text , it will darken when you hold the selection over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in a certain format ( a web address for example ) . Here are the results with a few common applications . If you know of any more , add them in the comments . <p> 1 . Safari - If you drop a web address ( i.e. something that starts with http : // ) on Safari , it will load up that address . If you drag any other bit of text , it will perform a Google Search on it . This is mainly useful if the text is from a non-cocoa app that does n't have the " Search in Google " item in the right-click context menu . <p> 2 . Firefox - If dropped text is a web address , Firefox will load it . This is helpful if you want to view a site in a browser other than your default browser . <p> 3 . Mail - A new message will load up with the dropped text as the main message body . Annoyingly the text is placed in the body even if it is an email address . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document containing the dropped text . <p> 5 . Skype - If the dropped text is a phone number , Skype will call it . This will also work with nicknames in your contact list . <p> 6 . Script Editor - A new script window will open up containing the dropped text . Script Editor will then attempt to compile it . <p> 7. iTunes - If you drop a podcast address onto iTunes , it will subscribe to it . If the address is n't a podcast , iTunes will attempt to do it anyway ( and fail ) . <p> 10 . Stickies - This will make a new Stickies note containing the text open up . <p> 11 . Dictionary - This will show you the definition of the dropped word . If you drop a selection of words , Dictionary will display the definition of the first . ( In cocoa apps , it 's probably quicker to use this keyboard shortcut ) . <p> Most of these also work if you drag the text to the desktop to create a text clipping first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dock you can use the section to the right of the divider to store folders . Many people choose to put their user folder or Hard Drive here for easy access . One of the greatest benefits is that you can right click ( Control click ) on the icon to get a handy pop-up menu containing the contents of the folder . From here you can navigate through to any file contained within . <p> This works great , apart from with the Volumes folder . If you do n't already know , the Volumes folder contains your Hard Drive , CDs , DVDs , Disk Images , iPods , iDisks and any other mounted media devices . To get to this folder , choose " Go To Folder " from the Go menu and enter /Volumes . You 'll find that if you put this folder in the Dock you can still right-click to view the pop-up menu , however you ca n't navigate into any of the drives apart from your startup disk ( Probably Macintosh HD ) . <p> The work around for this involves creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop-up menu . Start by opening up Script Editor ( located in Application/AppleScript ) . Paste the following script into the window that appears : <p> property script folder : ( ( path to documents folder ) as string ) &; " Drives " on run tell application " Finder " if not ( exists alias scriptfolder ) then make folder at folder ( ( path to documents folder ) as string ) with properties name : " Drives " end if end tell Update ( ) end run on adding folder items to this folder after receiving addeditems Update ( ) end adding folder items to on removing folder items from this folder after losing theseitems Update ( ) end removing folder items from on Update ( ) tell application " Finder " set theFolder to folder scriptfolder delete every item of theFolder set theDisks to disks repeat with i in theDisks make new alias at theFolder to i end repeat end tell end Update <p> Click Compile ( the Hammer icon ) and then click Run . The first time you run this script it will create a folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alias to every drive in it . You can drag this to your Dock and you will have a Drive pop-up menu that allows you to navigate through all of your mounted media . However , the list in the menu only updates when the script is run . This is where Folder Actions come in to make the script run every time a new drive is mounted or a drive is removed . <p> Save the script to your desktop and then go to your user folder and navigate to Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/ . You may need to create these folders if they do n't already exist . Drag your script from your desktop over to here . Now we have to attach it to the Volumes folder . <p> As described earlier , to get to the Volumes folder choose " Go To Folder " from the Go menu and enter /Volumes . Right click ( Control Click ) on the icon and choose " Enable Folder Actions " ( If folder actions are already enabled this will say disable - do n't click it ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action " . Choose the script you saved earlier . <p> If you have n't already dragged the " Drives " folder from your Documents folder to the Dock , do so , and then you 're done . Note that every time the list updates it moves the old list to the Trash , so if you insert and remove CDs , external Hard Drives , iPods etc. often , the Trash will get quite full . You might also want to change the icon of the Drives folder to something a bit nicer than the standard folder icon . <p> One of the comments on the Terminal Commands tip pointed out something I have never heard of before . Although it is entirely useless , ( a lot of the stuff on this site is ) I thought it was a nice trick : <p> They mentioned the killall Dock thing ... if you hold shift and collapse a window it goes slowly into the dock . if you do a killall Dock command in the terminal while it 's collapsing , the window freezes in it 's squished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and click links ( although the links will be in their original location ) . SleepingInsomniac Homepage 03.21.07 - 4:42 am # <p> This is great fun , and also a little weird . As mentioned , you will need to press Shift while clicking minimize to slow things down and give you enough time to run the command . Have Terminal open with " killall Dock " ready typed so you just have to press enter . When the Dock relaunches , your currently minimizing window gets stuck half way , but is still treated like a normal window . Drag it around , scroll up and down , browse web pages . It 's not perfect however - as SleepingInsomniac notes , the links on web pages are still where they were before you minimized , making things a bit confusing . <p> Check out the image below to get an idea of what it looks like . <p> To get your windows back to normal you just need to close ( Command-W ) and reopen them . <p> Update : This article is very old . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our top Terminal commands for Leopard and Snow Leopard . Our Terminal Tips category also has loads of other ways help you get the most out of your Mac . <p> There are a huge amount of hidden settings for Mac OS X and its applications that are n't accessible from preferences dialog boxes or the System Preferences . Applications such as Tinkertool and Mac Pilot allow you to access some of these , but the real flexibility is from the Terminal . From here it is possible to edit any preferences file for any application on your Mac . <p> You 'll find the Terminal in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder . To carry out any of the following commands you will need to copy/paste or type in the line of text then hit enter . For the most part , applications will need restarting before changes take place . For most applications you can just quit and open them again , but for the Finder and the Dock it is easiest to just type " killall Finder " or " killall Dock " into Terminal after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat the command with NO at the end instead of YES , or vice versa . <p> Feel free to add any of your favourites in the comments . <p> 1 . Make hidden applications ' dock icons translucent . <p> defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES <p> 2 . Normally the arrows next to artists and albums in your iTunes library search the iTunes store when you click them . This command changes them so that clicking will search your iTunes library instead . <p> defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks -bool YES <p> 3 . This allows you to drag widgets out of Dashboard onto the desktop . Requires the dock to be relaunched to take effect , so type " killall Dock " and press enter . Now , if you click and hold onto a widget in the dashboard and press F12 to return to the desktop , the widget wo n't disappear with the rest . <p> defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES <p> 4 . Force all mail to be displayed as plain text . <p> defaults write com.apple.mail PreferPlainText -bool YES <p> 5 . Set expanded save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a drop down menu ) . Replace TRUE with FALSE to reverse . <p> defaults write -g **34;1878;TOOLONG -bool YES <p> 6 . Display the currently chosen screen saver to be shown as the desktop background . Press Control-C or Command-. to stop . More details here . <p> Here 's a quick tip . Normally to make an application load at login , you have to open up System Preferences , go to Accounts and add a new login item . To quickly skip this stage out , right click on an application in your dock , go to options , then choose " Open at Login " . To undo this , just repeat the process . <p> I know a lot of people who use only use the minimize function to hide windows that they are n't currently using . I really do n't like this , as it 's not really usable via the keyboard , and it does n't work well with the Command-Tab application switcher . Instead , I use the hide function by pressing Command-H to hide active application . That is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to see the application underneath , or the desktop . This can also be achieved by choosing hide from the menu with the name of the application . To show the windows again , just click the application icon in the Dock , or switch back to the application by using the Command-Tab switcher . <p> One drawback of this method is that there is no way to tell that an application is hidden by looking at the dock . Unlike when you minimize , the windows do n't appear on the right-hand side of the Dock . The application icon also remains fully visible , unchanged from when the application was in view . With lots of applications open , it gets quite hard to tell which applications are hidden and which are n't . <p> By modifying a hidden setting , you can make the Dock show which applications are hidden by displaying them as a semi-transparent icon . To do this , open up the Terminal ( located in Applications/Utilities ) , paste in the the following line and press Return . <p> defaults write com.apple.Dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to relaunch the Dock . There are a few ways of doing this , but seeing as we are already in the Terminal , the quickest way is to just type killall Terminal followed by Return . <p> To cancel this change , and return the icons to normal , repeat the above command in the terminal , but replace YES with NO . <p> It 's not hard to notice that Right-Clicking ( Control-Clicking ) on an item in the Dock brings up a menu with the option to " show in Finder " , which essentially opens up the enclosing folder of that Application or File . <p> Less obviously , Command-Clicking on an icon in the Dock will do just the same . But it does n't end there . Command clicking has a similar effect when clicking icons in other places . <p> For instance , in the title bar of any cocoa app , you will see the name and icon of the open file . Command-Clicking on the icon brings up a list of all the enclosing folders . <p> Another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command clicking spotlight results . This one is especially useful , as the other option ( clicking on show all , finding the result , right-clicking and selecting show in finder ) takes a long while in comparison . <p> Do you ever accidentally click the wrong icon when choosing an application from the dock ? Normally this wastes valuable seconds waiting for the application to launch and then choose quit . However there is a nice shortcut . <p> Do you ever accidentally click the wrong icon when choosing an application from the dock ? Normally this wastes valuable seconds waiting for the application to launch and then choose quit . However there is a nice shortcut . <p> As soon as you have clicked the wrong icon , right click on it , and select force quit . This will allow you to kill it before it slows down your system . <p> If you are n't quite as quick , and the application has started loading , sometimes the contextual menu will say quit instead of force quit . To get around this , hold the option key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here 's a neat trick that is fairly pointless , but fun nonetheless . When minimizing a window , or bringing it back out of the dock , hold down the shift key , and watch as it shrinks/expands in slow motion . This also works with some other aspect of the UI , such as Expos , opening multiple mail threads , using the login window and changing view in address book . <p> If you want to see any application do something in slow motion , hold down the shift key and see if it works ! <p> If you are are one of those people who hates the dock , you probably already know it is fairly easy to remove it for good . However when you do this you also lose other features such as Expos , Command-Tab switcher and Dashboard . A much better solution is to move the dock to the top of the screen and then hide it - making it invisible , but still around . <p> The easy way to do this is to download a copy of Tinkertool ( free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The more hardcore solution is to use the terminal . Before you start , make sure Dock hiding is off by going to the apple menu , choosing Dock then " Turn Hiding off " . Alternatively open up the dock section of system preferences and turn hiding off there , or control-click on the gap in the middle of the dock ( or even press Command-Option-D ) . <p> Then launch the terminal ( located in Applications/Utilities ) and type <p> defaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string top <p> and press enter . Nothing will happen at first , until you log out then in again or restart the dock process in Activity Monitor ( also located in Applications/Utilities ) . <p> Once you do this you should see your Dock appear at the top of your screen , and all you need to do is turn hiding off again , and your Dock will be invisible , only activating if you

##619651 <h> Finish of the First Tour de France <p> Maurice Garin won the first Tour de France , on July 19th , 1903 , by a margin of almost three hours . <p> Products of the bicycling craze of the 1890s in France included an army regiment mounted on bicycles and numerous flourishing bicycle-connected businesses as well as a public appetite for races . Besides track events in ' velodromes ' , there were long-distance road races , from Paris to Vienna and St Petersburg , for instance , and from Paris to Rome . The Tour de France , which began as a newspaper circulation-booster , was an unexpected by-product of the Dreyfus Affair . In 1899 the bicycle newspaper Le Vlo , which sold 80,000 copies a day , ran a pro-Dreyfus piece that caused a fierce falling out with a major advertiser , the bicycle manufacturer Comte Dion . With other manufacturers , including Clment and Michelin , Dion started a rival sports sheet called L'Auto . The editor was Henri Desgranges , winner of the world one-hour record in 1893 . When one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities . <p> The first race in 1903 took nineteen days in six formidable stages , from Paris to Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Nantes and back to Paris . The stages varied in length from 274km ( 170 miles ) to as much as 467km ( 290 miles ) , with a total distance of just over 2400km ( 1,500 miles ) . A parade of cars , festooned with advertising and throwing free samples to spectators , travelled two hours ahead of the cyclists . Of sixty competitors from France , Belgium , Germany and Switzerland , including professional team riders and freelance amateurs , twenty-one finished the gruelling course and the race was won by a Frenchman , Maurice Garin , ' the Little Chimney-Sweep ' , by a margin of close to three hours . The last finisher came in two days behind . <p> Garin also won the second race in 1904 , but he and the next three finishers were all disqualified for cheating .

##620050 <h> United Star Would Consider England Return <h> Michael Carrick says he would definitely consider a return to the England squad , if he were offered one by Roy Hodgson <p> Michael Carrick has admitted that he would consider a return to the England line-up , despite the Manchester United midfielder turning down the opportunity to head to Euro 2012 on the subs list for the squad . <p> Hodgson was pressed over why he chose Jordan Henderson , who had a disappointing first season for Liverpool , over Carrick , who was one of Sir Alex Ferguson 's go-to men during the season for the title-challenging Red Devils . <p> But after Hodgson revealed that Carrick had said no to playing a bit part in England 's trip to Poland and the Ukraine , the United man insists that does n't mean he never wants to play for his national side again . <p> " I 've had no contact from Roy Hodgson , so it would be wrong of me at this stage to make a decision either way , " he told the Manchester Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Carrick also made the move to dispel rumours that he said no to playing for England because he was angry at being left on the sidelines ; he simply felt that it would be too frustrating to get no game time , and that a younger player would benefit more from the experience than himself . <p> " I did n't kick the door down and say : ' You 've got to play me or I 'll leave ' , " he explained .

##620452 <p> Wilton Park events take place under a rigorous protocol which means that apart from a few on the record speeches , I am not allowed to attribute particular comments with specific individuals . So these reflections are necessarily my own , supplemented with material I know is a matter of record . <p> Things got off to a cracking start on Day One with a welcome speech by new DECC SofS Ed Davey , the first time I had seen him in action . His intervention was a well judged combination of light and shade , pulling no punches as to the scale of the challenge , but with a suitable element of encouragement for those of us in the room ready to debate the issues . <p> President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon was next and spoke eloquently demonstrating that climate change and its impact on human security is very much a reality in Africa and elsewhere . <p> We also had the unique opportunity to be addressed by the 4th in line to one of the European thrones , Jaime de Bourbon Palme . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to earth as anyone else in the room . If not more so . He endeared himself to one of my colleagues when he asked for directions to the nearest tube station : no chauffeur-driven limos for him ! He stayed from the very beginning to the very end of the conference , actively participating throughout . <p> The first day ended with a reception hosted by the FCO 's Lord Howell of Guildford and by MoD Minister Andrew Robathan . As I headed to my hotel that evening what struck me most was the diversity of the organisations represented and the many nationalities involved , juxtaposed with the clarity and convergence of the message : there is a problem and we need to find ways to fix it . Fast ! <p> If Day One was about setting the scene , Day Two was about trying to figure out what we were going to do about it . The challenge of dealing with various regional actors was considered from all angles . One participant encouraged us to consider other non-government actors , such as the private sector , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . I would have liked to have seen more on the public/private partnership angle to this issue . Doubtless that will come later . <p> Various concluding speakers spoke of the progress that had been made here . Others promised to take the debate forward to the next stop on the challenging trail to enlightenment . I was left in no doubt as to the utility of the occasion in bringing people together and of demonstrating our continued commitment to the cause . Other countries and organisations were identified to do their bit take the issue forward . To my mind the Conference represented an evolution of the debate and not revolution . But as long as people keep talking about climate security , spreading these important messages and sharpening their narrative , then there is reason to hope that we are continuing to move forward towards finding solutions to the challenge of maintaining human security in a rapidly changing climate . <p> I could n't help myself thinking on the way to the airport of the metaphor of the boiling frog .

##624551 <h> Writing paragraphs <h> Exercise 1 <p> Divide the following text into paragraphs . Remember that each paragraph should develop a particular theme . <p> How to stop yourself snoring . <p> Snoring is caused when the airway at the back of the nose and throat becomes partially obstructed . This is usually due to the loosening of the surrounding oropharyngeal muscles , but the reasons why this should occur are varied . The most common are smoking , obesity and the consumption of relaxants such as alcohol and sleeping pills . As with any common ailment , there are a host of " miracle " cures advertised - but you should first try a few simple steps to see if you can halt the snoring before adopting more drastic measures . Lifestyle changes can be the most effective . If you are overweight , a loss of weight will help to reduce the pressure on your neck . You should also stop smoking and try not to drink alcohol at least four hours before you go to bed . Beyond this , try to change your regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick , or tie something uncomfortable into the back of your pyjamas to encourage you to sleep on your side . Both of these will help to alter the angle of your throat as you sleep , and may thus make breathing easier for you . It is also important to keep your nasal passage clear and unblocked . Allergies , colds and hay fever can temporarily cause you to snore ; nasal decongestants may help , but you are not advised to use such remedies for long periods . Nasal strips , as worn by sportspeople , have been proven to reduce nasal airway resistance by up to 30 per cent , so consider these as a long-term alternative . If this fails , then you may wish to look at the varied snoring aids that are on the market . They range from neck collars that stop your neck tilting , through to mandibular-advancement devices ( such as gumshields ) which reduce upper airway resistance , and tongue-retaining devices .

##635050 <h> Myocardial Infarction ( Heart Attack ) <p> A heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) is usually caused by a blood clot , which stops the blood flowing to a part of your heart muscle . You should call for an ambulance immediately if you develop severe chest pain . Treatment with a clot-busting medicine or an emergency procedure to restore the blood flow through the blocked blood vessel are usually done as soon as possible . This is to prevent or minimise any damage to your heart muscle . Other treatments help to ease the pain and to prevent complications . Reducing various risk factors can help to prevent a myocardial infarction . <h> Understanding the heart and coronary arteries <p> The heart is mainly made of special muscle ( myocardium ) . The heart pumps blood into arteries ( blood vessels ) which take the blood to every part of the body . Like any other muscle , the heart muscle needs a good blood supply . The coronary arteries take blood to the heart muscle . The main coronary arteries branch off from the aorta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart chambers to the body . ) The main coronary arteries divide into smaller branches which take blood to all parts of the heart muscle . <h> What happens to your heart with a myocardial infarction ? <p> If you have a myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , a coronary artery or one of its smaller branches is suddenly blocked . The part of the heart muscle supplied by this artery loses its blood ( and oxygen ) supply if the vessel is blocked . This part of the heart muscle is at risk of dying unless the blockage is quickly removed . When a part of the heart muscle is damaged it is said to be infarcted . The term myocardial infarction ( MI ) means damaged heart muscle . <p> If a main coronary arteries is blocked , a large part of the heart muscle is affected . If a smaller branch artery is blocked , a smaller amount of heart muscle is affected . After an MI , if part of the heart muscle has died , it is replaced by scar tissue over the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A heart attack and myocardial infarction ( MI ) are commonly used terms , and mean the same thing . However , the term MI is used less often now by doctors . This is because there are actually a range of conditions that can be caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow in a coronary artery . This range of conditions has an overall term called acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Two main sub types of ACS can be diagnosed by what is seen on your heart tracing ( ECG ) . The two main types are called ST-elevation MI ( STEMI ) and non-ST-elevation MI ( NSTEMI ) . NSTEMI can also include unstable angina . ( The ST elevation refers to a section on the ECG tracing . ) In STEMI , the artery supplying an area of the heart muscle is completely blocked . However , in NSTEMI , the artery is only partly blocked , so only part of the heart muscle supplied by the affected artery is affected . Your treatment can depend upon which type you have - STEMI or NSTEMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just referred to as myocardial infarction ( MI ) from now on . For information on NSTEMI , unstable angina and ASC in general , see separate leaflet called Acute Coronary Syndrome . <h> What causes a myocardial infarction ? <h> Blood clot ( thrombosis ) - the cause in most cases <p> The most common cause of an MI is a blood clot ( thrombosis ) that forms inside a coronary artery , or one of its branches . This blocks the blood flow to a part of the heart . <p> Blood clots do not usually form in normal arteries . However , a clot may form if there is some atheroma within the lining of the artery . Atheroma is like fatty patches or plaques that develop within the inside lining of arteries . ( This is similar to water pipes that get furred up . ) Plaques of atheroma may gradually form over a number of years in one or more places in the coronary arteries . Each plaque has an outer firm shell with a soft inner fatty core . <p> What happens is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is called plaque rupture . This exposes the softer inner core of the plaque to blood . This can trigger the clotting mechanism in the blood to form a blood clot . Therefore , a build-up of atheroma is the root problem that leads to most cases of ACS / MI . ( The diagram below shows four patches of atheroma as an example . However , atheroma may develop in any section of the coronary arteries . ) <p> Treatment with clot-busting medication or a procedure called angioplasty ( see below ) can break up the clot and restore blood flow through the artery . If treatment is given quickly enough this prevents damage to the heart muscle , or limits the extent of the damage . <h> Uncommon causes <p> Various other uncommon conditions can block a coronary artery . For example : inflammation of the coronary arteries ( rare ) ; a stab wound to the heart ; a blood clot forming elsewhere in the body ( for example , in a heart chamber ) and travelling to a coronary artery where it gets stuck ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into spasm ; complications from heart surgery and some other rare heart problems . These are not dealt with further in this leaflet . <p> The rest of this leaflet deals only with the common cause - thrombosis over an atheroma plaque . <h> Who is at risk of having a myocardial infarction / heart attack ? <p> MI is common . About 146,000 people in the UK have an MI every year . Most occur in people aged over 50 and it becomes more common with increasing age . Sometimes younger people are affected . <p> MI is three times more common in young men than in young women . However , after the menopause , the female hormones no longer protect the heart so the risk is then the same for men and women . <p> MI may occur in people known to have heart disease , such as people with angina . It can also happen out of the blue in people with no previous symptoms of heart disease . This is because atheroma often develops without any symptoms at first . <p> Certain risk factors increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ACS / MI . See separate leaflet called Preventing Cardiovascular Diseases which discusses these in more detail . <p> Briefly , risk factors that can be modified and may help to prevent MI include : <h> What are the symptoms of a myocardial infarction ? <p> The most common symptom is severe chest pain , which often feels like a heavy pressure feeling on your chest . The pain may also travel up into your jaw and down your left arm or down both arms . You may also sweat , feel sick and feel faint . You may also feel short of breath . The pain may be similar to angina , but it is usually more severe and lasts longer . ( Angina usually goes off after a few minutes . MI pain usually lasts more than 15 minutes - sometimes several hours . ) <p> However , some people have only a mild discomfort in their chest . The pain can sometimes feel like indigestion or heartburn . <p> Occasionally , an MI happens without causing any pain . This is usually diagnosed when you have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stage . <p> Some people collapse and die suddenly , if they have a large portion of heart muscle damaged . This is not very common . <h> What should I do if I think I am having a myocardial infarction ? <p> Call for an ambulance immediately . <p> Then , if you have some , take one aspirin tablet ( see below for the reason for this ) . You will normally be admitted straight to hospital . <h> How is a myocardial infarction diagnosed and assessed ? <p> Many people develop chest pains that are not due to an MI . For example , you can have quite bad chest pains with heartburn , gallbladder problems or with pains from conditions of the muscles in the chest wall . Therefore , tests are usually done to confirm an MI . These are : <p> An ECG . There are typical changes to the normal pattern of the heart tracing in MI . Patterns that occur include things called pathological Q waves and ST elevation . However , it is possible to have a normal ECG even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A blood test that measures a chemical called troponin is the usual test that confirms MI . This chemical is present in heart muscle cells . Damage to heart muscle cells releases troponin into the bloodstream . In MI the blood level of troponin increases within 3-12 hours from the onset of chest pain , peaks at 24-48 hours , and returns to a normal level over 5-14 days . <p> A rough idea as to the severity of the MI ( the amount of heart muscle that is damaged ) can be gauged by the degree of abnormality of the ECG and the level of troponin in the blood . Another chemical that may be measured in a blood test is called creatine kinase . This too is released from heart muscle cells during MI . <p> Your heart tracing will be monitored for a few days to check on the heart rhythm . Various blood tests will be done to check on your general well-being . <p> Other tests may be done in some cases . This may be to clarify the diagnosis ( if the diagnosis is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is suspected . For example , an echocardiogram ( an ultrasound scan of the heart ) or a test called myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may be done . <p> Also , before discharge from hospital , you may be advised to have tests to assess the severity of atheroma in the coronary arteries . For example , an ECG taken whilst you exercise on a treadmill or bike ( exercise tolerance test ) . An angiography of the coronary arteries may also be performed . In this test a dye is injected into the coronary arteries . The dye can be seen by special X-ray equipment . This shows up the structure of the arteries ( like a road map ) and can show the location and severity of any atheroma . <h> What is the treatment for a myocardial infarction ? <p> The following is a typical situation and mentions the common treatments that are usually offered . However , each case is different and treatments may vary depending on your situation . <p> As soon as possible after MI is suspected you will be given a dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tiny particles in the blood that trigger the blood to clot . It is the platelets that become stuck on to a patch of atheroma inside an artery that go on to form the clot . <p> Other antiplatelet medicines called clopidogrel or ticagrelor may be given . They work in a different way to aspirin and help reduce platelet stickiness . <h> Injections of heparin or a similar medicine <p> These are usually given for a few days to help prevent further blood clots from forming . <h> Pain relief <p> A strong painkiller such as morphine is given by injection into a vein to ease the pain . <h> Treatment to restore blood flow in the blocked coronary artery <p> The part of the heart muscle starved of blood does not die immediately . If blood flow is restored within a few hours , much of the heart muscle that would have been damaged and die will survive . This is why MI is a medical emergency , and treatment is given urgently . The quicker the blood flow is restored , the better the outlook . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the blocked artery : <p> Emergency angioplasty . Ideally this is the best treatment if it is available and can be done within a few hours of symptoms starting . In this procedure a tiny wire with a balloon at the end is put into a large artery in the groin or arm . It is then passed up to the heart and into the blocked section of a coronary artery , using special X-ray guidance . The balloon is blown up inside the blocked part of the artery to open it wide again . A stent may be left in the widened section of the artery . A stent is like a wire mesh tube which gives support to the artery and helps to keep the artery widened . See separate leaflet called Angioplasty for details . <p> An injection of a clot-busting medicine is an alternative to emergency angioplasty . It can be given easily and quickly in most situations . Some ambulance crews are trained to give this . Note : a common clot-busting medicine used in the UK is called streptokinase . If you are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have another MI in the future . This is because antibodies develop to it and it will not work so well a second time . An alternative clot-busting medicine should be given . <p> Both the above treatments usually work well to restore blood flow and greatly improve the outlook . The most crucial factor is the speed that one or other treatment is given after symptoms started . <p> Beta-blocker medicines block the action of certain hormones such as adrenaline ( epinephrine ) . These hormones increase the rate and force of the heartbeat . Beta-blocker medicines have some protective effect on the heart muscle and they also help to prevent abnormal heart rhythms from developing . Beta-blocker medicines will also help to prevent having another MI . <h> Insulin <p> Some people have a raised blood sugar level when they have an MI , even if they do not have diabetes . If this occurs , then your blood sugar levels may need to be controlled with insulin . If you have diabetes then it is also likely that you will need to be treated with insulin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Oxygen <p> You may be given oxygen which works to reduce the risk of damage to your heart muscle . <h> Treatment after you have had a myocardial infarction <p> Normally you will be advised to take regular medication for the rest of your life . See separate leaflet called Medication After a Myocardial Infarction which discusses this more fully . <p> Briefly , the following four medicines are commonly prescribed to help prevent a further MI , and to help prevent complications : <p> Aspirin - to reduce the stickiness of platelets in the blood , which helps to prevent blood clots forming . If you are not able to take aspirin then an alternative antiplatelet medicine such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor may be advised . <p> A beta-blocker medicine - to slow the heart rate and to reduce the chance of abnormal heart rhythms developing . <p> An angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor medicine . ACE inhibitor medicines have a number of actions , including having a protective effect on the heart . <p> A statin medicine to lower the cholesterol level in your blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , you will normally be advised to take the antiplatelet medicine clopidogrel or ticagrelor in addition to aspirin . However , this is usually only advised for a number of weeks or months , depending on the type and severity of your MI . <p> Many people recover well from an MI and have no complications . Before discharge from hospital , it is common for a doctor or nurse to advise you how to reduce any risk factors ( see above ) . This advice aims to reduce your risk of a future MI as much as possible . <p> Other medicines or treatments may be needed if you develop complications . <h> How serious is a myocardial infarction ? <p> This often depends on the amount of heart muscle that is damaged . In many cases , only a small part of the heart muscle is damaged and then heals as a small patch of scar tissue . The heart can usually function normally with a small patch of scar tissue . A larger heart attack is more likely to be life-threatening or cause complications . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people made a full recovery . With the help of modern treatment , particularly if you are given treatment within a few hours to restore blood flow , a higher percentage of people now make a full recovery . <p> Some possible complications include the following : <p> Heart failure . If a large area of the heart muscle is damaged , then the pumping ability of the heart may be reduced . Less blood than usual is then pumped around the body , especially when extra blood is needed when you exercise . Symptoms such as breathlessness , tiredness , and swollen ankles may develop . Mild heart failure can often be treated with medication . Severe heart failure can be serious and even life-threatening . <p> Abnormal heart rhythms may occur if the electrical activity of the heart is affected . The main risk of this happening is within the first few hours after an MI . Sudden , chaotic , fast heartbeats may occur . This is called ventricular fibrillation and is the common cause of cardiac arrest . This needs immediate treatment with an electrical shock given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely . Other less serious abnormal heart rhythms can also occur which can often be treated with medicines . <p> A further MI may occur sometime in the future . This is more likely if the coronary arteries are badly affected with atheroma , or further build-up of atheroma continues . If the risk of this is thought to be high then surgery may be advised to bypass or widen severely narrowed coronary arteries . <p> The most crucial time is during the first day or so . If no complications arise , and you are well after a couple weeks , then you have a good chance of making a full recovery . A main objective then is to get back into normal life , and to minimise the risk of a further MI . <h> After having a myocardial infarction <p> When recovering from an MI , it is natural to wonder if there are any dos and don'ts . In the past , well-meaning but bad advice to " rest and take it easy from now on " caused some people to become over-anxious about their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any activity that caused exertion , for fear of straining the heart . <p> However , quite the opposite is true for most people who recover from an MI . Regular exercise and getting back to normal work and life are usually advised . Much can be done to reduce the risk of a further MI . <p> See leaflet called

Why do you think it 's been split into the other sets ? Is this just a guess or has this been confirmed ? <p> That 's right . Why do you think it 's been split into the other sets ? Is this just a guess or has this been confirmed ? <p> Just a guess , but Riviera seem to be painting / overhauling quite a few coaches lately . And with West Coast &; the SPRS Mk1 sets on the mainline also at the moment , as well as a dozen Mk2s in store &; in use with both companies , i cant see any of the set being stored or the need for another rake of Mk1s on the mainline . <p> I 'm not sure that it would have been into the ' Royal Dutchy ' set - I was under the impression that ' Pride of the Nation ' and ' Royal Scot ' were air braked , whereas the ' Royal Dutchy ' set was dual braked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been split into the other sets ? Is this just a guess or has this been confirmed ? <p> The " Pride of the Nation Rake " has been split by Riviera Trains , so that carriages from this rake can now be found in Riviera 's " Royal Scot " ( Set OM02 ) and " British Classic " rakes ( Set OM01 ) . These vehicles are painted carmine &; cream or chocolate and cream respectively . Further vehicles from the " Pride of the Nation " set are also with Riviera but are , I believe , presently out of use and are for the most part in plain green livery . <p> The ' Pride of the Nation ' rake was pretty much retired 2005 , although some of the coaches remained in use for a while longer , appearing in other charter sets .

##650950 <h> Do you know what ' Statelessness ' means ? <p> This week , we came across an extremely interesting report on a subject that is unheard of by many of us in the UK . Asylum Aid and the UN Refugee Agency published a joint research report : ' Mapping Statelessness in the United Kingdom . ' What is statelessness you may ask ? Surely everyone belongs to a country somewhere ? Well , perhaps shockingly , this is not the case . <p> The UK is one of 37 States that have ratified both the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness . ' Statelessness ' was defined by the 1954 Convention as " a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law . " These are people who are left without legal residences , protection from embassies or consulates and have no right to return to the country they were born in , or remain in the country they have entered . The Conventions were formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find solutions to this complex problem . <p> The recent report ( the first of its kind ) aimed to ' map the number and profile of stateless persons in the UK ' and examine our government 's obligations to stateless people who reside here , dissecting the impact of current policies and practice . <p> This caught our attention since we deal frequently with applicants seeking to gain citizenship in the UK . Sadly , they are not always successful -- so what then ? This is a subject that is of a wider social importance . After all , as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ; everyone has a right to a nationality . <p> The report states that while the our government does meet most of its responsibilities in this area , it falls short in some , because " despite the UK 's obligations under the 1954 Convention and international human rights law , UNHCR and Asylum Aid found that stateless persons without leave to remain in the UK often go unidentified and those without leave to remain often live at risk of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat the report in length here , but it makes compelling reading and we do urge you to have a read through it . Particularly the profile of Nischal , beginning on page 66 , demonstrates how all too easy it is for people to become lost and destitute in our immigration system . Refused Bhutanese , Indian and British citizenship in succession and for various flawed reasons , Nischal had no access to the benefits available in the UK that we take for granted . He is completely reliant on friends and charity and on various occasions has found himself homeless . Surely , there is something wrong with a system which allows this to occur ? <p> The report clearly highlights all the areas our government needs to work on , and makes recommendations ( such as better collation of official data and access to Legal Aid for stateless persons ) as to how this can be done

##654052 <p> Childhood ends here : AJ prepares for life in the Premiership with his fancy boots ( Baby Bentley just out of shot ) <p> It turns out I 'm stealing the childhood of my two-year-old , desperately hoping he 'll hand me a pension by signing a contract with a top Premiership club 16 years from now . Today , I 'm forcing him to train " professionally " and shutting him away from children not blessed with his talent and -- God help him -- rich genetic inheritance . <p> That , at least , is the message from Viv Groskop in the Observer , writing about The End of Jumpers for Goalposts . While my two-year old heads off to Socatots , a football-themed playgroup , Viv 's seven year-old ca n't get a game because it appears all his friends are off playing organised games . <p> He ca n't get a game , but his mum managed to get 2,000 words on why not -- and it 's all to do with the " over professionalisation of childhood football " , probably by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the other boys he wants to play with have been in coaching since they were three or four . They 're not keen to play with amateurs . There are plenty of soccer fanatics around , but if you 're remotely serious you train several times a week . You want to play seriously and be refereed properly . There 's no more jumpers for goal posts . It 's enough of a rarity to see boys playing football in jeans . Playground football for boys like my son -- who love football but have no ambitions to be the next Rooney -- has virtually disappeared . <p> This situation upsets me . I 'm not a football person and neither is Will 's father . But we want to encourage him . Football is a common language for boys of any age . And surely it 's especially important to know your way around the game if you 're not naturally sporty ? Will is not keen to go into training . He just wants a kickabout now and again . In the playground he cunningly cast himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored of that . Now it sounds like he just does n't really bother . It 's all too intimidating . So what can we do ? " <p> Viv 's right about the importance of football among boys ( and , indeed , their dads ) . Unfortunately , what she describes is only marginally about the sometimes-appalling youth structure of British football ( for a more authoritative report on that , the excellent David Conn 's report on youth development from last year remains the best I can think of ) . <p> What she 's really writing about is the rite of male passage that is : learning you 're not very good at football . Trust me . I know what I 'm talking about here . <p> The only things I lacked as a player were pace and skill . Even in the 80s , long before Sky and all-seater stadiums and Baby Bentleys , the boys who were any use at the sport quickly were n't playing with the likes of me . They headed off to organised games and training sessions where , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidelines . Meanwhile , the boys who were a bit rubbish , or whose parents do n't want them involved ( or know the ways into that world ) , were left to scrabble around for a game elsewhere . <p> In communities without open spaces , it was -- and is -- doubtless hard to find a game . In others -- like where I was brought up -- you eventually found a band of equally talentless mates , and a patch of grass . The jumpers went down , and you got a game . <p> As then , now . The boys who do n't really care for football do n't play very much . Those who are madly , but rubbish , keen find a way to get their fill . It 's a great way to learn social skills and overcome shyness , as you assail any random group and ask ( at least in Scotland ) : " Gizza game ? Room for one more ? " . Later in life , when you 've swapped school uniform for office uniform , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious " . If not , you 're in . If there 's mention of leagues and strips and a second XI , the hopeless player bewares . <p> What do I hope for my son ? In a world populated by role models such as John Terry , Wayne Rooney and Joey Barton , certainly not a professional contract . I 'd much rather he became a banker . But I do hope he picks up enough skill for him to enjoy the sport , and be good enough play in organised games with his banker friends , if he wants . I 'll be delighted he 's not stuck in front of a computer screen , playing games or writing a blog or something else dreadful . <p> And , for the moment , he appears to love his football . <p> Take last weekend . I 'm reasonably certain that two-year-olds are supposed to like the snow . There 's the opportunity for snowball fights , snowman building and general slippery-slidy fun . Not for ours . On Saturday morning , a fresh inch or two lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ball , " he said . " More ball , " he added by way of confirmation . For further emphasis , he swung his right leg towards my shin a few times . <p> Football 's tricky in the snow , alas . Worse , the devilish Socatots was off this week . The church wanted its hall back for some kind of seasonal activity . The whole day was somewhat spoiled as Al , denied his run out , bounced around the house like a coiled spring . " Ball ! " he cried , frustrated we could n't get his message . <p> That 's m'boy . I suspect that , as he gets older , he 'll always find a way to find a game . <p> A bit like his dad methinks -- not so much in the playing stakes but always finding a way to do something ( in this case , get a game of footy ) ! Anyway , I would n't worry -- he 's getting exercise and the thing is , as you point out , people always normally get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others games and as long as he 's generally fit and can run/take a tackle ( or dish it out -- I still remember Mary 's great kicking off you that birthday night of yours in Edinburgh , so he 's got that in his genes ) he 'll be fine . <p> @Craig McGill -- " given the Scottish team you follow " ... what -- you ca n't even type its name ?

##662351 <h> Short Story ( Mar 09 ) <p> Dinner Battles by Laura Ewen <p> He was sitting slowly appraising the plate of food in front of him . He lowered his face to the plate and wrinkled his nose with distaste . He sat back in order to take in the plate in all its disgusting glory . He screwed up his face . He moved in again . And then back . He made eye contact for the first time . Another battle of wills . He blinked first . I leant in over the table , saying nothing , just glaring at him . He vehemently shook his head from side to side in a crazed manner . It was getting faster and faster , more agitated . I wondered if he was causing himself permanent damage . He stopped . He began to warily examine the plate again . A hand was lifted up and hovered above the plate . It went back down to his side . I glared . It returned to its hovering position above the plate . The pincer movement he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to pick up a piece of sweetcorn . He held it before his eyes and slowly inspected it and then suddenly and quite unexpectedly put it in his mouth . He chewed it very deliberately , round and round in that little mouth for nearly two minutes . He swallowed . He smiled . Looking me right in the eye he pushed his plate towards me . <p> " Bin , " he said confidently . <p> I said nothing and pushed the plate back towards him . The piece of sweetcorn was at least progress . Last night he just screamed for the duration of his dinner , not eating a thing . <p> He began the slow process again . He seemed to love tormenting me by appearing to consider eating it , even going so far as to tap his chin with his index finger , pondering , before commencing with the head shaking again . <p> I tried being an aeroplane , a train , an ambulance . He shook his head . I tried a bit , " Mmm . Yummy ! " and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little dance , jumping up and down , spinning in a circle . He laughed . I darted in with the spoon . But the mouth was clamped shut . He 's quick , I 'll give him that . I tried being nice . I tried ignoring him . I shouted . I grovelled . It did n't work . I was losing the battle . We 'd sit for a bit longer . Me in the hope he 'd eat a bit , him in the hope I 'd just give up . Give up , or know it was time to quit . Either way . I spent three hours a day trying to get him to eat . It had n't always been like this , I remember when meal times were a pleasurable experience . He was n't even like this every day , sometimes , rarely at the minute , he 'd wolf it down . It was getting very wearing . He 's lucky he 's so cute . <p> He started shouting , " Done . Done . Done . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement he swiped the plate off the table . It was so quick I did n't even see it coming . Rice , chicken , sweetcorn and a baby friendly sauce all over the kitchen . He looked shocked and his lip started to quiver . Seconds . Screams , wails , red face , gasping wrenching sobs . <p> His Dad came in . " Could you not get him to eat again ? What 's wrong with you ? It 's only dinner . " His contribution as usual had been to sneak off for a wank . His hiding places really are n't very clever and he always acts very strangely and defensively . He seems to think I do n't notice .

First of all I made a gift bag from one of the 12x12 papers which I then decorated with some ruched seam binding and Kraft tickets . The letters on the grey kraft-tickets were stamped using the new Printer 's Block stamps Bet you ca n't guess who I made this for ! The image perhaps does n't show this but I stamped the letters on Kraft card , cut them out and used foam pads to attach them to the inked tickets . I could n't decide which ink to use and in the end opted for Black Soot Distress Ink which worked really well . <p> Here 's a picture of the inside - I filled it with chocolates which I put in a cellophane bag . <p> I also made a card to match using a die cut bohemian-birdcage from a Privilege-club kit . I added a double bow made with black seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bag . The bird was cut using a Tim Holtz die . <p> Finally here 's a Get Well card ( top-notch-card ) which I made for a friend . I used die cut bohemian-flowers again but kept them quite flat as I had to post this card . Something like this would also work for a Sympathy card with the colours being quite muted . <p> That 's all for now but I will be back next week with a special post .

##672252 <h> The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe <p> This is not witchcraft as a belief of marginals . This is an exploration of witchcraft as a central feature of early modern intellectual life . As such , Stuart Clark offers an important re-examination of the contours and chronology of that life . This is , therefore , a study of constructions of witchcraft . <p> Clark draws a valuable distinction between the response of ' church-type ' and ' sect-type ' churches . In the former case , witchcraft was a serious counter-institutional competitor for the allegiance of potentially all Christians . Its significance lay precisely in the challenge it posed to universal domination . The witch was the rival of the priest , both offering alternative therapies and perverting the vehicles and signs of Christianity . Acting against witchcraft thus affirmed orthodoxy . <p> The attitude of the sects was different . As Clark points out , religious deviance had a different meaning when there was an absence of claims to monopoly and inclusivity . A rejection of priests and sacramental channels of graces ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals of fellowship and their programmes of mutual support , sectarian communities were less prone to the inter-personal disputes that lay behind traditional witchcraft accusations . Furthermore , the sectaries were more likely to see the devil as a spiritual opponent , making witchcraft essentially an inward obstacle to personal achievement . ' Hell ' in such a context was the term for an internal condition , not an external power-base . <p> Clark shows how writers on demonology reflected their position in the major spheres of early modern intellectual debate . Thus , any attempt to follow the trajectory of learned beliefs in witchcraft has to engage with a wider understanding of contemporary concerns . Witchcraft beliefs can not be profitably abstracted from this context . He argues that witchcraft theory refracted contemporary views on the history of science , religion and politics , and that these views experienced a new impetus , vitality and prominence . Clark explains how apocalyptic thought and prophecy were boosted by the Reformation , how providentalism , evangelism and Decalogue theology were important in the period , how the modernising of Aristotle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how politics became mystified ; all shifts that interacted with a rise in witchcraft beliefs , only to become weaker in the early eighteenth century . <p> This article is available to History Today online subscribers only .

For a long time I did n't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me happy . That 's how crazy my life had become because alcoholism pervaded our household .

I was at Irish Night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near my home . Due to my Irish heritage , this was something that I looked forward to going to every year .

At one point my friend 's boyfriend stood me up , took me in his arms , swinging me around and dancing with me to the music . It was so much fun that I could n't help smiling and laughing . My daughter Kelly was 11 years old at the time . She looked at my girl friend and said , <p> " Wow , I 've never seen my Mom happy " <p> I know in her child 's mind that she did n't mean she had never seen me happy but her reality was that she could n't remember a recent time when I was happy .

##674651 <h> Open Skies - look at airline alliances to see what 's next <p> So finally there 's a deal it seems . You 'd have to be brave to predict what will happen next - but a sensible analysis needs to start with alliances . ( And then look at the people not in alliances . ) <p> At Heathrow , Star Alliance 's day could have finally come . I 'd guess they already have a plan ready to go for how to leverage the slots held by BMI , Lufthansa , SAS , and United . <p> For Oneworld , with the non-immunised alliance between BA and American , things are more complex . But all of a sudden Iberia is more important than ever - and unsurprisingly merger rumours have come from nowhere as the open skies deal has looked inevitable . <p> Skyteam has even more wrinkles to its situation , but my feeling is that they 've already thought it through . Delta 's move onto JFK-Gatwick was a real strategic step , and Air France 's refusal to become embroiled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not moving into Malpensa . Continental , with its tactic of what has been described as ' carpet-bombing ' Europe with 757s also looks a whole lot more important . <p> And remember , Skyteam already has its hands on Heathrow Terminal 4 once BA moves out to the new T5 . <p> But non-aligned players will hold the key to some markets . The 65-ton gorilla is Virgin Atlantic of course - which is not happy about the intrusion into its Heathrow domain , but has a world-leading track-record in establishing overseas operations and the brand to end all brands . Sir Richard 's creativity is going to be challenged as never before . <p> Slots of course are likely to soar in value , but where will they all come from .

##688651 <h> The Seasons <p> In some places , such as deserts or rainforests , the weather is much the same all year round . However in other places , for example northern Europe , we expect a certain kind of weather at certain times of the year . In winter , the days may often be cold or stormy , while summer days can be warm and sunny . When the weather changes regularly throughout the year like this , the changes are known as seasons . Some places have just two seasons , a wet one and a dry one , other places have four : spring , summer , autumn and winter . <p> Tilting Earth ... <p> Seasons occur because the Earth is tilted at an angle on its axis . As the Earth moves around the sun during the year , different parts of the Earth are tilted towards the sun at different times . In the Northern Hemisphere , when the North Pole tilts away from the sun , the sun is low in the sky and days are short , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the sun though , more light and heat reaches the Northern Hemisphere as the sun is high in the sky and days are long . This change brings what we know as summer . Between these two seasons are spring and autumn , where the region becomes gradually warmer and colder as it tilts towards or away from the sun respectively . <p> These movements of the Earth all contribute to give the four seasons we experience in Great Britain and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere . However , because of the way the seasons work , the opposite sides of the equator experience opposite seasons as the Earth moves round the sun each year . For example winter happens in Europe and the United States when it is summer on the opposite side of the world , in Australia . <p> Hot Christmas ... <p> Imagine how your Christmas day would be different if it occurred when the weather was hot , as in Australia . <p> Overview ... <p> Overview : When the part of the Earth you live in is tilted towards the sun , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s surface . In cold seasons , your country will be in the part of the Earth tilting away from the sun . <p> Why don ? t you keep a record of how the weather changes during the year in your area ? You could note the length of day and night , how cold it is and the position of the Sun in the sky , for example . It is also interesting to see how seasons affect the lives of both plants and animals . Find a tree that loses its leaves in autumn ( what we call a deciduous tree ) . Study the tree each month to see how its appearance changes . Animals also react to winter , but in a different way . Some birds migrate to warmer places in the winter , and squirrels survive by eating food they have stored up earlier in the year . Hares in the Arctic turn white in the winter so they are more camouflaged against the snow . You may have noticed that even your pet cat or dog develops a thicker , warmer coat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different time in summer ? We do in Britain , don ? t we ? Do you know why ? It is to help people such as farmers who work outside to make the most of daylight hours . The clocks are put forward one hour in spring , and in autumn they are put back one hour again . Do you know what we call the two different time periods in England ? British Summer Time ( BST ) and Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) . <p> As well as the different seasons we experience , the weather also changes from day to day .

##706752 <h> Black People in Britain : The 1930s <p> David Dabydeen concludes our special issue with a look at Hogarth 's representations of black people in the 18th century . <p> On September 23rd , 1934 , ' Winifred Holtby wrote to her closest friend Vera Brittain that at tea she had entertained Eric Walrond , ' a Negro poet from New York ' , Una Marsen , ' the Jamaican dramatist ' and her cousin , Daisy Pickering . ' Would you think that party would mix ? ' she asks Vera , ' What time do you think the last departed ? 9.45 ! Was I tired ? But it was interesting . We turned the colour question , miscegenation ... and race prejudice inside out ' . <p> Winifred 's letter reflects an upsurge of interest in liberal-humanitarian circles in the 1930s in ' race relations ' ( though this term as such was not used in the way it is today ) . Before the First World War , apart from the discussion of the ' general relations between the so-called white and coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1911 and the paternalistic interest of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society in aiding destitute Africans , for most whites there was ' no recognised colour problem in Britain ' . The few ' friends of the Africans ' , such as E. D. Morel , the trenchant pre-war critic of colonialism , channelled their reforming energies into championing the cause of ' helpless natives ' and their racial attitudes were tinged by the strong enthno-centrism of Victorian Britain . <p> But during the First World War the influx of coloured colonial seamen , munitions workers and others substantially increased the numbers of the British ' coloured ' population . In the aftermath of the war , British white liberals -- the section of the community with a broad sympathy towards the problems of blacks which stretched back in the liberal , humanitarian tradition to the abolitionists -- were confronted for the first time with a sizeable domestic ' race problem ' . From this time an embryonic form of the modern concept of race relations began to emerge . <p> Initially , the problem of race surfaced in the 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning white soldiers , bitter and resentful over the scarcity of employment , directed their frustrations against black workers , who had ' stolen ' their jobs while they were away . Blacks were physically intimidated and harassed and the tense situation finally erupted into rioting . In response the Government proposed repatriation schemes , an idea raised consistently throughout the inter-war period . Restrictive legislation , such as the Aliens ' Order , 1920 and the Special Restriction ( Coloured Alien Seamen ) Order , 1925 was enacted to check any further influx of ' coloured ' people . <p> The serious and persistent unemployment of the inter-war period , combined with the discrimination by white unions and employers against black workers increased the poverty and distress in local black communities . In 1935 , rioting broke out again in Cardiff , the result of accumulated bitterness over discriminatory employment practices . A sympathetic informal report on the troubles , isolated ' the smooth co-operation of the Trade Union ( National Union of Seamen ) , the Police and the shipowners ' . Before unrest broke out there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when black seamen of undisputed British nationality had been classified as aliens . The report concluded that the distressing situation was ' a new monument to economic ignorance and racial animosity ' in Britain . <p> Although the black community in Britain was still very small during the bleak 1930s racial prejudice permeated all levels of white society , reinforced through popular literature , cinema , the content of school curriculums and the patriotic propaganda of Empire Day celebrations . Most people were unconcerned about the problems that blacks faced . Even on the Left , prejudice was deeply rooted and at times openly apparent as in the controversy which surrounded E. D. Morel 's article ' Black Horror on the Rhine ' , published in 1919 , which played heavily on the sexual threat to white women posed by black soldiers in Europe . <p> Why , in such an atmosphere did a small number of British people become aware in the 1930s of the pressing need to improve relations between the races ? Apart from concern for the plight of black workers and their families , a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , for instance , the ' colour question ' was inseparable from the ' colonial question ' . In the non-self-governing colonies , rare-consciousness and anti-colonialism were almost synonymous . In Britain , colonial students began to express their grievances more forcefully . <p> The growing discontent in the British colonies attracted interest among the members of the international community organisations , particularly in the early 1930s . Communist commentators diagnosed the race problem as a symptom of the inherent class conflict in imperialist society . In this analysis , the overthrow of European colonialism by the ' toiling negro masses ' would topple capitalism and thus eradicate race prejudice . Such ideas were popular in more radical black circles in the 1930s and seemed to pose a serious potential threat to the stability of the Empire . It may be argued that some white liberals were spurred into action by their deep apprehension of Communism . <p> The 1930s saw the establishment of the first ' race relations ' organisations in Britain . The two major groups were the Joint Council to Promote Understanding between White and Coloured people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LCP ) . The Joint Council , instigated in 1931 by the Quakers , was modelled on the multi-racial South African Joint Councils . ( There were strong links between South African and British liberals during this period . ) The LCP was founded in the same year by Dr Harold Moody , a long time black resident in Britain , and throughout the 1930s it had more white members than black . <p> Both the Joint Council and the LCP were voluntary organisations dependent on charitable subscriptions and enshrined the gradualist , Christian liberal-humanitarian approach to improving race relations . They were concerned primarily with individual instances of racial discrimination , ( the ' Colour Bar ' ) , encouraging a ' wide appreciation ' of ' the contribution of Coloured people to human welfare ' and philanthropic aid for black workers and their families . Together with other interested groups , mainly Christian , they held multi-racial social events and church services and a number of conferences .

Black and white began to diverge ; the LCP remained a moderate organisation but the fervent multiracialism of the early 1930s was no more . <p> Increasingly , blacks began to reject white ' help ' , well intentioned though it may have been . As pan-African sentiments grew in strength , the need for self-help and solidarity among Africans and people of African origin throughout the world was emphasised . As one contemporary black writer put it , in the eyes of whites ' you are not a person , you are a problem . And every crusading crank imagines he knows how to solve your problem ' . By the late 1930s many blacks had decided that their ' problem ' could be solved only by themselves . <p> In assessing the white liberal involvement with black causes in the 1930s an interesting factor which emerges is the prominent part played by women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists have testified to the ' dedication , kindness , friendship and sympathy ' of British women .

Although Robeson underwent a political transformation and rejected his white patrons , many of the black members of the LCP for instance , who mixed in white circles , were too elitist to identify with the problems of the black working-class .

However , the company has backtracked on its intitial reports that a bot had definitely been identified . <p> The security company had issued warning to customers of its DeepSight threat notification service saying that there were " reliable reports " of an in-the-wild worm or bot that was attacking , then installing itself , on D-Link routers . However , the company has now decided that was a step too far . " After looking into it further , we decided that that was a little misleading , " said Oliver Friedrichs , a director of Symantec 's security response team . " It 's unconfirmed at this point . But we have definitely seen an increase in attack activity , and that activity appears to be coming from other D-Link devices . " <p> In other words , although Symantec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bot sample , all the evidence points in that direction . " We suspect that it 's a bot , " he said . <h> Related Articles on Techworld <p> According to Friedrichs , the attacks against the D-Link routers begin with hackers scanning TCP port 23 for an active SNMP service , a flaw that first showed up in D-Link router firmware in 2005 . " It looks like they 're exploiting the SNMP vulnerability to reset and reconfigure the administrative password on the routers , " said Friedrichs , perhaps to conduct " drive-by pharming " attacks that change a router 's settings so its users are unknowingly directed to bogus or malicious websites instead of the real URLs . <p> " Having port 23 open on the Internet-facing side is a bad idea in general , " said Petko Petkov , a prolific penetration tester from the UK who , with a partner , Adrian Pastor , has published research on hacking routers . " But I guess this is due to the fact that the attacked devices have only one Ethernet port and users can unwillingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Router vulnerabilities are up and attacks against routers are on the rise - especially attacks that target devices used by consumers and small businesses to create wireless networks , said Friedrichs . " Attackers are increasingly looking beyond the desktop , " he said , for new places to install - and hide - their malware . <p> Petkov was n't shocked to hear of Symantec 's warning . " We 're not surprised at all , as all embedded-device(s) we have tested so far are vulnerable to all kinds of interesting vulnerabilities , " said Petkov . Nor would creating a worm or bot Trojan be tough . " Anybody can code a worm which attacks routers on a massive scale quite easily . Most of the research information is out there , so it is a matter of putting the pieces of the puzzle together .

##734352 <h> How to improve indoor air quality <h> If you thought you could hide from smoke and smog indoors , you 've got another thing coming . Laura Sevier takes a look at the problem of in-house pollution , and offers advice on what you can do to clear the air <p> So much for home sweet home . When it comes to indoor air quality , the chances are you 're better off wandering the fume-filled streets of London than sitting at home in front of the telly . <p> Take your favourite sofa , for instance . Did you know that particles of the fabric can abrade and be taken up by your nose , mouth and lungs ? According to German chemist Michael Braungart , co-founder of Cradle to Cradle design , the fabric is likely to contain ' mutagenic materials , heavy metals , dangerous chemicals , and dyes that are often labelled as hazardous by regulators -- except when they are presented and sold to a customer ' . Braungart has carried out ' off-gassing experiments ' on everyday products such as carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaseous emissions . Some of the worst offenders include vinyl wallpaper and flooring , laser printers and photocopy machines ( the toner dust can be easily inhaled ) , glues , paints and household appliances such as TVs and washing machines . His verdict ? ' Indoor air is much worse than outdoor London air , ' he says . ' Inside , you have chemicals in a sealed building . ' <p> It 's a view supported by a growing body of scientific evidence . The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) first blew the whistle on poor indoor air quality in 1986 ; the UK 's Building Research Establishment ( BRE ) published devastating findings in 1996 . And yet , while there are European mandatory standards for some pollutants in ambient ( outdoor ) air , still there is none for indoor air . <p> We spend much of our lives in buildings , be they homes , offices , schools or shops . Studies from Europe and the US show we spend an average 90 per cent of our time indoors . We are what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body , so good quality air is of vital importance . <p> Most indoor air pollution comes from sources inside the building . As Braungart 's studies show , nearly everything we use sheds particles or gives off a range of gases , particularly when new . The stuff and staples of daily life -- carpets , upholstery , manufactured wood products , electronic devices and cleaning products -- emit volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) including formaldehyde . VOCs are liquid or solid substances that turn into or emit gases at room temperature ( a process known as off-gassing ) . They are the most common type of gases found indoors , and they are bad news . Adverse health effects can include eye , nose and throat irritation , headaches , loss of coordination , nausea , and damage to the liver , kidneys and central nervous system . Some are known to cause or are suspected of causing cancer in humans . <p> Dr Derrick Crump , a BRE specialist in indoor air quality , says indoor concentrations of VOCs are typically 10 times higher than outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors . Thanks to the airtight and energy efficient nature of many modern buildings , there is less ventilation in the form of drafts . Also trapped can be chemical contaminants from the outside ( such as pollutants from exhaust fumes ) , which can seep through windows or poorly located air intake vents . <p> At worst , high levels of contamination can cause ' sick-building syndrome ' . Headaches , dizziness , disorientation , fatigue , difficulty concentrating , eye , nose and throat irritations are all symptoms . Newly built or remodelled buildings , in particular , tend to off-gas a higher level of chemicals than older ones . <p> What you can do ... <p> Freshen the air - naturally <p> Unless you live next to the M25 , the cheapest and most effective way to allow fresh air in and toxic air out is to open a window . Ban air ' fresheners ' , a source of VOCs , and use natural odour-eaters such as a bowl of baking soda or naturally fragranced alternatives ( see www.natural-house.co.uk ) . Avoid using perfumes , deodorants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identities of as many as 100 potentially persistent or allergenic chemicals . <p> Clear out cleaning chemicals <p> Recent studies have linked cleaning sprays with a new onset of asthma in adults and linked cleaning products , when used by pregnant women , to persistent wheezing in their offspring in early childhood . Use a range based on natural plant ingredients or experiment with simple cleaning solutions made from lemons , vinegar and baking soda . <p> Breathable particles ? <p> Dust is just dust , right ? Wrong . A 2002 Greenpeace analysis of house-dust samples vacuumed from 100 UK homes showed that hazardous chemicals such as phthalates , brominated flame retardants , alkylphenols and organotins were widespread contaminants . Regular cleaning can help keep levels of breathable particles down along with dust mites , pollen and other allergy-causing agents . Keep humidity to a minimum to discourage the growth of mould which has the potential to cause allergic reactions when inhaled . <p> Carpets act as a reservoir for dust , which leads to a build-up of dust-mite allergen , an important trigger for asthma and other allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK report , ' Poisons Underfoot ' , found that new carpets contain significant levels of hormone-disrupting , brominated flame retardant BDE-209 , the pesticides permethrin and tributyltin ( an immune- and reproductive-system toxin ) and formaldehyde . Vinyl ( PVC ) floors , made with phthalates , a hormone-disrupting chemical also linked to asthma and allergies in children , are no better . As a general rule , choose natural fibre carpets and rugs made from organic wool or cotton , coir or jute , instead of synthetic carpets ( typically made of nylon or polyester ) , though check they have n't been treated with unnecessary chemicals or glues ( see www.healthyflooring.org for suppliers ) . FSC-certified wood flooring is another option . If you do have a carpet , avoid toxic carpet cleaners -- use a steam cleaner instead . Take off your shoes to keep dirt and bacteria from the streets at bay . <p> What not to paint with <p> Conventional paints can include acrylic , polyurethanes , PVC and VOCs . When they off-gas , the fumes are likely to include the emissions from VOC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . Check that it is ' solvent-free ' . <p> Electronics <p> Ban electrical appliances from the bedroom . A computer , for instance , contains toxic gases , toxic metals ( such as cadmium , lead and mercury ) , acids , plastics , chlorinated and brominated substances . The dust from some printer toner cartridges has been found to contain harmful substances such as nickel and mercury . Greenpeace has an online ' Guide to Greener Electronics ' which ranks the top manufacturers . <p> Protect babies and children <p> Expecting a child ? Go easy when creating a nursery . Often people paint walls and put in new carpets and curtains -- so when the baby arrives it ends up in a room full of off-gassing . Myriad Toys ( www.myriadonline.co.uk ) sells handcrafted natural wooden toys in waterbased colours , finished with natural oil blends . <p> Older buildings are in many ways better than new - the materials used are often locally-sourced , such as limestone and decent wood .

##742951 <p> Successful or not , Facebook 's IPO has taught us one very important thing over the last two days . <p> The **25;1766;TOOLONG knows extremely little about greenshoe IPO mechanics . And yet , because who shouts loudest makes the most waves ... the idea that Morgan Stanley had " lost face " on the IPO due to its commitment to take on shares at $38 " at a burden " to itself managed to linger around far too long for comfort . <p> Two trading days later , we finally have at least two high-profile commentaries explaining how greenshoe dynamics really work and why it is that in the worst case scenario Morgan Stanley 's much derided " stablisation " activities will probably have left it with a neutral position ( if not a positive one ) . <p> It all comes down to the bank having shorted the stock ( via over-allotment ) at the beginning of the process . As Felix Salmon explained on Monday : <p> You 'll note that Morgan Stanley sold more shares than it bought . That 's the greenshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're short that stock , so when a bank exercises its greenshoe option , as Morgan Stanley did in this case , it is going short the stock in question . <p> Why would a company like Facebook want its banks to be short its own stock ? Partly because when there 's a big short in the market , that provides upward pressure on the share price . Shorts need to cover their short position -- which means they need to buy stock . But more generally , the greenshoe is a way to provide the market with a nice extra slug of shares , which everybody wants if the stock trades substantially higher than its IPO price . <p> The greenshoe and stabilization are weirdly misunderstood ; people can not get over the idea that it is a prop position for the underwriters , meaning that if the stock reached $50 the underwriters would make a kajillion dollars on their 63mm share greenshoe option , while if instead it breaks through $38 in the wrong direction the underwriters would be long a lot of stock at $38 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $38.00 last night , but only bought 421mm from Facebook . That left them with a 63mm short that they were hoping to cover at $37.582 ( the price of the IPO and greenshoe to them ) but that it sure looks like they 've mostly covered at $38.00 -- $38.01 today . <p> All of which is very understandable . <p> Though Felix Salmon goes one step further by pondering the existential nature of 63m shares -- which were never issued -- but sold by Morgan Stanley in the first place : <p> The greenshoe does , however , raise certain existential questions -- not least , how can 484 million shares be sold , if only 421 million shares have been issued ? Do those extra 63 million shares exist ? <p> He says the answer is that the shares exist in a kind of quantum limbo . As he observes : <p> In one possible world the shares trade happily on the open market , in which case Morgan Stanley will exercise its option , and force Facebook and its investors* to cough up the last 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . In another possible world , Morgan Stanley ends up buying back those 63 million shares on the open market , thereby reducing the number of shares actually trading to the original 421 million . In that world , the 63 million shares never had much of an existence : they were sold by Morgan Stanley and then bought back by Morgan Stanley , and all that 's left at the end of the day is nothing . <p> We , on the other hand , would prefer to call these ' phantom shares ' . And that 's because the dynamics seriously remind us of how ETFs trade on a daily basis . <p> A small but important divergence into ETFs <p> When it comes to ETFs , authorised particpants have what you might call a permanent " greenshoe " option on the creation of new shares . <p> They exercise that option whenever it 's profitable for them to do so . Therefore whenever the ETF shares trade at a premium to the underlying ( since they get new stock at a discount to the market rate because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of delivering what is now a discounted underlying basket ) . Just like Morgan Stanley in the Facebook example , they can then use these shares ( exercised greenshoe options ) to close out their short positions . In doing so they add supply to the market and stabilise the price . In the case of ETFs this activity prevents the units from trading beyond their underlying value . <p> In the reverse scenario , however , when the stock falls below the cost of creation ( the greenshoe option ) , the authorized participants buy back shares from the market to close out their short positions . No greenshoe option is exercised . <p> In an important caveat , however , the authorised particpants also have the option to redeem shares from the issuer at their net asset value ( as opposed to their discounted trading value ) -- meaning it might in some cases make sense to maintain the short position to " pop " the stock . <p> Either way , until those shorts are fully closed out they -- just like the over-allotted facebook shares -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of ETFs the over-allotment of shares by authorized participants to hedge funds and other clients is usually done on a constant basis , exercised via such things as " create-to-redeem " programmes . <p> It 's one reason why you can get such huge short-interest ratios in ETFs , often beyond 100 per cent . <p> The more the AP over-allocates the stock , the greater the AP 's flexibility and opportunity to profit risk-free from discounts or premiums in the units versus the underlying price of the units . <p> Arguably the greater the opportunity to " pop " the stock at the same time too , especially since there is no time-limit to this type of " greenshoe " option . <p> So why did we go off on this ETF tangent ? <p> We think some of the concerns which were brought up with respect to Morgan Stanley 's stabilisation role in the Facebook IPO are actually more relevant to how ETFs trade than how IPO stock is floated . <p> On price discovery <p> Some market participants have complained that Morgan Stanley 's " stabilisation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal form of stock manipulation . <p> We 'd say that since the greenshoe option will eventually expire , the stabilisation only eroded short-term market volatility . The stock will be allowed to achieve its market price , but in a less volatile way than it might otherwise . <p> With ETFs , on the other hand , the greenshoe option is perpetual , and floats in line with the value of the underlying stock basket . That means the option hypothetically links the ETF unit to the " real value " of the fund ( rather than some banker 's guestimate valuation ) . It 's the magic that really makes ETFs work . <p> But what if the ETF units become more liquid than the underlying ? Is there a risk that the ETF might end up tracking a false valuation ? Does the constant stabilisation suppress volatility ? And to what degree does carrying large " over-allocated " short positions ' pop ' the stock on a continuous basis -- arguably propping up the less liquid underlying ? <p> Phantom shares <p> When it comes to the phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another crucial difference between the ETF market and the IPO market . <p> With the IPO phantom shorts there is a natural limit beyond which over-allocation is no longer risk-free . The limit is set by the size of the greenshoe option . <p> With the ETF market , however , there is no such limit . APs can hypothetically issue as many " risk-free " phantom shares as they want , even 10 times the outstanding issuance . <p> Can this endless ability to issue risk-free phantom shares impact how the stock and

##794451 <p> In their attempt to assassinate girl-activist , Malala Yousufzai , has the Taliban inadvertently rescued the narrative of violence against women ? <p> Just as in other patriarchal societies , violence against women ( VAW ) in Pakistan is endemic and cuts across all classes and ethnicities . Men of all ideological bents instrumentalise the political economy of VAW as a highly lucrative and politically successful strategy of maintaining material supremacy and social power . <p> Over the last three decades , Pakistan has been at the receiving end of donor-assisted campaigns and gender-empowerment awareness programmes on violence . These projects were sub-contracted to NGOs that had been set up by feminists who themselves , in the 1980s , had been involved in direct action activism on cases of violence . With the sponsorship of international development assistance , " women 's NGOs " have steadily embraced the concept and become advocates of linking VAW to neo-liberal development agendas . This has re-directed analysis and activism from its primary focus on survivors and perpetrators of violence . Instead , increasing attention and funding has led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donor-preferred approach known as ' Gender-Based Violence ' ( GBV ) . <p> The shift has meant more than a replacement of acronyms . The impetus of both , VAW and GBV activism , may be the overlapping theme of violence but for the latter , the emphasis is much more on the context and sites where violence is ' gendered ' and sustained . The long-term developmental aim of GBV is to change power inequalities between men and women in society . Exacerbating factors such as poverty , injustice , discrimination or lack of awareness or dis-empowerment of women and girls , is the core of the GBV agenda . However , the UN preference for GBV linkages with developmental goals has meant that the politics of VAW has deflected or at least , diluted , the focus from the immediate perpetrators , purpose and benefits of violence . Instead , the GBV approach looks closer at socially constructed masculinity rather than material-based patriarchy , to be the direct motivation or cause of criminal intent behind such violence . <p> Perversely , this is allowing generations of perpetrators to metaphorically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because GBV projects offer to rehabilitate masculinities , change the broader power structures , and improve the justice-education-health systems or gender relations in communities , rather than simply recognize the criminal and his immediate motivation . Nor do GBV projects sponsor punitive methods to address such violations . The recent attack on a 14 year old girl-activist , Malala Yousufzai , by the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) in Swat , Pakistan , has pushed the reset button on the momentum that was being gained by Gender-Based Violence ( GBV ) . The Taliban 's attack may have inadvertently rescued the narrative of the VAW approach , which calls for more direct focus on immediate causes and perpetrators and more urgent responses to cases of violence against women . <p> Responses to the Taliban attack <p> The range and multitude of the global response to the attempted assassination of Malala have been far-reaching . They span from Madonna 's puzzling bare-back tribute to the young activist at a concert just days after the attack , to the equally jingoistic decision by the government of Pakistan to name three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Shazia ' and ' Kainat ' , as a ' tribute ' to all three school girls targeted and injured by the Taliban . While the case has received near-universal condemnation , various interests groups in Pakistan are competing to add to the multiple layers of ascribed motivations , causes and responsibilities . There is also much political mileage to be availed in view of the sweep of outrage and sympathy across the world . A virtual supermarket of ' Blame ' brands are available for commentators ranging from American hegemony , imperialism , drone attacks and even , anti-Islam blasphemous material produced in the West . <p> ' ' We demand the end of Extremism and Terrorism " - Protest in Pakistan by left and women 's groups . Photo : member of WAF . <p> While GBV approaches link the low rate of literacy and abysmal indices for girls ' education in the country to gender based discrimination , the narrative that has spun around Malala 's case has thrown up a host of deeper , unresolved and critical issues with reference to violence . The Taliban have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of violence it consciously employs . In several press releases , the Taliban spokesman has refuted all the defenses being spun by Islamists and conservatives ( such as drone attacks ) , as the motivation behind the assassination attempt . The statements have impatiently corrected the rationalisations and confirmed that they attacked Malala specifically for her adversarial intent to " secularise society " by educating girls according to a non-Islamic curricula . Her aimed defiance to the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) qualifies her as anti-Islamic and the Taliban claim , " We did not attack her for raising voice for education . We targeted her for opposing mujahideen and their war " . The aim to kill her was the natural culmination of their larger campaign of systematically blowing up girls ' schools over the last five years , in northern Pakistan . <p> For decades , women 's rights activists resisted the monopoly of violence claimed by the state , and unpacked the lease of this to men in communities who then target women with impunity under the guise of cultural practices and patriarchal traditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several development practitioners became engaged with the idea of instrumentalising Islam as a tool for women 's empowerment . This premise allowed them to pursue the case for educating women and girls through religious didacticism . It also allowed for the co-option of clergy who resisted contraceptive use to become its promoters . Theoretically , it was thought that this strategy would counter what were labeled ' anti-Islamic ' traditions that sanctioned violence against women . VAW proved far more resilient . What these activists underestimated was that instrumentalising Islam is not a parochial privilege limited to rights based activists . The Taliban and sympathetic Islamists do not doubt nor resist the need for women 's education as a Quranic prescription -- just its nature , purpose and ' secularising ' ends . <p> The debate is shifting away and being reframed by all the actors involved and reconfiguring around notions of religious and secular forms of violence . As a result , the symbol of woman as a carrier of both the virus and cure , the seed of destruction and resurrection , war and peace , continues to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs secular options and pursuits . <p> Clarity in the Taliban agenda <p> In the post War on Terror ( WoT ) period , incrementally , Pakistani women have been the direct targets of Islamic militancy . At first , activists struggled to decode the patriarchal impulses and gendered impact of a more generic conflict . By 2007 , however , the Swat Taliban came to have virtual control over Swat . Girls ' schools were bombed , barbers and music shop owners were attacked , women warned not to come to the bazaars or hospitals or to leave their houses alone , and were assaulted when in violation of regulations . Women performers , called the ' dancing girls of Swat ' were assaulted , and at least one , Shabana , was shot dead and her body hung on display at a crossing dubbed Khooni Chowk ( Bloody Crossing ) as a symbol of the Taliban 's regimen of moral cleansing . The use of women as a signpost is not exclusive to the Taliban but unlike in inter-community or inter-ethnic murders , Islamic militants leave messages to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead bodies routinely and systematically . So too , Shabana 's body was strewn with currency notes as a mocking reminder of the fate of those deemed un-Islamic ( in her case , prostitutes ) by the Taliban 's sharia rule . <p> Unlike men of sub-nationalist movements or even mainstream Islamists , the Taliban are overt and unapologetic in their exploitative and symbolic use of the female body . Despite the self-confessed assassination attempt on Malala and repeated explanations of why they will continue such acts , the Islamists and conservatives in Pakistan have launched a counter-campaign to disassociate this crime ( against Malala ) from the criminal ( the Taliban militant ) . The argument in the media spin that followed the targeted assassination attempt was that Malala had been attacked by an abstraction -- American hegemony , imperialism , Islamic freedom , militancy , Westernisation , class aspirations , honour , nationalism , secularism , women 's rights . By not recognizing the self-confessed murderer , Islamists absolve the criminal and dissolve the crime . <p> Such unprecedented violence has diverted attention and hindered the struggle of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routine public and private cases of VAW . Activism meant rescuing women under threat , offering legal assistance and providing shelter as well as , pressurizing the state and justice system to deal with the perpetrators . Even as we observed the course of the ' war on terror ' and its fall-out in Pakistan , the growth of GBV projects continued to divert the emphasis away from direct action and towards developmental and rehabilitative approaches . Islamic militants such as the TTP have directly challenged all apologia that argues that they are victims of some misguided masculinities , brutalized by tribal war and poverty . Neither do they view themselves as jihadi proxies used and discarded by the Pakistani state , or as citizens who are denied justice . They do however agree with some sympathisers who continue to view the Taliban as products and resistance armies of US anti-imperialism . Is it viable to continue viewing the conscious agent as a victim ? <p> Agent as victim <p> To deflect the direct responsibility of a crime away from the individual and place it on the breadth of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then empties the perpetrator of criminal motivation and refills him with a higher , larger-than-life , mission . <p> The creation of such noblesse oblige is done by converting the agent into a victim . This laundering opens a new line of defense . It suggests ( as several Islamists have done ) that , under certain circumstances , a case of justifiable homicide may be made . However , in the views of the same sympathisers , this flexibility is a limited moral commodity . The defense of a higher moral purpose as the motivation for murder is not a universally available tool for all citizens regardless of class , creed or gender . It is a selective application reserved only for those who are deemed Islamic enough and soaked in the cause of promoting/defending Islam as defined by powerful or political clergymen . <p> In other words , Malala may be worthy of sympathy due to her status as a minor but does not qualify for justice because of her near-fitna ( seductive , luring , chaotic ) activities . In the minds of these apologists , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were caught , despite their stated motivation ( which has not been cited as the drone attacks but due to Malala 's adversarial intent to secularise her society ) and even prior to a judicial hearing . In such a world-view , justice must not be blind but dependent on the perceived beliefs or religious weightage of the individuals or parties involved . <p> One of the complaints made by proponents of the Taliban-as-victim group , is that violations against women by secular landed politicians , do not receive as much media attention or outraged response . This is a completely dishonest proposal . The case that is often quoted as ' exaggerated ' or ' sensationalised ' to expose the Taliban 's Islamic justice system following the peace deal with the government in 2009 , is that of a woman flogged by Taliban ' police ' in the streets of Swat . The mobile phone amateur video went viral on national and international channels . In 2008 , soon after the new incumbent civilian government was installed , two high profile cases involving the landed politicians of the ruling party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With reference to one of these cases of the alleged ' live burial ' of girls who refused their arranged marriages , Pakistani women 's groups lobbied , protested and came on TV channels demanding the removal of the cabinet minister from the said constituency . They did so , in protest of his defense of such ' traditions ' , which he offered as a justification for this crime . To suggest that religious militancy is the only crime that is picked up by the media or liberal groups is an intellectually dishonest claim . The spectacle of the flogging caught on video made the case more visual and hence caused more outrage than the other cases . <p> Reclaiming agendas <p> This defensiveness stems from a more common refrain used by the apologists of Islamists ' politics of violence -- that secular political forces are no better . Feminists , including myself , have persistently made this critique of not only liberal , secular men , but also of the state , as abusers of the political potential of women 's bodies and also because their acts sanction a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the Malala case falls outside of this framework . The concern of the Taliban in this case was not to regulate the girls ' sexualities ( although it may be elsewhere ) , nor to accrue material benefit , nor revenge for drones and nor was the purpose to restore ' honour ' , as some communities employ this motivational excuse in cases of VAW . In these non-theocratic cases , perhaps the GBV framework is a useful one . However , the Taliban are not hiding behind socio-economic or tradition based excuses . It is time for analysts to recognise the self-acclaimed agency of the perpetrators and clearly identify the victim in cases of VAW , rather than defend the criminal as victim and dissolve the crime as an abstraction . <p> The TTP has reminded us of the simple core of VAW and reiterated what feminists always knew - VAW removes any threat that the liberationist ' Woman ' may pose to the religio-patriarchal social order . If eliminating girls ' schools does not do the job , then a stronger signal of directly removing all agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may be harbouring plans to disrupt the Islamic order they seek to impose . Foreign donors scramble to rebuild schools , and the state attempts to resist militancy by giving symbolic significance to the services and resilience of girls such as Malala , in order to boost their public relations campaign in the fight against militancy in north Pakistan . Meanwhile , the Taliban have recovered the simple lesson of success achieved by direct action , and the symbolic value and immense ideological success available through the act of removing the obstacle .

I think its missing a decimal point . It is not almost a half billion pounds sterling . Further the civil list only exists because the royal estates all surrender their income to the government : the Duchy of Cornwall for instance -- that revenue used to flow to the Price of Wales but now is used to fund the civil list . further no mention is made of the fact that the Queen , technically the ' Font of Law ' now pays income tax . So I think the only issue to argue for or against the monarchy is the issue of the peerage in general . That concept has lost all real power , the House of Lords has been decimated -- so all you really have is the glory , the history and most importantly the great Tradition and the Crown : the ensign of which is the only object upon seeing Her Majesty bows . <p> May 30 , 2012 at 3:43 pm <p> Weatherbrain <p> And to address a comment here about the " audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of address , certain deferments and so forth , I am reminded of the second state visit of Her Majesty the Queen to the United States . She was receiving guests before the dinner during the reception and Cher was in line . When Cher greeted the Queen she said rudely " Why should I curtsy to you ? " To which the Queen replied in the most calm and measured tone " I believe it is customary . " The point is that these ' royals ' do n't ask anything -- custom and protocol dictate everything around them . So do n't blame them or imbue qualities or actions to them that are not theirs in truth . <p> May 30 , 2012 at 3:56 pm <p> Technical Vault <p> In answer to those who wonder why Brits keep these relics around it 's simple really , they 're the least worst option .

A sort of political placeholder so to speak . As for the social cost of having people born to rule , I 'm afraid that 's human nature .

A huge tourist industry that generates millions upon millions of visitors enthralled by the history , pomp and ceremony that is the Royal Family . The Queen and her family do an awful lot of work for the country , patronise hundreds of charities , and if anything , make Britain a more interesting and fun place to visit .

The US leadership is not naive to not know that Russia and China will always veto any major stand the US and EU take . Expecting the UNSC to approve a move to help build democracy is being stupid . Why would Russia and China the two non-democracies will approve building democracies anywhere and thus strengthening the hands of their rivals the US and EU ? Besides , if the people of Libya want a no-fly zone , who are Russia , China , or even the UN to interfere with their decision and create blockades in their way ? Why should the US insist on taking permission from Russia and China before helping Libya ? Of course because the US preaches democracy but it courts dictatorships around the world and the US really wants to maintain Gaddafi in power and also to crush the democratic revolution.All this talk of Afghanistan and Iraq is nonsense Afghanistan and South Iraq did n't ask for help . Kurds did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galbraith about it . Libya has asked for help . So why is giving them help illegitimate when the have asked for it ? The US is responsible for the massacre that is going on in Libya and it will be responsible for the crushing of democratic uprising in the Arab World Saudi Arabia has already quietened down . Obama 's hands are tainted with the blood of Libyans.Going by the Libyan case , we would be foolish to imagine that the US is even remotely interested in bringing democracy to the Arab World , least of all to Saudi Arabia.With a coward in the White House we should n't expect any kind of leadership from the US.When Libya burns and asks for help , Obama has the time to arrange sports dinners at White House .

( As is often the case , I du n no . ) Many thanks again to Sara for sending this in . <p> A couple o ' pics that are new on here ; the one on the left from 1965 , the one on the right from December 1968 , and both of them , co-incidentally , showing the same corner of the big living room . Here 's how it looks these days - the wall was knocked through in the ' 90s to create a second entrance from the hall : <p> The ' 65 pic has done the rounds recently , being part of a new Curvebender collection of Henry Grossman 's unseen Beatles stash ... and pretty amazing it all sounds too ; lots of Kenwood and Sunny Heights material , and much more besides . Sadly , for whatever reason they have priced it at a truly wince-inducing level , and certainly way beyond the means of the vast majority of people . A real shame that most will never even see a copy , let alone be in a position to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm is battering my window as I type , possibly akin to that affecting our boy 's hair . John , outside the front door at Kenwood , in typical fashion ; he really was most patient with ver fannage , was he not ? And once again , gratitude to Mark Lewisohn , not least for similar forbearance . <p> Early 1965 , and 3 photos featuring an anonymous Kenwood related person ; John 's renovations remain incomplete , to the extent that what turned out to be the most famous room in the house has n't even been built yet . The first , above , shows the door to the laundry , outside of which squat Julian plus said anonymous Kenwood related person , to the right of which would soon see the sunroom . Compare with the view a couple o ' years later : <p> John and Yoko would also be " photoed " on these very steps in December 1968 : <p> Second , and moving on to the boot : at last , an exact location - half-way up the front drive , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more anon ) : <p> Frontage and , moreover , etc : <p> Finally , and thank etc. , a spot o ' carpet beating outside the living room : <p> Ah yes , Kenwood . The above jo-anner must shurely be familiar to the upwards of several people who peruse this ... this . Squatting , as it did , in the den , I 'd always taken it for just another piano , one of several dotted about the titular pile . Would n't John have been composing in the attic , or in the sunroom , and not generally in the den ? Not in late ' 66/early ' 67 , as it turns out . Apparently , in 1971 , he had a plaque affixed to the side of the above stating the following : " On this piano was written : A Day In The Life , Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds , Good Morning Good Morning , Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite and many others . John Lennon 1971 " ( see I told you it was 1971 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John 's contribution to Sgt Pepper was actually composed in the den , now simply a simple room , squatting in a simple mansion , and shurely familiar to etc : <p> The piano ended up being sold at auction in Japan , though how it got there remains a mystery . Many thanks to the venerable Mark Lewisohn for scannage . <h> Monday , 29 October 2012 <p> The area around Montagu Square saw a great deal of the aforementioned " action " , no more so than in the mid-60s , when Neil Aspinall and Mal Evans shared a terraced house in one of the mews behind said Square , at number 16 . Them Fabs were photographed here on 1st December 1965 , supposedly " rehearsing " for their forthcoming ( and final ) British tour . A likely story . Still , the house has seen no major renovation since then ; note the fireplace : <p> John and George were captured on the other side of this room , beside the staircase : <p> Said staircase : <p> Heading up said staircase , one comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mal 's ) : <p> And up another floor to what would have been Mal 's bedroom ( or Neil 's ) : <p> They were n't here long , but while they were here , this is where they were . Or something . <p> Heath House was once a school , and , specifically , the school Julian attended during the Kenwood era . If you believe John ( and who would n't , I arsk yer ) , it was here that Lennon Jnr produced his daubing entitled Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds , so to inspire the song of that name , and give rise to the notorious acronym ... errr ... LITSWD . It 's been converted ( or re-converted ) to a house , and is currently on the market . In these very rooms , a little bit of Pepper was ground ( if you believe John , that is , and who would n't I etc . ) : <p> Twenty eight miles south-west of Dublin lies Luggala , site of the Guinness Estate , and last resting place of Tara Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His grave is one of three situated on the shore of Lough Tay , next to a structure known as the Temple : <p> Tara 's brother , Garech Browne , still lives on the estate , in the house which was the venue for Tara 's 21st birthday party , a bash apparently attended by Macca , amongst others . Here ' t is , the house , the graves , Garech , another bash , and some magikal goings on : <h> Friday , 12 October 2012 <p> Halloween hoves into view once more , does it not , and thus , at this spookiest time o ' the year , there is no better time to unveil the following jibber-jabber . So draw the curtains , put another ( oh get on with it , for f*ck 's sake ) ... The Beatles , as any fule no , spawned ( and occasionally did their best to encourage ) a ludicrous amount of over-interpretation . In this regard , precisely what the proportion of accident to design was in their latter oeuvre remains a matter of conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time they chucked material in purely to see what sort of ridiculous response they 'd get from lumpen " fannage " /critical mass . Ian Macdonald , one of the latter , regarded this as a very bad thing , tending to see it as tantamount to lighting fuses that trailed off into darkness with unforseeable consequences ( viz , for example , certain alleged aspects of Mansonism , etc . ) . Well , perhaps . That period of popular culture was , for many reasons , wide open to symbolism , real or imagined , and it 's certain that whatever the Beatles did would have been scrutinised for " meaning " . So they could n't really win . What 's also certain is that the scamps were still up to their old tricks ( if that they be ) on Free As A Bird . Lizzie Bravo recently sent a link to a little seen interview with Macca , circa Anthology , in which , tongue firmly in cheek , he points out that the backwards message towards the end of " Burd " can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - made for John Lennon " , and thus expressing post-mortem approval for the whole project . Palpable nonsense . At which point , as chance would have it , an odd blue flare rises on camera : <p> The director stops proceedings , and Paul laughs , as you would , joking to the effect that this is John once again making his presence felt . Yet should ye choose to freeze the interview , and zoom in on the bottom left hand corner , you might " see " something a little odd : <p> This , it does n't need to be said , is akin to seeing Ringo 's fizzog in a potato , and is drivel , though perhaps amusing , at a push slightly uncanny , but undoubtedly typical , in its way , of Beatle-ish accident ... or design . And I 'm sure there are better things I could be doing with my evening . ( Should ye wish to see the interview , it can be viewed HERE . And thanks , as ever , to Lizzie for the original link . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 1967 ( a Saturday , fact fans ) , ver lads assembled before the equally assembled press in order to proclaim the " message " du jour , via the medium of ... errr ... sandwich board : Love Is You Need ( errr .. someone clearly has n't thought this through ) . Thus manfully boarded did they strut , both in studio 1 , where preparations for the following day 's Our World broadcast continued apace , and just outside . A Beatle eye view of the grunters : <p> At some point , they de-sandwiched and headed downstairs to the canteen ; here are 3 lesser seen photos ( lesser seen by me , at any rate ) : <p> Hard evidence of tea drinking : <p> This , possibly , the high water mark of their cultural reach and group gestalt ( not the tea drinking in the canteen , but Our World ) , just post-Pepper , Brian still alive , and the four seeming very together , for the time being , at least : <p> To change the subject , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the old one back ( or even how to manage the new one ) ? <h> Monday , 17 September 2012 <p> A final helping of Apple , for now at least . Heading up a floor , we come to the press room ... or what 's left of it , which is n't much . In fact , this whole room has been reconstructed , with only the window wall intact from the Deggs-era . Then unt now above , and a couple of ' 69 shots below : <p> Just outside is a small windowless room which , I 'd guess , was once the " black room " , infamous dumping ground for the thousands of demos , scripts , etc. sent in following the following : <p> And that " infamous " room : <p> Ever upwards to the top floor , and the head of the stairs circa 1914 ; this rather ornate staircase was pulled out in the 1960s , pre-Apple , and the whole area was demolished in the 1970s : <p> Top floor , back and front , or north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple days , home to Apple Films and the kitchen . John and Yoko 's caviar bill was , apparently , on the indulgent side : <p> Finally , the roof , which requires no description : <p> Other than to say that it too has been completely rebuilt - but note how everything around it remains unchanged ; the chimney pots , or lack of them , make a good reference point : <p> The two Johns , so goes the story , had been up for days at Kenwood , fuelled by contemporary substances , when John spotted a TV news story concerning that evening 's 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Ally Pally . Psychedelic Roller duly commandeered , off they did trot . This pic shows the pair there , and lest there be any doubt about the chemical element ... the eyes have it . <h> Monday , 10 September 2012 <p> Foot-holding " action " in the master bedroom at Kenwood . Note the bedside literature in the picture below ; John , in common with the rest of them ( and with the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently in later years , and in Joycean fashion , he would read seven pages of seven books before sleep , covering such subjects as ancient history , anthropology and mysticism , amongst many others . But back to feet : <h> Friday , 31 August 2012 <p> As good an illustration as one might " hope " for of the manifold problems that " then unt now-ing " presents ; one corner of what once was the ground floor office of John &; Yoko , circa 1914 and 2006 . Note how the room has been reduced in size , and the entrance has moved walls . The bottom of the grand staircase ( itself subsequently replaced ) is visible through the 1914 door . Other aspects have survived , notably the fireplace : <p> Much of the detail of the room has gone , however . There seems a general tendency in renovation to favour the bland , possibly connected with prevailing notions vis-a-vis " property " that anything too individual or characterful will cause " potential next-buyer " problems . Whatever , they ca n't ( or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) : <p> Dragging " usselves " upstairs to the first floor , the long room overlooking Savile Row was the main board-room , ie the Beatles ' collective office , not over-used by the four for reasons of business ( and personal ) dissonance . Co-incidentally , it is also probably the space to have been least abused . 1914 v. 1968 : <p> 1968 v. 2011 . The fireplace is behind chipboard , and note how the spaces adjacent to the windows have been boxed in : <p> A close look reveals radiation : <p> The large wooden fireplace surround , an echo of grandeurs past , unmasked : <p> The other end of this room has seen some tinkering . Compare , again , if ye will , 1914 with 2011 : the door is the same , but hidden behind the screen in 1914 . Decoration still in-situ , though an arch has been inserted : <p> Thus , despite the odd cosmetic flim-flam , it 's pretty much as was : <p> See here , again ' 68 versus ' 11 : <p> Next up @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It 's still , however , astonishing to think that it 's been more than three decades since Foxton released an album as a solo artist with his name on the sleeve . <p> Back In The Room is that album -- and a fine piece of work it is , with songs that nod in the direction of his more high-profile past but with an arguably more mature and philosophical viewpoint .

##1430050 <h> Resolved Question <h> I can see aura colours on people and energy ? ( Only spiritual people please . ) ? <p> i have recently started seeing aura colours like mainly blue around people , and then the auras of colours like yellow having a purple aura and things like that . i also see what i believe to be some sort of energy its like neon outlines in blue and yellow around objects and people , but i havent met anyone around me that can see them and i thought that usually very spiritual people can see them but im just a normal girl . i do nt know much about these kind of things.so i was wondering if this is normal of me to see ? why can i see them ? what are they ? because of the answer i get on yahoo answers im starting to think maybe im going crazy . please no answers about ' retinal fatigue ' . brain tumours etc .. as i am aware of the effects of that . <h> Best Answer - Chosen by Voters <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill that can be learned . A psychology teacher taught our class how to see auras by putting ourselves into a soft-focus hypnosis . Since first seeing them , I can now see them when just relaxed and oddly , can see them around formerly living things like wood . I do not remember what the colors are supposed to mean , but that is certainly something you could find . Had my aura " cleansed " once by a Shaman and experienced a very positive and lasting effect . Continue exploring it . <h> Other Answers ( 9 ) <p> Seems like you are sensitive to vibrational energy ( a.k.a. auras ) given off by people , animals and various objects . You do n't have to be spiritual at all to see them . You 're ability to see auras is perfectly normal . You can see them because ( as previously stated ) you are sensitive to vibrational energy . They are ( also as previuosly stated ) vibrational energy that we see as colours , based on our emotion , awareness , and other factors based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as normal as you think you are . You are special to be able to see what you are seeing . <p> How far you choose to take it is up to you . But you can explore it further by perhaps mixing with like minded people and one of the safest environments to do this is within a spiritualist church . From this starting point it is possible to do classes or perhaps in time sit in a circle and let your special gift grow . <p> It 's really rare to have the ability to see others aura . Some people do have this gift Maybe your one of them Do n't worry about it too much , it may just be a phase and might go away Aura often tell the others ... ( I do n't know how to put it ) .. Atmosphere Or that 's what I heard . Your able to almost know someone 's inner strengths etc without meeting them or research It 's a gift you have ... Really do n't stress on it ... Accept it positively Some people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Humans do not emit visible light , and energy does n't work like you seem to think it does . It 's very common for kids your age to make this stuff up for attention , but we 'd all rather you did that in the religion section instead ( that 's why it 's there ) . This is the science section , and science says you 're making it up . Or hallucinating . If that 's the case , talk to a doctor . <p> The ' Aura ' you see is Karma on people , or their mood ( E.G Red-Angry/Evil Blue-Sad/Good Yellow-Happy etc. etc . ) If you 're seeing them on objects , I do n't know what that is , it 's probably the use of it ? I have no idea , I do n't see them on objects , just people . <p> Auras are the energy emitted off of people . Only psychics can see them . And very powerful psychics at that . You have a great power . I can explain and answer any questions you might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes auras are real . Our spiritual bodies are a little larger than our physical bodies ( hence feeling awkward when people stand to close ! ) . Saying that , seeing auras is of no account really . Even if you know what the colours mean , they are transient like our feelings so you cant really help people . My advice would be for you to stay well away from new ageyness . You are obviously 
##1432150 <h> Getting files in and out of the Teaching System <p> There are many ways to get files in and out of the Teaching System . The range of methods changes ( sometimes at short notice ) because of security considerations . The method you use depends on the size and number of files to be copied , where the other machine is ( some methods only work inside CUED ) , and who else will have access to the files . <p> If you 're regularly accessing Teaching System files from another CUED machine you might wish to set up a more permanent arrangement where your Teaching System files appear as a folder on your screen . See our Accessing your home directory from a Windows PC page . <p> Mail - you can post a file as an attachment from one machine and download it onto another . There are size restrictions on mail items . Also , the attached files are usually encoded , so you need to ensure that the mail program at the other end can cope with the encoded file . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies files using the same kind of security as " slogin " and " ssh " use . It 's available from the command line on some machines . On others it may be incorporated into a friendly interface . Single files or folders of files can be copied . If you want to use it to access the Teaching System from afar you 're currently restricted using gate . For example , if user abc1 was on a Mac in Australia and wanted to copy their work folder and everything under it from their home folder on CUED 's Unix Teaching System , they could do <p> WWW - anyone at CUED can put files on the WWW by putting them in their /publichtml folder . Once the files are made readable by all , anyone with a browser can download them onto their own machine . The only size restriction is that imposed by the usual disc-quota limits .

For more permanent arrangements , or group-based activities , see the ftp page . <p> ftpupload - if you want to let anyone use ftp to send files to you , read about ftpupload <p> memory stick , flash memory , flash drive - you can use the DPO machines <p> Big files might benefit from being compressed before transfer . You need to ensure that you can uncompress the file after transfer . Nowadays , programs that compress can usually bundle files up too . The most portable compression program on the Unix Teaching System is zip ( versions are available for MacOS , Windows , etc ) . On the Unix Teaching System typing <p> zip small big <p> will create a file called " small.zip " which will be a compressed version of the existing " big " file .

Quite scary to see my little bungalow with a huge plane passing by : - ) Mind you , I have seen a Lancaster Bomber going over the rooftops , and a Red Arrows team appearing to be flying along a nearby road ( they were above the rooftops but seemed a lot lower ) .... this was real not a CGI , both happened during air show/displays in Blackpool : - ) x <p> Lilian - I live in South Lincolnshire and we often get the Vulcan and Lancaster bombers and Spitfires flying over us - they are spectacular and so loud ! ! !

That seemed really spooky somehow - sent shivers down my spine : - ) <p> We get mainly military flights over here with the odd private jet because being not far from the RAF bases it 's military air space . OH has a box that connects to his computer which shows what 's flying around here . If someone we know is flying anywhere he can also track their planes because lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates a network . <p> It really is spectacular and it seems as though it is flying really slowly when you see it . It makes the ground vibrate when it goes over . It has been flying this year - I saw it over here a couple of months ago . It was too windy for them to risk flying it for the Jubilee flypast I think . <p> Yes . I know what you mean . The video footage makes it look like it 's going to fall out of the sky . Then it lights up . Not surprised they do n't risk it often in bad weather . It 's an old plane now I guess . <p> Just love the sound of the Spitfire . You just ca n't miss it .

We also get modern military jets here too because the Typhoons are based at Coningsby which is about 20 miles away . We noticed how quiet it was when they went to Northolt while the Olympics were on . We 're not far from the bombing range in The Wash so we get the military jets over here all the time - I think they use our solar panels as a point of reference ! <p> I envy you .

Opened in April last year , it was the first purpose-built intergenerational centre in the country , and offers everything from cookery sessions to zumba and street dance , to karaoke and murder mystery nights . More than 500 people use the centre each week . <p> Kim Norden , who manages the centre , says : " It is bringing people together and breaking down the stereotypes . Some older people might think that young people are all hoodies and some young people think that all old people are frail with walking sticks . They start to realise they have things in common despite the generation gap . It is lovely to see . <p> They start to realise they have things in common despite the generation gap .

She said she loves meeting people and she feels like part of the community , which makes her feel safer . " <p> Katie May , 44 , and her children Megan , nine , David , seven , and Laura , two , use the Acacia intergenerational centre . They go to zumba , cookery , gardening and arts and crafts sessions , while Laura also goes to the playgroup . <p> Megan says : " We go nearly every day . My mum likes doing zumba there and sometimes I do it too . My little sister sits in her chair but she knows all the moves and dances in her chair . I like fish and chip Friday -- we do n't just have fish and chips but when everybody has eaten we play bingo and and you can win prizes . <p> " I enjoy cooking the most . I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am older .

I have met young and old . I really like it . " <p> David says : " I like cooking the best . It is really fun . There are all ages there -- some adults , some children , some old people . I especially like fish and chip Friday , where we have bingo . " <p> Katie says : " The centre is there for us . The children get a lot out of it . They can chat to people of all ages . They learn to respect people of all ages . There are disabled people that go , older people and children younger than them . " <p> The Liverpool experience <p> In Liverpool , the local NHS brings young and old together through its active ageing programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Health NHS Trust , says the scheme started in response to concerns about anti-social behaviour from young people , so they wanted to foster links between young and old . Now local schoolchildren get involved in tai chi sessions for older people . <p> The younger people now see older people completely differently <p> Diane says : " It gives me a great buzz when I watch it , because when they first come in they want to stick within their little groups . We do ice-breakers and over time the young people come and sit with the older people and become quite protective of them . Often they do n't have any other interaction with older people in their day-to-day lives , or if they do it is negative , like kicking a ball into an older person 's garden and being shouted at . <p> " The younger people now see older people completely differently . Where they might have seen them as older people sitting in front of the television in their slippers , they now see them as active people who are willing to

##1440452 <p> The stop-signal paradigm is a useful tool for the investigation of response inhibition ( for a review , see Verbruggen &; Logan , 2008 ) . In 2008 , Gordon Logan , Michael Stevens and Frederick Verbruggen developed a free program , called STOP-IT , for running the stop-signal task . STOP-IT can be installed on computers running Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 , is available under the GNU General Public License . <p> Windows 2000/XP STOP-IT for Windows 2000/XP and can be download here . The main advantage of STOP-IT is that there is no need for additional programming . In addition , we also offer an analyzing program , called ANALYZE-IT . ANALYZE-IT can also be used out of the box and is automatically installed during the installation of STOP-IT . This second program allows users to estimate SSRT for every subject and it will calculate the means for all dependent variables of interest . <p> Additional notes : <p> We strongly advise users to read the instruction file , which can be found in the Startup folder , after installing the program . <p> You need administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not write the data to the output folder . <p> In the 2008 STOP-IT paper , it is mentioned that " The stimulus remains on the screen until subjects respond , or until 1,250 msec ( i.e. , the maximal RT ) have elapsed . " ( p.481 ) . However , in STOP-IT , the stimulus remains on the screen for 1,250 msec , regardless of the latency of the response . <p> Windows Vista/7 , Linux and OSX Because the original version of STOP-IT did not run well on Windows Vista/7 , we have created a new version which uses Matlab ( shareware ) / Octave ( freeware ) and the PsychToolbox . You can download it here . The installation is a bit more cumbersome . Instructions for can be found here ( these instructions can also be found in the zip-folder ) . <p> Unfortunately , the developers of Psychtoolbox have decided no longer to support Octave for Windows machines . So I am afraid that for now , you will need a Matlab license of a Linux/OSX machine if you want to use my code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows users though . <p> On the plus side , it is easier to change instructions ( simply by adjusting text files in any text editor ) 
##1441050 <h> Time reports <p> This section is about commands which control the appearance of the time reports . There are eight such reports , which show the pattern of usage over time . Six of them show the usage at specific times , whilst the Hourly Summary and the Daily Summary show the total ( not average ) activity at particular times of day and week over the whole time period of the report . <p> Each time report can contain columns listing the requests , requests for pages , and bytes transferred at that time , using the following code letters . <p> R <p> Number of requests <p> r <p> Percentage of the requests <p> P <p> Number of page requests <p> p <p> Percentage of the page requests <p> B <p> Number of bytes transferred <p> b <p> Percentage of the bytes <p> Which columns appear in which reports is controlled by various COLS commands . For example , the command <p> HOURCOLS Pb <p> tells analog to include the number of page requests and percentage of the bytes , in that order , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands are MONTHCOLS , WEEKCOLS , DAYCOLS ( Daily Summary ) , FULLDAYCOLS ( Daily Report ) , FULLHOURCOLS ( Hourly Report ) , QUARTERCOLS and FIVECOLS . There is also a TIMECOLS command , which specifies that all the time reports are to have the specified columns . Similarly , analog can plot the bar charts in the time reports according to the number of requests , number of page requests , or number of bytes . This is controlled by the GRAPH family of commands . So , for example , <p> FULLDAYGRAPH P <p> tells analog to plot the bar charts in the Daily Report by the number of page requests . This also controls how analog decides which is the busiest time period in the bottom line of the report . Using a lower case letter tells analog to plot the bar charts with ASCII characters instead of the normal red bars . ( This produces shorter output , and it is how they appear anyway in ASCII output style , or when viewed with a non-graphical browser . ) So , for example , <p> FULLDAYGRAPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without using the graphics . The other GRAPH commands are MONTHGRAPH , WEEKGRAPH , DAYGRAPH , HOURGRAPH , FULLHOURGRAPH , QUARTERGRAPH and FIVEGRAPH . There 's also an ALLGRAPH command to set all of them simultaneously . You can plot the graphs either forwards in time ( starting from the earliest date ) or backwards ( starting from the latest date ) . Use commands like <p> The other BACK commands are FULLDAYBACK , FULLHOURBACK , QUARTERBACK and FIVEBACK . It tends to be confusing to mix directions ( and analog will warn you if you attempt it ) so usually you want to use the ALLBACK command which will set all of them at once . For the more detailed time reports , you usually only want to list the last few time periods . ( Every five minutes for the last three years ? ? I think not . ) So analog provides some ROWS commands to let you specify how many rows you want in the time reports . For example <p> QUARTERROWS 96 # only the last day 's worth MONTHROWS 0 # 0 means no restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEEKROWS , FULLDAYROWS , FULLHOURROWS and FIVEROWS . Even if a ROWS command is given , the line at the bottom of the report will still show the busiest time period ever , not just the busiest one in that many rows . The character which is used for plotting the graphs in ASCII style or on a non-graphical browser is specified by means of the MARKCHAR command . For example , <p> MARKCHAR = <p> tells analog to use the equals sign . <p> There is a parameter called MINGRAPHWIDTH which sets the minimum nominal size of the graphs . For example , if you set <p> MINGRAPHWIDTH 10 <p> then the graph will be allowed to be up to 10 characters wide , even if that would exceed the PAGEWIDTH . <p> There is one more command which affects the time reports . You can specify which day should be counted as the first day of the week . This affects the layout of the Daily Report , Daily Summary and Weekly Report . For example , our local student newspaper publishes a new edition on the web every @ @ 
##1441752 <h> The Ethics of Playing the Unethical <p> Peter Fraser talks to Rosamund Pike , the ex-Bond girl who likes to take risks in her acting roles <p> Rosamund Pike is one of the UK 's most talented and adventurous actresses , mixing films of varying scale with the stage acting that she says she enjoys more than anything else . Indeed she confesses when I meet her that she pursues her film acting as a way to ensure that she can bring audiences to her work in the theatre and expresses concern that theatre audiences may be dwindling . Rosamund first came to widespread public attention in her role as Miranda Frost in the Bond film Die Another Day in 2002 before acting on stage in the acclaimed play ' Hitchcock Blonde ' , Roles have followed in Promised Land , The Libertine with Johnny Depp , John Malkovich and Samantha Morton , and Pride and Prejudice in 2005 in which Rosamund played Jane Bennett to Keira Knightley 's Elizabeth Bennett . <p> In Fracture , Rosamund plays high flying corporate lawyer Nikki Gardner whose looks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win a case against his sadistic nemesis Ted Crawford , portrayed by Anthony Hopkins . In the film Gardner is an enigmatic and amoral presence who Rosamund says she does n't agree with ' ethically , politically or even stylistically ' . So perhaps the obvious question is , what attracted her to the role ? <p> What attracted you to the film ? <p> Well it was the film rather than the part in this case . I said after Pride and Prejudice that I 'd like to do a thriller because it was the kind of thing that I have n't done and then this came along . I 'd seen Primal Fear , which was Gregory Hoblit 's most famous film , and I was so disconcerted by that film that I thought , " My goodness , this is something that he 's going to do really really well " and I just wanted to be part of it . <p> Would it be apt to describe your character Nikki as a latter-day femme fatale ? <p> I do n't know . I know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how she comes across then that 's fine but you ca n't really play someone like that . She is quite hard and she was quite hard to play . I think that in some ways she has that effect because the director deliberately wanted to pretty much play a single quality . He was n't so interested in trying to portray a three dimensional character . He did n't want a back story for instance . He wanted to capture the idea that these people always perform on a public stage , never in private . I always look for a character 's vulnerability because that 's what I 'm interested in . Gregory was always making me take the upper hand , take control and play the Alpha Female and every time I softened it or tried to give Ryan an easier time Gregory said " no " . So she comes across as really tough I think . The association of the femme fatale is with noir film and I love all that . I love the gloss of the film with slick , shiny LA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hitchcock is an obvious reference and you 've played a Hitchcock Blonde on-stage ... <p> Yes . I think also fairy tales . I mean we grow up and our , the very first stories we 're exposed to as children are thrillers really . Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel are thrillers in a way . They 're set in a world where things are not what they seem and terror lurks beneath the surface and I think that there 's something of that in a thriller when it 's made in a way that is fantasy as well as reality . The film is slightly Hitchcockian in the way it is shot and the entrances that people make . You rarely see people coming towards you in the film . They just slip into frame . There 's that wonderful shot in which you 're looking at someone and then they walk out of shot and you realise that you 're looking into a mirror . I love little things like that . <p> It 's interesting that you mention fairy tales because the film has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare these days . Willy , the central character , has a very definite moral choice to make at one point that could take him in one direction or another , which is quite reminiscent of a fairy tale or fable . Morally , the film is certainly a critique of the values of Ted Crawford , the Anthony Hopkins character , but do you think that it 's also a critique of the values that Nikki lives by ? <p> I do . Not many people have mentioned it but I think that it 's an anti-capitalist film in a way because Ryan 's character gets morality and gets a conscience halfway through the film . Nikki is trying to live her life without a conscience . I thought that was a lead into the character . We met these LA attorneys and I asked this woman , " How do you feel if you 're representing someone who you think is guilty and you get them a verdict of innocence ? What goes through your head ? " and she just looked at me she said " That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I thought : " Well that 's it . It 's just a game and Nikki has no moral qualms with it at all . " <p> I think it 's fair to say that the viewer is n't sure what kind of role Nikki is going to play in the overall plot until the very end , whether she 's central or peripheral ... <p> Well , she 's working at this corporate law firm and Willy has a choice between working for the greater good and the underdog or representing big high-powered clients . In other versions of the script her legal knowledge came to the fore more . Then David Strathairn was cast as the District Attorney and some of Nikki 's dialogue was taken away and given to him because of course with an Oscar nominee on board his role needed to be bulked out a bit . Of course we were all very pleased to have him but I sacrificed all my slightly more impressive legal language to him . <p> How did you find working with Ryan ? <p> I learned a lot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogates the script and pulls it apart . He refuses to say things whereas I 'm much more dutiful . I think it 's because I come from a theatrical background where you would never think to change a playwright 's lines . You would n't dream of acting in a Tennessee Williams play and saying , " Well I do n't think I 'll say that , I 'll say this instead . " Whereas in a film , people think it 's a complete free-for-all . The difference is quite interesting and in Fracture it comes off very well because Ryan does create this indelible character out of Willy and a lot of the lines are his , like the scene in which he talks about the various flavours of jelly beans . There 's the wonderful scene at the opera where he fluffs his line and gets the character 's name wrong because the name was changed in the script . They have to get permission from anyone who has the same name as a character in the script , all the Willy Nelsons or whatever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bob and Ryan got the name wrong but it just came off as the arrogance of the character for not having done his research properly . <p> Did you do much research for the role ? <p> There 's only so much you can do . I love to do preparation and throw myself right into something but there was n't that much I could do for Nikki apart from hang around down town and watch people go up and down in escalators and look slightly dodgy with a digital camera trying to take pictures of women that I thought might resemble Nikki . I realise that I must have looked pretty suspect . It was interesting that I stuck out there . People are quick to recognise an imposter in their midst . I was trying to belong in that fast moving business world

This Killer whale can be bought from Amazon although at 8.99 for the adult whale this is by no means cheap . The Killer Whale is about 20cms long and it is meant for children aged 3 and up however my 2 year old plays with this and there is no problem with this . <p> The Killer Whale is available in Mummy and in baby of which we have both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only concern when my 2 year old starts waving it around as if she let go it could easily do someone an injury . The killer whale is painted as you would expect in black and white and it has a little pink circle which is slightly indented about a quater of the way down it 's back from it 's head to represent it 's blow hole . <p> My daughter love playig with all the animals and they have a wide range to choose from , they play Mammy 's and Daddy 's with them as most of the animals in the range you can get both parents and a baby . The girls like to take this one in the bath along with the Dolphin and like playing splashing games with them much to my Mams dismay ! <p> The Killer Whale is fantastic , it is painted in block colour which is nice and simple and it is extremely durable , this toy has been played with for years now and it has stood the test of time .

##1448750 <h> The House Of Windsor <h> Elizabeth II <h> ( succeeded 1952 ) <p> Elizabeth II , eldest daughter of Albert , Duke of York ( later George VI ) and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon , was born in London on 21st April , 1926 at 17 , Bruton Street , Mayfair , the London home of her maternal grandparents , Claud , Earl of Strathmore and Nina Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck . In accordance with the accepted custom since the birth of James II 's son , the Catholic Old Pretender , in 1688 , the Home Secretary was present . <p> The new arrival was christened Elizabeth Alexandra Mary in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace , by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Cosmo Gordon Lang . Mary was the name of her grandmother , Mary of Teck and Alexandra that of her great-grandmother , the beautiful Alexandra of Denmark . <p> The baby Elizabeth was not in the direct line of succession and it was at the time assumed that her father 's older brother the charismatic and popular David , Prince of Wales , would marry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of a second daughter , Princess Margaret Rose on 1st August , 1930 at Glamis Castle in Angus , Scotland . Elizabeth was a great favourite with her paternal grandparents , George V and Queen Mary , the King , in particular , doted on Lilibet , as she was known in the family , although inclined to be gruff with others , he was excessively fond of her . She experienced a secluded childhood and was educated by a Scottish governess , Miss Crawford , within palace walls and later by the Provost of Eton . <p> On the abdication of her uncle , Edward VIII , in 1936 , her father unexpectedly succeeded to the throne as George VI . <p> During the Second World War , Elizabeth was allowed by her parents to be called up for national service with the A.T.S , her first experience of being able to mix with ordinary girls . She served as Second Lieutenant Elizabeth Windsor . On VE night in 1945 , Elizabeth and Margaret were allowed to mingle with the celebrating crowds outside Buckingham Palace , an experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they joined in the spirited revelries with enthusiasm . <p> As a teenager the Princess Elizabeth began to assume some official royal engagements . On the occasion of her twenty-first birthday she made a speech dedicating her life to the service of her future subjects . <h> Prince Philip of Greece <p> Before the end of the war years Princess Elizabeth fell in love with the blonde and handsome Prince Philip of Greece , her father , George VI , although he liked Philip , would not at first give his consent for the marriage , doubting whether his daughter 's affections would remain fixed on the first young man she had met . <p> In the intricate web of royal genealogy , Philip was twice Elizabeth 's cousin , being also descended from Queen Victoria , as are many of the royal houses of Europe . He was the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg . The Greek Royal House were an offshoot of the Danish Oldenburg dynasty , who were invited to take up the throne of Greece . <p> Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice , the second daughter of Queen Victoria , who had been married to Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse , making the couple third cousins from their shared English descent . They are also second cousins once removed by their shared descent from the House of Denmark . The Queen 's great-grandmother , Alexandra of Denmark , was the sister of Philip 's grandfather , Prince William of Denmark , later to become George I of Greece . <p> Philip had been born in Corfu on 10th June , 1921 , on a kitchen table at the villa of Mon Repos , but his family had been forced into exile . His parents drifted apart and his mother , who was deaf , suffered a severe breakdown , while his father adopted a playboy lifestyle . <p> Under the auspices of his maternal uncle , Lord Louis Mountbatten , Philip was educated in Britain at Gordonstoun , in Scotland and had later entered Dartmouth Naval College . Whilst on leave during war service he had become very interested in the young Princess Elizabeth . She accompanied her parents and sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her return , her feelings for Philip still constant , her father at last agreed to their engagement . <p> Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20th November , 1947 , at Westminster Abbey . Phillip , who took his mother 's Anglicized surname of Mountbatten , had become a naturalised British subject and had been created Duke of Edinburgh by his prospective father-in-law prior to the marriage . <p> The couple 's first child , Prince Charles Phillip Arthur George of Edinburgh , later Prince of Wales was born the following year and a daughter named Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise , later created Princess Royal arrived on 15th June , 1950 . Both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth doted on these grandchildren . As the King 's health , never robust , continued to deteriorate , Elizabeth and her husband took on more royal duties and official tours on her father 's behalf . <p> Elizabeth and Philip were on tour in a remote part of Kenya when George VI died in his sleep at Sandringham on 6th February , 1952 . The onerous task of informing her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne fell upon her husband . She was proclaimed Queen on the 8th of February , 1952 . On the insistence of the Queen 's grand-mother , Queen Mary , it was announced that the Queen and her heirs should continue to be known as the House of Windsor , to carry on the name of the dynasty founded by her husband , George V. The decision irked the forthright Philip , who is reported to have angrily exclaimed " I 'm a bloody amoeba ! " . <p> Elizabeth II 's reign has witnessed the dismantling of the British Empire . Prince Philip has attempted to modernise the ancient institution of monarchy , he reorganized the royal household , instituted the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and more controversially , allowed an informal television film to be made covering the royal family 's life style . <p> A further declaration was issued by the Queen regarding the family surname in 1960 stating that while she and her heirs would continue to be known as the House of Windsor , her descendants not inheriting the throne would take the surname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of the Queen and her husband , Prince Edward will succeed to his father 's title of Duke of Edinburgh . <p> The assassination of Philip 's uncle , Lord Mountbatten , by the provisional IRA in 1980 , shook the royal family to the core , particularly affecting the sensitive Prince Charles . Mountbatten had been spending a family holiday at his second home of Mullaghmore , County Sligo , when a bomb , which had been planted on his boat in Donegal Bay had exploded . Prince Charles had shared a particularly close relationship with his great-uncle and mentor , referring to him as his " honorary grandfather " , he was known to find communication with his father difficult . Mountbatten was given a state funeral at Westminster Abbey at which a visibly shaken Charles read the lesson . <p> The behaviour of some of the younger members of her family has often evoked criticism of the monarchy and the marital relations of her children have often been the cause of endless negative media attention . Princess Anne , married to Captain Mark Phillips , divorced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divorcees but the Church of Scotland did not , Anne married for a second time to Commander Timothy Lawrence at Crathie Kirk in Scotland , near the Queen 's Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire . <p> This was followed by the very public collapse of the marriage of Andrew , Duke of York to Sarah Ferguson . Scandal threatened to engulf the House of Windsor when the tabloids published photographs of the Duchess of York , topless and in compromising positions with her ' financial advisor ' , John Bryan . <p> The marriage of the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer ran into difficulties even in its early stages . Ill matched from the outset , both partners had engaged in extra-marital affairs and their marriage had become little more than a sham , endured for the benefit of the public . Their problems were endlessly very publicly aired and Charles infidelities exposed in a book by Andrew Morton , whom the Princess collaborated with . <p> The Prince and Princess of Wales drew the monarchy into further disrepute by their on-going feud and public point scoring over each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waleses . After the Princess appeared on the television programme , Panorama , admitting involvement in Morton 's book and an affair with an army officer , Major James Hewitt , the Queen advised them to divorce , for the sake of their children and to limit the escalating damage to the monarchy . <p> The marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales ended on 28th August , 1996 . On the death of the much loved and immensely popular Diana in a car accident in Paris on 31st August , 1997 , the Prince of Wales ' popularity reached its nadir . He and the royal family came under criticism for what the public perceived as its ill treatment of Diana and they were accused by the press of being cold and unfeeling , slow to react to and out of tune with the feelings of the nation . <p> The Queen has striven since then to alter these perceptions of the royal family and despite the marital difficulties of her children remains an uncontroversial figure .

Many have suggested recycling as a way out of the mass deposit of waste across the country .

Recycling companies will need no persuasion before helping to clear the waste since the rubbish is as good as the raw materials they use in manufacturing their goods .

##1455051 <p> The Roi des Belges began its life last summer in a barn in rural Sussex . A marriage of Plymouth steel and magenta-stained timber , it 's a strange little vessel dignified by its nods to Heart of Darkness , Roi des Belges being the name of the boat Joseph Conrad took up the Congo in 1889 . It would take five months , a police escort and a crane to bring it to where it stands now : on the roof of London 's Queen Elizabeth Hall by the Thames . <p> As a structure , it is a giddy and beautiful thing with broad windows offering views along the river . While its presence is in part aesthetic , its purpose is also practical : devised by Living Architecture and the arts organisation Artangel , and given the additional name A Room for London , the boat will , for much of its 12-month rooftop residency , operate as a very special one-room hotel . <p> However , for a number of days each month as part of the Cultural Olympiad , it will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers and thinkers , a sprinkling of uncategorisable performances ( including Orson Welles 's unfilmed screenplay for Heart of Darkness and David Byrne talking about bicycles ) and a monthly musical event . <p> Watch Andrew Bird in conversation with Laura Barton , discussing A Room for London Link to this video <p> A year ago , Michael Morris , co-director of Artangel , invited me for a glass of wine . It was n't such a curious invitation . Michael and I often email each other about shared musical interests : Edward Sharpe &; the Magnetic Zeros , the Low Anthem , Lou Reed . But this time , Michael had a specific proposal : would I help to curate Sounds From a Room , 12 miniature concerts to be held in the ship ? <p> I agreed , of course , and we met several times thereafter , attending gigs of potential performers , brainstorming possible artists , and deciding that , owing to the size of the boat , we could really only invite solo acts or duos . It grew increasingly tricky . I took to scrawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me -- standing on the Victoria Line struck by the idea of James Blake , Tunng or Kate Rusby , ; suddenly wondering about Gold Panda while baking a clementine cake . <p> There were logistical problems , of course . How does one track down Chuck Berry ? If we sweet-talk Jerry Lee Lewis into doing it , can we winch a piano up ? And of course there were disappointments , delays , illnesses and endless emails as we attempted to tally touring schedules , album launches , holidays . I now know more about amps , acoustics and the specific requirements for looping violins than I ever thought possible . Perhaps the hardest part was simply explaining precisely what the project was and that , no , we had not taken leave of our senses . " It 's a boat ? " they would say . " On a roof ? " And then a pause . " Where will the audience be ? " <p> Crucial to the whole idea is the notion that these should not be regular gigs . The space is meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and the busy thoroughfare , it is a strangely tranquil spot , and we hoped that this might influence visiting writers and musicians . For the musical strand , players will board the boat the day before their performance , giving them time to acclimatise and consider their performance . They can use the space any way they please , playing in the belly of the ship , in the library , or on the viewing deck . . <p> Inside the boat itself , there will be no audience : just a couple of camera operators , perhaps a handful of the artists ' friends . The shows will instead be streamed live -- free -- via the Room for London website , as well as the Guardian 's music site . And there will be a large-screen streaming of each event inside the Queen Elizabeth Hall . <p> We have decided to announce the lineup in three-month bursts .

##1462452 <p> See " No need to take notes ? they 'll be on the website " The Internet and Virtual Learning Environment may or may not radically change teaching , but the technology which has probably made most difference in the past fifty years has been cheap , on-site , duplicating copying and printing . Among other things , it has radically changed student expectations ? and the more conversant teachers become with computers and printing , the higher the expectations get . <p> Handouts are an integral part of the teaching and learning system . <p> That is to say , they make a difference to other elements in the system : they are not neutral add-ons , because their very existence ( or non-existence ) has an effect on the process of the class . <p> Give out a comprehensive handout at the start of the class : why should anyone stay to hear you say it when they can read it ?

Next time they wo n't bother . <p> Do you want students to take notes ? Would it help them to understand the material for themselves ? Then do n't use handouts . <p> Do you want them to concentrate on the session itself ?

At the other end of the scale , glossy and slick productions by some commercial training providers acquire a spurious authority , and often suggest that the trainer is a mere functionary rather than a professional who generates her own material . <p> All handouts should have plenty of white space for students ' own notes : use wide margins , and leave substantial gaps between topics ( if you print these pages out , you will find I have tried to facilitate that ) . <p> They should clearly flag the structure of the topic , using headings and sub-headings to show the relative importance of points ? the structure is easily lost in a lecture . <p> Relevant graphics are useful , particularly if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in copying them down : but be careful about clip-art merely to " brighten up " the presentation . <p> Students can be intimidated by vast wodges of paper : try not to make them too big . <p> On fonts for dyslexic readers , go here There is considerable debate about the most suitable type-face for dyslexic students .

##1464150 <p> This photograph shows a 17hand nine year old Irish Draft/Thoroughbred mare who has done all riding club activities as well as affiliated Pre-novice eventing . She is a very genuine and easy-going soul , and it may come as a surprise to anyone looking at this photograph to know that she is actually very long backed . That she looks so in proportion here is a tribute to how well she is being ridden by someone who is a BHS qualified Intermediate teacher and a senior coach within my network . <p> The horse needs to be just a fraction more out on the end of the rein , putting her nose on instead of a little behind vertical . But there is a very good ' power lift ' to her movement . This term was coined by an artist friend of mine , who knew little of the technicalities of dressage , but who could draw that quality with just a few strokes of a crayon . There is a lovely connection along the mare 's top line , all the way from her tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of her body were hung from that line . This gives her the ability to move her limbs very freely , and instead of plonking down heavily onto the ground , she appears more weightless than she is . <p> A colleague of mine who is a senior figure in the judges training programme in America tells the story of attempting to start a discussion amongst the trainers about ' throughness ' . She felt that they needed better ways of describing it , and teaching their trainees to see it well . Everyone was so stumped for words , however , that the discussion fell rather flat . So that evening she cornered her roommate , and refused to give up until she came up with a good description . ' Well ' , said her colleague ( after much sighing and head scratching ) , ' it 's as if there 's a line of dominoes all along the horse 's back and crest , and all the dominoes must be pointing forward . As soon as one of them is n't , the horse is not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the originality of this description , and how effectively it does indeed describe ' throughness ' . But her colleague was disturbed by her laughter . ' What 's so funny ' , she said , ' does n't everyone see it like that ? ' <p> Thinking in mages like this gives us great scope for ingenuity , and often says it far better than literal descriptions . I love the idea , for instance , of the horse moving on round wheels instead of square ones . ( The horse in the picture would definitely have round wheels . ) This idea was coined by the husband of a client of mine , who saw with innocent eyes the changes in his wife 's horse . <p> I also like to think of the muscle chain from each of the horse 's hind legs to his poll like a pair of hosepipes , running just to each side of his spine and crest . Sometimes those hosepipes are full of the kind of debris that might accumulate over a winter , and the water has to power through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rider must not land on those hosepipes with so much force that she blocks the water flow . The saddle too must not constrict them . And the water must flow as a constant stream -- not in the kind of spurts that can happen after an air lock . And this , in turn , could make the horse look like he has square wheels , or as if he has the kind of ' kangaroo petrol ' that can make your car splutter and lurch as you start it on a cold morning .... <p> Without images , my teaching would loose an awful lot of its impact and its clarity . This is the language that appeals to the right brain hemisphere , which thinks in picture and ' feelages ' rather than words . So the words satisfy the left ( literal , language ) brain whilst the picture speaks to the right , and with both sides of your brain engaged in the action , you take in far more than you would if I remained literal . An anatomy lesson about the muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movement might well have its place , but you would find it rather dull , and easy to forget . And since it is the right brain hemisphere that does the riding , this theoretical knowledge will leave you no better off ... <p> This is why reading books about riding does not make you a better rider . Your left brain can recite the theory , but your right brain has still not ' got it ' . We all ' get it ' in stages , especially when our starting point is not that great . The rider in the photograph has got many facets of riding working really well -- so well that she has been able to bring this horse into a really nice carriage by the use of her torso and thigh . She has not resorted to ' kick and pull ' , which can never yield this degree of ' through ' , ' reaching ' and ' unscrunched ' . <p> Her hands , for instance , are clearly out in front of her ( as if she were pushing a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly on tiptoe , and it would be better to see her heel level with her toe if not slightly down . Leveling out her foot would bring her knee slightly further down and back on the saddle , which would give a more classical look . <p> Overall , the angles of her body are good enough , and at this phase of the stride in rising trot one would expect to see her body inclined slightly forward . She would land on the riding arena on her feet if we took the horse out from under her by magic , but she might then wobble a bit . Change the knee and foot slightly and she would be secure . <p> The biggest change she needs to make , however , concerns the ' A frame ' made by her thighs . This is too tight at her knee , and not narrow enough at the top of the thigh and across her back . The extreme of ' grip with your knees ' can make the rider look as if she would ' ping ' backwards off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' relax your knee , take your thigh off the saddle ' never gets hold of the horse 's rib cage enough to draw it upwards into the carriage you see here . Although it is often said , it is not what really good riders do . <p> The rider literally does hold the horse in an ' A ' frame . This is a more profound concept than you might realise as you read these words , and it gives the rider an even contact down the inside of the thigh from the tendons at the corner of the pubic bone down to the knee . I like the idea of the thigh being ' snug ' against the saddle , although many people who have ridden with their thighs off the saddle make this change and tell me that they feel as if they are gripping . Remember to notice this next time you ride , and compare yourself to the ' A ' frame ideal . <p> The ' A ' frame too must be in the right place , and it is the need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused this rider to over-emphasise the contact in the lower thigh and knee . This horse could easily look as if there were more horse behind the rider than there is in front of her , and it can help the rider to think of herself like a napkin ring around a napkin . If the napkin ring can , as it were , take a step back around the napkin , more napkin is then in front of it . The horse 's shoulders and neck can then reach out infront of the rider , and can fill up with ' stuffing ' ( as they would in a brand new stuffed toy horse ) . <p> This idea is especially helpful on backward thinking horses , who effectively keep saying ' you go first ... after you , ' . Some can even feel as if they are trying to crawl out backwards from under you , and their attempts to not go can leave you feeling powerless as you flounder about on their neck . Nothing you do will work until you get your centre of gravity back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ' A ' frame and bring it far enough back on the horse 's torso . <p> In keeping her ' A ' frame back enough , this rider has made its arms are too parallel , but despite making this mistake she is having a very good effect on the horse . If she could close the ' A ' frame behind her and begin her bear down in her back ( which I do not have the space to explain to 
##1464151 <p> This horse is an eleven-year-old thoroughbred mare , who was a chaser until she was nine . Her owner used to ride out for the horse 's trainer , and bought the horse at the end of her racing career . Two years on the mare is much saner than she was , although her owner tells me that her tendency to be sharp , spooky and stupid has resulted in a fair few ' dodgy moments ' . Getting her attention , apparently , is one of the hardest facets of riding her , and some beatings in her racing days have left her so nervous that the rider can not carry a stick . Our rider had hoped to event the horse , but she did not settle to a new jumping style , and has become much more happy and relaxed as a dressage horse . They have done a few affiliated Preliminary Dressage competitions . To begin with , the horse was very hollow and backward thinking , and her rider feels hugely relieved that she can now get her to go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hurdle , the latest problem seems to be that she would now like to overbend . Her rider wants to know how she can progress from here . <p> Firstly , I think she deserves our congratulations for surviving the transition from racehorse to dressage horse . Even with very good riding skills this is not easy , and two years is probably about the time it takes to wipe the slate clean , establish a new outlook on life , and develop some new movement patterns and a new musculature . <p> This is a nicely made horse , moving quite well . Although the rider tells us that it is hard to get her horse 's attention , here at least she has succeeded well . Notice that the horse 's ears are sideways rather than pricked , as they would be if she were admiring the view . She is close to tracking up ( where the hind hoof steps into the footprint left by the front hoof ) . She is , as her rider says , slightly overbent , and as well as this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to poke her nose towards us out of the photograph . The way that she is looking to the inside is not actually a correct bend , and the contact on the inside rein is also not quite correct . This is too subtle an evasion to deal with in this article . <p> The rider 's stirrups are very short . However , given that her history includes riding racehorses , it is not surprising that this is how she likes to ride . ( I suspect that she would actually like to be shorter , and that she already feels as if she has made enough of a concession towards dressage ! ) It is amazing how altering your stirrups by one hole can made you feel either like a jockey , or as if you are floundering around with no stable base of support . And yet the change in length is half of the distance between each hole , and probably no more than half an inch . How delicate our balance is on a moving horse ! How sensitive we are to change -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial horrors of feeling different . The ideal angle for the thighbone is about 45 degrees to the ground , and our rider 's thigh is more horizontal than this . The angle of her hip and knee joints , however , match each other quite well . Although she is somewhat on tiptoe , her foot is in about the right place . I suspect that she would just about land -- and remain -- on her feet if we took her horse out from under her by magic . <p> The rider in a good flatwork balance , and the rider folded down over a fence in jumping position , should both be in balance over their feet . So should the rider positioned anywhere on the continuum inbetween these extremes . To understand this , stand in an ' on horse ' position with a shoulder/hip/heel vertical line . This places your shoulder seam over the boney knoble at the top outside of your thigh , which is over the boney knobble of your ankle . Ideally test this by standing sideways on to a large mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning forward or back , and/or rounding or hollowing your back . Gradually fold down into jumping position , pausing frequently along the way . As your backside goes backwards and your shoulders come forwards you ' fold down like an ironing board ' ( a wonderful description from jumping trainer Pat Burgess ) . Our rider here is essentially in balance whilst being part way into that fold , and the angles of her hip and knee would be absolutely appropriate for working on the flat between fences . If she were indeed doing this , we would conclude that her biggest problems lay at each end of her body . Her ' iffy ' heel would let her down over a fence , and she is rather scrunched at the back of the neck , with her chin up , as if she herself is ' above the bit ' . Fortunately for her , this tightness has not translated through to her horse . <p> The angle of the thighbone is critical to the rider 's effectiveness , for the thigh acts like a lever and helps her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on horse ' flatwork position , and stay there for a while . With no horse to hold you up , the quadriceps muscle at the front of your thigh works hard , just as it should when you are riding . If instead you treat the horse like an armchair and rely on him to hold you up , this thigh muscle relaxes , the horse supports your weight , and you become a much greater burden to him . <p> This is the biggest danger of having the thigh more horizontal than the ideal of 45 degrees to the ground . With the backside more down and the knee more up , the rider is more likely to put all her weight on her backside and to squash the horse . To her credit , our rider is not doing this , and her light frame makes her less vulnerable to this mistake . The more the rider 's weight is spread down her whole thigh the more leverage she creates as the weight acting at her knee counterbalances the weight of her upper body . The pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is testament to the muscle work involved . . This effort does more than simply stopping you from squashing the horse -- it can actually enable you to act like a suction device , drawing his back up under you . The dressage horse who looks beautiful has lifted through his back and shortened his belly muscles , just as you would in a slight abdominal curl . The top of his neck then elongates and the underside of the neck softens . When the rider uses her thigh muscles to draw the horse 's back up it is as if she actually hangs the saddle and the horse ( as well as her lower leg ) off those muscles . This is not for the faint-hearted ! <p> Many riders imagine that they should be striving for a vertical thigh , but with the thigh more vertical than 45 degrees , leverage is again lost . Without the knee in front of the hip , all of the rider 's weight is taken in the centre of the horse 's back , just where he tends to hollow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so should the rest of us . Use a mirror or a friend to check this for you next time you ride . However terrible you feel when you first alter your stirrups , realise that you will adapt to the change in a surprisingly short time . The horse 's neck is another lever . Think of his head as a weight on the end of a long pole , and to fully appreciate the point , hold a reasonably heavy object in your hand with your arm straight and horizontally out in front of you . Before long the muscles along the top of your upper arm will start to ache . These equate to the muscles at the base of the horse 's crest . When the horse starts to overbend , to drop his head down towards the ground , or to become heavy in your hand , these muscles are tiring . The long back muscles under the panels of the saddle also play a role in that counterbalance and they too are tiring . The horse that is above the bit holds his neck up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no good , it seems to fatigue him less , perhaps because he is then running on adrenaline . We all know horses that can keep going like this for hours ! <p> Again it is the rider 's thighs which can help the muscles along the top of the crest to do their job . Sit on a chair , and put the fingertips of one hand in the angle between your leg and your body . Then lift your knee , and you should feel two tendons that stick up rather like taught pieces of rope . Do this several times , and then put your other hand on your knee and hold it down as you attempt to lift it . Your knee does not move , but your tendons stick up . This , together with that 45 degree angle , creates the muscle use that most helps the horse to use his back and neck muscles well . Without moving your knee , activate your tendons like his when you ride . <p> Remember , though , that both you and he will tire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expect him to overbend and/or to become heavy in your hand . Be a just and fair task-taster for both of you , and appreciate that his generousity is the greatest gift that he can 
##1464152 <p> The photograph shows a 12 year old girl riding her Section D Welsh pony mare in a showing class . Her mother tells me that they bought the pony at a Welsh auction as a three year old , and backed her themselves . She adds , ' Storm works well at home but at shows she gets very tense ... her show always looks rushed , and this is the comment the judges always give ... we think that if she worked as well at shows as she does at home , she could make first place at good shows ' . <p> What a lovely picture of a well-ridden pony . Storm is tracking up well in trot , and the angle of the cannon bone on the hind limb matches the angle of the upper part of the forelimb . This tells us that the hind leg is being bought well underneath the body -- she is pushing herself along with her hind legs instead of pulling herself along with her forelegs . She is reaching nicely into the rein , with her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest point of her neck ( although the flying mane stops this from being your first impression ) . <p> However , the pony could be more ' in front of ' Sam . If you draw two circles in your mind , one from the rider back , encompassing the horse 's loins , quarters and hind legs , and one from the rider forward , encompassing the horse 's shoulders , neck and head , there is more horse in the back circle than there is in the front one . Although the pony may actually have a long back , more skilful riding would change this look , elongating her neck to equalise the circles . <p> If Storm were truly ' in front of ' Sam , I think that much of her show-related tension would disappear , and this is the challenge that faces Sam as her rider . Notice how the pony is holding her upper lip . This is the sign of a stressed horse , and the phrase ' stiff upper lip ' has more truth to it than you might imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses and people ) tells us what is happening in the limbic system , which is the seat of the emotions . I well believe that this pony takes hot and sensitive ( as most Welsh ponies are ) to the edge of being emotionally delicate , and if she acts like a tank at shows , her apparent ignorance is a cover-up for her delicate nature . <p> Sam is doing a tremendous amount right , and has a lot going for her as a rider . Notice the angle of her thigh , which lies , as it should , at about 45 degrees to the ground . However , we could criticise her lower leg position , as her calf is vertical and she would not land on her feet on the grass if her pony were taken out from under her by magic . Her straight vertical line from ear to shoulder to hip brushes the back of her heel instead of extending down to her ankle bone . ( I 'm sure that this is the showing world 's interpretation of that shoulder/hip/heel line . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her body being ' all of a piece ' : She fits so well on this pony , and is not making many of the most common and killing mistakes . <p> There is a very good straight line from her elbow to her wrist to the pony 's mouth , although her wrists appear to be slightly rounded The line of her back is very good , and her upper body has a martial arts type stance , complete with her seat bones pointing down , her ribs down towards her hips , and her stomach muscles bearing down . Only about 3% of riders organise themselves as well as this ( and a remarkable number of good adult riders started their competition career in showing , which at least encourages them to develop good riding skills ) . This is an enviable start , and I hope she will take her skills beyond the world of showing into eventing or dressage , where she could have potential to get herself talent spotted , and to do really well . <p> Let 's give you some contrasts so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what Sam is doing . Sit on a hard chair on your hands , with your palms facing down . Your seat bones should be pretty ( if not painfully ) obvious to you . Arrange your pelvis and spine so that they are pointing straight down . Then slouch by dropping your chest and rounding your back , and realise that this makes your seat bones point forward . Pass through ' down ' again on your way to hollowing your back , which points your seat bones backwards . Now grow as tall as you can . Your seat bones point even more back , your stomach sucks in , your back hollows , your chest lifts , and your breathing practically stops ! <p> Sam is not growing tall in this way . Neither is she slouched . That martial arts stance keeps her seat bones pointing down , and anyone who habitually either hollows or rounds her back would feel very strange if I rearranged her into the position Sam is using here . But even if it feels wrong to you , can you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rigorously by placing your chair sideways on to a large mirror . Then you can turn your head to check that your are not leaning forward or back , and to check that the line of your back shows minimal curves . <p> Sam 's rightness is enhanced by the use of her stomach muscles , and this adds the power that enables her to look as if she is cruising along on this horse doing nothing . <p> With your seat bones pointing down and your feet flat on the floor , put one hand under your sternum , and put the thumb and first finger of the other hand each side of your spine at waistband level . Then clear your throat . You should feel your muscles push out against your hands . Put your hands on your sides and repeat the experiment . Then place the fingers of one hand half way between your belly button and your pubic bone , and clear your throat again . <p> Sam is riding as if she is doing this permanently . I first called this use of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that ' bear out ' might have been a better term , since it does not make you sit heavier . Wherever you have soft tissue , i.e. in the entire band around your waist between your ribs and your hips , and all down your abdominal muscles from your sternum to your pubic bone , your guts push against your skin . Think of pulling your stomach in , making the muscles into a wall , and then pushing against that wall . It is as if your torso were a jam jar or a baked bean tin , and the contents of the tin are under pressure , pushing against the edges , but without deforming the shape of the container . <p> The next difficulty arises with the need to breathe and bear down both at the same time . This requires diaphragmatic breathing , which will be familiar to you if you have learnt to sing or play a wind instrument . In this , the ribs expand outwards but do not lift up : think of the air being drawn down into your abdomen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in . Bearing down whilst breathing well is a big deal for most riders -- I suggest that people practice whilst driving their car , for this has to become a way of life . Sam is one of the very few people to discover this so young that she has already ingrained it as a correct pattern in her body . To her it probably feels perfectly normal , as if she is doing nothing -- but her version of ' nothing ' would be very different from most other people 's ' nothing ' ( and after another ten years of practicing riding well , her ' nothing ' will make her a phenomenally powerful rider ) . <p> I would enjoy the chance to help Sam build on the tremendous start she has made , so that she learns how to recognise and create the feels which define ' right ' . This will give her progressively more influence over her horses , and make her into an effective , sensitive rider with tremendous feel . Basically , there are two types of good riders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it look as if they are having an easy ride when they are actually contending with all sorts of difficulties . The second type develops the tools to solve those problems and to influence the horse for the better . The first group make good auction and competition riders , but do not train horses well . The second group train horses with great skill

The first step would be to REGISTER for free so you can take advantage of all the features we have to offer . <p> Despite the information leaking early , as it so often does , the MINI JCW GP was just officially released , confirming the specifications that leaked yesterday . <p> With more horsepower , an overboost function that takes torque to the next level and loads of performance parts , the hottest MINI to date is a track-ready road car . At 218 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque at 1,750 rpm , the little car proved to be a real rocket while running around the Nurburgring , setting a 8:23 lap time on the North Loop . <p> Further emphasizing the car ? s track ready handling , MINI increased camber on both the front and rear tires in an effort to improve grip and steering during high-speed driving . Sitting inside those tires , larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer better stopping power than lesser models . <p> Drag is also reduced thanks to a fully-enclosed underside , rear diffuser , new rear spoiler and front bumper modifications . An individually adjustable coilover suspension will also allow for the car to be lowered as much as 20 millimeters ( .79 inches ) . <p> The car will be produced in a limited run of only 2,000 units . Pricing has only been announced for the U.K. so far at 28,790 which converts to about $45,850 , though that isn ? t an accurate reflection of what to expect . Expect the car to make an appearance later this month during the Paris Motor Show . <p> Official spy photos of the Mini Paceman were released by the company recently which showed off the car sporting a bit of camo , but now we have full photos of the new three-door Countryman . <p> The Paceman sits 0.4 inches lower than the Countryman and loses 1.6 inches in overall height , giving it a more aggressive coupe stance than the standard car . Mini has confirmed that there will be two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard car , and 181 in the Paceman S. It has also lost 44 lbs compared to the standard Countryman , which will make it a quicker car . <p> Watch for the online debut of the Paceman next week , and the official debut at the 2012 Paris Motor Show . <p> As a part of the ever evolving language of the Internet , if you 're writing in all caps , you 're screaming . That 's what MINI appears to be doing with its new JCW GP model ; and rightly so . <p> Unveiled today at the Paris Motor Show it 's the fastest MINI ever , horsepower is rated at 211 , while a host of other performance goodies make for an 8 minute 23 second lap time at the famed Nurburgring <p> Full power from the turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine comes on at 6000 rpm , while torque of 207 lb-ft is available from just 1750 rpm . Paired with a six-speed manual transmission , the JCW GP can hit 62 mph in 6.2 seconds . <p> Special 17-inch wheels come coated in 215/40ZR17 high-performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialed-in for added cornering stability . In addition , a fully adjustable coilover suspension can lower the GP 's suspension by as much as 20mm ( almost one inch ) , while large 13-inch bakes up front and 11-inch rotors in the rear help slow the fastest MINI ever . <p> Looking the part , the GP gets new front and rear bumpers , side skirts and a large roof spoiler , all of which work together with an underbody tray to reduce lift on the rear axle by 90 percent . <p> The AutoGuide.com network consists of the largest network of enthusiast-owned enthusiast-operated automotive communities . <p> AutoGuide.com provides the latest car reviews , auto show coverage , new car prices , and automotive news .

##1468350 <h> Student projects in an international context . <p> Iain Coyne : Some of the time , some of the topic areas , I do bring cultural issues , as a limitation for the research so far . Very much dominated in , let 's say a westernised concept , more often than north American concept , so I say that 's a problem , would this issue with this idea work in another culture , there are cultural differences , would this work in another culture ? And then I 'd bring some information in there and then some of the students in discussions will pick up on that and argue that . <p> And some of them , now , because they 're now looking at doing their projects , are starting their projects off , some of them want to do culturally based studies , so they want to look at a concept within their culture , to see whether they find similar relationships similar differences . <p> Mike Clifford : My students have been tackling problems from around the world , designing simple stoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassava processing , things like that . And when the students start to tackle these projects , they have to sort of lay aside all their cultural prejudices about the communities they 're working with . They also have to just rediscover what the priorities are , so in design , they might be told that welding is a very efficient process and they should n't be using lots of fasteners , they should be using welding if they 've got a lot of joints . But , for example , we designed a oven for a Ugandan village , and they did n't have welding facilities . Labour was very cheap and very plentiful there and so our final design had four hundred nuts and bolts in it . Now , if I was marking that , or if many of my colleagues were marking that , they did n't know where the oven was designed for , they would have given it a very low mark because they 'd have said it 's terrible design , but actually , if you look a the context and you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . <p> Nicola Pitchford : So , what we 'll do is , if it 's a third year project student , they basically have six months to go on that project so in the first term of the third year , so autumn semester , I 'll get them to get their project together so do the necessary background reading , think about the research topic and area that they 're going to look at , put the question together and then , to prepare all the materials that they 're going to need , they 'll probably pilot it on students here because there 's usually , even if it 's completely within their own language , for example , there 's usually several other students that they can pilot it on within our school or the university at large . And then , during the Christmas sort of , you know , break , the winter break , they 'll go back home and collect their data there , and then come back in January , February and we 'll analyse the data and put it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Binks : I think one of the things that I 'd quite like to develop , which I have n't done yet , is to get students from different cultural backgrounds to bring that difference out in some of the work that they do with other students . So instead of teaching students about how to access funding for smaller businesses or something like that , you ask them to explain how a small ... what would happen in Kenya , or Shanghai , or in Malaysia , or whatever . What would happen ? Where would people go ? What would happen when they got there ? What would be there ? Would there be banks ? How do their traditions inform and impact on the way in which not just entrepreneurial cultures but general things proceed ? I think that would be very valuable for other students from other cultures to actually gain a little insight into the special world that each of us has in our culture , you know . And I think also it would be well received by the students themselves because I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you know , where you live , what happens with such and such ?

##1468552 <h> Child Development <h> Early Childhood : Let 's begin at the beginning <p> Babies ' rights as individuals are ignored and their creativity neglected by standard educational theory , say Penelope Leach and Colwyn Trevarthen <p> When do ' the early years ' begin ? Government documents often refer interchangeably to ' early years , ' pre-school children ' and ' under-fives ' , focusing on cognitive development rather than any other aspect of development . They talk too of ' school readiness ' , as if school were an end in itself rather than a small part of life-readiness , and success in school-taught subjects as the most important aspiration for childhood . There 's more to education than prescribed learning to tested standards , epitomised by the early learning goals of the Early Years Foundation Stage , and many people are appalled by both the cognitive and social pressures to which children are expected to conform as they grow up . <p> A large number of dedicated people are trying to lessen or redirect these pressures but economics are against them . Even while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefits falls , Government insists that paid work for parents is the only route out of poverty for children . Meanwhile , parents at every income-level struggle to resolve the conflict between spending time with a child or using that time to earn money to spend on her , and between enjoying and ' educating ' her . Many find the conflicts diminishing somewhat as children near ' school age ' and free care in school . Few parents exercise their right to keep children out of school until they turn five and many are worrying about school readiness before they have left babyhood behind . <p> ' I know it 's time she started in nursery , ' said the mother of an 11-month baby , ' but we 've been having such a good time in the park with other mums from my antenatal class that I 've been putting it off . But babies these days do n't just stay home with mummy and play , do they ? It 's time she was with a real teacher and doing all those proper activities ... ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before life is ruled by requirements of an artificial technical world : a secure family with affectionate parents who have time free from other duties to grow in creativity and co-operation with their infant ; a richly varied and challenging natural environment ; and a responsive community of companions of all ages . <p> But babies ' rights are being largely ignored because babies are not seen as individual people , as persons , but as appendages - even burdens - to parents . Even after the first year , the natural creativity and co-operation of infants and toddlers , their self-produced motives for acting and knowing with other people , are remarkably neglected in standard educational theory , and especially in the administrative practices and Government policies by which nurseries , childcare centres and schools are regulated in post-industrial societies . <p> As childcare institutions replace traditional care in families and communities , their duty comes to be perceived as protecting children from physical risks , including those of adventurous play in rich environments , and instructing them in a multitude of skills , including many such as moving around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are integral to human development . <p> CHANGING ATTITUDES <p> If we are to change childhood we have to change our attitudes to its beginnings in babyhood . Neuroscience is pointing the way , mandating a focus on the under-ones rather than all under-fives , and on emotional and social development before and alongside cognitive development and skills . Outcome studies are making it clear that the most important aspiration for any child is not precocious pre-academics at three or four , or even excellent language at two , but a secure attachment to parents or people who stand in for parents , from the very beginning , and joyful companionship with them . <p> Babies are born and must flourish in an enormous range of environments . Brains large enough to allow for every possibility would require skulls too big for natural birth . Instead of extra large brains , natural selection has produced adaptable brains , born at a very early stage of development and able to develop specialised structures to adapt in days , rather than over the aeons of evolution , to whatever demands the baby meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little attention and perhaps domestic aggression rather than affection , a baby 's brain structure and chemistry will immediately start to adapt defensively . She may develop extra-strong fear and anger reactions which are easily provoked for the rest of her life . Born into a family where predictable parents enjoy , cuddle and play with her , listen to her , comfort and laugh with her , the connections that form in a baby 's brain will be very different . <p> Babies depend on intimate bodily care from someone who loves them . Their rapidly growing brains are shaped by social experiences and produce sociable human minds - clever ears and eyes and expressive faces and hands that can communicate their interests and feelings from moments after birth . <p> In a few weeks they enjoy conversations without words , sensitive to the tones of any gentle human voice and the fun of its musicality . They learn to take part in the little rituals of action songs , beginning to pick up traditions of their ancestors from family members . Before one year they like to co-operate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They learn how people they know well use things like toys and books , and cups and spoons . They pick up words and play with them with a special genius for what the sounds of language can tell . <p> From the start , a child is a creative person who responds with inventive expressions to live company . This is how knowledge of the human world and its culture or ' human sense ' is passed on , with the child as both learner and teacher , in a small trustful community . <p> MOTHERS MATTER <p> ' Mothers matter ' is not a new message , of course . Women everywhere have always known that babies ' survival depends on being mothered . But this is the first generation that can come to understand the scope of mothering . They understand that the relationship a mother , or someone who stands in for her , makes with a baby is largely responsible not only for that child 's immediate health , well-being and behaviour but also for making the actual physical connections and layers within the baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . <p> There 's a large body of sound research showing that the hugs and conversations , songs , games and giggles , activities and outings babies get with loving and loved people affect every aspect of their development . We can not afford to go on ignoring or trivialising that ' baby-stuff ' . <p> Only if everyone understands the importance of these early relationships , and how eagerly babies seek and respond to them , will society come to treat them as the intelligent , feeling human beings they are . And only then can we hope to make families , communities and nurseries and schools fit for children rather than trying to force children to fit into them . <p> We need playgroups and nurseries , nursery schools and pre-schools because long before even our pushy society considers children old enough to benefit from classroom schooling , they are ready and eager for companionship in peer communities with their own meanings , arts and techniques . Toddlers want to discover how to use the artful and super-complex human body and mind as richly and confidently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitating , co-operating to build shared beliefs and understandings . <p> This early peer culture was traditionally embedded in large families and small communities but small families in vast cities must find institutional alternatives . Unfortunately , the creativity of young children is often beyond the expectation of those who are charged with managing the complex machines and machinations , rules and routines of the adult world , and whose primary concerns are with its economic , health , judicial , political and employment problems . <p> Somehow we have to demonstrate to politicians , administrators and managers of children 's services that early childhood is qualitatively , even morally , different from all other concerns , and that efforts should be made to meet the needs and nurture the natural talents of babies and young children , regardless of cost . <p> Fortunately , we need not rely on moral exhortation alone . Money spent on children is the best investment a nation can make . Good beginnings not only produce children , adolescents and adults who will cost the state less in the long run , the creativity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is downgrading the social and cultural health of all our communities . <p> Penelope Leach PhD , C Psychol , FBPsS is a psychologist specialising in child development .

##1469151 <h> Rwanda : why UNHCR is wrong about Cessation <p> The UN Refugee Agency must not be the facilitator of a permissive attitude towards continued corruption and the absence of democracy in Rwanda . By calling on refugees who fled before 1998 to return home to the threat of persecution it risks legitimising Kagame 's autocratic regime . <p> On the 30th June 2013 , the UN refugee agency , UNHCR is recommending that states around the world invoke the Cessation Clause for refugees who fled events occurring in Rwanda between 1959 and 1998 . If states follow UNHCR 's recommendation , the international protection of those who fled Rwanda during this period will cease to exist . <p> According to principles set out in the 1951 Convention , refugee status is an essentially temporary condition which should allow for the return of refugees should ' fundamental , positive and durable ' changes occur in their country of origin . These changes should render the well-founded fear of persecution which led to their flight no longer present . UNHCR 's desire to invoke the Cessation Clause only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In stating that those who have fled after this date may still have a well-founded fear of persecution , UNHCR suggests that fundamental , positive and durable changes have not really taken place in Rwanda . <p> Further contradictions in UNHCR 's recommendation are evident in the internal division among UNHCR offices on the question of Cessation for Rwandan refugees , as discussed previously on openDemocracy by Barbara Harrell-Bond . Whilst UNHCR Geneva recommends the invocation of the Cessation Clause , its own office in Belgium has advised European governments that Rwanda is not a safe country . <h> Fundamentally divided ? <p> UNHCR 's suggestion that the Cessation Clause should be revoked for those fleeing events before 1998 would imply that those who faced persecution or discrimination during this period are no longer at risk . Evidence to the contrary is widespread . Many refugees have spoken of their experience of attempting to return to Rwanda , only to find themselves persecuted , marginalised and discriminated against once again by the Rwandan ruling party , the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) . <p> Mr Karegeya , Kagame 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew full well that his life would be in danger as soon as he defected . He had witnessed firsthand the murder of many who had gone into exile , which , he stated , happened on direct orders from President Kagame . Mr Karegeya told The Times newspaper that President Kagame is ' a serial killer who does not believe in debate , he believes in eliminating all opponents ' . This suggests that Kagame 's government is not the face of a stable democracy but the mask of an autocratic regime . <p> Many of those who fled Rwanda before 1998 did so because of fears brought about by political instability and by ethnic division . Mr Karegeya learnt of plans to kill him from fellow Rwandans who had been recruited to do the deed . His case highlights the division that remains between Rwandans and is proof that the basis for the well-founded fear of persecution that caused so many Rwandans to flee before 1998 is still in existence . A Rwandan refugee , who asked to remain nameless , currently living in Mozambique stated that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive , one is a criminal and the last one is a spy - or at least that is how we perceive each other ' . She takes issue with UNHCR 's desire to reunite Rwandans when they ' do n't even trust their own shadows ' and when the RPF exploits this mistrust , employing blackmail and persuading individuals to kill their own friends <h> Fundamentally undemocratic ? <p> There is little evidence to suggest that Rwanda is now a truly democratic country . On the contrary , President Kagame 's regime continues to oppress political opposition and to threaten the people of Rwanda , both at home and abroad . Earlier this year Scotland Yard warned two Rwandan exiles living in the UK that the ' the Rwandan government poses an imminent threat to your life ' . UNHCR is wrong to think that sending refugees back is appropriate in these conditions . <p> A refugee has , by their very nature , criticised the country that they fled and the Rwandan government has a proven record of hostility to criticism . Sending back those who once feared persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put great numbers at risk . <p> Further questions to the true democracy for the Rwandan RPF are demonstrated through claims by two of President Kagame 's former bodyguards that members of the Republic Guard were involved in stuffing hundreds of ballot boxes two days before the election in 2003 . More recent examples include the difficulty for opposition parties to register their desire to stand in elections , as experienced by the Democratic Green party before the 2010 elections . Before a party can stand , it must first convene . But on the five occasions the Democratic Party tried to convene , members were arrested and harassed by RPF supporters . <p> Another opposition party , the United Democratic Forces ( UDF ) has faced a difficult fight to be recognised . Their leader , Victoire Ingabire , returned from exile in 2010 to lead the party . She was quickly imprisoned and is now facing a life sentence for ' genocide ideology ' , a vague concept used by the RPF to legitimise the imprisonment of often innocent detainees . Both the FDU and the Democratic Green Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities . Thus the RPF faced no meaningful challenge in the 2010 elections , whilst political opponents remain persecuted and imprisoned . <p> In the 2010 election the RPF won such a huge majority of the vote - 96% amongst the diasporas and 93% on average - that it is difficult not to suspect foul play . The Rwandan people are not able to voice their true democratic rights because of a fear of the consequences of opposition . How can UNHCR pretend that Rwanda is an example of a country where fundamental , positive and durable changes have taken place ? Instead of legitimising the actions of Kagame 's corrupt government by branding the country as safe , UNHCR should be pressuring Rwanda to make the real changes that would permit the proper invocation of the Cessation Clause . <p> In an interview with The Times , former bodyguard Joel Mutabazi told of how in 2010 he had been accused of being a Hutu , imprisoned , interrogated and tortured . He spent 17 months shackled and handcuffed , told by prison officers authorised by President Kagame 's regime that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can do what we want ' . This was just two years ago . <p> Amnesty International says it has documented 45 similar cases , warning that such abuses have only been possible because ' perpetrators expected their actions to go unpunished ' . In fact , the Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama admitted that there had been a series of illegal detentions in 2010 but accredited this to the overzealousness of the security forces , stating that the ' state would never condone torture ' . Yet the same security forces still remain in their positions and claims of torture and persecution can still be heard from Rwandans in exile around the world . <h> International apathy and economic assistance <p> This belief that terrible human rights abuses and continued governmental persecution can go unpunished is well-founded . In fact , instead of condemning such behaviour , the international community at large has continued to passively justify human rights violations through funding the Rwandan government . <p> Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth since the genocide in 1994 and much of this growth is thanks , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This growth has brought some positive changes to the country , including the construction of new buildings in the capital , Kigali . As one refugee pointed out , however , the presence of beautiful buildings does not constitute profound changes in a country . Impressive government buildings should not detract from the corruption that the walls hide from prying eyes . <p> In a recent letter to the World Bank , Human Rights Watch raised questions about the provision of huge amounts of aid to Rwanda in light of ' detailed evidence of human rights abuses by the Rwandan government and the Rwandan military 's support for armed groups in the DRC ' . Human Rights Watch expressed its concern that the World Bank remains one of the most significant donors in Rwanda , with US $300 million in active projects in March 2012 and a further US $88 million in trust Funds in the country . Yet questions still remain about how this money is being spent . <p> Last year the UK government boasted that it gave more bilateral aid to Rwanda than any other European country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 90 million in 2014/2015 . The Conservative government contend that is has used Rwanda as an example of how development aid should be used in the modern world , to allow a state to modernise through investment , so that they can strive to be independent of aid . President Kagame was even the guest of honour at the Conservative Party Conference just 5 years ago . All the while , Conservative party members have cultivated close friendships with Mr Kagame . In his last act as International Development Minister , the now Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell reinstated millions of pounds of development aid to Rwanda . He is said to have visited Rwanda at least 8 times in the last 6 years and famously enjoys a particularly intimate relationship with Kagame . Mr Mitchell has been criticised for the closeness of their relationship as he has demonstrated ' monumental naivety by falling for the African 's ingratiating personal charm offensive ' . <p> Conversely , the US , the Netherlands and Sweden have recently suspended their aid to Rwanda following allegations that the government was assisting rebels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights abuses . Even the British government has announced plans to probe the re-instalment of aid to Rwanda . If nation states are beginning to take note of the ongoing support for human rights abuses within Rwanda , surely UNHCR should do the same . <p> Nonetheless , the international community on the whole remains passive and permissive in its interactions with Rwanda . There is evidence to suggest that money from the World Bank has gone into arming conflict , and corruption is rife as the Rwandan government demonstrates very little accountability for the expenditure of its funds . Continued support from the World Bank and many national governments should not be viewed as evidence of fundamental change in Rwanda , but rather of the RPF 's ability to control opinion and of the global community 's inability or unwillingness to perceive the situation for what it is . Invoking the Cessation Clause would represent yet another example of the international community overlooking its obligation to the people of Rwanda , instead preferring to turn a blind eye to the problems which remain within the country . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rwandan budget comes from Rwanda 's top five international donors . This means that the Rwandan government should be held to account for at least 58% of its expenditure , which should be allocated according to proper procurement procedures . Yet the RPF continually manages to avoid accountability for this money , as they use it to enable key party members to amass wealth , power and influence . According to official figures , 77% of the population live below the poverty line , all the while members of the RPF and their families become richer and more influential . <p> The RPF have created an un-impenetrable shield under which it controls wealth and assets under the umbrella of Crystal Ventures and Invest Group . These two structures administer millions of pounds annually and are both controlled by and accountable only to the RPF . Under the cover of these organisations , family members of those loyal to President Kagame benefit from investment whilst other entrepreneurs miss out on the chance to tender for contracts . <p> A former procurement officer in the President 's office , who is now an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . In one such example he told of a Belgian man wishing to apply for the tender of US $300,000 for the Cleaning and Garden Maintenance of Urugwiro , Kiyovu and the VIP lounge at the Kanombe International airport . He was told before he could bid for tender that he must first visit the site . The Belgian is still awaiting permission to visit , whilst the tender has been given to a relative of the Ministry of Defence Reserve Force 's Chief of Staff , General Fred Ibingira . <p> The RPF has a monopoly of control over assets of every kind in Rwanda - from plastic chairs to beer , from government finance to coffee . There is an obvious point to be made about the way in which the RPF 's management of finance gives the party an unfair political advantage , as it can finance propaganda and campaigns almost with no limit . Indeed , according to sources , half of the RFP 's $2.4 million campaign costs for the 2010 elections came from companies controlled by Crystal Ventures . <p> Crystal Ventures controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 staff it is the country 's second biggest employer , after the state . The monopoly of this government-controlled organisation goes against basic principles of democracy and permits mismanagement of public funds and large scale corruption . <p> The Chairman of the Board of Crystal Ventures , Professor Nshuti Manasseh , justifies the governmental control of the investment branch by stating that Rwanda does not want to remain dependent on international development aid but rather to be able to fund its own projects and manage its own wealth . Whilst this is in theory a positive aim , the means are questionable . Crystal Ventures amassed its wealth through donations from Tutsi diasporas , demonstrating evident problems of ethnic divides that still remain embedded in political and economic process in Rwanda . <p> Political instability and ethnic divides which led to the genocide in 1994 have provided the grounds for the flight of many Rwandans since . Unfortunately Rwanda remains a hugely divided society , whilst freedom of expression remains an ideal rather than a reality . Reports suggest that President Kagame is becoming increasingly autocratic . It is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive changes have occurred in Rwanda , invalidating their call for the invocation of the Cessation Clause . <p> By only invoking the Cessation Clause for a certain period UNHCR suggests that it does not truly believe Rwanda has changed . UNHCR should retract its recommendation that states invoke the Cessation Clause , instead recognising its 
##1469152 <p> The world media 's attention on Afghanistan in the past week has , most unusually , been focused on the country 's domestic politics rather than its internal-security situation . The questionable process and equally uncertain outcome of the presidential election in the country on 20 August 2009 mean that political tension is likely to persist for at least several weeks , possibly longer . This is particularly the case as doubts evolve about the fairness of the vote . Such a situation creates worries for the coalition 's military forces and diplomatic representatives , whose main interest is to see a semblance of order and control in Kabul so that the campaign against the Taliban and related militias can proceed as straightforwardly as possible . <p> Paul Rogers is professor in the department of peace studies at Bradford University , northern England . He has been writing a weekly column on global security on openDemocracy since 26 September 2001 <p> Bradford 's peace-studies department now broadcasts regular podcasts on its work , including a regular commentary from Paul Rogers on international-security issues . Listen/watch here <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a degree to draw attention away from the deteriorating security situation , in which United States and British forces in particular - engaged in bitter fighting with the Taliban in the southern Helmand province - continue to experience regular casualties . <p> An earlier column in this series highlighted a change in US military tactics in Afghanistan , namely the decision to try to kill or capture around fifty key people in the opium industry that were reported to have links with Taliban groups ( see " Afghanistan : the wrong target " , 13 August 2009 ) . This project - mentioned in a report from the foreign-relations committee of the US Senate , and revealed on 10 August 2009 - is significant on three counts . <p> First , it indicates that the Barack Obama administration 's involvement in the war is becoming even more intense , at the very time that the president 's domestic difficulties over healthcare reform and the economy are growing ( and with public doubts over the Afghan war on the rise , prompting some commentators to suggest that Afghanistan might become for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Second , it appears on every reasonable criterion to represent a violation of international law . <p> Third , it represents an escalation in US operations that tacitly acknowledges what senior US military commanders have begun openly to admit : that , despite a substantial increase in troop levels in 2007-09 , the war in Afghanistan is not going well . <p> The longer view <p> A clear indication of current worries is the interview given to CNN on 23 August 2009 by the chair of the US joint chiefs-of-staff , Admiral Michael Mullen . The admiral accepted that there had been a marked downturn in levels of security . The situation , he said , " is serious and it is deteriorating , and I 've said that over the last couple of years , that the Taliban insurgency has gotten better , more sophisticated . Their tactics just in my recent visits out there and talking with our troops certainly indicate that " ( see " More troops may be needed to bolster Afghanistan " , CNN , 23 August 2009 ) . <p> In a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources ' , the coalition could begin to make progress in quelling the insurgency within twelve to eighteen months " ( see Scott Wilson &; Joshua Partlow , " On Afghanistan , Political Test for Obama " , Washington Post , 26 August 2009 ) . <p> In neither interview did Mullen indicate how many additional troop numbers might be sought , but he is clearly working the media and public - and perhaps his political masters - to prepare the way for a further " surge " , following the additional 17,000 troops deployed from May 2009 . The current commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , is due to deliver his report on the security situation to the White House in the first week of September ; there are widespread expectations that as many more troops ( perhaps 25,000 ) will be requested . At present , 62,000 of the 100,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan are American , and 6,000 more are already scheduled to arrive by the end of 2009 ; a further increase at the higher end of the scale anticipated would take the total to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column , Paul Rogers writes an international security monthly briefing for the Oxford Research Group ; for details , click here <p> Between the lines a telling degree of pessimism is audible in such estimates and plans . When , for example , the most senior officer in the US armed forces says that the coalition " could begin to make progress in quelling the insurgency within twelve to eighteen months " emphasis added , it implies that positive results - even with existing and further deployments of additional resources - will not be visible until 2010-11 . This is a very long way from the impression given on both sides of the Atlantic that the increase in troop levels of early 2009 was intended primarily to ensure sufficient security for the presidential elections . <p> The larger strategy <p> The immediate run-up to the polls - originally planned for April , before the current presidential term ended in May , and then rescheduled for 20 August - was indeed marked by an upsurge in violence in June-July . The toll of coalition casualties , both deaths and serious injuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers on 24 August , for example , took the total coalition losses in 2009 to 295 , meaning that more have already been killed this year than in any other year since the termination of the Taliban regime in November 2001 . <p> Even on election-day itself - during which the government in Kabul tried in effect to impose something of a security-news blackout - there seem to have been in excess of 400 attacks across the country . A provisional assessment from the United Nations suggests that up to one-fifth of the polling may be suspect , on account of corruption and malpractice as well as insecurity ; though the precise degree of violation and of orchestration involved is yet to become fully apparent . What does seem beyond dispute is that very low turnouts in many areas reflect the apathy and disaffection among Afghans who voted in the 2005 elections and are unhappy with the failure of their government and its foreign backers to deliver good governance . <p> The Taliban assaults continued throughout the electoral campaign , though it is clear that the movement 's violence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic objectives . A big attack on 25 August in the southern city of Kandahar , for example , targeted the provincial offices and other key buildings ; the truck-bomb killed at least forty-three people and wounded nearly twice that number . It was followed by another bomb in the same part of the city a day later . <p> It is in this context that McChrystal 's report , and the Obama administration 's response to its recommendations , are so crucial . Even in comparison with 2006 , the Taliban and other paramilitary groups are far more active and control more territory , while many Afghans have lost faith in the prospects for security and clean government . <p> The moment of choice <p> In coming to a view of General McChrystal 's report , Barack Obama and his advisers will need to take into account three further developments . <p> First , Pakistani army activity across the border appears to have declined in the wake of the killing of a key Pakistani Taliban leader , Baitullah Mehsud . The passing of the local Taliban leadership to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced 30-year old , Hakimullah ( Zulfiqar ) Mehsud , might seem to argue for a continued pursuit ; but the army 's apparent success over Baitullah can equally be regarded as providing a good reason not to go further with a potentially unpopular campaign . <p> Third , and perhaps most important , the attitude of the US military leadership may be opposed to compromise . General David H Petraeus , the commander of US Central Command , and some of his colleagues have made substantial progress in changing the attitudes and tactics of the US army and marine corps towards counterinsurgency warfare , and are committed to seeing these implanted in the next generation . At the same time , there is a pervasive concern at the most senior levels of the US military that to compromise with Taliban elements in Afghanistan - following the costly ( and unfinished ) six years of war in Iraq - will be viewed as a humiliation for the world 's only superpower . <p> The different approach <p> The American concern over a negotiated outcome in Afghanistan is made deeper for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented as the direct and utterly necessary response to 9/11 - a true " war of necessity " as opposed to the " war of choice " in Iraq . The very least the US military wants is a substantial further surge in troop levels sufficient to reduce Taliban influence , followed only then ( perhaps in 2011 ) by some kind of deal . <p> There is an alternative political option , which is advocated by the Afghan presidential candidate and former senior World Bank official , Ashraf Ghani . This is to embark on serious and determined negotiations with the Taliban that might offer a clear timetable for a progressive withdrawal of foreign troops in return for a series of ceasefire agreements . <p> This would be a very different approach for Barack Obama 's team to take ; it would rouse considerable anger among the political right in the United States ; and it would it certainly be risky . Against this , an intelligent leadership may have to recognise the unpalatable reality that the more foreign forces have been deployed in Afghanistan in the past three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramilitaries . In this light , the perils of a serious engagement leading to a timed withdrawal may be balanced against the prospect of an even more violent conflict if the present course continues .. <p> There are many analysts in and around the United States military who argue that Iraq and Afghanistan are more truly representative of future wars than state-on-state warfare , and that these are the conflicts that the US forces must learn to fight . A near-nightmare outcome - with , again , the Vietnam precedent in mind - would be for both of these wars to be seen at their end as bywords for chaos , waste , failure and embitterment . If the Afghanistan war , in particular , concludes in a withdrawal negotiated with those deemed responsible for harbouring the 9/11 attackers , the damage to the world 's most powerful military would be profound . <p> The public sentiments of gloom about the course of Afghanistan 's war are striking . But equally strong military voices want to ensure that Barack Obama prosecutes the war , and at even higher intensity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of voting , in the weeks ahead . But whoever emerges as their president at the end of the process , the war that approaches its

That 's all I see ! everything is to help the first time buyer get on the market like homebuy scheme , part buy part rent , also when you look for a morgage it 's always 5% deposit only if first time buyer !

Of course the die hard party politics boys are still out there spouting the relevant party line , but the rest of us , seem to be totally unsure . <p> Given my own choice to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vote no ! <p> I am reading many major economists and political leaders all over the world telling the Euro group that austerity is the way to actually stifle any hope of growth and is a certain route to even deeper recession . <p> I ? m no economist , but seeing with my own eyes what the Troika ? s austerity plan is doing to my friends and neighbours , and me , then they seem to have a very relevant point , and default , surely can ? t be any worse . We ? ll still be poor and wondering where the next meal is coming from , but at least we ? ll have our dignity back , which in turn could lead to a true will across the board , to get it right this time , get our politicians really under control and responsible for their actions , ( first time ever ) and say ? up yours ? to Empress Merkle and the gang . <p> So while Sphincter tightening Sunday is now on a Friday or Thursday , the big word here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austerity , or even Help ! ! . <p> It ? s Olives . <p> Olive trees , normally produce every other year , so one half of the village has them one year , then the other half the next . Well wether it ? s down to Global warming or a gift from God , this year every tree is absolutely bursting under the weight of Olives . <p> In 22 years here , I have never seen so many . <p> Even my oldest tree , which i was contemplating turning into furniture earlier in the summer , is overflowing , and this is after not producing on single olive for the last ten year <p> The price of oil is obviously a source of worry , as with so much oil about to be produced , will the price fall below the norm ? , but the even bigger worry is who picks them . <p> Normally there ? s a few weeks work to be found picking olives , and it ? s a great family time as well . It ? s a personal delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually pick them , to see whole families out in the olive groves , from the youngest kids to the oldest grandma and grandpa . Everyone takes part , it ? s a full days outing , and wine , crusty fresh bread , tomatoes and cheese are the staple menu of the lunchbreak . If you are walking the dog , you need to pick your route carefully , for to pass too many of these families anywhere near lunch time , means being invited to join them , with no refusals accepted . <p> In this situation it ? s good to have a dog who knows his way home . <p> This year however , the families don ? t have the money to hire the odd worker or two to assist in the picking and the talk is of hiring Bulgarian or Albanian workers , or even gypsies , who will work for less than half of the 40 euros per day normally paid for a serious 8 hour shift . <p> I have signed on for three picks at the moment , one at 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other still under debate , as i am a foreigner after all . <p> This scenario is throwing another source of argument into the daily political discussions . <p> The third largest party here in Greece is called Chrisi Avni , or Golden Dawn , and they are out and out nazi ? s . Complete with Black shirts , swastika style symbol , and attacks on immigrants they deem to be illegal . They are openly beating up immigrants in the back street ghetto areas of Athens , invading the traditional local village markets and destroying the stalls of anyone not Greek , wether they are there with legal paperwork or not . There are serious rumours flying around of police involvement ( secretly ) in the party , let alone the ability of the local bobby to turn a blind eye . <p> What astonishes , if not frightens me more than a little , is the amount of ? normal ? people suddenly beginning to suggest that Golden Dawn may well have the right idea . <p> I am totally against them and everything they stand for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so whenever asked . The Olives have given me a big boost in this stance . <p> Today , with a good old fashioned capaitalist , ( with serious left wing tendencies ) , who is now retired , i was shocked to hear him somewhat supporting Golden Dawn . However , at the same time , he was asking all and sundry in the villages we were passing through on our way back from the big town , if they knew of any Bulgarians or Albanian workers , who would pick his olives for 15 to 20 euros a day . <p> Now I was a tad pissed off by this , as he had already offered me the work at 40 euros a day , and was actually , and openly , seeking cheaper labour for my job , while i was stood next to him . I used it to question his beliefs in the new Greek Nazi party . <p> Letting him regail the virtues of slinging out all foreign workers unceremoniously , i asked him where , of Golden Dawn came to power , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he is too old to pick his own olives , and his family are all teachers , doctors and lawyers in Athens who couldn ? t give a shit about picking olives whatever the wage . <p> I questioned , wether or not he feels he should be doing his bit , ( as he ? s not skint ) , by helping out some of his own countrymen and women , and fellow villagers . Suffice it to say , i managed to cause enough doubt to regain my position as his chief ( and only ) olive picker , albeit at a reduced 30 euros a day , and trust me , i shall start picking them on Monday , when i finish concreteing his cellar , before he goes back to being a total fascist again , and finds and Albanian or two . <p> The rise of the Nazi party has got to be taken seriously here . <p> In a few short months they have gone from a joke , to the third largest political party here , in the home of democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he is down , the more they are acting as recruiters . <p> As we already know from our dear friend with the tiny mustache , in the not too distant past , poverty feeds raging xenophobia , and the consequences are simply too much to even contemplate . <p> Something , the financial whizz kids of the Euro group , currently destroying whole cultures to prop up their ailing currency , would do well to remember . <h> Comments <p> LOrd knows , this rise of the nazi party here in Greece worries me a thousand times more than will i have food on the table next week . It could spread through Europe with the rise of the left in recent elections , and then it 's man the barricades around your house and every man for himself . <p> Not self serving at all Pav . Down to earth and honest , that 's all . Greece from a local Islander 's point of view . <p> Hard to find this stuff anywhere else . You should market it to publishers in well off countries like Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The yanks have n't a clue where Europe is let alone Greece , so it

##1803950 <p> In C a string is just an array of characters . The end of the string is denoted by a zero byte . The various string manipulation functions are described in the online manual page called string ' , and declared in the string.h include file . The following piece of code illustrates their use and highlights some problems <p> Usually str1 ' would be used instead of &str1[0]; ' to refer to the address of the first element of the character array , since C defines the value of an array name to be the location of the first element . In fact , once you 've set cptr to str , the 2 variables behave similarly in most circumstances . <p> There is not really any difference in the behaviour of the array subscripting operator as it applies to arrays and pointers . The expressions stri and cptri are both processed internally using pointers . For instance , stri is equivalent to * ( ( str ) + ( i ) ) . <p> Array and pointer declarations are interchangeable as function formal parameters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never actually passed to a function . Therefore , any parameter declarations which look like ' arrays , e.g. <p> int f ( char a ) ... <p> are treated by the compiler as if they were pointers , so char a ' could be replaced by char* a ' . This conversion holds only within function formal parameter declarations , nowhere else . If this conversion bothers you , avoid it . <p> Because the distinction between pointers and arrays often does n't seem to matter , programmers get surprised when it does . Arrays are not pointers . The array declaration char str110 ; ' requests that space for ten characters be set aside . The pointer declaration char *cptr ; ' on the other hand , requests a place which holds a pointer . The pointer is to be known by the name cptr , and can point to any char ( or contiguous array of char s ) anywhere . str1 ca n't be changed : it 's where the array begins and where it will always stay . <p> You ca n't pass whole arrays to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointers correctly you need to be aware of the different ways that multi-dimensional arrays can be stored in memory . Suppose you created a 2D array of characters as follows : - <p> char fruits310 = " apple " , " banana " , " orange " ; <p> This creates space for 3 strings each 10 bytes long . Let 's say that fruits ' gets stored at memory location 6000 . Then this will be the layout in memory : <p> The routine has to be told the size of the things that names points to , otherwise it wo n't be able to calculate namesi correctly . So the 10 ' needs to be provided in the declaration . It does n't care about how many things are in the array , so the first pair of brackets might just as well be empty . An equivalent declaration is <p> void listnames ( char ( *names ) 10 ) <p> saying that names ' is a pointer to an array each of whose elements is 10 chars . <p> The above method of creating arrays wastes a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alternative way to initialise is as follows : - <p> char *veg = " artichoke " , " beetroot " , " carrot " ; <p> Here veg ' is set up as an array of pointer-to-char s . The layout in memory is different too . A possible layout is : - <p> Note that veg ' is the start of an array of pointers . The actual characters are stored elsewhere . If we wanted a function that would print out these strings , then the listnames() ' routine above would n't do , since this time the argument names ' would n't be pointing to things that are 10 bytes long , but 4 ( the size of a pointer-to-char ) . The declaration needs to
