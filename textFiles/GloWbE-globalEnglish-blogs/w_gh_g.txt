The mainland African species also occurs on Madagascar , but it is not a native of that island . <p> A typical common name is baobab . Other common names include boab , boaboa , bottle tree , upside-down tree , and monkey bread tree . The species reach heights of 5 to 30 metres ( 16 to 98 ft ) and have trunk diameters of 7 to 11 metres ( 23 to 36 ft ) . An African Baobab specimen in Limpopo Province , South Africa , often considered the largest example alive , has a circumference of 47 metres ( 150 ft ) and an average diameter of 15 metres ( 49 ft ) . Some baobabs are reputed to be many thousands of years old , which is difficult to verify as the wood does not produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide age data . <p> The Malagasy species are important components of the Madagascar dry deciduous forests . Within that biome , A. madagascariensis and A. rubrostipa occur specifically in the Anjajavy Forest , sometimes growing out of the tsingy limestone itself . <p> Beginning in 2008 , there has been increasing interest for developing baobab as a nutrient-rich raw material for consumer products . <p> The name Adansonia honours Michel Adanson , the French naturalist and explorer who described A. digitata . Water storage Baobabs store water inside the swollen trunk ( up to 120,000 litres ( 32,000 US gal ) ) to endure the harsh drought conditions particular to each region.All occur in seasonally arid areas , and are deciduous , shedding their leaves during the dry season . <p> Uses <p> The fruit is about 18 cm longThe leaves are commonly used as a leaf vegetable throughout the area of mainland African distribution , including Malawi , Zimbabwe , and the Sahel . They are eaten both fresh and as a dry powder . In Nigeria , the leaves are locally known as kuka , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritious possibly having more vitamin C than oranges and exceeding the calcium content of cow 's milk. 5 Also known as " sour gourd " or " monkey 's bread " , the dry fruit pulp separated from seeds and fibers is eaten directly or mixed into porridge or milk . In Malawi , the fruit pulp is used to make a nutrient-rich juice . <p> The fruit was once used in the production of tartar sauce . In various parts of East Africa , the dry fruit pulp is covered in sugary coating ( usually with red coloring ) and sold in packages as a sweet and sour candy called " ubuyu " . <p> The seeds are mostly used as a thickener for soups , but may also be fermented into a seasoning , roasted for direct consumption , or pounded to extract vegetable oil . The tree also provides a source of fiber , dye , and fuel . <p> Adansonia grandidieri , Madagascar Baobab in RecifeIndigenous Australians used baobabs as a source of water and food , and used leaves medicinally . They also painted and carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A very large , hollow baobab south of Derby , Western Australia was used in the 1890s as a prison for Aboriginal convicts on their way to Derby for sentencing . The Boab Prison Tree still stands and is now a tourist attraction . <p> The whole fruit of the baobab is not available in the EU as current EU legislations from 1997 dictate that foods not commonly consumed in the EU have to be formally approved before going on sale . On 15 July 2008 , the EU authorised the use of Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp as a food ingredient in smoothies and cereal bars Food Standards Agency website . More recently , Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp achieved GRAS status for these same food uses . <p> A nonprofit organization , PhytoTrade Africa , plans to market the fruit for the benefit of around 2.5 million of the poorest families in southern Africa . <p> The Baobab Fruit Co. of Senegal currently markets baobab in Europe , and in North America through their agent Conceptula LLC . <p> Traditional uses of the whole fruit are unlikely outside of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white powder with a cheese-like texture to be used as an ingredient in products . <p> Culture and myths Tabaldi is the name of the Baobab tree in Sudan and its fruit is Gongalis . Baobab 's trunk is used as a tank to store water . People in west Sudan use the hollow in the trunk to save water in the rain season . Gongalis is used to make juice or to cure stomach and other diseases . Baobab trees are also seen in the mountain region of Saudi Arabia , near Al Baha Rafiki , in The Lion King , makes his home in a baobab tree . Ernst Haeckel mentions " monkey bread-fruit trees ( Adansonia ) " in his The History of Creation ( Chap . 29 ) , and claims that their " individual life exceeds a period of five thousand years " . The owners of Sunland Farm in Limpopo , South Africa have built a pub called " The Big Baobab Pub " inside the hollow trunk of a 22 metres ( 72 ft ) high baobab . The tree , which is 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old . Baobabs are cited in the The Little Prince as a tree 
##1237952 <h> Akwamu <p> The Akwamu was a state set up by the Akan people in Ghana which existed in the 1600s and 1700s . Originally immigrating from Bono state , the founders settled in Twifo-Heman.In 1693 , the Asimani of Akwamu lead a raid and seized Osu Castle ( currently the seat of the Ghanaian government ) , from the Danish colonists.The Akwamu sold it back to the Danes a year later , but retained the keys to the castle . As of 2007 , the Akwamu still have the keys . <p> History The Akwamus like most Akans also migrated from Adanse to settle at the Twifo-Heman forest at the later part of the 16th century . This group of Akans belonged to the Aduana family and are blood brothers of Asumennya , Dormaa and Kumawu . According to oral tradition it was as a result of succession dispute that compelled Otomfuo ( brass-smith ) Asare to desert the family to form a new state or city called Asaremankesee- Asares big state . The modern city of Asaamankese was originally founded and occupied by the Akwamus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to places like the whole Akuapem area including Kyerepon and Larteh , Akyem , Denkyera , Ga-Adangbe , the Ladoku states of Agona , Winneba , Afram plains , Southern Togoland and finally Whydah in present Benin . The powerful king Nana Ansa Sasraku l annexed the Guans and took over the traditional areas of the Kyerepons and ruled over them until Asonaba Nana Ofori Kuma and his followers after a succession dispute in their effort to form their own State engaged them in a fierce war after which the Akwamus were driven away from the mountains . <p> These Asona family members and their followers then were given a piece of land from the original settlers the Guans , Kyerepons , to form the Akuapem state . However , most of the present Akuapems still have their roots at Akwamufie especially those bearing the names Addo and Akoto or from the Aduana family . <p> Nana Ansa Sasraku also played an important role in the life of the King Osei Tutu of Asante . He protected him from the Denkyiras and when he was called to take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Akwamu to guide him to Kwaaman . When Nana Osei Tutu arrived , he gaved all the men to Kwaaman Asafohene and they became citizens of Asafo and that won the Kumase Asafohene the title Akwamuhene of Kumase . According to oral tradition , the whole structure of the Asante army that was started by Nana Osei Kofi Tutu l and helped the Asantes through many wars , was a replicate of the well organised Akwamu army . <p> Nana Osei Tutu was also assisted by the Anumfuo ( later Adumfuo ) who accompanied him from Akwamu , in execution cases . A large number of the Asantes of today originated from Akwamu especially , people from Asafo and Adum as well as sections of people from Bantama and Barekese . <p> After the death of Nana Ansa Sasraku , he was succeeded by two kings collectively , Nana Addo Panin and Nana Basua . It was during this time that the Akwamus took over the possession of the Danish Castle at Christianborg or Osu . <p> Because of the cordial relationship that existed between Akwamu and Asante , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most states after war , was never annexed by Asantes but rather the Akwamu Stool became the wife of the Asante Stool during the reign of Nana Odeneho Kwafo Akoto l . That is the reason why during the Golden Anniversary of Nana Kwafo Akoto ll Nana Opoku Ware ll crossed the Pra river to spend two days at Akwamufie . <p> At the peak of their power the Akwamus had embraced much of the Gold Coast and traditionally the Akwamuhene still has the jurisdiction of the Akosombo part of the Volta River . <p> In the 1720s the King of Akwamu began selling many of his subjects to slave traders . This led to civil war and the state 's disintegration . Most of the King 's allies were sold away as slaves and transported to the Caribbean island of St. John . In 1733 they fomented a slave revolt there. 4 <p> In 1734 the Akwamu were defeated by the Akyem and , the previously illustrious empire was put to an end . <p> Sadly and unfortunately modern Akwamus have however lost most of their land to Akyems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rulers of state of Akwamu ( 
##1241950 <p> In the middle of the vast desert that characterizes Jordan and the Middle East protrudes a large rock -- a mountain really -- that looks out of place and glows a vibrant red . Because there were n't really any forests to cut down to make homes , the city of Petra was intricately carved into the mountain so that every home , temple , reservoir , etc. was fixed into place . The only changes were the geologically slow changes of the rock itself and sporadic rain events , revealing layers of colors and patterns . The Bedoins , or native dwellers of Petra , vehemently protected the area and prevented any outside from entering because they believed that the lost treasures of the Egyptian Pharaohs were buried hidden within the maze of caverns in the great rock -- Petra had served as an important trade outpost between Ancient Egypt and the Far East .

##1241951 <p> I saw an email about a conference by the European Science Foundation on a small island in the Mediterranean off the south coast of France . There were travel grants available so I thought I may as well apply . Sure enough , I got the grant and was on my way to the beautiful island , escaping for a bit from the gray , dreary weather of England in November . The conference itself was fine , and I had some good conversations with a lot of good people . What was definitely most enjoyable was experiencing what the island had to offer , and simply bonding and having a great time with new people from all over the world . <p> The port of Porquerolles . <p> Bienvenue au port de Porquerolles . But , do n't ask me to pronounce that with a good French accent . <p> On the second day of the conference , we had talks only in the morning and took a boat ride around the island in the afternoon . <p> I take my boat touring seriously . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of real estate . <p> Winding around the island edge . <p> The eastern tip of Porquerolles . <p> Rock . <p> A small , secret cove tucked away on the side of the island . <p> Lighthouse above to prevent shipwrecks ( the lady on the boat told us about the many shipwrecks around the island , which did n't exactly make me feel comfortable ) . <p> Another lighthouse and fort . Hey , I guess you ca n't have too many . <p> The wide open sea . <p> Ah , nice . <p> Gently dancing on the cool breeze . <p> Boat crew . <p> Cool shot taken by E va . <p> Another nice E va shot . <p> The windmill . We would find ourselves there later in the middle of the night after hours of partying ... <p> Our crew went on an evening stroll . From left : Antony from S.

There is a picture of the sea on the piano that says Claire de Lune . Inspirational " sheet music " ? <p> Our expanded group , after they kicked us out of the bar . <p> Hmm , we 've found ourselves with wine at the windmill . <p> The guys forced Antony to tell a story so he proceeded to give us a twisted , complex story of mystery , love and intrigue involving a dragon among other details . It was kind of trippy to say the least . <p> Ask this guy to explain the two meanings of the French expression for " Give me a kiss " ( that 's the first meaning ) . <p> Anna is falling asleep while I watch shooting stars pass overhead . <p> The next day we went for a bike ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our bike crew . <p> We were trying to find the lighthouse , or Phare .

Not bad at all . <p> Me and Eva looking quite relaxed . <p> Gentle waves . <p> Colorful pebbles . <p> We wanted to jump into the water , but we discovered something interesting floating around . <p> There were literally hundreds of jellyfish lining the water waiting for a hapless prey to dip his foot in .

The music started before the bar opened so we were all a little hesitant and shy to hit the dance floor . I got people started by playing the memory dance game . <p> Here , the guys watch as I do a breakdance move -- which , actually was n't my contribution to the memory dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one could do it . <p> So people started coming up to me totally freaked out when they saw my eyes , which glowed only when I tilted my head upwards towards the blacklights on the ceiling .

I got Nikolai to take a photo of my eyes , and when I saw the photo in his camera , I took was freaked out . I think it was the result of these greenish eye-drops I had been using , but this is something I will definitely have to follow up on with my eye doctor ( and get more for when I go clubbing again ) . <p> Wooo !

##1251751 <p> So many men and women today do not have the reinforcement that is needed to keep their goals in perspective and their dreams alive . We believe Dreamshare can help . <p> Here is how it works , in 7 steps : <p> 1 . Commit yourself to a goal . <p> 2 . Find a friend or an associate with whom you can entrust your goal . The friend or associate should have the same faith in you . <p> 3 . Agree to talk at least once a week . You may meet in person , talk on the phone , correspond through e-mail , or meet in an online chat system . <p> You must set aside at least one hour of undisturbed time each week for one another . <p> 4 . Your first talk will take longer . You will each discuss what your long-term goal is , why you have chosen the particular goal and how committed you are to seeing it through . <p> 5 . Then you will carefully lay out the steps required to reach your goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Equal time , equal concern . This part is essential : talk through the steps write them down , think them through together . You may need two meetings to complete this task . <p> 6 . At the end of the planning session(s) , each of you should have a written account of the other person 's step-by-step list . <p> 7 . Each week , you contact one another and discuss what you accomplished that week and what your plans are for the coming week . <p> ================= <p> As time passes and circumstances change , you will need to re-think your plans . <p> You congratulate one another when steps are successfully taken and support one another when little gets done . Most important , you wo n't let one another give up ! <p> We have suggested a partnership of two people ; however , you can work in larger teams . The important point is that you have at least one person you can count on for the long haul , as long as a year . <p> Your dreams are important . 
##1251752 <p> It has been nine months since my husband Nicholas Regush died of a heart attack . We had enjoyed a remarkable bond over the 30 years we were together -- an emotional , intellectual and very sexual partnership , which seemed only to get better and deeper as the years went by . <p> I was thinking about this as I sat in the small , packed hotel-meeting rooms where the " New View " conference on women 's sexuality was held earlier this month in Montreal . <p> As I made my way from one session to the next , I came to an even greater understanding of how fluid human sexuality can be , and how mysteriously , wondrously complex . Many of the conference sessions showed with startling clarity , however , that we are powerfully influenced by a modern culture which would have us believe that " correct " sexual experience can be summed up in a few words or images . And , therefore , " sexual dysfunction " can also be blithely defined -- leaving the door open for the almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viagra , which promises to deliver everyone , who shows a whiff of deviance from the norm , once more sexually upright . <p> A dangerously simplistic view of sexuality but good for business . <p> I was fortunate to have been with Nicholas all those years . He was an emotionally open man with a confident sexual flow . For him sexuality was not just " doing it . " He felt , as I did , that a major aspect of our overall health was that we gave one another a lot of physical comfort : hugs , kisses , nuzzling , holding hands , rubbing feet -- and some very tender nightly love rituals . All of it part of the wide spectrum of an evolving sexual relationship . <p> But our modern culture promotes quite a reduced picture . One of the conference speakers , Jean Kilbourne , showed us slide after slide of graphics from magazines and television , which presented women 's sexuality as totally dependent on a limited notion of beauty , devoid of intellectual curiosity , and sadly dysfunctional if it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known investigative journalist Jean Lenzer gave an eye-opening account of how the clinical results of drug studies could easily be skewed in favor of what drug companies require in order to persuade a needy , older woman that she could be in a sexy swirl again if only she would take this or that little pill . Lenzer titled her talk , " The Wolf In Sheep 's Clothing . " <p> As I listened later in the day to marriage counselor and sex therapist Marty Klein speak about the strong similarities between the sexual needs of both men and women -- in a session called Women are from Earth , Men are from Earth -- I thought of a time , perhaps 30 years earlier , when I had a kind of Hollywood-ideal man in mind for myself : tall , dark and handsome , smart , honest and funny . <p> My mother encouraged the vision . After all , I was nearly six feet tall . And then along came Nicholas with a very different body type from my own . Handsome in his unique way -- brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that he was right for me . Perhaps not tall enough ? she wondered . Still she opined , " With Nicholas , you will never have a dull moment . " <p> She was right . <p> Nicholas questioned everything . He was not easily swayed by the opinions of others and he was ruthless about decrying a culture that tried to put everything , sexuality included , into a tidy little box . <p> This is why I am so pleased to be associated with Red Flags , which Nicholas founded . His vision was to offer readers greater insight into health issues than existed elsewhere on the Internet . <p> Not tied to a world of black and white answers , not funded by drug money , we strive at Red Flags to explore the many shades of grey , the story behind the story . <p> Now that Nicholas is gone -- gone for that mystical number of months , nine -- I feel that I am going through a kind of rebirth . I miss him in ways I can not articulate . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of centeredness . But I know that I will have to find new ways to express my sexual self -- not an easy task in a world that is sadly narrowing its understanding of what it means to be sexual . <p> It is too bad that we even have to have conferences that explore the " new view " -- as important and educational as this one was -- because in truth , our sexuality is always changing . Shaped by cultural forces , politics , religion , world events , human inventiveness , and by technology and an aging population ... <p> Leonore Tiefer , the head organizer of the New View Conference , spoke well when she said in an interview with Ms. Magazine ( worth the read ) : " Sex is always changing . I do n't know exactly what sex used to be like , and I do n't know exactly what sex will look like in the year 2150 . I do n't mind that I do n't know . It 's not a problem . The idea is to prepare people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stop Pfizer from plowing ahead with Viagra . I ca n't stop the efforts of the Right . And even if I could , we know from history that something else would pop right up in its place . The point is to educate people to be prepared to deal with these messages in ways that do n't infringe on their enjoyment of sex , to keep an open mind and , if possible 
##1252252 <p> Brian May was online via Virgin Net on Monday June 1st , from 7pm until 9.30pm . There were a few problems initially , which resulted in a series of questions being typed , and Brian 's answers not coming through and vice versa , so therefore the first few lines wo n't make much sense - Brian was replying to questions asked by the interviewer live , not in the chat . As Brian himself said , the answers given were n't always exactly what he said . Brian was n't the one typing - AndyB was selecting the questions , and Brian was being asked them verbally , and someone else typed his replies . Note : the typos have been corrected , and some of the words have been corrected to give a better sense of what was being said . Here 's the transcript : ) <p> ArikBot changes topic to " Chat live to Brian May and send in your requests . Tonight at 7 . " <p> AndyB reminds lovers of Bad Music and Bad Football teams that we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland Manager Craig brown at 5 , and Brian May at 7 ( I did n't even mention bad haircuts ! ) . <p> ArikBot : This room is the answer room during this evenings chat . Please go to #BrianMayChat to ask your questions . You will only be able to chat in the question room . <p> BrianMay : Hi - we 're live now . The webcast is now starting . <p> BrianMay : Jimi Hendrix , Jeff Beck coolest guitarists on the planet <p> AndyB reminds users to post their questions in the room #BrianMayChat and see answers here <p> BrianMay : It was completely spontaneous , but knew each other because we did guitar legends in Seville - we played all together . I 've only been in one " guitar legend " thing and that was the one in Seville <p> BrianMay : Our Queen songs ... we do n't use many effects in the Queen music . it 's an ac30 .. and a lot of peoples sounds are in the fingers versus the effects - take Hank Marvin for instance <p> BrianMay : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think anyone 's ripping me off really . Sound is very important . It 's underrated . Jeff Beck has a great sound ... his atmospheres and things . I do n't know of any young people from this country that I really like their sound <p> Gaz : Hi Brian ... Gaz from Queen Heaven here - now that you 're seeing more of what the web does , what are your thoughts on things like music files , photos and so on , being available on unofficial websites ? Particularly MP3 technology , which allows massive compression at CD quality ? And are you against unreleased tracks being made available for download , such as the two tracks you performed on Virgin Radio last week , and things like the Highlander version of ' A Kind Of Magic ' ? <p> AndyB : Do you know what mp3 is ? <p> BrianMay : Not a lot .. <p> AndyB : Big scandal , ' cos it 's CD-quality sound , that people can play over the internet for free , without paying royalties - and now youcan get unreleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs attention but I think it 's one of those things which is bound to happen , and you 're a Luddite if you stand in the way . It will sort itself out to a certain extent . Erm .. yeah .. It does kind of change the way you feelabout things , to an extent , you know . It used to be that you could stand on the street corner and play - or you could do a live show somewhere , and just think it 's for the moment . Now you have to think that it will be out there for forever more - somebody will have bootlegged it , and it makes you feel .. It kind of spoils the moment sometimes . I actually thought about that , doing the Virgin Radio thing , I thought , this is gon na be on bootlegs all over the world , you know , ( laughs ) and it made me feel ... I think I would have been more ' relaxed and more spontaneous if I had n't had that thought in my head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of'thing , and I tend to be not a person who does everything right all the time , you know , so ... <p> AndyB : Do you learn from your mistakes ? <p> Brian : Yes , but a lot of mistakes are just random things you know , and if you do a whole tour you are probably going to play each of the songs brilliantly one night , in the whole tour , and the rest of the nights there will be things wrong with them , you know , or there might be magic moments , and that 's what live is about . If you start sort of making everything permanent , there 's a danger of losing the spontaneity . That bothers me more than the royalties , you know . I think royalties will sort themselves out , but <p> AndyB : Do you check out the queen fan sites ? or the Brian May official site ? Do you have a hand in that ... do you know queen-fip.com ? <p> Brian : Yeah that one I know . That is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of it . They used my suggestions to make the look better . I do n't surf the net in general though . I have someone do it for me instead , because I find it sluggish . <p> Tobias : Hello Brian . My name is Tobias and I 'm from Sweden . I would just like to say that I think you 're the best guitar player in the world . I 'm also wondering if you have any plans to visit Sweden , or any of the Scandinavian countries , on your tour ? <p> BrianMay : Tobias : There are dates on our tour currently to play in Sweden - we do n't have a drummer at the moment and that may impede our playing in Sweden , but yes I hope to go there and see ya Tobias <p> ( At this point the questions and answers seemed to lose track of each other completely - where possible we 've matched them up . There are quite a few questions from here on that do n't get answered for one reason or another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another thing worth noting is that questions being asked by the interviewer , from ther ones emailed in , are preceded by Brina repeating the question . Ed ) <p> GeneRex : Hi Brian , How do you cope with dry periods of creativity ? <p> BrianMay : www.virgin.net/music to see this live via real video - that is a news flash for ya <p> BrianMay : Yes yes no no to releasing an album with Patrick Moore <p> RedSpecial98 : What 's the word on the queen BBC sessions ... will they be released ? <p> BrianMay : He actually writes good music . He 's an exceptional ... <p> homer : Brian - are there any particular queen songs that you used to dread performing live due to their intricacy ? <p> Miracle : How much money would you need before you would part with your Red Special ? <p> BrianMay : Ok , we 're back now <p> ryvers : You Wrote about 3 new guitars in the another world booklet .... what are they ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> BrianMay : I have guitars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Red Special live - it will be back in time for the tour . <p> BrianMay : For Chris Cooper , I still think We Will Rock You is great and I love hearing it at the football matches . Gives me a very warm feeling to know that it is heard all over the world . But can I make it public knowledge that I am not a football expert ! <p> tweety : What is the song that could n't be on your live album for copyright reasons ? <p> BrianMay : The song that could n't be on my live album was God by John Lennon due to copyright control - Yoko has control , and she never replied to me . So it 's not on there but surely it 's been bootlegged <p> BrianMay : Fried chicken ... it was just a stupid aside that went into the song .. you know which one I 'm talking about . - there are a lot of things in queen albums that you do n't expect that ' s why we threw them in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mention them either . there is a glaringly obvious secret though - a lot of people could n't find the secret .. a lot of the journos . The fans found it , but the reviewers did n't . <p> Mayzinha : Hi Mr. May I 'm Ana from Brazil and I 'd like to know if you receive the gifts that we send to you or not ? <p> BrianMay : mayzinha : Not sure if we received your gifts . I try to answer people when the time , but there is a lot of people to reply to ... thanks and we 'll try and get back to you . <p> BrianMay : dazed and confused : It was a hard choice . What Are We Made Of was a contender for the album , but just not enough room - there was never a version that was just right for the album The Carmine track just was n't the right one . This is an internet goody ... I am thinking of putting together another album with all the stuff we did n't use on Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Australia ... If someone asked you to shave off your hair for charity or a dare would you consider doing it and if it grew back do you think it would grow curly again ? <p> BrianMay : For lizard : Re my hair . yes , no , no , maybe and no. - it 's natural and that 's official . Do n't believe the press - other hair mishaps include setting on fire when we were at Brixton . It grew back curly though . always curly . Ca n't change it . Regarding who 's right about black holes . I do n't think either of them are right about black holes - Einstein got most of the things right about black holes . I 'm not an expert on black holes , I must admit . do n't know all the physics . but Einstein was generally right - he may have missed a couple of things though <p> AndyB : Question from Twinkie from Southend : How did the Brian May band form ? <p> BrianMay : Julie managed the Queen office for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children hate me being such a big star , so please them alone . it 's very hard for them to have a father who is always in the public eye . None of them are following them into music , although Jimmy may surprise us all next week <p> BrianMay : Re the photo on the album cover of Another World - I saw the picture of the tree in a magazine and I had to go find it - the location has to remain secret so it does n't get trampled . <p> BrianMay : Who influenced my music the most ... everyone you love influences your music the most . It 's hard to say . I lost my mother a year ago as well and that was in my work as well . The biggest emotion in creation is the bridge to optimism . <p> CatherineZielin : Do you know what the 2 bonus tracks will be for the August U.S. release of Another World ? <p> BrianMay : Queen had its time and place and at the moment I 'm not concentrating on that era . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US in August . There will probably be a bonus mini CD with it . The American version of the CD will be different to the UK version . <p> BrianMay : Did I like Bohemian Rhapsody being used in Wayne 's World ? Yes , I thought it was very good . We used to do the same thing that the guys were doing as well . We used to bang our heads <p> sweflash : Hello Brian ! This is Stefan from Sweden who is writing . How will you replace Cozy ? Have you asked Roger ? <p> BrianMay : The most interesting moment with Queen and playing with Bad News . Had a great time playing with BN at reading . - they were very funny and spontaneous . It was great playing with Vim . Any arguments in the studio they had were real . <p> Angela : Brian , this is more of a plea than a question . Are you going to perform in America at all ? If so , please come near Wisconsin ! <p> BrianMay : Angela : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go if we can drum up the audience . The potential audience seems to be dwindling in the states though . The last tour I did in the states ... how should I put this , I was kind of embarrassed for the band because of the size of the audience . If it 's possible to go to the states I will be there <p> BrianMay : What were the best videos I 've done ? Ca n't really tell you . <p> BrianMay : The best thing of playing in South America was being taken out in an armoured car after the gigs - they 'd stop everything for us . <p> Gianky1 : Brian why you were dressed as a penguin on the back sleeve photos of the QUEEN ( 1st ) album as like as the dress for " I 'm going slightly mad " ? ? ? This is a question that many Queen fans want to know but nobody ever answered ! Can you tell something about it ? <p> BrianMay : gianky1 : it was a whim - Now you know the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at ( besides the Virgin Megastore of course ) ? Also , what is your favourite venue in the world to play ? <p> BrianMay : nealf : My favourite London venue was the Hyde Park gig . It was out of this world - it was a kind of homecoming and we had n't been accepted in London till then . it was brilliant to get the reaction we did from the fans . - one of my other favourite venues is the Albert Hall . it has a magic to it . - we 'll be playing there this fall so try and get there . <p> BrianMay : What drives me ? ha ha , the car joke ? The Driven By You thing is not a joke , it 's an aphorism . What drives me is just the search to find stuff that has never been found before . I just like to get up there and play things and just to see the reaction from the audience . When it all comes to fruition is the moment you get up and play it live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your favourite holiday destination ? <p> BrianMay : Hello petra ! Wow I had a brilliant time in Auckland - I 'd love to get back there . My favourite hols destination is a little island called Kourasaw in the Dutch Caribbean . <p> r-special1 : Hi , Mr. May . This is Livia from Vienna . First thanks for your all the music you gave to us . How does your love to astronomy influence your music ? <p> BrianMay : Would I have done anything different in my career ? Like playing in SA during the height of apartheid ? I could talk about this all night . Sanctions always hurt the poor , the weak , the children . <p> ittemie : Virve here , I 'm from Finland and I would like to know that are you coming to any concert in Finland , at this summer , or next summer ? I have waited that you would come here , because when you last time were at Finland , it was in 1974 and I were n't born yet then = ( <p> Gambit : Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences were Jimi Hendrix and Beatles etc . Have you got any bands today that you like the sound of ? <p> BrianMay : Hmm , Re the different influences in Another World . There were many different styles in it because I went where they lead me . <p> toyrx : Brian , do you have E-Mail and do you look at the Queen sites on the Internet ? <p> BrianMay : Re playing the bass on my new album . I play because it 's part of the writing process . I 'm not as great as John Deacon , but I like it . <p> TvR would just like to say hello to Brian May ..... " Hiya Brian .. " <p> Hoyerman : Brian , which song do you feel best shows the versatility of your Red Special guitar ( whether Queen or not ) ? ? <p> BrianMay : Re my project with Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins . The project I did with him was perfect because he put so much sweat and enthusiasm in it . He knows that John Bonham and Cozy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gianky1 : Will the song familiarly known as " Is everybody happy ... " ( recorded on 1987 and aired on a fan club convention ) be released in the near future ? ? ? I find it lovely , what about your opinion ? <p> BrianMay : Can I just say one thing before that . Can I say sorry to all the guys who queued up at Virgin Radio . They did n't make it known that I was n't actually going to be there . <p> MLG : Do you miss Cozy and what will he most be remembered for ? <p> BrianMay : Were any lefty red specials made ? yes there were some unlicensed Japanese copies made . - strangely enough , I think Cozy had one . I may be wrong , but someone that I know requested one <p> GeneRex : Brian , Would Cozy and Mick Ronson make it into your all time best fun band ? This is Gene here in the USA . <p> BrianMay : Hey GeneRex ! It sure would be funny . There are so many good people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a TV show with Rick Parfitt . He 's a great guy . I also have known the Quo guys for along time . They 're great and should be afforded a lot more respect than they get . Everyone should see Quo . They are the best of their kind . And people will miss them when they 're gone <p> Iomi : Are you a long time Black Sabbath fan ? <p> BrianMay : Hello mr Iomi ! I 've known Tony from Black Sabbath for years and years and years - he 's a brilliant guitar player and a human being of great substance . <p> BrianMay : What would I get rid of in the rubbish - any five things in the world , if I could - let 's start with the millennium dome - why are we building this huge white elephant - it 's full up with the millennium dome . - I think that we should build hospitals instead of the dome . - I work with a lot of charities and think that the money should be spent better helping those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered biting the head off a live bat ? <p> Sheri : What was the reason behind changing guitarists for the first Brian May Band tour from the guy who was with you in South America to Jamie Moses ? I 'm glad you did - Jamie 's great ! <p> BrianMay : Regarding new guitar players . We now have Jamie playing with us versus the guitar player we had in South America because we found him and that was it . <p> Loverboy : What do you think of the numerous tribute bands around ? I hear you asked for your own copy of " Ga Ga " s CD ? <p> BrianMay : Loverboy : I think queen tribute bands are great . however we have to keep them at arm 's length other wise it could be too dangerous . Many of them are very good <p> Sheene : Hi Brian , this is Gary and Emma from Southend , we loved the t-shirts from the promo nights , how about BM clogs next time ? <p> BrianMay : Gary , Emma : brilliant ! - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spice girls now that Geri has left ... I 'd just have to do what they do . I thought that they were all great and feel for them . I know what they 've been through - it 's very hard . <p> Doug : Brian . Something that I 've always wanted to know that 's been bugging me for ages ... In the Magic Years video , there 's an interlude where you are at the piano , in the studio recording One Vision , playing a lovely little piece . What is it ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> BrianMay : Doug : I think it was a song called Butterfly , I never released it . It 's somewhere in the vaults . I do n't play piano very often but I was taught it . It 's good for helping to write songs . <p> Wolfgang : Wolfgang from Germany . Queen music is used a lot in TV adverts . What do you think of this and do you ( i.e. members of the band ) approve the products ? <p> BrianMay : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's music is used for their commercials . We can say no to some products and I think we said no to more than one smoking commercial . It 's the same thing when people send us covers of our songs they 've sampled . We 've said no to some covers that people want to record . <p> TheGuvnor : You ' ve been working over 20 years with Queen and as a solo artist and during these 20 years I 'm sure you recorded a lot of songs ( " Hangman " .... ) that never made it on an album . Then , there are a lot of live recordings , live videos and other " rarities " . Can we expect anything to be released in the ( near ) future ? Christian , Germany <p> BrianMay : Re Queen : There are no plans to release any Queen music that has not been previously released . <p> BrianMay : The good thing about technology is I can play the piano and record it into midi . and if there are mistakes , I can go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like you come up to Edinburgh for tea and scones and play guitar with you . Fancy it ? <p> BrianMay : BlackQueen : sounds great , if I have any time in twenty years . thank you . <p> AndyB : Brian do you ever read any of the fanzines like POTU and Chronicle ? ( from Bev , please blow me a kiss ) ) <p> BrianMay : Do I have any hidden hobbies ? my big hobby is photography . I collect stereo photographs from the nineteenth century . - T.R. Williams is one of the photographers who I am trying to find photographs from ... if anyone has any ! <p> BrianMay : Bev : I 'm gon na blow you a kiss ! <p> AndyB : Can you play " harry palmer " : - ) <p> BrianMay : The best way to start playing guitar ? I 'm hopeless at playing scales and do n't know what modes are called . Instead try and be instinctive first and analytic afterwords , although it 's good to study the theory of music . <p> AndyB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie Your Mother Down " - Any chance of a quick burst ? <p> BrianMay : Got ta tune up before I can play any requests . <p> BrianMay : What age is good to start playing guitar ? you can do it anytime . <p> BrianMay : Was the pose on the album cover done for yoga reasons ? No , more for resting reasons <p> Freddie-vanter : Brian , can you tell us more about the secret instrumental track on Another World ? <p> BrianMay : Am I a vegetarian ? No , I 'm just a person who does n't eat meat . <p> BrianMay : It was the latter ... I have enormous respect for Jimi Hendrix but when I played his music it I took it to another place . <p> MaNoPlaS2 : Hi Brian ! I 'm from Spain . Now I 'm working on a clone of Red Special , but I think that is very expensive now build a guitar in these days ! ! ! What do you recommended , please . You are Incredible ! ! ! <p> BrianMay : manoplas2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some help when making it . Ask people who understand woodwork , guitars and electronics . Always ask advice <p> BrianMay : Sue : My nicknames at school . I had lots . The best one that comes to mind is Brimay as it was the name of a box of matches at the time . I was also called ' you ' . <p> BrianMay : Does " the queen of heaven " looking down on us refer to Freddie ? Different things come to me at different times . So no , not directly . Lyrics come in different patterns . the queen of heaven is just the queen of heaven . <p> tweety : how do you make that ' floating wave sound-effect ' you used in GET DOWN MAKE LOVE on LIVE KILLERS ? ? any chance of showing us ? <p> BrianMay : Hello tweety ! We had a special pedal made for the harmoniser . <p> Volker : Volker from Germany here ( great show yesterday ! ) I would like to know what you are doing all day , I mean " normal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house work . Could you describe a usual " Brian May-day " ? <p> BrianMay : Hi Volker ! My days are very chaotic . I talk to a lot of people on TV and radio and internet chats like this . There is n't really a typical day . The phone goes all day . I worry about my kids , where my lady is . I worry about Queen and at about 11pm I try and make some music . I like to go for a walk or swimming or in the garden when I can . It 's a busy kind of life , but I guess I 'm lucky . <p> ryvers : Please play or sing something from " breakthru " , I 'd like to dedicate it to the love of my life , Xav , because I wrote the lyrics on a valentine card to her ... <p> Brazil : Do you play guitar in the bathroom ? <p> BrianMay : Do I play guitar in the bathroom ? No , because your fingers get soft . You ca n't do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in the steam bath to get your vocals sounding well , but you do n't want your fingers to get soft . <p> BrianMay : How do I feel answering questions via a computer ? It 's ok , but I 'd prefer to do my own typing . because my answers are n't totally coming through . In the future I 'd rather do my own typing even if it is slow ! <p> AndyB : One last important question I 've been getting all night from Mark Please ask Cherry to marry me whilst playing the Wedding March from Flash <p> BrianMay : Ok Cherry if you 're out there , you have to marry Mark . Just do it . You have to be careful of the Wedding March though because it has a bit of a death march in it . <p> BrianMay : One last chord for the road <p> AndyB : Rob Leedham is desperate for a lick from Bohemian Rhapsody ( the bit that goes before " nothing really matters " ) <p> BrianMay : Thanks for the chat . bye ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the chatters here ! Thanks a million for taking time out for us . Brian would like to chat live to you all ... he is in the chat room now and on the keyboard ! <p> AndyB says you can chat directly to Brian now .. he is at the computer ! ( waits for deluge ) <p> ( There was far too much going on at this point , as the channel became unmoderated , so we 've made vast edits and saved just the bits of Brian speaking , and a few other comments . Ed ) <p> BrianMay : Hey ! ! ! ! OK , this is Brian typing - if I 'd been a better typist I would 've done it all this way ...... I really enjoyed talking to you all - it was a nice first stab at this kind of thing ..... hopefully we 'll improve things .........

##1257250 <h> Depression <p> This is my testimony ( in a nutshell ) in dealing with and eventually overcoming severe depression . <p> For me , 1989 had been a productive and hope filled year . After graduating from Bible College in 1988 , I had joined a church planting team as the assistant pastor . I expected 1990 to be one of best years of my life as I planned to further my theological training and join another church planting venture in pursuit of my goal of becoming a missionary in Thailand . <p> Probably the primary factor in causing my depression was genetic inheritance , both of my parents had suffered from it . However , there were many other factors that contributed to its severity and duration . Throughout that year a number of factors combined to cause the gradual decline of my mental and physical health . I had neglected physical exercise , eaten poorly and devoted little time to rest and recreation . I worked full time as well as serving part time in the church . The sleeplessness which had troubled me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ever more fatigued , panic attacks and obsessive fearful thoughts afflicted me in increasing frequency and severity , even though I had no idea what they were at that time . Undiagnosed complex partial epilepsy could have been another factor . <p> On the other hand , throughout that year I remained positive and full of zeal for life , excitedly pursuing my goals . <p> In late November 1989 I went to Thailand for a hectic ten-day missionary orientation course , where I barely slept at all . When I returned to Melbourne , I fell apart emotionally , physically , mentally , and spiritually . Although 178cm tall , my weight had fallen to 55kg . The final straw came a few days later - I suffered a shock so powerful that for almost 24 hours I was unable to complete a single thought in my mind . <p> After eight nightmarish days that defied all reason , I suddenly bounced back to some semblance of normality . Unfortunately , I collapsed again two weeks later , where my mind unravelled to the extent that for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed , rocking from side to side as I tried in vain to pull myself out of terrifying panic attacks that would not cease . <p> This time , instead of bouncing back , I remained stuck in the hellish nightmare , which continued without respite into the New Year . I felt disturbed and ill at ease all day and could barely sleep at night . My mind became sluggish , stuck in a rut of thinking fearful , anxious thoughts all the time . Many physical complaints assailed me , missed , palpitating and racing heart beats , very painful aches in the shoulders and jaw , nausea and chest pains , difficulty breathing , and more . Emotional symptoms included anger , confusion , irritability , loss of interest in life , fear that I would never escape the nightmare , and I withdrew from almost all relationships . My spiritual life was equally a shambles , I struggled with anger and bitterness towards God , could no longer feel His presence , and felt guilty all of the time . <p> Although I continued to languish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven months , there were a number of things that slowly helped me cope with the ordeal . <p> When my mother , who had been away , returned to find me bedridden , she bundled me off that bed and kept me busy me with menial chores around the home . Although this required a massive effort on my part , I soon realised that the distraction provided by these activities slightly lessened the inner pain . When I had to return to work a few days later , although I was still a complete and utter mess , I found that being busy at work further dulled depression 's intensity . <p> Around that time a friend who had experienced depression , gave me a very helpful piece of advice . " Find anything that you enjoy and pursue it . Just try to have fun . " My unspoken response was , " How can I have fun when I am like this ? " However , although very difficult to do , with Christ 's help I was able to put his advice into practice . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ' Philippians 4:13 KJV . ) I bought a computer , played engrossing computer games , and over the next five years wrote three novels . These hobbies helped keep my mind productively occupied and were a significant factor in helping to break my mind 's habit of thinking fearful thoughts . I can remember one day when I was lying on my bed stuck in the grip of a savage panic attack , when I managed to fix my eyes upon Jesus , and He said , " Peter , you do n't need to do this . Come with Me - I have lots of constructive things for us to do together . " So I got off the bed , sat at my desk and lost myself in one of my hobbies , and started to feel better . <p> In March 1990 I admitted I needed professional help , so I forced myself to see a trained counsellor . She counselled me once a month for several months , sympathising with what I was going through , giving practical advice , and through prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to face and deal with several deep emotional wounds and flawed thought processes . She also helped me to see the fearful thoughts that were terrorizing me from another perspective -- the true Biblical perspective . <p> Following my counsellor 's advice , I went onto anti-depressants under my doctor 's supervision . Although the tablets did not heal the depression , within two weeks they had significantly dulled its effects . My diary entries began to contain a faint glimmer of hope . With the symptoms dulled , I found myself more able to concentrate on the task of recovery . <p> During those first eight months , I frequently blamed Jesus for allowing such a thing to afflict me . Why would not He heal me ? I read the Bible constantly , spent hours in prayer , but these provided little relief . However , although I could no longer feel His presence , I knew Jesus held me in His hands . I continually reminded myself that He is Faithful and True , and kept reaching out to Him . It was in this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnt to stand fast upon God 's Word and on promises such as : ' I will never leave you and " And surely I am with you always , to the very end of the age . " Matthew 28:20 . This next verse was particularly comforting , " My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me . I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; no one can snatch them out of my hand . " John 10:27 <p> In late July 1990 , by a miracle of the Lord 's provision , I came across the book , ' Self Help for Your Nerves ' by Dr Claire Weekes . My life changed when I read the comprehensive list of symptoms that can be caused by anxiety and depression and how they are caused . The bewilderment and confusion that had terrorised me for eight months were replaced by understanding , which brought a tangible sense of relief all in itself . ' Give me understanding , and I will keep your law and obey it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to my life when I put into practice the practical steps presented in the book . The most helpful technique was learning how to face , accept , and learn to live with the symptoms of depression rather than fighting , fleeing or fearing them - and then letting time pass . Putting these techniques into practice slowed down and eventually stopped the endless flow of negative adrenalin , reducing the severity and duration of depression 's symptoms , until they eventually faded away . <p> As I read ' Self Help for Your Nerves , ' I realised that her techniques were practical applications of Bible verses that teach us how to cope with anxiety and troubling circumstances , such as these : <p> Acceptance : ' Consider it pure joy , my brothers , whenever you face trials of many kinds , because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance . ' James 1:2-3 <p> ' Be joyful always ; ; give thanks in all circumstances , for this is God 's will for you in Christ Jesus . ' 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 <p> Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want . ' Philippians 4:12-13 <p> Letting Time Pass while Trusting that God is in Control : " Do not let your hearts be troubled . Trust in God ; trust also in me . " John 14:1 <p> ' Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial , because when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him <p> " Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink ; or about your body , what you will wear ... Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life ? Matthew 6:25,27 <p> ' Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding . ' Proverbs 3:5 . <p> Three months after reading ' Self Help for Your Nerves ' my counsellor said I no longer required counselling . Although I was still suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to get back into things . Over the next six months , I joined a new church , became a musician in a home group , started teaching Sunday School , and engaged in normal social activities again . <p> It took about four more years to recover from depression , but I kept busy throughout that time , staying involved with the church , joining a gym , and pursuing engrossing hobbies . Some of depression 's symptoms took longer to fade away than others , especially the mental ones , but by changing the way I reacted to them robbed them of their power as I no longer feared them . <p> Today I can look back at that time and say that I have no regrets . It was during those years that I learned to rely completely and utterly upon Christ and His Word , rather than upon my feelings and circumstances . I can see how He brought good out of that trial , drawing me closer to Him and setting me free from lifelong anxieties . I also found myself better equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share my story so that others may find comfort and encouragement , as I received from the my time of great distress . ' Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort , who comforts us in all our troubles , so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves

Known as Spooky , he was well known for his performances in which he emulated the stage personas from Busta Rhymes ' vivacious delivery to Snoop 's debonair flows . <p> With his pure , unadulterated talent , charisma , and lyrical skill , he is taking his message of awareness , to the masses . <p> Upon immediate arrival in the states ( to pursue higher education ) Wanlov proved his skill in the freestyle circuit of the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wanlov , then still known as Spooky , won over the respect of local emcees in the Central Texas area . <p> After performing at local events and shows he eventually ventured out of Texas making his imprint on both coasts . One of his most memorable experiences was performing with Boundleczz of the Rapskallyonz for DJ Hi-Tek in Cincinnati , OH who personally let them know how awed he was after their performance and that he was looking forward to working with them . <p> That stroke of good luck went bad right after Wanlov left Boundleczz in Ohio and headed back to Texas . Boundleczz had to re-locate to Chicago for personal reasons losing important contacts in the process especially D.J Hi-Tek . <p> Wanlov on the other hand went through I.N.S abduction to a private holding facility in Laredo , TX for school status reasons .

Seeing how hard it was to get into the music industry , with positive , socially conscious messages while maintaining secular appeal , Wanlov decided to start an indie record label with his childhood best friend and fellow Hiphop junkie Gerald Hagan . This has provided Wanlov the base to promote himself as well as seek other conscious artist to work with .

Ok . I am not even going to elaborate on this . I will let you make your own decision . Not interested ? Don ? ? t call . <p> I am a male residing in Endicott , NY . My name is Doug . I recently met a Woman in Athens Greece . We became married and as we were planning to return to the USA her mother living in Ghana , Africa , became seriously ill . Yes , Ghana the scam capital of the world ! She went to be with her Mother , who eventually died . This all happened about a year ago . <p> When trying to leave Ghana she discovered that her Greece passport had expired . Not knowing the extreme difficulties involved in leaving the Country of Ghana , she thought that since her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for a Visa and Passport there and make the flight . <p> She did apply and ran into all kinds of problems . Simply because she showed up at the airport and they had on record her maiden name and she presented them with her married name . Ghana is VERY strict on duplicate passports with different names on them . Even the marriage certificate , which she had , did not help . She was told to go back and reapply for a different type of Visa if she wanted to use that passport . <p> This has taken MONTHS and THOUSANDS of dollars . Since she was coming to America , and wants to be able to start a business here she applied for a high level Visa . Again , us not knowing the complexity of all of this , we continued with this visa . Comes to find out that this visa has even more requirements than any other visa has ( they all have a lot ) . <p> One by one , we met these requirements . One was that she must have $5.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she must have $10,000 in travelers checks that can only be cashed at Wells Fargo , Chase , Or Bank of America in the states . This is a U.S. requirement put on people coming from Ghana who plan on staying and working here . In many cases a lot of these people come here and fail to find work and end up on welfare roles . Thus the requirement for anyone , coming to America with this Visa , to have enough funds to get them back home . <p> The BIG requirement is that they must also own a substantial asset in Ghana . Again all of this is to make it very difficult for poor immigrants to come to America with no means of supporting them self or have nothing to go back to . Land was one of the things that met this requirement and would be the cheapest for us . So we purchased a parcel of land . And the law for this visa said that it must be in the Province where she lived , or in this case where her Mother lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghana and was a half way decent district . Most of Ghana is on the poverty level . <p> This cost ME $70,000 . I am now OVER $100,000 into this . I am now out of funds . The plus side of this is that when she arrives in America , she has the $15,000 in cash and travelers checks AND she can now sell the land . <p> Land in Ghana , is the one asset that is very strong as Ghana is a leading Gold producer . Check it out on goggle . <p> I paid $70,000 for the land . The land has now been valued much more because there is gold dust all around the area . Sure this is sounding like a Disney fairy tale but please read on . <p> In addition to the $15,000 the land can be sold immediately . And her agent there already has people interested in it for far more than the $70,000 I just paid . <p> HERE IS MY BUSINESS PROPOSION : <p> I need $13,000 to complete the expense to get my Wife here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that . <p> As soon as she arrives , we will put up the land for sale and expect an immediate response . It took me 8 months to come up with the $70,000 and during that time the owners were contacted by several other people looking to buy the land . He could not sell it to them because he was under contract to do that with my Wife . <p> So in addition of the immediate payback of the $13,000 we , you and I , will discuss and CONTRACT with me that I WILL put the land up for Immediate sale , and I will also remit to you , an ADDITIONAL sum that will be MORE than satisfying to you . Another $13,000 ? I don ? ? t care at this point . Something you and I will agree to . I AM ALSO OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON DEVELOPMENT OF THIS LAND INTO SURVEYED SECTORS . IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTATED THAT GOLD DUST EXISTS ON THE SRUFACE AND POSSILBE VIENS LIE BELOW . I WOULD CONSIDER PART OWNERSHIP . THIS IS ANOTHER SEPERATE BUSINESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have as documentation : <p> The DEED to the land Our marriage certificate <p> The other documents required by the Visa <p> She had to have a police record approved <p> She had to have a complete physical <p> I also have her agents name and contact number which you can call . I also offer to you that you come to my HOME and see for yourself all of this documentation and hundreds of emails that back all of this up . I am sure you would be satisfied at that point . <p> Fundamental to all of this is that as soon as I procure The $13,000 she will be on a Delta flight to JFK in NYC within a day . Your investment and whatever funds ; you deem appropriate for this risk will be given to you within a 30 day peroiod .. probably sooner as we will immediately be selling this land . The reaming funds are for : $7,300 for the agents fee . Everything in that country is done through an agent ? travel , registering the Visa and Passport Documentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney here . <p> The air line ticket of $3,500 , the balance for miscellaneous expenses . <p> Sure I can wait but at this point I am Financially drained . I am retired and on disability . Yes I can prove that as well . And it would take me another year to raise these funds . I already used what I have saved . <p> I think a phone conversation would be appropriate if you are interested . I am posting a very long ad simply because I want to use it as a filter . I do not want many calls only to go through this dissertation and have someone not interested . <p> So after reading this proposal and you wish to take the next step please give me a call <p> My name is Doug <p> I will give you my full name and address when we talk . <p> My phone number is 607 232 4310 <p> If you have any serious doubts .

##1264851 <h> WELCOME TO MEDI- MOSES PROSTATE CENTER ! <p> MALE POTENCY <p> What exactly is the essence of male potency ? If we look at it from psychotherapeutic point , the main constituent of male potency is the exchange of symbols into pictures . The fact is that different genders have different dominating brain hemispheres : women perceive the world by means of pictures or images , which represent the right brain hemisphere , while men perceive the world by means of symbols or numbers , represented by the left brain hemisphere . A man , who is able to change his numbers into her pictures , is the one who has the real male strength . <p> Usually we define the male potency by the level of male hormones androgens , especially the most important one of them - testosterone . The testosterone macho will have bigger muscles , higher temper , and tougher character . Nevertheless , such men are not always successful in life , including success with women . Male strength is the composition of androgens and wits . What does male potency depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temperament , or your disposition , general mood , or innate aspects of your personality that are genetically based . Penis is the measure of the man 's overall health . The coherent functioning of heart , blood vessels , nervous system and endocrine gland are very important for potency . Self-confidence and life experience are also essential for male sexual strength . A blow to the pride in the past or low self-esteem can very often lead to erectile dysfunction . Sometimes we should look way back to find the cause for it , when a mental trauma from the childhood comes out at the physical level causing sexual problems . Also , male potency depends a lot on the woman . A woman with high sexual drive can raise the sexual bar of her partner . <p> What is the most common cause for sexual weakness ? About 20 years ago , erectile dysfunction was considered to be caused by psychological factors in 80% of the time . The doctors could not make out the sources of sexual dysfunction such as vessels congestion , hormonal issues and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowadays medical views have drastically changed , and the cases with psychological causes for erectile dysfunction account for only 10-15% . Although it is still usually pretty hard to raise the potency to the high level without the help of a psychotherapist . <p> Which diseases decrease sexual drive ? First on the list are cardiovascular diseases . The male genitals are covered with blood vessels , therefore if the heart is not doing a good job pumping blood and/or your blood vessels are clogged up , there is no ground for a good strong erection . Secondly , diabetes and other hormonal disorders have been linked to decrease of sexual drive . It has been proven that a small decrease in sugar level in your blood can lead to a drastic increase in erection strength and quality of your sex life . The third disease is obesity . Other diseases like hypertension and some prescription drugs use in managing hypertension . <p> What is the difference between male and female potency ? Sexual drive is determined by the testosterone 's production in both men and women . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women 's sexual drive is characterized as an emotional surge , and men 's is characterized with logic . If we asked a couple to fantasize about the happiest day in their lives , the woman would be imagining him marrying her , and he would be imagining her in bed . <p> What are the characteristics of the sexually potent man ? Surprisingly enough , sexually potent men do not necessarily shine with physical beauty . So why are women attracted to them ? As a rule , women tend to look for a protector by whose side they would feel secure and peaceful . In other words they are looking for a father figure . If a woman feels dominance in a man she agrees to submit to him . Another indispensible feature of a sexually strong man is he can only be an optimist . <p> How do career achievements influence a man 's sexual life ? There are two sides to the answer to this question . On the one hand , successes at work are directly related to sexual well-being ( continuous work-related stress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes excessive sexual activeness is just a cover-up for social fiasco . On the other hand , the more work-related troubles you have , the less is your sexual drive . Studies have proven that people with less intellectual jobs such as janitors , plumbers , etc. have a stronger potency . There is one more pattern : the bigger the city , the less the sexual strength of its residents . The civilization 's progress , technical advances , huge amounts of information , a bunch of contacts separate the person from his/her biological essence and cause a ton of problems and conflicts . It is no wonder that after a day spent commuting and communicating that by the end of the day there is little energy left for sexual purposes . And nowadays we have to travel and converse a lot . A person born in 1900 has travelled as many miles and talked to as many people throughout his whole life as a person born in 1973 has travelled and talked to over a course of one year . Such huge number of contacts can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why are erectile dysfunction and potency issues such a hot topic today ? Erectile - Dysfunction , Premature-Ejaculation , Sexual-Weakness or Impotency , are common to the penis . Most men suffer the above mentioned sexual problems and not able to make love to their partners satisfactorily and this is a problem bothering men and women . It is the desire of all to indulge in sexual feelings or sexual acts . It is our natural state of mind to feel this way and naturally make love and produce other life form . Statistics recently showed most men think of sex every three minutes . This means a man is a sex animal , and like to have sex regularly or very frequently , but inability to have an erection is a problem for man to have his desire . <p> Another very popular reason for male sexual weakness is continual stress . Modern society persistently offers the model of living in the future . Compare our ancestors who used to live " here and now " , to a modern person who constantly rakes up the past and tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life affect a man 's potency ? It has been noticed that married men maintain sexual strength for 7-10 years longer than single men . Regular quality sex can drastically prolong the man 's sexual clock . Men who have sex with a constant partner at least twice a week maintain their sexual drive at a respectable level way longer than those who tend to often change their sexual partners and inconsistent husbands practicing sexual abstinence for a month or longer . <p> Is it true that cell phones lower your sexual potency ? We often see the headlines in the press connecting using the cell phone with lower count of sperm ( minimum 30% less ) . This warning concerns mostly those who wear their cell on the belt or in the trousers ' pocket . However , there are no scientific grounds for this concern . If there was at least one case like this it would have been known all over the world and the company producing the cell phone would have been bankrupt . <p> How does alcohol affect a man 's sexual abilities ? Men drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potency issues already at 40 years of age . Men enjoying a glass of wine once a week or less are very likely to be still functioning at 75 . Those who love beer risk the most , since 1 liter of this drink is equal to 100g of vodka . At the same time beer contains particles that can cause addiction over time . Beer also contains substances that increase your appetite . The beer belly is usually a result of snacks that go with the beer such as chips , pistachios , groundnuts. etc . The potency and sexual drive of beer lovers suffers as well . The ideal drink before the night of passion is the half a glass of Champaign ( but not more than half a glass ) or a little bit of dry wine . <p> Is there a diet that contributes to good potency ? Ancient wise men claimed that in order to strengthen your male potency you should eat everything that looks like a penis and/or has a red color ( bananas , asparagus , meat , carrots ) . Modern doctors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of vitamins such as seafood , vegetables , fruit , etc. are good for erection . If a woman wants a passionate night of love it is important not to over-feed her man at dinner . A light protein-full dinner ( vegetable omelet ) will be a perfect culinary foreplay . Although , who serves dinner and how is much more important than what kinds of foods are served . If it is done by a woman you love , you are guaranteed to have a good erection . <p> Is it true that the sexual interest in your partner inevitably fades away over time ? It would be more correct to say that the sexual interest changes . If the sexual drive were to inevitable fade away , then all the marriages would break up or would hold up on children only . The perpetual passion and hormonal surge that are typical for the beginning stages of dating do not last forever , and that is normal . What kind of relationship you will have over years depends a lot on a woman . With time a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding . Interestingly , in brothels for elderly they are being " serviced " by elderly women . The retirees feel a lot more comfortable with the person of the same age than with a girl who is a lot younger than them . <p> Do men go through " menopause " ? Every man without exception will experience the decrease in production of the sex hormones . Their quantity starts to decrease at the age of 25 . However , at first this process is smooth and almost unnoticeable . But starting from about 45 years of age the testosterone production decreases abruptly . Over time the testosterone production is not capable of keeping up the same efficiency as before . Some men go through this process painlessly ; others experience muscles getting flabby , bones becoming fragile , they may also feel drowsiness and increased irritability . Sexual tastes may change as well from increased sexuality to developing sexual perversions . During this period of time some men start to feel drawn to young inexperienced girls . The 
##1268352 <p> Ghana , a country on the West Coast of Africa , is one of the most thriving democracies on the continent . It has often been referred to as an " island of peace " in one of the most chaotic regions on earth .

After Kwame Nkrumah , Ghana was ruled by a series of military despots with intermittent experiments with democratic rule , most of which were curtailed by military takeovers .

##1270952 <p> When you 're looking for a home today , there are going to be dozens of different styles to choose from . Whether you 're looking at Scarborough homes or properties in Mexico , there is the choice of single-family homes that were made popular a century ago and modern condos that are just coming into fashion . If you 're going to find the perfect property for you then it 's a good idea to look at all of these different home styles to decide which fits your lifestyle best . One of the homes that is becoming more popular lately , no matter if you 're looking at local or Red Hook real estate , is row houses or townhomes . This is a design that you should definitely consider if you 're a first time homeowner or want a property with a little less responsibility and maintenance than a standard single-family home . <p> A row house is one where it shares at least one side with another unit . In North America , this is commonly called a townhouse and you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because they are known as a way of making the most of the land that they are on without building high-rise condos . You can , however , find some row houses that are part of condo communities and benefit from the same amenities . When you 're looking at potential homes you should think about the style of real estate as well as whether it is a property that you buy outright or one where you are part of a larger community . <p> Row houses are usually more affordable than a standard standalone property . This is one of the main advantages for those that are looking for their first home or something where they can get a reasonable amount of space in a downtown location . Local to London architect s see this design of home as being one that uses the real estate that it is on efficiently while still giving the homeowner more privacy than you would get in a high-rise condo . These properties are usually spread over several levels to make the most of the space that they are on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are still sharing at least one wall with another unit . While you 're not in as close quarters as those that are staying in Puerto Vallarta condominium rentals , you are still getting less privacy then those that are able to live in a standalone home . Some people find that they do n't miss the additional space between the next property . You should think about whether you 're the type of person who is alright with your home being more vertical than horizontal . You might find that the bedroom and living spaces are spread over three to four floors . This is not for everyone but is a great compromise for those that want their own central property

Whilst aiming at helping the country to meet its increasing energy demands , ABES also seeks to make the best of technology transfer , by constantly upgrading the competence of its Ghanaian engineers to enable them produce several other renewable energy facilities locally . <p> The company is also working out the introduction of Green Loans by some Financial Institutions in the country to make it possible for low income earners to afford renewable energy solutions . <p> Speaking at the launch of the production facility and the first solar packages in Accra last week , Dr Adebayo Agbejule , Project Manager for Export and Import Innovations ( EXIMIN ) , Finland , observed that Ghana stands to benefit if its entrepreneurs took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit their own environment . <p> He mentioned that scientific and technological innovation has been the underpinnings of all advanced economies , and called on the country to go the same way . <p> Dr Agbejule who is also a Principal Lecturer in Production Management at the Vaasa University of Applied Sciences , Finland , observed that it was time Ghanaians began thinking of how we could address our problems ourselves , " adding that ABES had decided to take up the challenge of helping to improve Ghana 's energy situation the sustainable way . <p> Giving the genesis of ABES , Dr Agbejule explained that his outfit , EXIMIN is an EU related project consisting of four universities of applied sciences in Finland with the goal of promoting business opportunities and growth for Finnish SMEs in the African Market starting with Ghana . <p> The EXIMIN project also helps in the search for business partners and cooperation , introduction of new products to new and/ or existing markets , introduction of new types of innovation to improve busineses , exploration of the commercial feasibility of project idea in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Manager in charge of operations at HFC Bank , observed that heavy dependence on fossil fuels as a source of energy has resulted in the present climatic challenges with its accompanying devastating effects on the global environment . <p> This according to him has necessitated the development of innovative and affordable energy sources to contain the effects of green house gases on the global economy . He mentioned the high initial cost of renewable energy as an impediment to the adoption of renewable technologies . <p> Mr. Martinson called for Public-Private Partnerships as the best approach to addressing the country 's energy challenges , adding that banks and other financial institutions have a role to play by bringing on board financing options that will make it easy for individuals to afford renewable energy technologies . <p> On his part , Mr. Robert Yakohene , Research and Development Manager , UT Bank stressed that it is time financial institutions make available resources devoted to renewable energy financing in view of the critical role energy play in the development of a nation . <p> He pointed out that UT Bank already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to assist clients in purchasing their own power source . This , he said , also served as a means for financial institutions to show that they are socially responsible . <p> In an interview with the Financial Intelligence Newspaper , Nathaniel Gyibah , Managing Director of Atlas Business and Energy Systems ( ABES ) observed that with the demand for energy in Ghana increasing by about 5% per year in the past 10 years , there is need for capacity addition requirements of about 50MW to 100MW per annum . <p> According to him , the demand-supply imbalance could worsen if policy makers did not promote the use of alternative energy as the country gears up for a middle income status by 2015 . <p> By making it possible for low income earners to afford solar systems at costs below GH 2,000 , the managing director was optimistic that his company will change the energy landscape in the country and avert possible over-reliance on Ghana 's new-found crude for power generation . <p> " Ghana is blessed with 10 hours of free sunlight every day , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource , " he said . <p> Ghana 's major energy sources since the founding of the nation have been hydro and thermal power plants , the related problems of which have been frequent power outages and fluctuations leading to low level of reliability . The unreliable nature of the main sources of energy in the country has left many searching for secondary options . <p> There are also large areas that have no access to the national electricity grid , making government 's objective of reaching 85% of the population with electricity a difficult challenge . <p> A Ghanaian company has launched the country 's first locally produced solar panels . Authorities hope renewable energies can help ease the long-lasting power shortage in Ghana . Ghana 's first solar panels were launched on the market yesterday by Atlas Business and Energy System ( ABES ) , a private renewable energy company based in Ghana and Finland . ABES markets itself as a company providing solutions for installation of solar , wind and biomass energy . <p> According to ABES Managing Director Nathaniel Gyibah , its solar panels were built entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finland , including the inventors , and batteries . <p> In Ghana , the announcement was met with optimism given the country 's chronic energy deficit . Ghana depends on imports of fossil fuels from its neighbour countries , as an expensive addition to its mostly hydropower based electricity grid . Power blackouts are frequent and consumers look for reliable and affordable backup solutions . <p> ABES chief Gyibah hopes his company 's solar panels can become this backup . Not only were they cost-effective , but also environmentally sounder than fossil fuel alternatives . <p> " The energy industry in Ghana is a major concern to many people , " Mr Gyibah noted , adding that the introduction of the solar panel would curb the power shortage that often causes inconveniences to the people of Ghana . According to ABES ' Marketing Executive , Mr Charles Amoah , the company is to " provide both the low income and middle income home owners with new solar packages and information that would ensure energy savings for our clients . " The Ghanaian company further aims at providing " customised solar packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase its energy capacity has received a boost with the launch of a new energy firm , Atlas Business and Energy Systems . <p> Atlas Business and Energy Systems , a wholly-owned Ghanaian firm , with support from EXIMIN of Finland , would use renewable energy technology to provide custom-made solar solutions for home and business owners . <p> At the launch of the firm in Accra yesterday , Charles Martinson , General Manager in charge of operations at HFC Bank , said new sources of energy should be identified and developed to address the increasing use of electricity . <p> According to him , adequate and cheap sources of energy such as solar panels must be used to reduce poverty to accelerate the country 's quest to achieve international goals such as the Millennium Development Goals . <p> " Renewable energy creates employment by increasing energy security and these must be encouraged , " he said . <p> Speaking on the topic , " Green Banking , Role of Financial Institutions in the Development of Renewable Energy , " Mr. Martinson emphasized that financial institutions have a major role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country wants to harness its energy resources . <p> He noted that " sources of financing have been the main impediment to the development of renewable energy in Ghana and therefore called on all financial institutions to support the acquisition of renewable energy . " <p> Mr. Martinson called on Government and its agencies to create an enabling environment for the development of renewable energy systems . <p> Dr. Adebayor Agbejule , Project Manager of EXIMIN , Finland , on his part , chronicled how the whole project was conceived , saying that " his outfit 's major aim is to develop an alternative source of energy for the demanding Ghanaian market . " <p> " I come to Ghana every year to recruit Ghanaians to study in Finland but one day I realized that I could assist the nation by attracting Finnish energy firms to partner our local entrepreneurs to develop renewable energy systems . <p> " Though innovation is a long journey to accomplish , our quest to boost the energy system would definitely materialize , " he said . <p> Nathaniel Gyibah , Managing Director of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the nation should use the sun as an alternative source of energy than to allow it to go waste . <p> ABES provides crystalline solar PV that could last 30 years with maximum power production capacity . <p> It also provides a special maintenance-free battery that needs replacement after seven years . These sealed batteries do not produce flammable gases during the charge or discharge process . <p> Atlas Business and Energy System ( ABES ) , a private solar energy firm , yesterday launched its solar panel to help ease the power shortage in the country . Mr. Nathaniel Gyibah , the Managing Director , said that its solar panel was built in Ghana and that the only components imported from their collaborators from Finland were the inventors and batteries . <p> Mr. Gyibah said that the energy industry in Ghana is a major concern to many people , adding that the introduction of the solar panel will curb the power shortage that often causes inconveniences to the people of Ghana . <p> A special guest of honour , Mr. Charles Martinson , General Manager of the HFC Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals . <p> He noted that the dependency on fossil fuel sources have resulted in the present climatic conditions with devastating effects on the global environment . <p> " It has therefore become imperative to seek and develop new , innovative and affordable energy sources to contain the effect of green house gases on the global economy , " he added . <p> The answer , he said , lay in renewable energy technologies which can bring about both environmental and socio-economic benefits as they generally entail fewer emissions . <p> Mr. Martinson regretted that renewable energy projects are often promoted by comparatively smaller entrepreneurs who lack credit worthiness for large long-term financing . <p> He urged the public to support the idea of renewable energy technology . <p> In an interview with The Ghanaian Times , Mr. Emmanuel Ndzibah , a researcher from Finland , said that solar energy can be used as a back-up when the light goes out , as a hybrid solution when used together with the main electricity grid , or as a stand-alone system . <p> SOLAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Energy System ( ABES ) , a private solar energy firm , has launched its solar panel to help ease the power shortage in the country . <p> The Managing Director , Mr. Nathaniel Gyibah , said its solar panel was built in Ghana and that the only components imported from their collaborators from Finland are the inventors , charge controllers , and the batteries . <p> He believed the introduction of the solar panel will help curb the 
##1808352 <p> I lived the very beginning of Furia in Paris during January 1999 and the shock was amazing . The movie moved me very deeply so I thought that it would be too much pain for me to work for it . But I was really caught up with the movie and now Furia is a real part of my life . So I worked very closely with Alexandre , the creator of this movie , without the usual intermediary of the cinema world , to create the whole soundtrack for a movie for the first time in my career . Words , music , soundtrack of this movie are a strange mixture of French and English which we are extremely proud . Furia is eternal and it is a part of our universe . <p> Brian May <p> sleevenote 2 : <p> Furia . A commando film , small budget , each day seems to be the last ... Already two weeks filming in the South of Morocco and only four more to finish it completely ... The telephone rings , Gilbert Marouani , a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... A joke ? no , I think he 's seriou . Two months later , I meet Brian in a Paris hotel , we speak of music , of George Orwell , and of the cinema . I am very tense , he has come to see a first edit . One and a half hours later , silence , I think he was moved . The next day , he calls me , worked all night through , he had written the main theme of the film .... For a twenty years old to have the chance to work with someone of Brian 's stature surpassed all my dreams - a chance but also a challenge . Several months in the studio follow , correspondence , the symphonic orchestra , passionate discussions all to achieve this soundtrack . Your music , Brian , is the true voice of Furia , an indestructible link between the characters , a simple and limpid music in which a certain idea of love and liberty shines through ... A whisper of guitar which transports the images beyond the film . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears on the Furia soundtrack , while she does n't sing lyrics as such ( oohs , ahhs , and la-la-la 's ) . They did a personal recording of Emily singing the soundtrack finale , Dream of Thee , which Brian sings on the album itself . Brian is quite proud , as this is the first sound track he has ever written . He wrote it all except for 2 tracks . You Argentines will be gratified to hear that Brian was impressed with the two other tracks , which
