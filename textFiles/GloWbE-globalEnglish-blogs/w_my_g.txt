Posted on November 29 , 2012 , Thursday <p> KOTA KINABALU : Police have warned of stern action against any individuals , especially online media publishers who twisted facts on the discovery of the body of a teenage girl by the roadside near Kampung Ranau , about 2km from Kota Marudu town on Sunday . State Police Commissioner Datuk Hamza Taib said inaccurate facts published by social network sites and blogs would not only create undue fears among the people but could also threaten the national security . " Police are not denying that the case happened but what was being published in several social network sites and blogs on the Internet , including claiming that five Pakistanis had gang-raped the victim before killing and dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the case is still under police investigation , " he said . " Therefore , I strongly remind online publishers to stop releasing false information or action will be taken under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act , which carries a fine of up to RM50,000 or one year 's jail term , " he said during a press conference at the State Police Headquarters in Kepayan yesterday . Hamza was commenting on claims made over the murder of Norikoh Saliwa , a 16-year-old maid from Kampung Bombong 1 , Kota Marudu on November 25 . Revealing the facts of the case , he said the victim , her 32-year-old sister and a 15-year-old male cousin had gone to the Kota Marudu town to find a job for the cousin . They then went to a furniture shop in Goshen , some two km from Kota Marudu town , where the cousin was given a job . The trio then returned to Kota Marudu town together with the manager of the furniture shop for a drink . " While they were having a drink in Kota Marudu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the furniture shop in Goshen and asked the victim to follow the store manager back to the shop to collect it . " After the victim and the store manager had left , the victim 's sister was still able to call the victim to check if she was fine and the victim replied saying that she was alright and nothing was wrong . " Moments later , the sister and the cousin heard news of the victim 's body with head injuries being found on the roadside , placing the 40-year-old Pakistani store manager as the last person known to be with the victim before she died , " said Hamza , adding that police had detained the latter on November 27 to assist in their investigation . As the case is still being investigated , including waiting for the pathologist 's report , Hamza said he had no idea how the online articles could state that doctors had confirmed that the victim was raped by several men or other details on injuries found on the victim 's body . " Based on initial autopsy pictures that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head injury and couple of scratches on the body , but it is only with the full report ( from the Pathology Department ) that we can determine if there are any internal injuries , including whether the victim was raped or not , " he said . The case is currently being investigated under Section 304 of the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder . Also present were Crime Investigation Department chief SAC Omar Mammah and State Commercial Crime Investigation Department chief Superintendent Saiman Kasran . <p> I CALL UPON the authorities especially the Police to leave no stone unturned in their investigation in the death of 15-year old girl , Narikoh Saliwa from Kg . Bombong 1 , Kota Marudu who died mysteriously and was found by the road side on Sunday . <p> I have spoken to the older sister of the victim and what she told me indeed are critical information that should be followed up by the police officers who are investigating the case . <p> We want to know what is the real caused of the death of the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused of death and if the victim was raped before her death . <p> If indeed the police discovers in the course of their investigation that foreign nationals are found to be involved in the death of the girl then what I have said in parliament about foreign elements posing serious security threat in the country . <p> This incident is true and that what Minister in the Prime Minister Department Mohamed Nazri bin Tan Sri Abdul Aziz said in parliament recently in response to my queries about the foreigners as not posing any form of security threat are lies to hoodwink the people . <h> Tuesday , 27 November 2012 <h> Brutally murdered in Kota Marudu , Sabah . <h> KELUHAN DARI SESEORANG YANG MENGASIHINYA ... <h> This girl was brutally murdered yesterday in Kota Marudu Sabah . She is very precious to my cousin as even treated her like her own sister . I met her once 2 years ago , and indeed a lovely girl . She has been living with my cousin since and even is the nanny of my cousin 's 2 beautiful children . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rested in peace . Really tragic ... God blessed you NORIKOH . <h> Up-date : Police confirmed this case and are carrying out investigation . Witnesses are requested to assist police in their investigation into this case which had been flashed/posted/shared in Facebook and blogs . <h> Friday , 23 November 2012 <p> The National Registration Department 's ( NRD ) act of randomly listing Christians in Sabah with " bin " or " binti " in their names as Muslims in their identity cards has come under strong attack . <p> The NRD should not be doing this , the Malaysian Consultative Council on Buddhism , Christianity , Hinduism , Sikhism and Taoism ( MCCBCHST ) said in a statement today <p> " The NRD should note the historical position that in Sabah , ' bin ' and ' binti ' do not necessarily mean they are Muslims , " MCCBCHST explained . <p> MCCBCHST criticised the NRD action as an act of violating the constitutional rights and fundamental liberties of the individuals concerned . <p> " The NRD 's further decision that it will continue to list such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a syariah court to say that they are not Muslims is a violation of the affected persons constitutional rights and fundamental liberties as enshrined in Articles 11(1) and 12(4) of the federal constitution , " the interfaith organisation said . <p> Case taken to the wrong court <p> The council cited the case filed by Sabahan Intim binti Lambaran and her two daughters as an example , stressing that the fact that they were baptised as Christians and never at any time were Muslims should be sufficient for the NRD to list them as Christians in their MyKad . <p> " In the present case , Intim binti Lambatan should have filed a writ in the High Court to compel NRD to list them as Christians in their MyKad and not in the syariah court , as the syariah court has no jurisdiction over non-Muslims , " the MCCBCHST statement said . <p> The case is still pending before the Syariah High Court in Kudat , after the NRD refused to change the status of her religion , even though the Sabah Islamic Affairs Department has written to the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Islamisation register . <p> Another recent case highlighted by MCCBCHST is that of Siti Hasnah Vangarama Abdullah ( right ) , who wants her religion to be changed to Hindu because her parents converted her to Islam in 1983 , when she was an infant . <p> Despite the Muslim Welfare Organisation of Malaysia ( Perkim ) and Penang Islamic Religious Council stating that Vangarama was properly converted and that her case must be tried by the syariah court , the High Court has ruled that the matter must be decided by the civil court . <p> The Court of Appeal also ruled that there are important constitutional issues to be decided in Vangarama 's case and it should therefore come under the jurisdiction of the civil court . <p> Based on this ruling by the appellate court , MCCBHST said , the NRD has acted unconstitutionally and in an arbitrary manner in the Sabah instances . <p> It called on Sabahans to demand accountability from their government and elected leaders as they are the ones who have allowed this matter to take place by remaining passive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRD to rectify and reflect the true religion of the aggrieved parties upon notification , without reference to any third party , " the statement added . <h> Thursday , 22 November 2012 <h> Upko flaunts Dompok 's aide for Sepanggar <p> Umno , PBS , LDP and PBRS have staked a claim on the Sepanggar parliamentary seat but Upko says it is theirs . <p> KOTA KINABALU : The United Pasok Momogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation ( Upko ) is cranking up the pressure on the state Barisan Nasional leadership to contest the Sepanggar MP seat for the coalition in the coming general election . <p> In a less than subtle theatrics , Sepanggar Upko chief Steven Kutai offered the constituency to party president Bernard Dompok in place of their rising star Albert Bingkasan who is said to be eyeing the seat . <p> Dompok , who is Federal Plantation Industry and Commodities Minister , as expected , declined , saying that it was best to field a candidate from the Sepanggar Upko division and he would be defending his Penampang seat . <p> The byplay gave the party general convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion to be presented to the state BN leadership for its leader to contest the Sepanggar seat . <p> Kutai , who spoke at the one-day convention , told the over 1,000 delegates that Sepanggar had been a BN stronghold with Upko having the largest number of members in the constituency , which encompasses the state seats of Inanam and Karambunai , compared to other BN components . <p> The two state seats make up the Sepanggar parliamentary seat . Inanam has 12 polling districts and Karambunai 11 . The total number of voters , according to the latest electoral rolls , is 47,836 . <p> Half of the polling districts are considered KDM ( KadazanDusun Murut ) areas . <p> The seat was won by BN through Sabah Progressive Party ( SAPP ) in the 2004 and 2008 general elections but the Kadazandusun majority constituency is now in opposition hands after SAPP pulled out from BN on Sept 17 , 2008 . <p> Though Kutai , as party chief in Sepanggar , should be the candidate by convention , he has said he would not be standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee for the post . <p> Everyone wants Sepanggar <p> Bingkasan , 48 , who initially studied for the priesthood and worked for a few years in the media industry , is one of Dompok 's senior aides in Parliament and in the ministry . He is married to Nelly Henry James and they have four children . <p> Addressing the delegates at its closing , the would-be freshman MP said the resolution adopted for Upko to contest Sepanggar was in line with the resolution by Upko 13th triennial delegates conference last year . <p> Dompok brushed aside murmurs that the party was not following BN protocol by overtly grasping for seats . <p> " It is not wrong to request because we are in a democracy . Requests are the norm when it is election time and there are times when even seats which are held by a component party will also be requested by another party . <p> " For instance , Upko seats that we have in our pocket are being requested for . But it is up to the BN central leadership to decide which party should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other constituencies , " he said . <p> The other BN component parties to have laid claim to the constituency are Umno , PBS , LDP and PBRS . <p> A Sabah-based activist has accused Upko of pussyfooting around the illegal immigrant issue . <p> KOTA KINABALU : The author of a book ' Lest We Forget ' that chronicled the ' acquisition ' of Sabah by Umno-linked authorities , who re-engineered the demographics of the state , is surprised that local leaders are now downplaying the facts . <p> Expressing his concern , Dr Chong Eng Leong said he was worried that even a hardline local Barisan Nasional coalition component was backing away from the controversial issue after years of championing it . <p> Chong is particularly incensed that state assembly representative Donald Mojuntin , the son of the late Peter Mojuntin who is lionised as a defender of Sabah 's rights , was now choosing to limit the fallout from a widely acknowledged illegal act . <p> He accused Mojuntin , from the United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation ( Upko ) party , who was formerly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and national politics . <p> Mojuntin has also riled independents with his conciliatory stand on other sensitive Sabah-centric issues notably the date of the formation of Malaysia . <p> Chong said Mojuntin 's recent statement " let 's not waste time and effort to over-politicise it " when speaking about the problem of illegal immigrants in Sabah , was self-serving . <p> " I am sure Donald ( Mojuntin ) and Upko know that hundreds of thousands of foreign migrants are in the Sabah electoral rolls -- they decide which political party to govern us . Is n't this problem a political issue , Donald ? " asked Chong who is now with PKR and known for his stance on immigration reform . <p> He said the coalition partners appeared confused over their stand on the issue with Upko president Bernard Dompok once saying that internal upheavals and the strained relationship between state and federal governments had hampered efforts to resolve the problem . <p> Chong 's book gives a detailed insight of the audacious re-creation of Sabah 's ethnic and religious makeup of the state to tilt the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Umno in particular . <p> He pointed out that though the Umno-led coalition had been governing Sabah since 1994 , repeated calls by Sabah BN members for a royal inquiry since 1996 had not been entertained until this year and even then reluctantly and with limitations . <p> " Is n't this political ? Donald ( Mojuntin ) also said the RCI has no power nor manpower to take action on its findings and recommendations as this belongs to relevant bodies like police , immigration and the NRD , " noted Chong . <p> Immigration , police , NRD involved <p> Chong said that by stating this , Mojuntin was conveniently ignoring the fact that during in the Likas election petition hearing in 1999 , witnesses testified under oath that the meetings , chaired by the late Megat Junid , the deputy home minister at the time , discussed how ICs could be given to foreigners in Sabah and these meetings " involved immigration , NRD and top guns from Bukit Aman " . <p> " Can you expect the thieves to arrest themselves ? <p> " My research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us Sabahans ( be ) aware of this treacherous deed done by the federal government -- Dompok knew the modus operandi as he had heard the testimonies from public and briefings by NRD when he was the chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Integrity in 2006 . " <p> He said that Dompok is now urging the public to come forward and help the RCI to set things right but asked since he himself knew the modus operandi , would Dompok come forward to testify . <p> " I do n't know if I am one of the 48 witnesses identified by the RCI but if not I shall come forward come Jan 14 , 2013 , " said Chong . <p> He added that since former premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had admitted he did grant citizenship to foreign migrants after decades of silence when challenged , " he must be called if his name is not on the list of 48 ? . <p> " The RCI has the power to call anyone to its chamber and even interrogate , if need be , " he emphasised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry would lead anywhere as it was the BN government that started this issuance of ICs and citizenship to foreigners for decades through falsified documents and was still doing it now in spite of the RCI in progress . <p> " Who is going to believe that BN wants to solve this treasonous action ? <p> " Dompok , Donald , and all of you in Upko , if you still vote for BN -- the next BN federal government will for sure continue issue MyKad and citizenship to the millions of foreigners already in Sabah now and mind you when the next electoral boundaries are redrawn you shall kiss good-bye to your so-called struggle for your people . <p> " And forever we Sabahans will become refugees in our own land , " he warned <h> Shafie 's wooing Yong back into BN <p> Umno vice-president Shafie Apdal is allegedly masterminding the return of former Sabah chief minister Yong Teck Lee into the Barisan Nasional and claiming he has the tacit approval of party president Najib Tun Razak to negotiate the return . <p> This is despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party ( SAPP ) president . <p> Yong , Shafie and Joseph Ambrose Lee were partners in crime at one time . They allegedly took over the RM30-billion timber wealth of Yayasan Sabah through a share-swap . The " swap " had allegedly taken place when Yong was chief minister and Shafie a directer in Yayasan Sabah . <p> Like it or not , it was Musa Aman who was then Sabah Finance Minister who rejected this share-swap deal , saving Yayasan Sabah from a pending doom . <p> Shafie 's intention of bringing Yong back into BN will weaken Musa 's leadership among BN followers . <p> It will serve Shafie well . Shafie 's jealousy of Musa is well known here . He has made innumerable attempts to pull Musa down . <p> He was responsible for instigating Beaufort MP Lajim Ukin to call Musa 's removal as chief minister . Shafie awarded Lajim with a RM150 million road project from his Rural and Regional Development Ministry . <p> Shafie also helped form KDM Malaysia to divide the Kadazan Dusun Murut ( KDM ) community . The aim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party PBS ( Parti Bersatu Sabah ) , hence driving a wedge between Pairin and Musa . <p> Why is Shafie so jealous of Musa ? Shafie dreams of being the top dog in Sabah but I think it 's a pipe dream . <p> Musa 's good for Sabah <p> Irrespective of what people say , Musa has done good by Sabah . Let 's look at history . <p> When Sabah attained independence in 1963 , Malaysia was born . <p> Right from independence in 1963 to 1985 , the Alliance-Barisan National ruled Sabah . After 1985 , Harris Salleh was defeated , and Pairin became the chief minister . <p> But even at that time Sabah was ruled by BN until 1986 when PBS pulled out of BN . In 1994 , BN wrested control of power from PBS when Lajim defected from PBS . <p> His action opened a floodgate of defections from PBS and saw the collapse of Pairin 's PBS government . Sakaran Dandai became the first Umno chief minister of Sabah in 1994 . <p> In 2003 , Musa was appointed chief minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . <p> First , the state treasury was nearly negative ; Yayasan Sabah was on the verge of going bust ; state agencies were in the red ; and the financial situation of the state was in shambles . <p> Musa prudently turn around the mess he inherited . <p> In 2004 , Musa faced state election and captured more seats than in 1999 and became the chief minister again . He won again in 2008 with a thumping victory , winning 59 out of the 60 state seats . <p> Musa vs Shafie <p> Under Musa 's rule , Sabah has registered remarkable progress in the last 10 years . <p> Sabah has even earned praise from Auditor-General Ambrin Buang for demonstrating sound financial management and for maintaining its record of efficient and prudent handling of its finances over the last 12 years . <p> One hundred and six departments and agencies were audited last year and each showed that its financial management was at a very good level . <p> Even Moody International has certified the Sabah government for efficient and proper budget management for three years running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances . <p> Sure , Sabah has had problems , but it is progressing . <p> Shafie , on the other hand , has had billions at his disposal under his ministerial portfolio . He has been Semporna MP since 1995 yet his achievements paled in comparison to Musa . <p> He has done nothing much to improve the livelihood of the Semporna folks despite having a huge budget at his disposal . <p> It explains Shafie 's envy . <p> Meanwhile , word on the ground is that Musa is set to remain chief minister for the next five years . Word is that he will move on to become the federal Finance Minister in 2017 . <h> Saturday , 10 November 2012 <p> Kg Kionsom folks firmly against revival of quarry <p> Published on : Daily Express Saturday , November 10 , 2012 <p> INANAM : Residents of Kg Kionsom here are firmly against a company now seeking approval from the Government to re-develop a quarry in Kiaukad Ulu Kionsom that was ordered to cease operations eight years ago . <p> The villagers feared that damages , pollution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new company , Goltra Sdn Bhd ( GSB ) , were given a licence to operate the quarry . <p> The quarry operations eight years ago caused not only landslides but also destroyed rubber and fruits trees in the village . <p> The mud flood that swept a bridge near the Ulu Kionsom Rural Clinic also caused severe pollution to Sungai Inanam . <p> The residents registered their protest in a dialogue between representatives of the company at Mini-Dewan Kionsom that saw senior officials from the State Environmental Protection Department , Federal Mineral and Geoscience Department , Drainage and Irrigation Department , Land and Survey Department , City Hall and police attending . <p> The meeting was held following a directive by Inanam Assemblyman Datuk Johnny Goh after the company requested to meet with the villagers with an aim to seek their full support so as to enable them to revive the stone quarry . <p> Villager Jack Ginuhang , when objecting to the re-opening of the quarry , feared a similar disaster would recur if the company were given the approval . <p> He said this is because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government pre-school and the popular Kionsom Waterfall . <p> " The waterfall is very popular because it is located within the city . <p> It is a tourism attraction to both domestic and foreign tourists alike , " he said . <p> Another villager , David Modutin , expressed his fear that if the quarry were revived , it would cause pollution not only to the air and water but also deter tourists to patronise his Mari Mari Kampung Warisan business . <p> Mari Mari is a popular foreign tourist attraction in Inanam . <p> " There is also the Nuluhan Villa Retreat and Resort nearby and because of that , blasting at the quarry will be a security problem , " he said . <p> Another resident , Vitalis Gulabok , wanted the authorities concerned to conduct tests to ascertain whether quarrying activities would affect the quality of water in the area . <p> He said people in Kg Kiaukad depend on water from the area for their daily consumption , adding that the area is also a water catchment site . <p> Village Development and Security Committee ( JKKK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrying company had to cease operation after he and the villagers protested against it . <p> " We never experienced mud floods before until after the quarry was in operation . <p> " Now we want the authorities not to approve the company 's application to operate the quarry , " he said . <p> Village chief , Hendry Yaang , said his feeling is similar to that of the people . <p> " If they objected to the of the quarry , I will also object , " he said . <p> On the other hand , Vitalis Maduyang of the Environmental Protection Department ( EPD ) said there is no application for an Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) to redevelop the quarry . <p> Nevertheless , he said , the views and inputs from the villagers would be taken into consideration when his department scrutinises any application for an EIA from the company . <p> He pointed out that the dialogue was one of the ways for the department to get views from the people . <p> When asked about the EIA by the previous quarrying company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment approved it . <p> City Hall officer , Lalitah Jeneh , said it is not aware of the location of the land on which the company wanted to operate the quarry . <p> She said City Hall would only know after receiving a copy of the EIA report . <p> Meanwhile , GSB Manager , Simon Wong , told the meeting that his company was seeking co-operation from the villagers so as to enable the company obtain the licence to operate the quarry . <p> He assured that if the licence is approved , all requirements of the EIA would be adhered to . <p> He also promised that locals from the village and nearby localities would be given priority when the company hires workers . <p> Pan , nevertheless , said he would lead the villagers to object to the re-opening of the quarry . <p> He hoped to get assistance from environmental NGOs such as the Sabah Environmental Protection Association ( Sepa ) . <h> Wednesday , 7 November 2012 <h> ' Govt failed to protect Orang Asli rights ' <p> The public must rise up and pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asli , says the Bar Council . <p> KUALA LUMPUR : The state and federal governments have failed to protect the interests of the Orang Asli in Malaysia , the Bar Council said today . Bar Council treasurer Steven Thiru said the government had violated the Orang Asli community 's land rights in particular . " You see exploitation and deprivation of land in both East and West Malaysia . " Either the authorities -- the state government -- or private bodies have been grabbing , unlawfully acquiring ancestral land , " said Thiru , who is also co-chairman of the Bar Council committee on Orang Asli rights . Last month , some 500 Orang Asli had staged a picket outside the office of the Pahang Menteri Besar after having lost their native land to the East Coast Economic Region ( ECER ) project . However , two of the protesters were arrested the following day over charges of disturbing ECER 's contract workers . In September , 30 Orang Asli had also picketed outside the Orang Asli Development Department ( JAKOA ) headquarters to protest against the authority for continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from picketing , some of the Orang Asli go to court to solve their issues , but they get little compensation and at times even the court 's rulings are ignored , " Thiru told reporters today . He was referring to the 15-year legal battle among the ageing families of the Temuan tribe , which saw two members pass away before the court ruled in their favour in May this year . The families obtained RM 6.5 million in compensation for their native customary land , which was seized to build a highway to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) . But Thirun said such successes are few and far in between , and more could be done to help the dwindling Orang Asli community . " I am absolutely disappointed with the government 's performance so far , " he said . " So much more can be done , and ultimately it is up to the government to protect the Orang Ali 's way of life , and to make sure that their lands and rights are respected , " he added . Tension is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rashid Ismail said that tension was increasing among the Orang Asli community due to the amount of land being taken away from them . " Land is becoming more scarce , and we see urban areas edging ever nearer to Orang Asli settlements . For example , Damansara Perdana used to have an Orang Asli settlement there , but now it 's like a concrete jungle . " Most of the Orang Asli who originally lived there were either relocated , or were forced to abandon the lifestyle they have known for centuries and purchase houses , " he said . Rashid said that aside from land rights , the indigenous community was also deprived of the basic right to education . " According to a Suhakam report in 2010 , there were 17,9842 Orang Asli children who were not attending school . This is a significant number considering the population of the indigenous community , " he said . " The education minister can easily help to achieve 100% school enrolment among the children of the Orang Asli . But that is not happening . " Education is essential in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . Almost all live below the poverty line , " he added . Public must pressure government Meanwhile , Thiru urged the public to play an active role in pressuring the government to fulfil its responsibility towards the Orang Asli . " Do n't let the Orang Asli become a footnote in our history -- just a tiny mention at the bottom of our history books that they went the way of the dinosaurs , " he said . He said the public could learn more on the issue by attending a seminar jointly organised by the Bar Council and Hakam titled " The Struggles of the Orang Asli and Other Minorities in Malaysia " . The two-day seminar , which begins at 8.30am on Dec 7 , will be held at the Grand Seasons Hotel here . Tickets are priced at RM50 for the public , RM30 for members of the Bar Council and RM15 for students . He said Orang Asli representatives would be present to share their personal experiences , as well as officers from Suhakam . <h> Tuesday , 6 November 2012 <p> The fast-changing political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barisan Nasional coalition government of Musa Aman . <p> With the dust yet to settle from the exit of MPs Wilfred Bumburing ( Tuaran ) and Lajim Ukin ( Beaufort ) from the ruling coalition , Sabah Umno is making overtures to bring back into its fold former rebels who have switched sides . <p> Among them is former Kuala Penyu independent state assembly representative John Ghani . <p> It was bad news for Sabah 's now dominant political party when the popular Kadazandusun politician was forced to quit Umno after he contested as an independent against a BN candidate in the 2004 election and won convincingly . <p> Ghani showed that voters in Kuala Penyu , which together with Klias is part of the Beaufort parliamentary constituency , were not automatic Umno or BN supporters as had been assumed . <p> The defeated BN candidate , senior Upko leader Wences Angang , was no lightweight candidate himself . He was a deputy chief minister , and his defeat shamed Musa , Umno and the coalition who then had Lajim , one of the most influential politicians in the district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ghani , a former senator , had shown himself to be a counter-balance to Lajim 's well-known influence in the district . <p> Since Lajim 's squabble with Musa and his divide-and-rule state policies , the expulsion of the former Kuala Penyu assemblyman has come back to haunt the party . <p> Both Ghani and Lajim have thrown their lot in with Anwar Ibrahim 's Pakatan Rakyat coalition with the former in PKR and the Beaufort MP now leading Pakatan Perubahan Sabah ( PPS ) , an opposition friendly political platform . <p> That 's bad news for Chief Minister Musa who has been busy trying to outflank potential challengers from within his party . Ghani 's ' powerful ' in Kuala Penyu Early indications are that the internal manoeuvring within Umno , while strengthening Musa 's hold on power , has further weakened the party 's tenuous hold on various constituencies in Sabah and Kuala Penyu is among them . <p> Incumbent assemblyman John Teo of the United Pasok Momogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation ( Upko ) is already facing a revolt from within his own party with Anggang keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was narrowly defeated in the 2008 election after again standing as an independent is now with PKR and can count on the active support of Lajim and the tacit support of Angang if the latter is not selected to defend the seat by the BN hierarchy . <p> As things stand , BN 's chances of retaining the seat are slim and Musa knows this . Umno insiders say the party leader is now making quiet overtures to lure Ghani back into Umno . <p> The ruling coalition is mindful of the shock result in 2004 when Ghani polled 5,157 votes to Angang 's 3,139 votes . Guandee Kohoi of Setia and independent Saman Ahmad lost their election deposit when they only managed to get 308 and 633 votes , respectively . <p> Ghani , a Kadazandusun Christian , lost the seat in the 2008 election when he polled 4,159 votes , just 257 votes less than the 4,419 votes garnered by Upko 's Teo while Guandee who contested on a PKR ticket polled 589 votes in the three-corner contest . <p> Guandee has since left PKR and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an opposition party headed by maverick Sabah politician Jeffrey Kitingan . <p> With Angang doing little to hide his friendly ties with Lajim as the BN leadership sorts out its candidates , Lajim has been busy touring his constituency and other areas to drum up support for Pakatan with Ghani . <p> Others within Upko lobbying for the seat are Linda Antoni , Munih Epin and Lokman Sunggim but a voter in Kuala Penyu said whoever the BN picked would face a difficult fight against Ghani if he was the opposition candidate . <h> Monday , 5 November 2012 <p> According to its president , Tan Sri Bernard Dompok , the issue had been discussed and deliberated by UPKO 's Supreme Council during its meeting but it was decided that the party would stay in BN . <p> Dompok said this when asked to comment on the claims by former UPKO leaders Datuk Seri Panglima Wilfred Bumburing and Datuk Maijol Mahap that the party was on the verge of quitting BN . <p> Speaking to reporters after officiating UPKO Penampang and Kota Kinabalu divisions joint delegates convention here yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is very easy ? There have been people who wanted to talk about these things so we put it to the supreme council and it was deliberated . <p> " The majority voice was for us to go along with BN because of what BN has been doing as far as the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the presence of illegal immigrants in Sabah and all those things . <p> " So I can confirm that it was discussed but the party decided not to go along these lines , " he said . <p> When asked if that meant the former UPKO leaders were not being accurate in their statements to the media , the Penampang member of parliament replied : " That can not be true because there was a party meeting ( and ) we put it up . There was nothing for us to hide ( and ) I think everybody knows we had a meeting . " <p> Last week , former UPKO deputy president Datuk Seri Panglima Wilfred Bumburing and former party vice president Datuk Maijol Mahap claimed that the party had been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the exit did not happen because Prime Minister cum BN chairman Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak promised to make the announcement on the setting up of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the illegal immigrant issue and extraordinary increase in Sabah population . <p> " For the record , initially UPKO leaders have decided and were prepared to bring UPKO out of BN and join PR . In fact immediately before the function on 29th July 2012 , there were suggestions coming from several UPKO leaders requesting Bumburing and his group to postpone their intended date to quit BN-UPKO . <p> " They eventually agreed to let Bumburing go first while UPKO leaders sort out some technicalities . However , all these notions suddenly changed when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib promised to announce the formation of RCI which would be made on August 11 , 2012 , " Maijol said . <p> His statement was refuted by UPKO treasurer general Datuk Dr Marcus Mojigoh who was of the opinion that Maijol was inventing all kinds of stories to justify their action of leaving BN . <p> " As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party matters and I never heard nor any intention of the party to leave BN . As far as I can remember Maijol himself has never said he will leave BN . <p> " During one of our supreme council meetings , one of our members did suggest that the party should leave BN not because of RCI but on overall matters . That proposal was debated and was defeated and thrown out , " Marcus claimed . <h> ' Upko debated ditching BN ' <p> KOTA KINABALU : Senior leaders of United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation ( Upko ) met early this year to discuss pulling out from Barisan Nasional , a former top party leader said today . <p> Wilfred Mojilip Bumburing , the party 's former deputy president who resigned recently , disclosed that party leaders discussed the possibility of consenting to the silent ' wishes of the party 's grassroots members for Upko to leave the ruling coalition government . <p> Bumburing , who resigned from Upko and as BN head for Tuaran on July 29 and now heads the opposition-friendly Angkatan Perubahan Sabah ( APS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least eight times to discuss the matter . <p> The Tuaran MP revealed the secret meetings to clear up allegations by certain BN leaders especially those from Upko that he quit the party because he was not going to be fielded to defend his seat in the coming general elections was not true . <p> " There is no truth in these allegations . In fact prior to July 29 , I and a few other Upko leaders officially declared our decision to leave BN , " he said . <p> He said Dompok , a Minister in Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak 's federal cabinet , was well aware of the widespread dissatisfaction in the party over its position as a prop for the Umno-led coalition government . <p> " On at least on three of the ( eight ) occasions , Bernard ( Dompok ) insisted I stay put in Upko and personally asked me to stand and defend the Tuaran parliamentary seat for BN , " Bumburing said in a statement posted in APS 's facebook page . <p> " However , by then I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed out , adding that another allegation making the rounds that he quit because he lost the divisional chairman post in the election of Upko Tuaran divisional committee members was also BN slander . <p> He disclosed that prior to the divisional meeting in 2011 , he was told by the nomination committee that he had won the chairman 's post uncontested but he rejected the nomination and asked the committee to conduct another nomination exercise . <p> He said he also refused to be nominated as BN candidate for Tuaran constituency . <p> " The whole issue of me and my colleagues in quitting BN is the failure by the BN federal government to resolve the issues of illegal immigrants and the extraordinary population increase in Sabah over the last two decades , " he said . <p> No respect for Sabah <p> But Bumburing , a former deputy chief minister , said the disagreement with the BN federal and state government went beyond that of just the issue of illegal immigrants . <p> Apart from faulting the BN government for ignoring native customary rights over land with thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been placed under the Forest Management Units ( FMU ) which were threatening their very livelihood , he said the BN government had clearly shown itself to be biased . <p> The failure of the state government to fairly distribute welfare aid to all deserving such assistance clearly demonstrated this , he said . <p> Adding to the grievances felt by Sabahans , he said , was the fact that BN leaders at federal level had little respect for the guarantees made in the Malaysia Agreement of 1963 when Sabah joined in the formation of Malaysia . <p> Guarantees that should have protected the rights of the natives of Sabah had almost vanished , he said , adding that while natives in the interior of Sabah were hard pressed to get birth certificates and obtain identity cards for their children , illegal immigrants were easily obtaining citizenship documents . <h> Thursday , 1 November 2012 <h> Sabah RCI identifies 48 witnesses <p> Irrespective of whether or not the elections are called , the RCI on Sabah 's population burst will begin in January 2013 . <p> KOTA KINABALU : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old illegal immigrant controversy will start public hearings next year . <p> With the 13th general election due anytime now and some expecting parliament to be dissolved this month , the five-man panel headed by former chief judge of Borneo Steve Shim Lip Kiong announced Jan 14 as D-Day for Sabahans to hear evidence of what many claim is a massive immigration system fraud . <p> Shim said the panel had so far identified 48 witnesses to be called for the public hearing which will be held at the Kota Kinabalu High Court . <p> " We met today to finalise the list of witnesses and ( look at ) their relevance in our inquiry , " he told reporters after the panel met for their first meeting since their appointment on Sept 21 . <p> Shim disclosed that since their appointment , they had set up an investigative team to identify witnesses for the inquiry into the illegal immigrant problem . <p> He said the investigative team had done a good job identifying witnesses who will give evidence at the public hearing . <p> He declined to reveal the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information " to " come forward to testify . " <p> Shim also rejected criticism that the RCI panel was dragging its feet on the issue . <p> " No delay ... in fact our team of investigators have covered a substantial part in identifying witnesses . " <p> Six months target On the limited time given to complete the inquiry , he said they were not worried as there were provisions for them to request an extension . <p> " Barring any complications , we hope to complete it within six months . Hopefully , we will be able to solve the problem ( of illegal immigrants in the state ) , " he said <p> The RCI 's terms of reference empower the panel to determine the number of immigrants in Sabah that have been given Malaysian citizenship and if so whether the issuance of citizenship documents was legal . <p> The terms of reference stipulate that the panel can investigate the legality of the issuance of citizenship to immigrants in Sabah , verify if they are indeed holding blue identity cards or temporary identification receipts or citizenship documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The panel can also investigate the reasons for the abnormal increase in Sabah 's population . <p> The other members of the panel are former Universiti Malaysia Sabah vice chancellor Kamaruzaman Ampon , former Sabah deputy chief minister and state attorney general Herman Luping , for state secretary KY Mustafa and Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation president Henry Chin . <p> The secretary of the panel is Saripuddin Kasim , who is also Domestic Trade , Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry secretary general . <p> My Say : <p> Finally , the RCI will begin to sit and all is now waiting for the result of their inquiry in June or July . <h> Wednesday , 31 October 2012 <h> BN members still fighting over SAPP seats <p> The Sepanggar parliamentary seat which BN component parties are tussling over will be an easy win as there are 3,000 registered postal voters . <p> KOTA KINABALU : Barisan Nasional coalition members are scrambling to claim constituencies won by their former colleague Sabah Progressive Party ( SAPP ) in the last general election . <p> Leaders of Parti Bersatu Sabah ( PBS ) , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bersatu Rakyat Sabah ( PBRS ) , Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and BN 's backbone Umno have all thrown their hats in the ring for their members to contest the MP seats of Sepanggar , Tawau and the state seats of Likas and Luyang . <p> SAPP , now in the opposition holds the two parliamentary seats through party deputy president Eric Majimbun ( Sepanggar ) and vice president Chua Soon Bui ( Tawau ) while Liew Teck Chan and Melanie Chia are the state assembly representatives for Likas and Luyang . <p> All four had won the seats on BN ticket but the party led by former chief minister Yong Teck Lee quit the coalition on Sept 7 , 2008 . <p> PBS president Deputy Chief Minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan has announced that his party has applied to BN chairman , Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak , to register the mixed constituency of Sepanggar seat under PBS . <p> Pairin is basing the party 's claim ahead of other BN coalition aspirants on the shaky premise that PBS enjoys huge support in the constituency . <p> SAPP proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . The constituency was then known as Gaya . Yong defeated PBS candidate Johnny Goh Chin Lok , now the Inanam assemblyman , 15,315 votes to 11,198 votes . Third candidate Hamzah Abdullah of PAS only managed 729 votes . <p> However , PBS is this time also in a skirmish with Upko head Bernard Dompok , Pairin 's archival for the Kadazandusun political crown . <p> Dompok who is the Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister announced the party 's claim to the Sepanggar also on the basis of enjoying huge support in the constituency . <p> The last time Upko 's strength was tested was in the March , 1999 election where its candidate Christine Van Houten , a former civil servant , was defeated in the state constituency of Inanam . The constituency together with Karambunai is within the Sepanggar parliamentary constituency . <p> BN minnows , PBRS , headed by Joseph Kurup and LDP whose president Liew Vui Kiong is Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister 's Department have also established bases in Sepanggar but unlike PBS , Upko and Umno , they are not active in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main party in the the Sabah BN coalition , can be said to have the upper hand in any tussle among coalition members to contest Sepanggar . <p> Its divisional head Jumat Idris , is seen as a close aide of Chief Minister Musa Aman , the Sabah BN chief . Idris is also the BN chairman for the constituency . <p> Incumbent Majimbun is rumoured to be all set to move into state politics by contesting in his home constituency of Inanam . <p> Majimbun , who is SAPP deputy president , however also disclosed that his party would nevertheless field a candidate to defend Sepanggar . <p> The Sepanggar MP seat is said to be one of the easier seats for the BN to wrest from the opposition irrespective of who in the BN coalition gets the nod to be the candidate . <p> Political pundits say the electoral balance is tipped against the opposition here given that there are about 3,000 postal votes registered in Sepanggar . <p> According to them , based on past election results , postal voters by and large have always proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so in Sepanggar where there is a naval base as it has also been seen in the past that constituencies with a large military presence have always elected a BN candidate . <p> In the last general election , BN contested in all the 25 MP and 60 state seats . It was a landslide victory for the coalition who only lost the Kota Kinabalu parliamentary and Sri Tanjong state seat to DAP . <p> However a series of subsequent defections right up to a month ago has allowed the opposition to make further in-roads in the BN 's ' fixed-deposit ' state . <p> Meanwhile , apart from the seats now held by SAPP , seat allocation for the Sabah BN members has almost been settled , according to Dompok . <p> Opening Upko Beaufort division delegate conference over the weekend , he said there was no more problem in seats allocation as all the component parties had been informed of the seats they will be contesting in the elections . <h> Blogger <h> To All My Honoured Visitors <h> Aramai Tii ...

##1053452 <h> Friday , November 09 , 2012 <p> You 're probably wondering about now - what the heck is FURE ? Well , let Walski tell you right off the bat : it 's another one of those acronyms he made up . <p> And it stands for F*cked Up Right Eye . What Walski was seeing out of the FURE is something like this . <p> Okay , it 's not exactly a perfectly accurate rendition , admittedly , but Walski was kind of in a hurry when he created the image above . It does , however , give you an idea of what the right eye saw out of it . <p> Past tense , because he has since undergone surgery to try to fix it a couple of days ago . Technically , Walski should n't even be blogging about this so soon after , being that he 's been advised to lay off being on the PC for long periods of time . <p> But writing has always been a kind of catharsis , and quite frankly , it feels good to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is not going to be one of his famously long-winded posts . <p> He simply needed to talk about what he 's been going through these past few days , then off he goes to get the eye rested . Again . ( the eye , the procedure , and more , in the full post ) <p> Yes , it 's been light duty for him since his surgery on Tuesday , staying home most of the time , spending much of it taking catnaps on the couch . And it will continue to be more of that for the next couple of days or so . <p> It 's also utterly boring , by the way . <p> In any case , about a week ago , Walski felt that his right eye felt very blurry , with the sudden appearance of ' cobwebs ' amidst a very cloudy span of vision . Kind of like what you see in the picture above , only worse . <p> Apparently what happened was that a blood vessel in his eye , somewhere along the retina area , burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye ) to get mixed with blood , clouding the eye and creating what appears as " cobwebs " swirling within the field of vision . In the process , part of his retina was also dislodged . <p> The surgical procedure that Walski underwent is called a vitrectomy , which involves removing parts of the vitreous humor contaminated by the hemorrhage . <p> Sounds painful , but the surgery was pretty much painless . The worst part was probably when the 23 gauge needle was inserted , and that too felt nothing worse than a dust speck getting onto the eye . <p> A day after the procedure , Walski then went for his check-up , and had the bandages off . So no pirate eye patch for him , as he initially thought he might have to use for a while . <p> Arrrrr .... <p> In any case , it 's about three days after the procedure , and Walski does feel that the vision is coming back to normal . <p> But the doctor did say that some laser therapy may still be needed to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some other scans and stuff to ensure that the problem does n't recur . <p> Speaking of which , enough time in front of the PC , and it 's time to get back to rest . <p> The last thing Walski wants is to aggregate the FURE , or to get it FU again ... <h> Friday , November 02 , 2012 <p> For those who have been coming here with some regularity - and not likely the target audience for the pop-up anyway - you 're probably have gotten quite tired of it . <p> Like most good things in life , the pop-up has served its purpose , and it 's now time to put it to rest . The indefinite has been made finite ... ( state of online freedom , and more , in the full post ) <p> But has it done any good ? <p> In truth , Walski does n't really know . Perhaps it has . If nothing else , the outrage over badly written laws has been vocalized/visualized . The reality of it , however , is that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He hopes that it will never be used as the sole source of " proof " . At least , that 's the guarantee that has been given by the authorities . We will certainly hold them to their word . <p> And no , " personal freedoms " do NOT include stealing the property of others . It also does not include inflicting physical and/or mental harm on others . <p> Since the tragedy of Walski 's PC getting stolen about two weeks ago , he 's had some opportunity to reflect on life . <p> First of all , life is short . Certainly too short to hold on to a grudge , or harp on things that one has absolutely no control over . Like legislations being kept on the books , for instance . Raising awareness - which the pop-up has helped do - is one thing , keeping the pop-up in place longer than a useful timespan is another thing altogether . It 's time to move one ... <p> Second , in life nothing is permanent . Getting his PC stolen is proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Walski 's work , both personal and professional , in the form of articles , reports , resumes , presentations , photographs , etc . None of these are easily replaceable . But they can be rebuilt . <p> Third , the Malaysia we live in right now is going through precarious times , and along with his PC , Walski 's unquestioning faith in humanity has been stolen as well . Gone forever . <p> October 19 , 2012 will be a date that Walski will never forget . That 's the date of the theft , and that 's the date when his life changed . He 's certainly more careful , and a lot less trusting . If you find Walski to be more bitter and more spiteful from now on , you now know why . <p> And you can thank the bastard who stole from him for that . This is not holding a grudge , per se , but reassessing one 's outlook in life . Suffice it to say Walski 's view of humanity has changed forever . <p> It appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to orbit , shall we ? <p> The pop-up 's gone , and this blog may be accessed without having to close the Stop 114A window that shows up . <p> That 's pretty much what Walski wanted to say in this post . The rest is the ramblings of a man embittered by a once-upon-a-time beautiful humanity that 's utterly failed him , and shown its true ugly colors ... <p> Yes , it 's been another very long absence from blogging for Walski . There are many reasons for this , and he figured that it was high time something got posted to partially explain why . <p> If for no other reason , to let you folks know that Walski is still very much alive . <p> Not like anyone would really care if he disappeared from the face of the Earth . Probably most would feel that it 's one less annoying person on the Internet . <p> In fact , life has been quite interesting in the past few months . Occasionally traumatic , too . But we 'll get to that in due time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work has dominated most of Walski 's time awake . Some of you may know that he is no longer full time in the process automation &; controls world , but instead co-runs an art gallery in the KL area . He still does a bit of freelance work from time to time , but that 's another story we wo n't get into . <p> And if you think running an art gallery ( or any business ) is easy-peasy , you 're quite wrong . It is as challenging , if not more , only in different ways . ( with interesting comes trauma , and more , in the full post ) <p> So for the most part , life has been hectic , getting the gallery up and running from scratch , doing the online promotional work , the website operational , etc . So yes , Walski 's been online a lot , just not blogging here ( although myAsylum 's Facebook page has been somewhat active ) . <p> Oh , and the tragedy part ? Walski 's PC , hard disks , iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weeks back . Yup - approximately 20 years worth of data gone . Some motherfucker broke into Walski 's car and stole the lot . <p> He wo n't delve into more details than this - too much pain - but suffice it to say that steps are being taken to try recover at least the PC , if not the whole lot of electronics . <p> In the meantime , this is being posted via a MacBook Pro , the machine on which he tries to rebuild all the data and images ( particularly the gallery related ones ) that have been STOLEN from him . To the thief : you 've not only stolen physical hardware , but stolen someone 's life and memories . <p> While Walski , on principle , does n't like to wish bad on anyone , he does hope in this case the perpetrator 's conscience gnaws at its host physical container and causes it to suffer the anguish and trauma that Walski has for the past couple of weeks ... <p> And there you have it - a short post to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day this blog may be as active as it once was , maybe it wo n't . It all depends on what happens the next few months . <p> In the meantime , our Facebook page is fairly active , so visit us there if you can ... <h> Thursday , August 23 , 2012 <p> In the quiet shadows , Walski has been following what 's become of this nation of once great potential . And suffice it to say , what he 's observed is not pleasing one single bit . <p> Disquiet in the quiet , so to speak . <p> On the one hand , the ruling BN coalition is pulling out every single conceivable ( and sometimes inconceivably ludicrous ) ploy from their now dog-eared playbook , to the point of stating that at least what we have now , no matter how decrepit , is at least familiar . <p> Never mind that we 've pretty much become 1FascistMalaysia . Fascism is good if it 's familiar . That 's the bullshit we 're being forced-fed . And suffice it to say , Walski does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecule of it . <p> And then , on the other hand , just about everyone , and their pet amphibian , who has an iota of an inkling of Islamic credentials , is pushing for hudud . <p> Exactly what shithole , God-forsaken nation do you aspire Malaysia to become , pray tell ? Somalia ? Afghanistan ? Iran ? Exactly what model of a despotic state do you have in mind when you dream your wet dreams at night ? <p> Assuming you pro- hudud types can comprehend English , The Malaysian Insider published a really intelligent article on this issue ( written by Dr. Ahmad Farouk Musa , director of the Islamic Renaissance Front ) , and in it we see why , in the case of Malaysia , a secular democracy is the ONLY system that ensures justice for ALL Malaysians . <p> Never mind that our Federal Constitution does not allow for it . Too much detail to derail your wet-dream fantasy , is it ? Well , continue to spew your pro- hudud rhetoric , because in a nutshell , that 's about all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . <p> Sheesh ... Seriously , between the two , Walski can honestly almost bring himself to stick his head in a gas oven , turn the knob to ' Cremate ' , and light the burner ... <p> There is one word in the English language that pretty much sums up how Walski feels about what 's happening to Malaysia . And extrapolating a little from there , pretty much describes how he is starting to view life in Malaysia generally . <p> No thanks , of course , to the nimrods on the one hand , and the Oxygen-deprived dickheads on the other . ( and the word is .... in the full post ) <p> Well , if you 've been observant , and bothered to look at a clue Walski included above , you 'd have already guessed what that word is . But if not , Walski invites these aged rockers of yore to enlighten you ... <p> Walski 's never really been a big Aerosmith fan . But you have to admit that they 've written some pretty powerful lyrics during their long career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how Walski 's been feeling for quite a while now . <p> He 's jaded with how Malaysians are now expected to honor and revere STUPIDITY and IGNORANCE . And how the more ludicrous and nonsensical the argument , the more reverence that 's demanded of us . <p> Walski has about had enough with the race and religion baiting that 's being perpetrated by the political grassroots , primarily those of the UMNO persuasion . Do you imbeciles know how desperate you look ? Malaysia must really be suffering from severe brain-drain if you lot are the cream of the crop future leaders of this country . And incidentally , scum also rises to the top , not just cream . <p> Yes , Walski is JADED . <p> Despite what the " statistics " say , crime is on the increase . No , it 's not just a perception , as we 've been forced to believe . Walski has a real friend who really had her car smashed into while stopped at a traffic light , and had her handbag snatched ( fortunately she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced ) . Walski may be a lot of things , but he certainly is n't delusional , nor does he have imaginary friends . <p> The devil is in the details , and the details , apparently , involve creative crime classification . The letter to the CPI is definitely an interesting read , and if true , explains why our " perception " paint a totally different picture from what 's officially being reported . <p> Oh , and did Walski mention that he 's JADED ? <p> Then , there 's religion . More and more things seem to be halal -ized , whether or not it 's necessary . Granted , the majority view is that beer is not halal ( there is at least one minority opinion that states it is not entirely forbidden ) . But does that mean the word ' beer ' is haram as well ? <p> That WTF moment when you realize even labels need to be kosher ( click here for source ) <p> Seriously , do you think you make Islam more attractive by making it more restrictive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Oh , Walski forgot ... the pious are n't allowed to think , only follow ... <p> Yes , boys and girls , Walski is JADED . <p> &lt; <p> The above are but some examples of why Walski says he 's JADED . And by the looks of it , things are n't going to get any better . Not for the lack of trying , on the part of concerned citizens , though . <p> You can find out exactly what the campaign is all about via Anas ' blog posting , but in a nutshell it is one man 's attempt to make everyone 's mood better . By saying something nice when you Facebook-post , tweet , blog , etc . <p> Truth is ( and it 's an ugly , inconvenient truth ) , while it 's nice to be positive and all , that 's not going to change the underlying rot that 's the real root cause of our national woes . Not much anyway . It 's a rot that 's been slowly festering for a long , long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just smiling , and saying nice things , to heal that rot . <p> Perhaps invasive surgery to yank the rotting cancer out of our collective national soul would be a better option . Bonus if the surgeon smiles while he slices and dices . And says something nice about the rot in the process . <p> And you get the chance to play surgeon -- GE13 will be coming our way anytime over the next 6 to 8 months . <p> To Walski , the 25-point posting by our esteemed former PM is nothing much more than a desperate attempt to sugar-coat a terminally ill and dying Barisan Nasional as an entity that 's able to take Malaysia to the next level . <p> Next level down closer to Hell on Earth maybe , but certainly not to the next level of positive development , to be a nation par excellence . <p> Is it better to live out this life with a familiar mediocrity , rather than take a chance for possible excellence ? With all due respect , Dr. M , Walski has to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , entitled to state his opinion . That 's his right . Does n't mean we have to swallow it wholesale . Like many Malaysians Walski knows . <p> And perhaps that 's the problem with this country -- the general ineptitude to critically analyze , and to accept wholesale what a political leader friendly to one 's own persuasion has to say . <p> Compound that by 27 million , and you still wonder why Walski 's feeling JADED ? <h> Tuesday , August 21 , 2012 <p> This should have been posted a couple of days ago on Sunday , but due to circumstances beyond Walsk 's control , here it is , two days late ... <p> From all of us here at myAsylum , Selamat Hari Raya Aidil Fitri 1433H . And what better way to wish you all , than to post one of the best Merdeka Day slogan/logo parodies created , especially for this festive season . <p> Walski 's not entirely sure who the creator of the above image is , but since first appearing on Facebook a couple of weeks back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big brouhaha the original Merdeka slogan and logo , he could n't think of anything more appropriate for a Raya greeting graphic . <p> For Malaysians , ketupat and Hari Raya go hand in hand . Raya simply is n't Raya without this favorite delicacy . And whether you prefer it with rendang or peanut sauce ( aka satay sauce ) , you just got ta have ketupat for Hari Raya . That 's just the Malaysian way . <p> Over the next few days , beginning Sunday , the quest for ketupat , rendang , and satay sauce will commence . For those who have to travel long distances for this quest , we hope you do so safely , and that the traffic does n't get the better of you . ( Eid , be merry , and more , in the full post ) <p> As you may have probably noticed , we reinstated the Blackout pop-up some days back , after it was announced the the Cabinet would not ' review ' Section 114A of the Evidence Act . It 's almost as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be re-elected into office . <p> Malaysians may be forgetful , but the Internet has a very long memory .... We 'll see , come GE13 , whose date remains a mystery , as it always traditionally has in Malaysia , waiting for the moment of inspiration from the Prime Minister to announce the " right time " for it . <p> By the way , in case you were wondering what circumstances caused this post to be delayed a couple of days , there 's good news and bad news . <p> The good news is that all is well now , but the bad news is that Walski 's dad had to be hospitalized the morning of first day Raya , due to a suspected lung infection . His dad , who 's 77 this year , had severe difficulties breathing and was rushed to the hospital . <p> As it turns out , it was n't a lung infection , but something else less sinister , related to Dad 's other existing problems . Walski wo n't bore you with the details , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better now , and should be released within a day or so . <p> In any case , we 're now in the third day of Hari Raya , and he 's sure that by now , you would have managed to find your ketupat . For Walski , on the other hand , the quest continues . <p> Enjoy the Eid , safely , and because of the abundance of tasty treats this time of year , do exercise moderation when eating . But bottom line , enjoy yourself safely and responsibly ... <p> It 's a small victory , but the fight for a free , unencumbered Internet is far from over . In a larger sense , this fight is for a freer , a more open , and ultimately , a more vibrant Malaysia . ( Stop114A gets noticed worldwide , and more , in the full post ) <p> While it may be a small victory , it 's an important one . The Malaysian Internet Blackout Day got noticed , not just by our Prime Minister , but far beyond our shores , by international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and MSN , among others -- see here for a longer list ) . <p> CIJ executive officer Masjazliza Hamzah told FMT that the response to the campaign -- created to highlight a unpopular amendment to the Evidence Act 1950- was phenomenal . <p> " In terms of response to the campaign , it 's just phenomenal , " she said , conceding however that it was not as " huge " as other online protests have been in the past . <p> " The catalysts are the websites ... and the business that supported it ... but I think the credit should go to netizens for making themselves aware of it , " Masjazliza added . <p> Nevertheless , she noted that the campaign -- which saw many websites either going offline or hosting black pop-ups messages- helped to not only create a public awareness , but also pressured the government to think twice about the amendment . ( source : Free Malaysia Today ) <p> It is believed that it was Tan who penned the # BlackOutTipu hashtag used throughout yesterday ( and today ) , tracing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But enough about Tan Keng Liang -- you have to take your hat off to the man for his perseverance in being annoying ... <p> In any case , the onus is now on the Cabinet to " discuss " Section 114A , and do something about it , not simply discuss the amendment . Walski is rather intrigued -- is n't this the same Cabinet that drafted the legislation and pushed it through Parliament in the first place ? Were n't " people first " then ? <p> Question , Walski 's sure , that many others are wondering , too . But be that as it may , let 's hope something real and positive comes out of said " discussion " ( whenever that might be ) . <p> Again , KUDOS to CIJ for an initiative well executed , and to all who participated in yesterday 's Internet Blackout , congratulations on a job well done . <p> Never forget that yesterday was a real victory , even though the battle is far from over . What the next step will be all depends on the anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is 114A ? Section 114a is a new amendment to the Evidence Act 1950 that was passed in parliament without debate in April 2012 . The section is called " Presumption of fact in publication " . It states that any owner , admin , host , editor , subscriber of a network or website , or owner of computer or mobile device is presumed to have published or re-published its contents . <p> 2 . Why is it a problem ? It has wide-ranging reach and extends not only to practically everyone who uses any internet platform -- from e-mail and social media to blogs and online media -- but also those who do n't . <p> It is a problem because : <p> It presumes guilt rather than innocence . <p> It makes individuals and organisations who administer , operate or provide spaces for online community forums , blogging and hosting services , liable for content that is published through its services . <p> It allows hackers and cyber criminals to go free by making the person whose account/computer is hacked liable for any content/data which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content that you did not publish when someone creates an account in your name . <p> It threatens the principle of anonymity online , which is crucial in promoting a free and open Internet . <p> It threatens freedom of expression online . <p> In other words , it is against the core principles of justice , democracy and fundamental human rights . <p> 3 . How will this affect you ? If 114a is not stopped , you will be held responsible for the words of others . It can also result in the removal of comment functions , curtailing your space for posting legitimate comments and opinions . This impacts your democratic right to participate freely and openly in public debate and discussions . Indirectly , it will foster a climate of self-censorship , and will have a huge impact on the interactive nature of online media . <p> 4 . Why do we want to stop 114a ? Our opinions -- as netizens and as citizens -- matter . If the new Evidence Act were gazetted , 114a would seriously hinder the democratic right to freedom of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and open to critical comments and debates . <p> click on image to view larger version <p> But the problem with Amendment 114A does not stop with freedom of expression and burden of proof . It does have a real impact on the Tech and Business sectors as well , articulated in this article ( by Digital News Asia Executive Editor and Founder , Asohan Aryadurai ) . <p> We 're hopeful that with this initiative , many more will find out about Amendment 114A , and why it must be repealed . You 'll be surprised at the number of people who do n't actually know about this . <p> click on image to find out more <p> So do yourselves and your friends a favor -- spread the word about this . And if you 'd like to participate , the previous post we put up tells you how . Or click on the image above . <h> Friday , August 10 , 2012 <p> UPDATED at 1757hrs : Thanks to the guys at Cari.com Walski has updated this post , which now includes instructions for Wordpress blogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amendment to the Evidence Act 1950 was passed in both houses of Parliament . It 's called Section 114A -- " Presumption of Fact in Publication " . And it is a BAD piece of legislation . <p> click on image for larger view <p> The Center for Independent Journalism ( CIJ ) has put together an initiative to raise awareness of why this is a bad piece of legislation , consisting of , among other things , a purpose-specific blog , an ongoing awareness campaign , a public forum ( this Saturday , August 11 ) , and an Internet Blackout Day . <p> Similar to the SOPA/PIPA protest blackout , participating websites and blogs will be " blacked out " -- displaying a pop-up stating the website/blog 's participation in the blackout initiative , with links to find out more about Amendment 114A , and social media connectors to ' Like ' on Facebook . You can see an example of this pop-up in action here . Unlike the SOPA/PIPA blackout , however , the website/blog will still be fully functional once the pop-up is closed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its limited resources , and yes , we will be participating in the August 14 Internet Blackout exercise . <p> We will , however , go a couple of steps further -- change the blog header ( already done ) , and display one and only one blog post on the main page on August 14th , talking about Amendment 114A . <p> If you have a Blogger or Wordpress-based blog , you , too , can participate by following the instructions Walski has provided in the full post . ( how to implement the August 14 blackout pop-up , in the full post ) <p> But before you do anything else , please send an e-mail to CIJ Malaysia letting them know that you would like to participate , providing them details of your website or blog . They will send you back code to implement the pop-up . Be sure to tell CIJ whether you will implement the code on a website , or blog -- this is important because the implementation is slightly different between the two site types . <p> If you do n't have a website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 114A campaign on Facebook or Twitter , by changing your display picture to the one you see on the left ( right click on the image , and do a " Save Link/Target As " ) . <p> Every little participation helps with this campaign , and not having a website or blog should n't stop you from helping . <p> The instructions that follow for both Blogger and Wordpress-based blogs have been developed and implemented by the good folks at Cari.com.my , one of the websites that will be participating in the August 14 Internet Blackout . <p> Instructions for Blogger blogs If you have a Blogger-based blog , the following is how you implement the pop-up . We will only provide instructions for Layout-based Blogger blogs , but this should work with the old style templates as well . Also , you will need to be comfortable with modifying your blog layout . To be safe , always backup your template before you do any changes . Just to be sure . <p> Step 1 : Go to Blogger.com and log in to access your blog settings . Select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blog overview page . Click on Layout as shown in the picture below . <p> This will bring up the layout set-up page for your blog . <p> Step 2 : What you will do now is add a widget to one of the area sections , preferably in the footer section as shown above ( although adding a new widget in any section works ) . <p> Step 3 : A new window will pop up for you to select the widget type . The type to use is the HTML/javaScript widget type . <p> Step 4 . Once selected , an edit window will appear for you to insert the script . You can name your new widget ( optional ) , but bear in mind that naming a widget will cause the name you assign to appear as a heading in some templates . <p> For the code to use , 3 language versions have been developed : English , Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese ( with 3 different types of encoding ) . The " generic " code can be found at the following links : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it assumes that the images required to make the pop-up work are uploaded to the root directory of your blog . For Blogger blogs , this is not possible . There are two workarounds to overcome this . <p> The first is to host the image files on your some file-hosting service ( such as Fileden ) which allows direct URL access then modify the code to include the full URL of the two images required in the pop-up . Where the full URLs go are shown in the picture below ( where the red boxes are ) . <p> click on image for larger view <p> The full URL for the first image is : http : **34;1349;TOOLONG ... ( English ) http : **34;1385;TOOLONG ... ( BM ) http : **34;1421;TOOLONG ... ( Chinese ) <p> while the URL for the second image is : http : **34;1457;TOOLONG ... <p> Once replaced , the script will look like what is shown in the image below ( example shown is the English version script ) . <p> click on image for larger view <p> If all this seems too complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walski has pre-modified the scripts for you , so all you need to do is to download the modified scripts from the following links ( right click and do a Save Link/Target As ) : <p> Instructions for Wordpress blogs As with the Blogger-based blogs , you will need to be comfortable with tweaks to your blog template and layout , and just in case , be sure you back up your blog before commencing with the changes . <p> There are 5 steps to configuring the pop-up on Wordpress blogs . The step numbers correspond to the marked up blog configuration page below . <p> click on image for larger view <p> Step 1 : Login to your blog 's WP-Admin page , and click on the Appearance tab ( on the left-hand navigation pane ) . This will bring up the Manage Themes page . <p> Step 2 : Click on Editor . This will bring up the theme text editor . If you have more than one theme active , be sure you select the correct theme . <p> Step 3 : From the Template selection pane ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( footer.php ) entry , and click on it . This will bring up the footer code in the center pane . <p> Step 4 : Depending on what language you intend to implement the pop-up with , you can obtain the code from one of the following links : <p> Copy the entire contents from the text area on the web page you selected above . Paste the code you copied on the line immediately before the &lt;/body&gt; tag ( which is located towards the end of the code cluster ) . If there is no blank line , place your cursor at the beginning of the &lt;/body&gt; tag , and press the Enter key on your keyboard . <p> The code has been pre-configured to retrieve the images required from a specific external location , so there 's no need to do any modifications to the script . <p> Step 5 : Finally , save the modifications by clicking the Update File button at the bottom of the center pane . And with that , you 're ready to roll ! <p> End Of Instructions <p> The pop-up has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walski uses for experimentation purposes , and the end-result should look like the image below . <p> click on image for actual implementation view <p> Your blog will continue to operate as per normal once you close the pop-up . As mentioned earlier , you will want to inform CIJ Malaysia that you wish to participate before going ahead and carrying out the implementation . <p> Walski hopes that this post has been helpful , and he looks forward to seeing your blog or website participate . It 's an initiative aimed at ensuring the Malaysian cyberspace remains free from the possible effects of Amendment 114A to the Evidence Act . <p> The possibility of unjust prosecution aside , there 's also the chilling effect -- Malaysians will no longer feel safe to express their views freely , and therefore exercise self-censorship . In other words , the death of the Internet as we know it ... <h> Wednesday , May 30 , 2012 <p> Unless you 've been living under a rock without Internet , you would have heard by now the problems that ZI Publications has had with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syariah law . It 's a reminder that we are , after all , living in 1Apartheid . <p> This is the latest is the long standing tradition of banning things in Malaysia , something that some of our fellow Malaysians seem to be proud of . And of course , when things like this happen , you know that a myAsylum poll ca n't be too far away . <p> The pretext of this latest banning , as with many others before it : protection of Islam and Muslims . And it is because what Irshad Manji writes about . And believe it or not , what she writes about is about MORE than just sex , something what most Malaysians have been led to believe the book is about . <p> Frankly , Walski has not read the book -- yet -- so he ca n't tell you exactly what it is about . It is a safe bet that those who have been instrumental in the book 's banning have not read it either . But based on what he surmises , sex is NOT the central topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So far , thankfully , the MCMC has not ordered Amazon.com 's site to be blocked , and it is quite easily accessible , so go verify the table of contents for yourself , since the " majority " of Malaysians probably view Walski as nothing but a lying bastard not worthy of being believed . <p> Funny , but Walski could n't find one single mention of the word sex in the table of contents . Or perhaps it was the new offensive word in the book 's title that got the clerics ' panties in a bundle : liberty . ( the poll , its details , and more , in the full post ) <p> In any case , back to the poll -- this time around , you get to pick THREE ( 3 ) choices out of the list given . Or suggest your own answer , reflecting what you think . <p> Not what you reckon the government wants to achieve , but WHAT YOU THINK . It may come as a surprise to you , but here at myAsylum you are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real-world Malaysia . <p> As with other polls before this , you can share this poll via your Blogger blog ( by clicking the icon below the poll , located at the sidebar on the right ) , or if your blogging platform of choice is Wordpress , you can use the shortcode polldaddy poll= " 6256206 " . On other platforms , drop Walski a line via the comments and he 'll provide you the codes you need . <p> IMPORTANT NOTE : Being that Walski has been labeled a " liberal " by most quarters , and being that these days , being a liberal is deemed to be a bigger sin than murder and rape , it would be a good idea for you to tell your friends of ALL orientations to participate in this poll . Only because Walski DOES want to know the opinions of everyone , and not just the opinions of like-minded people . Yes , we liberals are strange that way . <p> The poll will be open until Midnight , Sunday , June 10 , 2012 , after which Walski will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal thoughts and analysis . <p> Do n't worry : your opinions and how you vote are actually anonymous to Walski , so please participate in the poll according to how you actually feel , and be honest with yourself . Honesty is what Walski expects , nothing more , nothing less ... <h> Sunday , May 20 , 2012 <p> It has been a very , very long while since Walski has written anything related to religion . But recent events have made it necessary for him to do so . <p> In the Quran , there is one basic commandment that is seldom talked about these days , going by the rhetoric from the many so-called protectors " of faith . <p> Let there be no compulsion in religion : Truth stands out clear from Error : whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold , that never breaks . And Allah heareth and knoweth all things Quran 2:256 Yusuf Ali translation <p> Instead , what we hear today here in Malaysia is compulsion -- in spades . Compulsion to believe that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and what it demands of the faith 's believers . Compulsion to accept what the " majority " accepts , and the compulsion to denigrate any point of view not in concordance with what 's " accepted " . Worse , the compulsion to prevent any expression of said viewpoints . <p> How else could one explain this news report , published by Malaysiakini earlier this week ? <p> A Muslim lawyers ' group is protesting Canadian author Irshad Manji 's programme in Kuala Lumpur on account of her " liberal " Muslim position , and wants her out of the country . <p> " PPMM urges the government not to allow her to continue with her programme and have her leave Malaysia immediately , as it can be a cancer to Islamic practices in Malaysia , " Zainul Rijal said . <p> He added that several groups have lodged police reports over the matter , and also urged the ulama to come up with " rebuttals to counter " the ideas the author allegedly propagates. ( source : Malaysiakini , subscription required ) <p> Two things occur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rijal has no bloody clue what he 's afraid of . ( what the real cancer is , and more , in the full post ) <p> Instead , the vehement opposition to Irshad Manji is based on her sexual orientation , and the fact that she 's a " liberal " . <p> And as we all know , the word " liberal " has become a foul seven-letter word among the seemingly growing number of folks wearing a conservative faade . <p> Even worse , without even delving into what her message is -- probably because these naysayers do n't have a clue -- there is the immediate assumption that she 's here to champion LGBT issues . And as Walski has mentioned elsewhere , LGBT has become a manufactured political issue du juor . <p> So , exactly what points of view does Irshad Manji have ? Here 's an example : <p> So what is it that Irshad Manji says that orthodox Muslims find so repugnant and repulsive , to the point that they do not even want her on Malaysian soil ? And please do Walski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to the the clip above , and then ask them the same question . <p> If you had the moral courage to listen to the clip above , allow Walski to ask you a couple of other questions : Did you spontaneously combust , or get struck down by a bolt of lightning ? Has your faith in God ( assuming you have it in the first place ) suddenly disappeared ? <p> It is a safe assumption to say that the probable and most likely answers to both these rhetorical questions are ' No ' . <p> Having heard what Irshad Manji had to say in the clip above , do you still think that she is a " cancer to Islamic practices in Malaysia " ? <p> Walski 's personal opinion ? " Islam " in Malaysia has been reduced to a very narrow and rigid interpretation , and nothing other than the " approved " Sunni-flavored " Islam " is tolerated . Just look at how the Shi'ah sects are viewed in this country , not to mention other schools of thought that have been deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these very same " deviant " schools of thought are generally accepted elsewhere in the Islamic world . Ever heard of the Amman Message ? Malaysia is one of the signatories , and yet , the various Shariah laws we have in Malaysia do not reflect the consensus arrived at within this message . <p> Whosoever is an adherent to one of the four Sunni schools ( Mathahib ) of Islamic jurisprudence ( Hanafi , Maliki , Shafi'i and Hanbali ) , the two Shi'i schools of Islamic jurisprudence ( Ja'fari and Zaydi ) , the Ibadi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the Thahiri school of Islamic jurisprudence , is a Muslim . Declaring that person an apostate is impossible and impermissible . Verily his ( or her ) blood , honour , and property are inviolable . Moreover , in accordance with the Shaykh Al-Azhar 's fatwa , it is neither possible nor permissible to declare whosoever subscribes to the Ash'ari creed or whoever practices real Tasawwuf ( Sufism ) an apostate . Likewise , it is neither possible nor permissible to declare whosoever subscribes to true Salafi thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permissible to declare as apostates any group ofMuslims who believes in God , Glorified and Exalted be He , and His Messenger ( may peace and blessings be upon him ) and the pillars of faith , and acknowledges the five pillars of Islam , and does not deny any necessarily self-evident tenet of religion . <p> There exists more in common between the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence than there is difference between them . The adherents to the eight schools of Islamic jurisprudence are in agreement as regards the basic principles of Islam . All believe in Allah ( God ) , Glorified and Exalted be He , the One and the Unique ; that the Noble Qur'an is the Revealed Word of God ; and that our master Muhammad , may blessings and peace be upon him , is a Prophet and Messenger unto all mankind . All are in agreement about the five pillars of Islam : the two testaments of faith ( shahadatayn ) ; the ritual prayer ( salat ) ; almsgiving ( zakat ) ; fasting the month of Ramadan ( sawm ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mecca ) . All are also in agreement about the foundations of belief : belief inAllah ( God ) , His angels , His scriptures , His messengers , and in the Day of Judgment , in Divine Providence in good and in evil . Disagreements between the ' ulama ( scholars ) of the eight schools of Islamic jurisprudence are only with respect to the ancillary branches of religion ( furu ' ) and not as regards the principles and fundamentals ( usul ) of the religion of Islam . Disagreement with respect to the ancillary branches of religion ( furu ' ) is a mercy . Long ago itwas said that variance in opinion among the ' ulama ( scholars ) " is a good affair " . <p> Acknowledgement of the schools of Islamic jurisprudence ( Mathahib ) within Islam means adhering to a fundamental methodology in the issuance of fatwas : no one may issue a fatwa without the requisite personal qualifications which each school of Islamic jurisprudence determines for its own adherents . No one may issue a fatwa without adhering to the methodology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do absolute Ijtihad and create a new school of Islamic jurisprudence or to issue unacceptable fatwas that take Muslims out of the principles and certainties of the Shari'ah and what has been established in respect of its schools of jurisprudence . <p> The Malaysian reality , however , is that apart from the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence , all others are officially seen as not entirely kosher . Despite Malaysia being a signatory . Compulsion by the powers that be , therefore , to ensure that only " approved " Islam is practiced . <p> And while Walski may not agree 100% with the Amman Message , it is a good and positive start towards reconciliation between the major schools of thought . <p> The same Malaysiakini report quoted earlier also had this to say : <p> Meanwhile another pressure group Persatuan Persaudaraan Muslimah Malaysia ( Salimah ) said they vehemently objected to the arrival of one who they said " insulted Islam with her writings and attitude " that allegedly " denigrated the views of venerated scholars " . <p> " Inviting someone like her is surely an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , " said the group 's chief Aminah Zakaria in a statement . <p> She said her group rejected Irshad 's presence charging that it would " raise confusion and incite anger " of the Muslim community . ( source : Malaysiakini , subscription required ) <p> Honestly , Walski does n't know where to begin commenting on this . For starters , he seriously doubts that Salimah has read anything Irshad 's written . Secondly , why is it that champions of the brand of Islam we 're being force-fed are so damned sensitive and angry all the time ? And why is it that just about anything disagreeable incites anger ? <p> Thirdly , by their own admission , Salimah are of the opinion that being a Muslim necessitates not thinking , and therefore prone to being confused all the time . <p> Solution ? Suppress ideas , and enforce this suppression through the stance of compulsion . <p> The truth is that groups like the PPMM and Salimah refuse to accept that there exist views other than those that jive fully with the state-endorsed narrow world-view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would prefer that the rest of the Muslims ( over whom they have no jurisdiction , incidentally ) also be in denial just like them . <p> That is the real cancer -- the self-inflicted refusal by vocal ultra-conservative groups such as PPMM and Salimah to use the God-given gift of reasoning , in fear of possibly insulting the views of " venerated " ( and centuries-long dead ) scholars . <p> But before you think Walski is being unduly harsh , he happens to think that theirs is a conditioned condition . It is the result of having been raised in an environment that loathes healthy inquiry , and damns questions as leading towards religious infidelity . <p> From Walski 's point of view , the root cause of the mind cancer that afflicts Mulsims at large , not just in Malaysia , but in many parts of the Islamic world , is in fact , compulsion . Coupled with the notions that the human intellect should not be applied to matters pertaining to religion , and religion is best left to those " more qualified " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to metastasize . <p> That is the real threat facing many Muslims today . As things stand , the notions of liberty only threaten those in positions of religious influence , positions that facilitate realpolitik power . And power , once tasted , is something difficult to relinquish . <p> Perhaps the fear Walski senses in Zainul Rijal is the fear of liberty , and perhaps more fearful , freedom of conscience . Both are potential show-spoilers that can unravel the hold that persons of religious influence have . <p> But it is exactly liberty and freedom of conscience that are needed if we ever want to eradicate the cancer of the mind that afflicts us . <p> And despite the no-brainer that Malaysia is not Egypt , certain individuals in positions of power -- and some formerly in positions of power -- insist that Bersih 3.0 was an attempt to " occupy Dataran Merdeka " until the government in power is expelled . <p> Through free and fair elections maybe , but certainly not through a revolting revolution . <p> And Walski certainly does n't remember anyone attending Bersih 3.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last a lifetime . <p> Seems like some people are in a state of desperate exasperation . Or exasperating desperation . Whatever ... <p> So , once and for all , in hopes that certain numbskull individuals are finally convinced , here are the Top 10 reasons why Malaysia is NOT Egypt ... ( the Top 10 list , and more , in the full post ) <p> 10 . Malaysia is NOT in Africa Despite how some people like to compare us to Zimbabwe ( and how we seem to love Robert Mugabe ) , and a stroll down some parts of KL reminds one of Abuja , Malaysia is NOT in Africa . Wrong continent , mate -- failed geography much ? <p> 9 . Egypt has The Nile On the other hand , what we have is denial . Lots of it . But that still does n't make us Egypt . <p> 8 . " Malaysia " and " Egypt " only have ONE letter in common And that alphabet is the letter " y " . Yes , Why indeed . Why , Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Egypt actually has a Spring Despite the changing weather patterns , Malaysia does NOT have a season called Spring . Local fashion designers kindly take note . The only seasons we have are Wet , Dry and Durian . With the proliferation of Thai imports , however , even the latter is questionable these days . Any mention of a Malaysian Spring can only logically refer to mattresses . And there ai n't anything revolutionary about mattresses . <p> 6 . Egypt has pyramids The closest we come here in Malaysia is pyramid schemes . But since these do n't come with sarcophagi or mummies , they do n't really count . <p> 5 . Camels are NOT indigenous to Malaysia And on a similar note , the Tapir is not indigenous to Egypt . Incidentally , Wikipedia indicates that the Tapir is a browsing mammal , although it neglects to mention which browser is preferred . Personally , Walski , like many other Malaysians , prefers Chrome . As do many Egyptians , most likely . But that does n't make Malaysia anything like Egypt . <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Ranking lists Egypt at #55 , while Malaysia sits at an inglorious #156 . No comparison whatsoever . There are at least 6 Egyptian footballers who have been in a Barclay 's Premier League team between 2004 and the present . Malaysian players ? ' Nuff said . <p> 3 . Sandstorms are common in Egypt Whereas in Malaysia , sand creates political storms . Mostly in teacups . And sometimes , teacups in Selangor . <p> 2 . In Malaysia vehicular traffic travels on the left While in Egypt , it 's more a guessing adventure , so Walski 's told . Egyptians will probably say we drive on the wrong side of the road , since they drive on the right side . Sometimes on the left , or center , too , to avoid camels , and other stray animals . In Malaysia , it 's only the stray mat rempit that we usually have to worry about . <p> And last , but certainly not least .... <p> 1 . Malaysians DO N'T walk like Egyptians ( usually ) <p> So there you have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now to convince the numbnuts in power to stop the revolting notion that Malaysians are planning to revolt just like the Egyptians did . Not to say Egyptians are revolting , mind you . But they did revolt . <p> Come to think about it , all they wanted was to stop being trodden upon . And their leaders-that-were saw said desire to be revolting .... Maybe that 's just a disease of those in power for far too long . Who knows . <p> All we peaceful Malaysians want is free and fair elections . Any toppling shall only be done through the ballot box , and the ballot box alone . <h> Monday , April 02 , 2012 <p> While Liverpool FC 's season continues with their self-destruct strategy to get into Europe next season -- this time at the hands of Newcastle -- Walski thought he 'd better get away from the boob-tube and post this . <p> No point getting the adrenalin pumping and blood pressure up for no good reason . Unlike Saturday afternoon , when the obligatory stage fright took over Walski 's body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . <p> But before we get the festivities of this blogpost further along , thanks once again to Sharon Bakar for the opportunity to read at Saturday 's Readings@Seksan 's . <p> And many thanks , too , to Dina Zaman for capturing an image of him for the scrapbook . Guess who forgot to assign someone to snap-snap while Walski read ? <p> But it went well , he must say . Rather pleasantly surprised that Walski 's writing was enjoyed by the audience . <p> Yes , the person you see in the picture above is the organic vessel in which Walski traverses this dimension . Not the pink guys , but the one directly in front of the mic . <p> All told , he did n't do too badly , despite the damned butterflies occasionally getting in the way , fluttering around the vessel 's larynx region , colliding with the tangled vocal cords ... ( no longer a Readings virgin , and more , in the full post ) <p> Best part of the whole afternoon , though , was that some parts of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle . Hopefully think , too . Oh , and he got reacquainted with a word he had n't heard in a while -- faction . Fiction based on fact . Which is what the Ali Baba story was , in any case . <p> He did feel somewhat intimidated , he must admit , reading in the company of much more accomplished writers . But with encouragement from the Mrs , and Sharon , he decided to go ahead with it . <p> Walski has sure come a long way from when he first started this blog . And he reckons , that after six years of writing under a pseudonym , it was time to appear in the flesh . <p> Does the organic vessel ever intend to drop the pseudonym and write under his own name . One should never say never , but Walski has every intention of continuing pseudonymously . Which , by the way , is very different from " anonymously " , because unless you 're one of the ' walking brain-dead ' , it 's not really difficult to find out the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the marine registry to find out ... <p> In any case , Saturday 's Readings was documented ( apparently for the first time ) by a gentleman named Leon Wing . Walski appears around time marker 9:56 thereabouts . <p> So yeah , Walski is no longer a Readings virgin . To him , Saturday was a rite of passage that any writer worth his or her weight in Sodium Chloride needs to go through in the Malaysian world of the written word . <p> And more importantly , it was fun . <p> Walski read last of all , by the way , preceded by four other real writers : Shahminee Selvakannu ( the writer who mentioned the word " faction " , if not mistaken ) , Jasmine Low , Dina Zaman , and Sabah Carrim . <p> Tan Twan Eng , the other guy writer who was supposed to read from his new book The Garden of Evening Mists was unfortunately down with dengue , of all things . So Walski was left being the thorn among the roses . Which is kind of fitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of a few folks along the way ... <p> Dina Zaman read from her recently launched collection of short stories , King of The Sea , a book that Walski will definitely get one day . Once his self-imposed moratorium on book purchases is lifted , that is . <p> A pleasant surprise was Ms. Sabah Carrim , an author who hails from Mauritius , reading from her book , Humeirah : A story about Beauty , Existence and Wisdom . Humeirah gives us an insight into being a woman , and being Muslim , in Mauritius , which incidentally is where one of Walski 's aunt lives . So perhaps this , too , will be a book that will make it to that growing list , post-moratorium . <p> So there you have it , another chapter in the ever-continuing life adventures of Walski . It was a pleasure to meet and speak to those whom he met yesterday , and whom , with the right cosmic alignments , will meet again somewhere down the road of uncertainty that we call life . <h> myAsylum <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranting and raving of a sane person living in an insane place , MY country , MY home ...

##1056852 <h> Foodiot KK <p> Foodiot=foodie+idiot . A person who loves to take picture of every food he/she saw and is eager to know WHAT &; HOW . Not only an enthusiast to food , but also likes to share about the food and idea . This is a food blog written by Tomatotree who lives in KK ( a short for Kota Kinabalu ) , Sabah , MALAYSIA . Lets fill the hunger : ) <h> Monday , 26 November 2012 <p> Thanks to the nature of my job as a sales representative , I have many opportunities to try out different food and restaurant when I travel around . In Malaysia , it has been our practice to take care of our clients ' stomach , which then will be the time the potential customer stay out of their hectic life and think what is best solution for them or their company ... <p> " TIPU-LAHYou are just taking OPPORTUNITY to EAT while WORK ! " <p> Haha ... <p> Very often for me to bring my clients or suppliers to some famous eateries around town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually went to a Halal Dim Sum at a hotel in town but recently the level of food quality has dropped tremendously . The price tag is not cheap , too ! <p> Last weekend I joined this Blogger Invite lunch Dim Sum session at the Noble House , the Chinese restaurant at Nexus Resort &; Spa Karambunai . Nexus is one of the best 5 Star Resort in Kota Kinabalu north , situated just 45min drive from KK town overseeing the South China Sea . In the restaurant , we were warmly greeted by the restaurant 's manager Ms. Siew Ling and the team . I was attracted to a dragon sculpture which " flying over " above the diners ! <p> We were presented their best and most popular Dim Sum and Chef 's Specialty dishes . For the Dim Sum part , we tried Crystal Prawn Dumpling , Scallop Dumplings , Chicken Cheong Fun , Steamed BBQ Chicken Bun , Shrimp Toast and others . At the same time , Ms. Siew Ling also introduced us with the restaurant 's famous Peking Duck , Orange Prawn etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef , with a little bit of meat attached to the skin , just in front of us ! For your interest , with just RM110+ , you will be served with 2 courses of duck : First , the Peking Duck , which diner wrap the duck skin with some cucumber , shallot cut and chilli in the thin egg skin . Second course is a choice of Sauteed Minced Duck with Lettuce , Sauteed Shredded Duck with Capsicum , Black Pepper Sauce , or Stirred Fried Shredded Duck with Fragrant Salt . <p> Only the skin and the attached duck meat was served during the first coarse . For the second course , we were served " Minced Duck with Lettuce " . <p> Trust me , the taste is so nice and refreshing due to the big piece of lettuce <p> We were brought to another bigger banquet room because the first table was too small . Not too small actually to fit 6 of us with an ordinary meal but we were served 20++ bamboo basket and plates of dim sum ! <p> BBQ Chicken Chong Fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siew Mai ) ( RM6/4pcs ) <p> Steamed BBQ Chicken Pao ( RM6/3pcs ) <p> Yam Dumpling ( RM6/3pcs ) This Yam Dumpling was quite unique of its kind : the Yam is sweet ! <p> Scallop Dumplings ( RM11.00/3pcs ) Definitely value the money as the scallop and prawn was so big ! <p> Crystal Prawn Dumpling ( RM8.50/4pcs ) <p> The skin 's transparent can see the prawn inside ! <p> Chicken Leg ( RM6 ) <p> Shrimp Toast ( RM6/3pcs ) <p> Yong Zhao Fried Rice <p> At first everyone thought the fried rice was just as plain as the one we usually get nearly the end of a banquet , but this bowl at Noble House was really different ! It taste very very good which was quite a surprise of the day ! <p> All prawn served in Noble House were big &; fresh , which reflects how serious they are in maintaining the top quality of food . As their name suggest : to provide diners a " noble " quality of dining experience . <p> Cod Fish in 2 types of cooking <p> Sizzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim sum and signature food at Noble House summed up with 2 types of dessert . Both equally good , I preferred the Shanghai Pancake very much due to the crispy but not too oily pancake skin ! <p> Shanghai Pancake ( RM8 ) Very crispy outside and sweet inside <p> Refreshing cool Mango Pudding with Milk ( RM8 ) <p> Despite being one of the most luxury resort in town , Nexus 's very own HALAL Chinese Restaurant , the Noble House offers Dim Sum and other Chinese cuisine at a very reasonable price . If we were billed for Dim Sum ONLY , it was approximately RM35 per pax including tax and charges . Great deal ! <h> Saturday , 24 November 2012 <p> This was my second visit to Wasabi Sushi &; Bar at Hilltop , KK . Click here for my previous post . I ordered one of the most popular Japanese meal for my dinner --- the Teriyaki Chicken Bento Set ! Teriyaki is a kind of yaki , means grilled , eg. " Yakitori " = grilled chicken ; " Okonomiyaki " = Japanese pancake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything grilled using hot plate . For teriyaki chicken , a pre-marinated piece of boneless chicken thigh was lightly covered in flour and was pan fried or grilled until the chicken skin turn golden . Then , a type of Japanese sweet soy sauce called the teriyaki sauce was poured on top of the chicken . Finally , some sesame was added on top of the chicken before served . <p> The Wasabi &; the Taiwanese Food outlet at behind <p> We were served a plate of wasabi as starter before the drinks ! <p> Eat Japanese food , watch Japanese Anime . So guess what gesture is this and appeared in which anime ? <p> Chicken Teriyaki was once my everyday food during college time at Setapak together with my best friends &; house mates at an ordinary food stall . I shall tell you the complete story in one day , now , let me complete the dinner course first . <h> Saturday , 17 November 2012 <p> There are 3 restaurants in Sim-sim Floating Village , Sandakan . I ever blogged about the Sim-sim seafood restaurant here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I am going to talk about only serves breakfast and early lunch . Its called by its house number : No . H84 . <p> Unlike the other 2 , H84 is truly the restaurant runner 's home . Patrons eating at their living area during the day ; at night , its where the children writing home work and the adults watching TV or playing Mah Jong . I am very sure they did play Mah Jong because during one of my visit to H84 , my table was eventually the 
##1057452 <p> Today Egon von Greyerz told King World News that dominos are falling daily and we should expect to see more chaos in the banking system , including failures . Egon von Greyerz is founder and managing partner at Matterhorn Asset Management out of Switzerland . Von Greyerz also said we are edging closer to panic and he expects this will accelerate the flow of funds into gold . Here is what Greyerz had to say about the situation : <p> " Eric , I do n't know if you read the book by John Galbraith , ' The Great Crash 1929 ? ' He wrote about how every day there was a bad piece of news , and in the end , everybody gets immune to it . I think that 's exactly what we are seeing now . " <p> " There is so much bad news every single day that people are not reacting to it . What will happen is all of this pent-up risk is going to erupt one day . I 'm seeing the dominos falling here , daily . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $415 billion from the ECB , and that 's about 63% of the total ECB lending . Bad debts in the Spanish banks are going up at record levels . Bad debts over the last 3 months are now 8% of total debt . That 's massive . <p> It also means defaults are not far away , and the banks have n't reserved for these .... <p> " The banking world is on the way to bankruptcy here . We 've talked about the leverage in the banking system , but people do n't seem concerned about it . What we are going to see , one day , is when these dominos start falling , there will be panic . <p> Banks are supposed to come down to 20 times leverage . There is only one bank of the top twenty-five banks in the world today that is below 20 times leverage . Every other bank is above . 20 times leverage means that if they only lose 5% on their loan book , they have lost their capital . <p> I will bet you that virtually every bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than 5% of their assets . And if you look at an entity such as Deutsche Bank , do you know what their leverage is ? 62 times . It means that if they have a bad debt position of 1.5% , the bank is bust . Deutsche Bank is bigger than German GDP . So , if something happens to Deutsche Bank , Germany goes under . <p> Credit Agricole , the largest French bank , has 63 times leverage . This is absolutely frightening . This situation is untenable . Some of these banks will not survive . Of course , central banks are aware of this , governments are aware of this , and they will print money . Will they print in time ? Maybe for some banks , but some banks will not survive , I 'm sure . <p> The two big Swiss banks combined total 7 times Swiss GDP . The banks have a leverage which is unsustainable , and in many cases are bigger than the countries themselves . <p> So , central banks , being aware of this , are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend will accelerate because central banks know that buying bank debt or government debt is a bad move . So , all of these dominos that will fall are going to accelerate the trend into gold . <p> The IMF came out with a report yesterday saying we are very near a eurozone breakup , a disorderly one . That would create panic in the market . There would be an even greater flight of deposits out of the banking system which would make the situation even worse . <p> The IMF is coming out with statement after statement that should frighten the world . Today they said that European Banks will have to sell roughly $3.8 trillion in assets . In reality , it could be well over $10 trillion in the next couple of years . <p> We are in a mess , Eric , and the IMF recognizes this . The central banks know this as well , but for right now they are trying to tell the markets , ' We are not going to print any more money . ' They will print money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making these statements , is saying central banks are going to have to print money , just to sustain the financial system . Improvements in the economy are unthinkable , things are going to get a lot worse . " Von Greyerz also added : " Regarding the gold shares , we could have a little more work to do , but after that I am expecting a major up-move in the . This should start fairly soon .

##1058750 <h> Tuesday , September 25. 2012 <p> Some overall points Gunter paper is a review of behavioural research on media effects on violence - extensive and useful , goes over the different types of research , etc The most fundamental difficulty is that everyone is different , media effects get filtered through individual cognitive and cultural screens , " certain forms of media violence can exert certain kinds of effects on some media consumers some of the time . " ( p1113 ) -- Real or fiction : people more likely to respond and be affected by real violence ( or violence said to be real , e.g. in experiments ) -- Also legitimacy : when violence is shown as legitimate , people more likely to repeat/be violent -- The lab experiments ( mostly with college students ) tend to show effects ( violence analogue , electric shock , ' angered ' subjects ) - aslo the Bandura one - tend to support media violence causality , but these are always artificial situation ( altho eg when children left to play after the experiment has ' finished ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see also p1111 ) -- More effects on younger children - hardly surprising -- Tend to be more males apparently affected , but this leads to on bias present in many - people who are already violent probably prefer violent media content and therefore there is not necessarily a causal link , only an associational one -- Literacy : positive results when children taught to interpret the texts - this implies that without such training , there is more likely to have negative effects -- Statistical significance : what does it mean exactly ? Correlation /= correlation ... ( pp1109 ) -- Many studies done on violence , and on youth - why ? ( Ruddock 's political point ) . Somewhere in Gunter he speaks of this bias also , and one ( meta analysis I think ) showed that depending on initial assumption ( violence , neutral , or non violent ) the outcome tended to support the assumption ( see also p1111 ) -- " A simplistic , unidirectional model of media effects therefore may hamper the achievement of a comprehensive understanding of why individuals respond to media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tuesday , June 12. 2012 <p> One of the main concerns that has been expressed regarding the recent Facebook IPO is whether or not it can monetise its massive user base properly . As Rushkoff ( I think ) has said , all of us who are on Facebook are its product , not its users . Our personal data is number crunched and requalified as advertising targets . <p> If you want to see this in action , just try changing your gender , or your age , your location or other data , and see the ads change . <p> So - in the example given . You take any post and say how much you want to spend Then ... <p> All promoted posts will show in the news feeds of the people who like your Page and , when they interact with the post , to their friends . These posts will be labeled as " Sponsored " in the news feed . Promoted posts will not be shown in the right-hand column of Facebook . <p> Your promoted posts will be seen by a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally see it . It will also be seen by a larger percentage of the friends of people who interact with your post . <p> So -- I guess this means that if you liked a page once , and never went back there ( as happens ) , then instead of no longer showing up ( as your feed is more likely to show those you regularly interact with ) it will suddenly pop up . Also , it will be pushed to more of your friends . <p> It 's not for everyone , you need to have at least 400 likes on your page , and it 's limited to posts that you have done in the last three days . But the money is am " lifetime budget " so I guess if you pay a lot of money upfront it can keep running for a long time . <p> Also : <p> Just like with regular ads and sponsored stories , promoted posts will be reviewed by our Facebook Ads Team , but generally they should start running as soon as they 're created . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inappropriate content . <p> What does this mean ? Well , just like all media we are going to have to get used to tuning out the advertisements , though these updates will look at first glance just like a normal one . By the time you have checked for the ' Sponsored ' tag , you will have taken in much of the content . I doubt that Facebook will give you the option to not have any of these sponsored posts . One response could be to unlike the page , which may happen in some cases but most people will probably just live with it . <p> Over time , the interleaving of your personal posts and friends ' posts with sponsored posts will highlight the commercial nature of Facebook , and therefore tend to make people more likely to leave to another service if they have the options . <h> Wednesday , May 23. 2012 <p> I often hear parents telling me that television is a good way for their children ( infants , toddlers ) to educate themselves . I usually shudder inwardly and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television for infants is likely to cause short attention spans and possibly also slow learning of language , etc . ( By the way he specifically mentions ' Baby Einstein ' DVDs as being a bad idea ; also note that Disney had to *remove* claims that Baby Einstein was educational and offer refunds after legal action was brought against them in the USA . ) One of the main problems is that the editing of TV programmes is so snappy , with new scenes every 10 seconds or less . We have not had television for a few years now , and when I do see television , I start to get annoyed at the way in which everything moves so quickly . <p> One of the reasons for this is the need to keep people interested , and to stop them zapping onto another channel if they are not stimulated in the next 15 seconds . So , imagine a world without the remote control - it 's an interesting way to think of the effects of technology on our lives . <p> The inventor of the remote control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a major contributor to the current short attention span-friendly TV programming , with his invention of , as his patent application put it " a system to regulate the receiver operation without requiring the observer to leave the normal viewing position " ( Rosen ) <p> On the other hand , and in a good example of the need to avoid plain technodeterminism ( i.e. the argument that technologies cause social change ) , it is instructive that one of the selling points of the ' Flash-Matic ' was its ability to " tune out annoying commercials " ( by reducing the volume , Rosen ) , and the ability to avoid advertisements is still a motivating factor for most TV viewers . <p> Toddlers want control , they need it . Which is why they keep saying ' No ' . It 's an important part of how they develop a sense of their own individuality in the world . So it does n't surprise me that they ( apparently ) pick up the use of a remote very quickly , and one research reported that <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could neither recognize numbers nor tell time , but he " had mastered the basics of RCD use . " He " primarily used the RCD to change channels on the TV in order to watch his favorite programs , " and when told the time , clever Jimmy " knows if his program should be airing . " ( Rosen ) <p> Frankly , I ca n't help thinking that if poor Jimmy had n't been given free reign of the remote he might have learnt more words , numbers , and the time . Let 's hope that he eventually managed to learn to read . <h> Friday , January 27. 2012 <p> This is a Prezi of a paper I presented last year at the 6th Asian Graduate Forum On Southeast Asian Studies at the NUS Asia Research Institute . <p> Here is the abstract : <p> Whereas the great majority of blogs are of the ' personal ' genre - i.e. diaristic accounts of individuals ' lives - academic research has focused mostly on the ' social-political ' blogging genre and its relevance to the democratisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing upon anthropological critiques of economic theory , this paper discusses the complexities of the articulation of personal blogging with existing models of media advertising in Malaysia . By conceptualising personal bloggers ' provision of advertising space and ' advertorials ' ( paid blog posts ) , this paper argues that the monetisation of personal blogging has resulted in a new blogging genre , the ' lifestyle blog ' . <p> The advertising industry in Malaysia has responded to the destabilisation of the advertising market enabled by blog affordances by seeking to internalise the bloggers who represent " voicy consumers " in the " economy of qualities " ( Michel Callon ) . Robert Foster has argued that surplus value is created for brands " through the everyday practices in which consumers use branded goods to create social relations and shared meanings and affect . " In effect , the diaristic practices of personal bloggers create both an opportunity for this process to take place and , for the more popular bloggers , a platform for advertisers to reach significant portions of a younger , more affluent , audience . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertisers seek to entangle the brand with the bloggers and their audience 's shared network of meaning , or dynamic assemblage . <p> While these findings are based on the Malaysian context , they have particular relevance for Singaporean blogging , as well as potential relevance for blogging worldwide , which has seen an increased interest in blogs as an advertising platform embedded in local and contextualised markets . <h> Wednesday , January 4. 2012 <p> Well , it was a long year - most of which was spent writing my thesis which I handed in at the end of September ! That was a relief , but immediately followed by the realisation that when it comes back from the examiners , there will be revisions , and no doubt some difficult questions . So it did n't have the release that one usually gets from finishing exams , or a school year , when there is nothing more to be done . <p> The Australian doctoral system does not have a viva ( i.e. an oral defence of the thesis ) as is common everywhere else . Someone explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously it was too difficult to arrange for Australians to defend in person when their examiners were typically in the UK or the USA . Instead , the examiners write an evaluation and can ask questions which have to be answered in written form . <p> It 's kind of excruciating waiting for the examiners ' responses , which I hope to get soon , from time to time it pops into my head , and I wonder what they are going to say . No doubt they will have detailed questions and they are sure to find some flaws somewhere ... That 's their job after all . <p> OK . Here goes for a rapid review of 2012 . <p> January : Of course , Charlie has been the most enjoyable part of the year . I stopped posting about him because I started to feel a bit uncomfortable about pasting him on the internet - after all , it 's his life and he may not appreciate all his baby photos being online when he gets older Anyway , in January he was learning to drink from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is walking , talking , and just started his first ( pre ) school yesterday ! Apart from that , the highlight of January was being invited to present at the Pecha Kucha event organised by Niki Cheong and the British Council . It was a good night , and the principle ( 20 slides , 20 seconds each ) is a great discipline . <p> March : No blog posts . The whole year , up until September , I was trying to block off any other activities . Dividing time between taking care of Charlie for 2-3 days a week , reading , writing and analysing , with little sleep and much stress , sometimes I found myself despairing . <p> April : Only one post about the 1Malaysia email . It does n't seem to have had much take up yet , but I still think that eventually , having a state-certified online identity will become commonplace . <p> June &; May : No blog posts . More writing . Doing a PhD thesis is probably the most difficult thing I have ever done . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about 250 students . The difference is that with a thesis , you need a lot of self-discipline - it 's easier to work with tight deadlines when you can go from one day to the next , completing each task as it comes to you . The whole point of a PhD thesis is to write something that nobody else has done - so , in the end of the day , you are all alone . <p> July : One post on Visualising Assemblage . For various reasons , I decided to use Deleuze &; Guattari 's theories for my thesis . This meant a whole lot of reading and trying to understand this complex theory . I think it was worth it , but it probably added a couple of months onto the thesis . <p> August to October : No posts . Heh . Sometime in July or August I realised that when I do n't sleep enough I get very bad tempered . I also started to feel extremely burned out . I learnt that you just ca n't do without enough sleep for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Actually , after I handed in the thesis we went to the UK and Belgium for a month . That was very nice , and after a couple of weeks I started to feel alive again . Spending the time with Charlie was great too , and he really took to travelling well - to our relief , as I was dreading a twelve hour flight with screaming toddler <p> November and December : only one post about Forced Labour in Malaysia . I can not ever look at foreign labourers the same again after reading those harrowing witness accounts . <p> So that was my year . Christmas was on the beach near Port Dickson - chasing crabs with Charlie and eating some homemade mince pies . New Year was a few beers and a great view of the fireworks over KL thanks to some friends . <p> But ... that 's **not** all folks ... <p> Please say hello to Neil ! <p> We 're so happy to have another addition to our family - due in about five weeks <p> All the clichs are true - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also brought us the most consistent source of joy ever . To think that soon we will have two is really exciting , and we are so looking forward to seeing them play together and grow up together ( touching wood - I get superstitious sometimes ) . <p> Finally - all my best wishes for the New Year to you , dear reader , with thanks for taking the time to read to the end of this post . <h> Wednesday , November 2. 2011 <p> Imagine coming home one day and finding out that your brother has been taken away to do forced labour . You do n't know when you will see him again , and you ca n't go to the authorities for help - because they are the ones who took him away . You suspect they will come for you next , so you take what you can on you back , in a suitcase , and leave your country - not knowing when you can come back . <p> Imagine the police visiting the house of parents , who are soon to be 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that their son has been involved with an NGO , and they believe that he is working with an ethnic independence organisation . They say : ' We will come back here tomorrow , and we want to see him here . If not ... ' - the threat is clear although unspoken . That night , the parents and the son take what they can on their back and leave to the next country . <p> The government continued to repress ethnic minorities protesting in relation to the elections as well as those who peacefully opposed the impact of development and infrastructure projects on the environment . Authorities also persecuted ethnic minorities for their real or suspected support of armed groups . ( Amnesty International 2011 Annual Report ) <p> All this has happened , and is happening , in Burma ( aka Myanmar ) . Many refugees from there have come to Malaysia - there are more than 90,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia , most of whom are from Burma . <p> Unfortunately for them , Malaysia does not recognise them as refugees , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to work legally . Because of this , in a bitter irony , many of them find themselves in forced labour right here in Malaysia . They can not go home and they have to survive , so they take whatever job they can find . Often , unscrupulous and immoral employers exploit them as much as is humanly possible - denying them their full wage , locking them up , and threatening them with denunciation to the police ( even though they themselves are doing something illegal by employing them ) . <p> The next time you get served by a waiter from Burma - think of this : <p> San ( 32 ) , an ethnic Burmese asylum seeker , recalled how he was once confined by agents who promised him a job at the hotel . " He kept me at a house with other people from Burma and Indonesia , including 3 women . We were locked in when they went out . The agent said he would give me a job if available . There were three guards in the agent 's house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their living quarters . John is housed in a place he refers to as a " hostel , " where he is not allowed visitors . He has to share a small room with five other people . ( Witness accounts : Forced labour in the Malaysian service industry ) <p> Or imagine how Min managed to keep his sanity when he was ' sold ' for RM1,000 ( note : an iPhone costs at least RM1,990 ) to a plantation owner by a restaurant owner who thought he was n't " presentable " enough to work in the restaurant . He worked - with no pay - for a year , so that he could ' pay back ' the money he was ' bought ' with : <p> Min worked 11 hours a day , even when it rained . He was given only two meals every day , usually only rice and leftover vegetables from the plantation . " The boss gave me a container for me to collect rainwater for bath and other purposes . " His main job was to spray insecticide , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use clothes left by previous workers because the boss refused to " spend more money " on him . <p> Min said that the experience was really hard for him . " At that time , I could n't even see myself as a human . The situation really drove me crazy and I felt like I wanted to die . " It was also during this time that he heard about the deaths of his mother and younger sister . " There was no one for me to speak to . The pain I felt was unspeakable . " ( Witness accounts : Forced labour in Malaysian plantations ) <p> Unfortunately , there are many more examples like this . In a recent survey , " 61% of refugees and asylum seekers who had worked full-time in Malaysia had experienced forced labor . " ( See the video below . ) <p> You ca n't change the world , nor help every refugee and asylum seeker out there , but you can make your voice and indignation heard . Ask the Malaysian government to recognise refugees and asylum seekers as @ @ @ @ @ 
##1063552 <p> Q. Why did you write about this particular moment in Malaysian history ? <p> I 've been interested in this period since I was a boy , and I 've been reading up on it and collecting materials and books on it for a long time . It 's a time which appeals to me , perhaps because it 's so soaked in nostalgia . Things seemed to have been done with more style then , there was a greater emphasis that things had to be done properly . <p> When I began writing THE GIFT OF RAIN , it seemed only natural to me that I set it in that era . The story also required it to be , of course , because I wanted to write about the Japanese Occupation of Malaya and how it affected my characters . <p> Q. Who do you identify with the most in the novel ? <p> I identify myself with many of the characters in THE GIFT OF RAIN -- from Philip , to Endo , to Michiko and all the other characters . While the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does contain many of my views on life , the philosophies which have influenced me , and the questions about life which I often ask myself and wiser people around me . <p> Q. What does Philip Hutton want in life ? What is important to him ? <p> Philip wants -- like all of us -- to find a place to belong to . I think many of us feel that we do n't really belong to the society we 're in , that we do n't fit in . We go through the motions everyday of living our lives , but there 's a part of us that feels we ought to be somewhere else , a place where we are fully accepted for what we are and how we think . <p> Q. Were you influenced by other authors or other texts while writing ? Which ones ? <p> I was n't influenced by anyone or any text while actually writing THE GIFT OF RAIN , but I 've been an admirer of Kazuo Ishiguro 's works for a long time . He has that spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first decided I wanted to be a writer , I thought I would like to write the way he does . But when I began working on THE GIFT OF RAIN , I realized that I could n't do so , because we 're completely different people , with different influences , tastes and viewpoints . <p> Q. What are the lasting effects/ reminders of World War II in Malaysia ? <p> It 's odd that despite what had happened , Malaysians are a forgiving -- or forgetful -- lot . The people who lived through the Japanese Occupation have died or are growing older now , and the younger people actually have very little knowledge of it . When the UK edition of THE GIFT OF RAIN first came out , many of my friends in Malaysia told me , after reading it , that they had n't been aware of quite a lot of the events during the war . It 's different in the UK and Australia , where the returning veterans have written memoirs and books on the subject . <p> Q. How does the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Aikido is one of the most complex and sophisticated martial arts I 've come across . As I mentioned in the novel , at its highest level it becomes more of a mental exercise than a physical one . I also wanted to use it as a vehicle to carry the Eastern philosophical elements of the novel , using the descriptions of the movements to convey what I wanted to say . By doing so , I could avoid dragging the pace of the novel , or confusing readers who would have found certain concepts confusing . <p> Q. You are a strong proponent for the conservation of heritage buildings in Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia . What prompted this interest and what can be done to staunch the destruction of historically important structures ? <p> My interest is primarily aesthetic -- I find these buildings architecturally beautiful , symbolizing a time which can never return . Compared to modern architecture , these old buildings have souls , history , stories . <p> It 's hard to staunch the destruction of these structures , especially in Asia , where they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindset is to have something new and modern . But I suppose by educating people about the intangible value of such buildings we can do something to stop the destruction . A middle way can be found , by preserving these buildings and converting them to suit modern requirements -- but something is always lost as well when this happens . <p> Q. What was the experience like to be long-listed for the Man Booker Prize ? <p> It was wonderful and also surreal . I was a bit tense on the day the announcement was made , and . I had to go out for dinner that evening and I was n't a very good dinner companion ! Halfway through dinner I had a call from a London number which was cut off before I could answer it and this added to my distraction and anxiety . When I got home I found an email from my agent with the word " CONGRATULATIONS ! " on the subject heading . And because I was n't expecting a baby , I knew I was on the list . That night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I failed to fall asleep . So many thoughts went through my mind and at 4 a.m . I got out of bed and began answering the congratulatory emails that had already started to come in . <p> There was also an element of fear : now my book was out there , brought to the attention of readers around the world . <p> Q. How did you come to writing novels ? How did you balance working as an advocate and solicitor with writing ? <p> I write novels because since I was young I read very widely and extensively . I wanted to be a writer from childhood , because I thought -- erroneously ! -- that it was an easy profession , glamorous , and financially rewarding . I was also fortunate enough to be doing my Masters when I wrote The Gift of Rain . There was no way I could have worked as a lawyer and still write -- especially a book like The Gift of Rain , where I had 
##1063651 <p> The first really warm day of spring , and almost everyone headed straight for the beach . Seriously . It was a Sunday , and it was like the whole kampung ( village ) had come out to play . It took us forever to find a patch of sand to call our own . <p> But , oh it was glorious . I love the beach . It 's my zen and my dream , although admittedly , having to keep both eyes on an active 2.5 year old meant a lot less zen than I 'm used to . <p> It was Kaylin 's third time , and she loved it . The first two were in January this year , during our trip to California , where she repeatedly refused to step on the sand and had to be carried a lot . <p> This time , she happily played at the water 's edge , and even dipped both feet into the sea , probably because she 's older now , but more likely because she was playing with a friend . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always say , do n't give up on your dreams . Go after what you want , because dreams do come true ? <p> Well , nobody wants to be the jerk that breaks the bad news : Not all dreams come true . Sometimes , no matter how hard you try , you just do n't have what it takes . Go watch American Idol . <p> So why are we encouraged to keep on dreaming ? In the cases of the truly hopeless , is n't it even a little cruel ? <p> I 've been thinking about this , as I reach a point in my life where certain things are out of my reach , and I come to terms with the fact that not all my wishes and dreams will come true . <p> What I want to be and who I really am are n't necessarily the same thing . I 'd like to walk with the confidence of a Victoria 's Secret Angel , and exude the charisma and easygoing charm of an A-list movie star , but the reality is I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to change that . <p> Also different : What I want to achieve and what I actually can achieve . Hard work alone does n't guarantee success . So many other things come into play , such as timing , talent , opportunity , location ... <p> For example , 55-year-old The Voice contestant Yolanda Barber , who has what Rolling Stone called one of the best voices the show has ever had on , but she could n't get a coach to turn around because she did n't fit the target demographic : <p> Read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell . Life is unfair sometimes . So why do we keep on dreaming even when we know our dreams probably wo n't come true ? Should we keep on dreaming ? <p> My answer is yes . Because we do n't know what the future holds . Not for myself , not for anybody . <p> Dreaming makes us feel alive and gives us hope . It makes us want to better ourselves , motivates us to work harder , and gives us something to strive towards . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our passions , and because I 'm lucky enough to get to do something I love for a living , it also reminds me to count my blessings . <p> As for my other aspirations , well , I plan to continue singing and dancing around the house , pretending to run , and imagining I can paint . A girl can ... dream . <p> Because I 'm geeky that way , a friend and I spent an hour of our lives last Saturday night learning how to do this cup thingy that Anna Kendrick showed David Letterman . It took up way too much focus and concentration , but we finally got it . I figured I 'd never be coordinated enough to sing while doing it , so I went to bed . <p> The next day , I picked up a plastic cup to see if I remembered the trick . And wonder of wonders , not only did I still know it , I was good . And ... this is the part that surprised me the most , I could sing at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still . It was something I totally could not do if my life had depended on it the night before . <p> Turns out , the best way to master a new skill is to learn the basics , practise your butt off for a while , and then sleep on it to let everything sink in . I never knew that ! <p> I could n't resist : I put both hands in the air and announced to my living room , " I am awesome ! I rock ! " before doing a little dance . Kaylin looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and derision in her eyes , as if to say , " I bang cups around all the time and you do n't see me reacting this way . " <p> Inspiring on so many levels . Every time Barack Obama takes the podium , it 's like he can move mountains . In 2008 , I rooted for him because I love an underdog , and a smart man in a suit , and a man who speaks well , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted for him because I believe he 's a genuinely good and kind man , and the world needs more of those in leadership . Also , he 's married to one of the most awesome women in the world , and we definitely need more Michelle Obamas too . Oh , happy day ! <p> Kaylin is finally old enough for activities like art &; craft , and I for one am overly excited . As a kid , I loved shows like Art Attack , and I 've been looking forward to doing art with Kaylin since she was born . So here we are -- her very first time " playing " with glue and bits of paper . <p> I drew the butterfly on the back of a piece of used A4 paper , and cut up small pieces of coloured paper so Kaylin could glue them on . And then , because it looked like so much fun , I ended up doing a bit of gluing myself . As you can see , Kaylin 's two-year-old attention span did n't last very long . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write her name . Ta-da ! <p> Every December , I think about the year that has passed and what I want to focus on in the coming year . A sort of theme for the year , if you will . This year , I think I 've found my theme for 2013 even though it 's only November . 2013 will be my Year of Creative Pursuits . <p> I want to write ( more ) and read ( more ) and paint and sing and play the piano and do craft ... basically , anything vaguely arty and creative that piques my interest . I 'm sure it sounds a lot cooler in my head without the interruptions of life and work and motherhood , but we 'll see . <p> Last month , in a fit of enthusiasm , I actually went out and bought canvases , acrylic paints and brushes . I 'm pretty excited to see what happens when I get around to using them . <p> Here 's a habit I 've picked up recently . Ca n't yet decide whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the judge ) . Throughout the day , I find me asking myself : Is this what I really want to do ? What do I want to do ? <p> For a borderline approval whore , this is a positive sign . It means I 'm starting to care less about what other people think , and caring more about what I want . The focus is shifting -- to me . It 's something I 've been hoping to do for a while , and hurray , out of the blue , my unconscious seems to think it 's finally the moment . <p> This is Kaylin 's first ever McDonald 's meal . Or Mackers , as I also call it . Does n't she look pleased ? Considering she 's already 2.5 years old , I think I held off her introduction to fast food pretty well . I 'm not a big Mackers person myself , but the lure of the drive-thru was just too great on this day . <p> Actually , now that I come to think of it , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped a quarter mug of coffee onto my Macbook Pro . YES , SHE DID . It was completely unintentional ; I do n't think she realised what had happened until she saw the mess . And then she instantly knew she had just done A VERY BAD THING . ( My ensuing panic and commendable attempts at not swearing may have helped . ) <p> With her usual impeccable timing that she must surely have inherited from me , she 'd spilled the coffee just minutes before we were due to leave the house for a work meeting . So I had to call and say I was going to be late , and frantically wipe up coffee/hold the laptop upside down while rivulets of caffeine lazily oozed from between the keys/open up the back cover/wipe some more coffee ... you get the idea . <p> I eventually left my laptop upside down and opened up so hopefully it would dry out , and left for my meeting . By the time we were done , Kaylin was so drowsy she fell asleep in the car on the way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do for lunch . <p> As for my laptop , it would n't turn on when I got back , or the next day , or the next . Not too surprising . My habit of backing up my work regularly meant I was n't freaking out over the potential loss of data , only over the seemingly certain expenditure of buying a new Macbook Pro . When the keyboard started to smell bad , I imagined the insides rotting from the coffee , and was convinced it was doomed . <p> And then , on the fourth day , hope ! I brought the laptop to an Apple Service Center and they later contacted me to say that I had to replace the top case for about RM630 ( excluding labour charges ) , BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FINE . I had never been so happy to fork out this much money in my life ( the cost of a brand new Macbook Pro certainly put things into perspective ) . <p> Five days later , I got it back , and everything was exactly as it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungraciously reminding Kaylin of her mistake . From now on , I 'm implementing a one-foot no-liquids 
##1066052 <h> Monday , November 26 , 2012 <p> Simon says : - I read this today from Swimsmooth and it hit a chord , I 've lost count the number of times I 've heard people say they ca n't swim , or ca n't improve their swim or some similar variance . I 'm not always a " believer " myself but I keep trying to reset those doubt and get better - you should too ( unless youre in my age-group of course haha ) . <p> When Louise Sawyer said " you get what you settle for " she was talking about relationships . But the same thing is true for your education , your career and also your swimming . <p> While swimming is n't as important as our relationships , it 's saddening to see someone you care about settle for less than they deserve because they do n't believe they can be better . <p> If you 've read our new book , you 'll have heard us talk about how an eleven year old can be such a fast swimmer despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons they can do that is that kids do n't place limitations on themselves , every time they go to the pool they walk out excitedly on to the poolside with a clear head , jump in the water , go for it and see what they can do . <p> Maybe you 've settled because of your age , your inexperience , your talent , your training time , your gender or your height . Are you sure the barriers you feel are not entirely self imposed ? Take a leaf from that eleven year old 's book : enjoy every moment , work hard , keep an open mind and believe you will become a better swimmer ... <p> 2 best friends graduated from medical school at the same time and decided that , in spite of two different specialties , they would open a practice together to share office space and personnel . Dr. Smith was the psychiatrist and Dr. Jones was the proctologist . <p> They put up a sign reading : " Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones : Hysterias and Posteriors " . The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , the docs changed it to read : " Schizoids and Hemorrhoids " . This was also not acceptable , so they again changed the sign . <p> " Catatonics and High Colonics " -- No go . <p> Next , they tried " Manic Depressives and Anal Retentives " -- thumbs down again . Then came " Minds and Behinds " -- still no good . <p> Shilpa had a bit of a panic this morning as her Blackberry rebooted and all of her new contacts and all of her photos were missing . I said not a problem I 'm sure you back it up and sync it with your PC regularly like I 've told you so many times ... A troubled look came over her face and she said " Yes , 8 months ago " Whahahahahahaha . Fortunately I got all the data and photos back without much problem but it just goes to show the power of backing up . That reminded me of a joke I heard some years ago ... One day , Jesus and the Devil were having a discussion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So God sat them down at two computers , one each , and told them to type up an article written on a piece of paper . The first to complete the typing would win . <p> Anyway , both Jesus and the Devil were typing away frantically , when there was a power cut and both computers switched off . Their typing work had disappeared from the two screens . <p> When the power was restored , and the computers re-booted , Jesus 's work re-appeared on his screen , but the Devil could get nothing back and had lost all his work . So Jesus was declared the winner . The Devil complained bitterly to God saying that it was n't fair at all and demanded a rematch , but God said , <h> Monday , October 08 , 2012 <h> Simon says : - <h> I have just read this open letter on Facebook , I 'm speechless and absolutely amazed . Surely there has to be another side to this story or maybe it 's just the case that the wheels turn a little slower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Malaysian Triathlon Federation guys ( not yet anyway ) , I know that they are good people and I have always thought that they have their hearts in the right place . I shall email this link to them and ask them to comment on it . I shall then publish their responses to give a balanced side of the story . <h> Steve Lumley is a world class coach and we are privileged to have him here helping us " Weekend Warriors " out but also working with the grass routes of Malaysian traithletes to get them on to the world stage . He needs our support and that of the Malaysian Traithlon Federation . So come on Traithlon community of Malaysia . Leave your comments of support for up and coming Malaysian triathletes competing and representing your country . <h> Let 's keep everything positive for now , there 's a time and a place to force change but in the meantime we owe it to the guys that represent TRIAM to put their side across . <h> So again , no reason to prevent entry or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay their own costs . Again , no reasons for TRIAM to prevent them racing . <h> No explanation or reason has been forthcoming for this effective ban . <h> A reason has been given for the refusal to allow the senior athlete from Malaysia to enter the senior race in Hong Kong . TRIAM is on record as stating that this because he did n't race when selected to race for Malaysia in 2010 ( he actually could n't afford to travel to race ) . Do TRIAM see it as appropriate to punish an athlete due to his economic circumstances or that of his family ? <h> Also , if not racing in 2010 is the real reason for banning him , why was he selected for the Asian Championships in 2012 ? Is there another reason he is banned ? <h> TRIAM has received several requests from a junior athlete who is eligible to be entered onto the wait list for the JUNIOR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS . <h> It appears that this has not been done , again without explanation . <h> TRIAM is supposed to be the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia . It takes less time and effort to actually enter athletes into races than to avoid doing so and costs TRIAM nothing . <h> Friday , September 21 , 2012 <p> Simon says : - Never was a truer word said ! Another expression that comes to mind that really sums this up is " You lose weight in the kitchen not in the *gym ! " *Replace " gym " with bike , pool , treadmill etc ... The point is that exercise supports the weight loss mentality but the weight is lost by the decisions you make in what you put in your mouth ! <h> Wednesday , September 19 , 2012 <h> Wednesday , September 05 , 2012 <p> Challenge Roth was my 21st Ironman ( sue me WTC ) . I had really struggled to get ready for this one having given my all in March at Ironman Melbourne . I was mentally drained and having gone into IMMelbourne carrying a couple of injuries I was really finding it difficult to train let alone recover from the injuries . <p> So I turned up in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Do n't get me wrong , I was going to nail myself to the wall but I was n't going to destroy myself and end up miserable . <p> On a family note , Sid and Seb were still at school so Shilpa decided not to come as she has had enough Ironman spectating to last a life time . My Mum and Dad drove over from the UK though and my sister , Angela , husband , Markus and 3 out of 4 of her kids , Jan , Nico and Sven , came too from their home in the Black Forest , Germany . <p> The race is a bit fragmented as the swim is in a shipping canal but T1 and T2 are separate locations . Consequently the logistics are a bit tricky so I was very grateful to have Sam on hand who 'd done the race two years before . <p> Come race day rain was forecast for 2pm and it was clear that the wind was going to play a large factor on the bike . As it turned out no rain materialised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . <p> Pre-Race All good and very efficient , the usual German way . I was set up in no time and went in search of the portaloos for my 4th " sit-down " of the morning . As I got into a portaloo line I noticed that the guy at the front looked familiar ... " Bryan " I yelled . <p> Bryan Payne from Canada had said he 'd do this race and on that basis and the fact that Sam was doing it was enough for me to enter . Unfortunately Bryan was staying miles from where we were and together with on-line work commitments and keeping the family happy we did n't get to meet up throughout the whole event except for this fated moment . <p> My wave start was straight after the pros and Bryan was in a wave 30 minutes later . We had a great chat and a catch up and wished each other the best but I had to head to the water pretty sharpish . The downside to this is that I could n't pull off his goggles as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to draft off me haha . <p> I pushed my way through the gate to get a decent warm up at the same time as the pros . Unfortunately this triggered my chip and added an extra 10 minutes to my finish time as the timing system assumed that I started with the pro wave . It was all sorted out after the race but not in time to stop Bryan posting all sorts of abuse and gloating . Talk about having to eat humble pie , in the end the poor bloke got beat by an almighty 9 seconds and he 's backpedalling to this day . I reckon I 've got a few years mileage on this one . haha <p> SWIM 1:04:47 <p> The gun went , my wave was probably 200 athletes but I was surprised how much I got beaten up and got the biggest kick to the goggles I 've ever had . Ouch ! The swim was up and down the canal , difficult to go too far off course but still not as straightforward as I 'd hoped with buoys a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable swim although I might have hoped for a slightly quicker time as swimming had not been affected by injury and I 'd not missed any swim sessions . Still a solid time nonetheless . <p> This was a bit of a rude awakening . I was not happy throughout the bike , the wind was definitely a factor for me as we really do n't get much in Malaysia , not often anyway and certainly not consistently . On top of that I just was n't enjoying it and had some very very dark moments which I usually reserve for the run haha . <p> As I was in the first age-group wave there were very few other riders around me . At one point near halfway I saw an idiot in a car trying to squeeze onto the course next to a marshal truck with the marshals telling him in no uncertain terms not to . I kept well out of the way and continued up the road in the emergency lane . It took me about 4k to realise that I 'd not seen another competitor for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't in the race . I stopped and waited but no one in the race came past - SH*T ! Maybe I should have turned at the truck . I rode back , very angry and very unhappy . Sure enough there was a turn I should have taken . I was n't near enough to any other bikes to naturally follow them and the incident with the car had kept my focus on that rather than a turn I should have taken . Oh well ay ! Get on with it I thought . Needless to say the dark thoughts and moments now got a little bit darker and lasted a little bit longer . <p> On the bright side there is one hill on the course that we do twice , it is about 500m longer , quite steep although not a big issue but it slows you down to a grind and the crowds there are ten deep and they literally part in front of you as you ride through them . It 's just like you see in the Tour de France . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly grin on your face . WICKED ! <p> I reckon I lost about 15 minutes on the bike detour but even so the time was rubbish by my standards even despite the wind . We 'll put that down to burn out and a bad day at the office . Gladys was wonderful though despite her injury and I ca n't blame her at all . <p> T2 3:47 T2 was somewhat less smooth than T1 , I was struggling to walk for a start , I 'd got very stiff during the ride . Not too bad though and was soon set up for the run . <p> RUN 4:05:16 <p> I was hoping for a sub 4 hour run but literally every stride of the entire run was dogged with a hamstring pain in my right leg . Mentally I could deal with it but mechanically it was shortening my stride and each stride was firing more slowly than had I been running normally . By kilometre 6 I was walking through the aid stations but they were small stations so the walks were short too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people called it boring I loved it . We were shaded from the sun , it was pancake flat and just beautiful surroundings . At either end we ran through little villages with huge support , it was wonderful ( despite the pain ) . <p> I saw Bryan as I was heading back from the first turnaround and I reckoned I had a 40 minute lead over him , so with the wave start about 10 minutes in reality . He was moving really fast though . Stay focused I thought . <p> At about 20k some crazy German guy was running next to me chatting away as if I knew him ... it was Jens . A great friend from KL who 'd been moved back to Germany by his company . It was a real inspiration and a great lift to see him . <p> After that it was back to the grind and just trying to keep it together . At the other end of the canal you turn off and go and do an out and back to a village and then it 's back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Bryan again but he did n't see or hear me this time . He ran down the slope , to the aid station , did n't break stride , grabbed a drink and tore off . He literally did n't lose a second . OMFG , he 's definitely catching me big time , rather than slugging out the last 12 painful kilometres I need to pick up the pace ... this is gon na hurt ... and it did . <p> Somehow , I ran the whole thing bar very short walks through the aid stations . The finish was brilliant , massive crowds and beer ( albeit no-alcoholic ) on tap and free as soon as you crossed the line . <p> I eventually met up with Sam and Carmen but somehow missed Bryan . I caught up with my sister and family before they had to drive home ( work the next morning , so cool of them to come , thanks guys ) . I saw my mum too , unfortunately my dad was super sick ( pneumonia that he caught somehow on the drive over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All in all a brilliant race that I reckon is one of the best I 've done albeit I 'd have enjoyed it more had I been fresh rather than semi-burnt out . So yes I would highly recommend it although be prepared for the logistical difficulties the different transition locations present , especially after the race when you 're tired and just want to get your stuff your bike and get home . <p> FINISHING TIME 10:46:34 <p> POSTSCRIPT Bryan has taken a bashing since the race , he thought he 'd won , blogged about it , bragged about it , laughed at me about it and then put me back in my box when I suggested the results might be wrong . When eventually things were sorted and the official results posted the shoe was on the other foot ... now being a quiet , demure , quiet kind of a guy ... ( oops no , that 's someone else ) ... I am proud to say I have been ( and will continue to ) milking my 9 SECOND victory . <p> 10 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious 9 Seconds . As some of you may know my new Twitter name is now " 9 SECONDS " ... Bryan has done his best to be a good egg about it but you can see that it 's eating away at him . In the end he even got his girlfriend of 20 years to post this little video . Nice to see she 's a good sport but Bryan you got to let this go buddy . Do n't let it upset you . I solemnly promise that if you let it go that I will too ( in about 10 years Whahahahahahaha ) . <h> Friday , August 17 , 2012 <p> My dad 's 80th birthday a few days ago . He just survived a scary attack of pneumonia and is now back on his feet and thinking about running again . Happy birthday dad , you put many a younger man to shame . <h> Wednesday , June 27 , 2012 <h> Monday , June 25 , 2012 <p> It was Sid 's turn to amaze his Dad this time with his piano recital at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ability they 've achieved , do n't forget he 's only 6yo . He and Seb have more musical ability in their little fingers than I have achieved in my whole life . <p> Listen and decide for yourselves but this proud Dad scores straight 10s for Sid 's performance . <p> A senior citizen bought a brand new BMW Z4 convertible and drove it out of the salesroom . Taking off down the motorway , he floored it to 120mph ; enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left . <p> " Amazing ! " he thought as he flew down the M4 , enjoying pushing the pedal to the metal even more . Looking in his rear view mirror , he saw a police car behind him , blue lights flashing and siren blaring . <p> " I can get away from him - no problem ! " thought the elderly nutcase as he floored it to 140mph , then 150 then 160 . Suddenly , he thought , " What on earth am I doing ? I 'm too old for this nonsense ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and waited for the police car to catch up with him . <p> Pulling in behind him , the police officer walked up the driver 's side of the BMW , looked at his watch and said , " Sir , my shift ends in 10 minutes . Today is Friday and I 'm taking off for the weekend . If you can give me a reason why you were speeding that I 've never heard before , I 'll let you go . " <p> The old man , looked very seriously at the policeman and replied , " Years ago my wife ran off with a policeman . I thought you were bringing her back . " <h> Friday , June 22 , 2012 <p> Imagine walking into a courtroom as the defendant in a lawsuit . The prosecuting attorney reads the charges against you citing nothing more than the testimony of anonymous witnesses as evidence . You object , claiming this is unjust ! To your surprise the prosecutor walks to the judge 's bench , puts on a judge 's robe and denies your motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then takes out his cell phone and calls three of his friends to serve on your " independent " jury . <p> This fictitious , but obviously unjust situation is incredibly similar to the case Lance Armstrong currently faces from the United States Anti-doping Agency and its CEO Travis T. Tygart . <p> A similar investigation led by the United States Department of Justice concluded in February , 2012 . After almost two years of investigation , and millions of US tax dollars spent researching Armstrong 's past , the USDOJ decided there was n't enough evidence to continue the investigation . So is this just another branch of the Federal government wasting millions of more tax dollars on the same investigation ? <p> No , despite the officially sounding name , it turns out the " United States Anti-doping Agency is not a part of the federal government . Although it receives almost 90 percent of its funding from the federal grants , the USADA is a government program masquerading as a non-profit organization . This non-profit status allows it to investigate and prosecute athletes without affording them the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This status also allows it to prosecute athletes with a lower burden of proof than the " beyond a reasonable doubt " standard that would have been required in the previous investigation by the USDOJ . Finally , it allows a situation where the same man , Mr. Travis T. Tygart is allowed to serve as Prosecutor , Jury and Judge in the investigation of Lance Armstrong . <p> PROSECUTOR : Tygart initiated the charges . <p> On June 12 , 2012 , Travis Tygart and his staff at the USADA sent a letter to Armstrong accusing him of violating anti-doping rules . As evidence of this violation , Mr. Tygart and his staff were only able to cite previous drug tests that Armstrong had passed and the testimony of anonymous witnesses . <p> In the letter , Mr. Tygart informs Armstrong that he has 10 days to submit evidence to a Review Board that will determine if there is " sufficient evidence of doping " to continue with a full hearing . In his defense , Armstrong can only offer written materials to the Review Board . He will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have allegedly testified against him . <p> JURY : Tygart gets to hand pick the Review Board <p> The " Review Board " will decide whether charges should be brought against Armstrong from the USADA , and whether the case shall go to a full arbitration hearing . Who serves on this review Board ? According to USADA protocol 11(b) The independent " review board " shall be appointed by the USADA 's CEO . You read that correctly , Mr. Tygart is allowed to handpick the individuals that serve as the " Jury " , and decide if these charges should move forward . If an athlete had failed a drug test and the board was looking at objective evidence this process might make sense ; however , Armstrong has never failed a drug test . All of the evidence in this case is subjective . Mr. Tygart has allegedly caught several other cyclists doping , and offered them immunity in exchange for their testimony against Lance . Should n't the credibility of such a witness be at least considered ? Well , let 's assume that Mr. Tygart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board " find enough evidence to move the investigation forward , what happens next ? <p> JUDGE : Tygart and USADA staff recommends sanction <p> Under the Applicable rules , Travis Tygart and his staff at the USADA , will recommend a sanction that will be imposed which may include up to a lifetime of ineligibility from sport . Finally , if Armstrong disagrees with the sanction imposed on him by Mr. Tygart , he can appeal for a full arbitration hearing . <p> USADA lacks internal and external controls <p> If Mr. Tygart and staff have the power it appears , what are the internal and external controls at USADA ? What would restrict an overly ambitious CEO with an " axe to grind ? " According to USADA bylaws , the organization has a very small ten member board of directors . The current director 's are apparently impressed with Tygart and his " Tygarthian " prosecution style of accusing first and looking for evidence later . Unless Mr. Tygart received a pay cut last year , he 's been paid a total of over $1.2 million in compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spokesperson at the USADA did respond to my e-mail , but she declined to comment whether Tygart 's bonuses were tied to finding a certain number of athletes or a particularly high profile athlete guilty of doping . <p> So , how are the USADA 's directors chosen ? Although the Bylaws allow other organizations to nominate potential directors , the USADA Board essentially has the power to elect their own replacements . This could ensure that only directors sympathetic to the Tygart are ever elected , and removes the accountability that a non-profit board should provide . <p> Finally , there 's the office of National Drug Control Policy . This is the branch of the Federal government that funds the USADA $10 million a year of federal tax dollars to operate . According to legal counsel for the NDCP office , the $10 million grant is an " unsupervised non-competitive " grant . So , Tygart and staff are guaranteed $10 million a year in funding from the Federal government , but must answer to no one . <p> MY VERDICT <p> Do I think Mr. Tygart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion is yes , but I also think actions sometime speak louder than words . The 2012 London Olympic Games are a little more than a month away . Mr. Tygart and his staff are responsible for testing all US athletes headed to the games . However , he has chosen to use the majority of his offices resources investigating whether a retired cyclist doped 16 years ago . <p> The investigation and sanctioning process at the USADA is unconscionable . The partiality of the prosecutor , the lack of due process for the accused , and the lack of an independent fact finder are completely at odds with our American system of justice and fairness . <p> In the words of Heinlein , " To give a man power without accountability is to establish a tyrant . " <p> Simon says : - <p> I do n't think I need to say anything do I ? Did Lance dope ? I do n't know , there 's a lot of smoke and as they say , there 's no smoke without fire . However , I 'm passionate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> I 've also got to say that I 'm a bit biased as I , like so many people in the world , want desperately to see Lance at Kona this year . Does such a desire justify letting a guilty man race ? No ! BUT he has n't ever been found guilty .

##1079051 <h> Marimo Balls <p> Marimo literally means seaweed ball . It is a species of filamentous green algae that grow into large green balls with a velvet like appearance , also known as Cladophora ball , Lake ball , and , in some cases Moss Balls . <p> There are three forms of Marimo ; epilithic which is found growing on the shaded side of the rocks , free-floating filaments that grow as small tufts of unattached filaments sometimes forming a soft carpet on muddy lake bottoms , and a third form that takes the ball shape , where the algae grows in balls of densely packed algal filaments that radiate out from the center . <p> Marimo is native to Akan Lake in Japan . It was declared to be a national treasure of Japan in 1921 and people from all over the country gathered these balls in glass jars to take home as keepsakes , perhaps to bring luck , or just because they plain looked good as a centerpiece on the table at home . It is said that taking excellent care of the balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after a hydro-electric plant was built on the Akan river , the river was dammed and as a result water level in the lake fell dramatically , which in turn had some rather undesirable effects on the local ecosystem . <p> Dead and decaying Marimo began littering the shores of Lake Akan . Because of the selling of individual Marimo as souvenirs and the damming of the Akan river , the populations of Marimo balls declined rapidly . Environmentalists launched a campaign in efforts to try and protect the Marimo of Lake Akan and an appeal was made to the people of Japan to return their Marimo souvenirs . The people responded and great numbers of the Marimo were returned to their natural environment in the lake . People were so overwhelmed by the support received that they held a festival in appreciation of the selfless act . On October 7 , 1950 the first of the annual Marimo Festivals was celebrated at Lake Akan . <p> Marimo algae balls have been observed growing in some other lakes in Japan and freshwater ponds in European countries , but only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly spherically shaped . They grow to a diameter of 25 centimeters or 10 inches at maximum . <p> Marimo Balls exhibit a number of interesting behaviors , including rising and sinking in a water column , responding to light , rolling around and dumping the collecting sediment from their surfaces . They can be seen rotating positions with other Marimo on different levels of the lake bottom . This phenomenon of movement allows them to be found at deeper depths than stationary plants . It also gives the appearance that Marimo Balls could even be sentient beings , and as such as much revered . <p> Marimo balls are just one of the latest frenzied fads to hit the aquatic plant hobby . They are good for controlling algae since they out-compete other algae species for nutrients , thus starving others and they are relatively easy to cultivate as it requires little space and no special care . It does not require fertilizing and does not need sunlight . It just needs the moss to be rinsed off and gentle tapping with your fingers to keep it in perfect spherical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All types of fish are able to live with Marimo . Algae eaters will leave it alone because the plant material is tough and tangled making it difficult for them to eat . So , in a nutshell , purchase toss in , and away you go . <p> Domesticated marimo can grow in tap water at room temperature as long as the water is changed every one or two weeks . The water should be changed more frequently in the summer and less often in the winter months . The marimo may be refrigerated during hot weather ( above 25C ) , but it does not survive freezing temperatures . <p> A Marimo is sometimes mistaken for an animal in the aquarium because of its movement , which is another reason for the interest . Furthermore , it has a rather long life span . The largest Marimo ball is known to have lived for over 100 years . So by cultivating the algae balls under the right conditions , you could lovingly pass down a Marimo through a couple of generations , from grandparents to a grandson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor would most likely be due to legend . There once was a daughter of a chief of an important tribe living on the banks of Lake Akan , who fell in love with a commoner . Their relationship met with the opposition of her parents . In order to be together , they ran away , metamorphosed into Marimo and lived happily ever after . Because of this myth , the Marimo has become known as the " love plant " in Japan . <p> Unfortunately , the population of Marimo balls continues to dwindle . Ongoing research is being carried out now to try to save or recreate this unusual form of algae . There have been no breakthroughs . <p> All types of fish are able to live with Marimo . Algae eaters will leave it alone because the plant material is tough and tangled making it difficult for them to eat . <p> Marimo tend to be slow growing in aquariums , possibly due to the conditions . Water currents in an aquarium is not as fast moving as those found in larger bodies of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to literally take them apart , exposing all of the individual algae strings . The strings in the center of the ball are inert until they are exposed to light . These strings have the ability to rejuvenate within 4-6 hours of coming in contact with light . Marimo balls in their natural habitat will naturally break apart as they get larger . <p> The most difficult part of the propagation is rolling the individual strings back into a ball . Gently rolling the strings in the palm of your hand takes patience and a lot of time . A better solution is to place the new Marimo ball into a round container such as

##1083752 <h> KOREA <h> The Yi Dynasty <h> GENEALOGY <p> The Choson Dynasty of the Yi clan established its dominion over Korea from 1392 . The country was unified and a long period of development and cultural renaissance ensued . The reign of King Se-jong witnessed a remarkable flowering of culture . A new alphabet and writing system invented , astronomical instruments assembled , music and rituals reformed and expanded , printing invented and a whole new Confucian social system based on harmony between mankind and nature established . This flourishing society soon attracted the attention of powerful neighbours . The Japanese invaded several times during the 1580s and 1590s , taking away many prisoners , but who ultimately transformed Japanese culture . The rise of the Manchu power in the early seventeenth century could not be resisted . Korea became a vassal state in 1637 . Although the first contact with Europeans had been established by Portuguese Jesuits in 1594 , the English in 1614 and the Dutch in 1653 , the country remained virtually closed until the nineteenth century . By the 1860 's the world powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of arms . The Japanese became the most influential foreign power , particularly after their defeat of China in 1894 . King Ko-jong proclaimed his independence from China , turning Korea into the Empire of the Han in 1897 . But this independence was short-lived as the country came under increasing Japanese domination . Frequently resorting to assassination or poisoning members of the Imperial family and influential officials who opposed them . Defeat of Russia in 1905 removed the only counterweight against them . They forced the abdication of the independent minded Emperor and proclaimed a protectorate in 1907 . In 1910 even this fiction was terminated and the country fully annexed into the Empire of Japan . Thereafter , the Imperial family was incorporated within the Japanese Imperial system . As an instrument of policy several younger members if the family were removed to Japan to be educated and to contract arranged marriages with highborn Japanese ladies . <p> American and Russian troops freed Korea from the Japanese at the end of the Second World War . Separate republics were eventually established in the North and South of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North , under the influence of the Soviet and later Chinese Communist regimes . Members of the Royal family who had settled in Japan lost their princely status as a consequence of the US inspired constitution of 1947 . The first republican government of South Korea remained hostile to the Yi family . Ironically , the first President , the authoritarian Syngman Rhee Yi Sung-man was himself a descendant of Prince Hyo-nyong , second son of the third King , T'ae-jong . The government that toppled him from power encouraged the surviving members of the Imperial family to return from Japan in 1960 , placing several palaces and residences at their disposal . The Crown Prince was offered the post of Ambassador in London but turned it down due to ill health . He finally returned to Korea in 1963 , but suffered a severe stroke as his aircraft touched down at Seoul .

##1088050 <h> It Turns Out Size Really Does Matter <p> The female orgasm has caused much wonders and also worries since men began trying to understand the needs of a woman . Well buddy , it 's been proven size has a lot to do with it . <p> Based on a new study by a psychologist at the University of the West of Scotland , it would seem that size does matter after all . But only for some women , and for certain types of orgasms . <p> Women who reportedly have frequent vaginal orgasms compared to other women are said to be able to climax more easily when their partners have larger penises . While ladies who prefer the conventional penile-vaginal sex over other types of hanky-panky are also found to ' come ' easily . <p> For the study , the 323 participants were asked to recall past sexual encounters and recent sex habits including the importance of penile-vaginal intercourse and other sex acts to them . These ladies were also asked to define penis lengths and whether size influenced their ability to orgasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.9 cm ) or US dollar bill ( 15.5 cm ) . <p> It was found that 160 of the women had enough sexual partners to " compare " size experiences . Out of the lot , 33.8 percent said they preferred longer-than-average penises , 60 percent said size made no difference and 6.3 percent said longer was actually less pleasurable than shorter . <p> To support the hypothesis that size matters , researchers found that women who reported the highest number of vaginal orgasms in the past month were more likely to say that longer was better . <p> The study may have involved just a very small percentage of test subjects -- 323 women -- the findings are interesting nevertheless . It may shed some light on the mysteries surrounding female orgasms . For years , scientists have gone back and forth trying to establish whether there is a difference between vaginal and clitoral orgasms . <p> It 's a fact that stimulation of different area , vagina or clitoris , activates different brain regions and sensations but when it comes down to it , imagination and personal preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor emerita at Rutgers University is contesting the latest findings .

##1840250 <h> Commitment Phobia ; How to make your man commit <p> Wikipedia tells us that the term commitmentphobia was first coined in the popular self-help book Men Who Ca n't Love in 1987 . Following criticism of the perceived sexist idea that only men were commitmentphobic , the authors provided a more gender balanced model of commitmentphobia in a later work , He 's Scared , She 's Scared . <p> Men are famous for being able to date a few women for years without settling down . Worse still is the perpetually monogamous bachelor which every woman ca n't help but want to settle down with , usually causing the him to flee even further . One such a friend broke up with his lovely girlfriend who invited him to go to her friend 's wedding ! <p> Commitment can be as simple as wanting him to date you exclusively or as complex as planning for your ideal wedding . <p> So , if you have spotted the man of your dreams and you 're the marrying kind , how do you lock him down without locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space <p> Do n't suffocate him by bringing it up all the time . Just enjoy the moments . Do not also spoil moments by trying to sieze romantic ones and forcing him into a proposal or an uttering of commitment . It is as irritating as him using romantic moments to tell you how you should wear sexy lingerie more often or giving you un-welcomed fashion tips . <p> 2 . Timing <p> Timing as they say , is everything , and sometimes , the only thing . <p> A friend was trying to get a just-divorced man to date her exclusively , she was one of few women he was seeing . You may be asking if she is blind , stupid or both , but women get that way when they are in love . She kept hinting to him and eventually of course he just stopped calling her . Space and timing . <p> If you 've been dating him for just under two years , it may still be a bit premature to constantly bring up the issue . You should and can test water about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your man . If he is non-committal on the relationship , you should make mental notes and not ignore it . It may come back to bite you a few years down the line . <p> If you 've been dating for quite a number of years and want him to drop the question , you should be at ease enough to bring it up . If he ca n't commit to even talking about commitment , prepare yourself to leave and do n't look back . If he is not comfortable enough to talk about your future together , those are alarm bells that can not be ignored . Do n't try to convince yourself that he will eventually come to . Try the next step soon after . <p> 3 . Make him want you <p> Right after he displays his lack of commitment , you need to immediately send subtle messages that you mean business , instead of talking your way into his heart and brains . Start to distance yourself and get occupied with other things , take a holiday without him , exercise , pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while dating him , hang out with supportive friends who know what is going on . <p> See less of him , make him wonder if he has distanced you . If he is sensible and REALLY wants you , he 'll come right back . However , if he just misses the idea of you , comes back and still not sober up to reality by offering a word of commitment , get the hint woman . Stop digging past the 6 feet relationship mark ! <p> 4 . Stop giving in and stop getting too comfortable ! <p> Once you mould yourselves into a routine and play happily married couple without him popping the question for years , he will happily play boyfriend until eternity . Problems will start to arise when you want to change your Facebook status and start to give him ideas . Such situations could be deal breakers in a relationship . The longer you stay , the deeper the pain , since firm roots have been planted . <p> If he keeps telling you he is still young , or needs to make himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingo , it probably means his job , business , or personal time is more important . You do n't feature as yet , and may not . So before you overly commit to something which like milk , has an expiry date , you may want to check the labels and goods . <p> 5 . Be clear about your intentions right from the start . <p> If you 're in it for the long run , make it clear right from the start . I knew a couple who dated after the girl was freshly out of a relationship and the guy going from one to another . They both wanted to have fun and knew what they were in for . The problem is that the girl fell in love and eventually wanted more . They were good together in fun land for quite a number of years , but he bolted the moment she wanted more . She married soon after the breakup as she knew what she wanted . <p> 6 . Chill babe <p> Most of us would have watched a sitcom or movie where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ... " and before he can finish his sentence , she screams out " Yes ! ! " ? <p> Please do n't be her and carry the when-will-he-propose look on your face everywhere you go . It does n't match with anything you wear , trust me . <p> Sometimes women get so caught up in the objective of wanting to get married that they miss the roses on the path towards the aisle . Enjoy the relationship , perhaps you may discover things in your boyfriend that make you thank heavens or Planet Venus that you never got to marry him .

We present yet another argument . <p> Facebook has definitely paved the way for self expression that transcends bounds both geographical and demographical . In recent light of the Invisible Children 's plight to make Joseph Kony famous , we see again the power of social media moving the masses with such great momentum you 'd think the world would be ready to storm into Uganda at the sound of a war horn . <p> But disregard the worldwide , blockbuster sensationals -- what does social media do to the people using it ?

Especially if they ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . We know how antisocial children can become when they 're given the liberty to spend all their time in virtual reality -- social skills are unable to develop and they lose the ability to communicate effectively in real-life situations . Studies have also shown that many of these teens develop narcissism and can be
