I 'm going to move to somewhere cold like that ' cze I wan na buy and wear the winter-clothes ! ! ! ! ! : D <p> Just arrived in Xiamen after the 4hours ' flight . <p> Xiamen is actually WAY MORE pleasant than I thought , I was extremely surprised by the level of cleanliness , volume of traffic on the roads and the brightness of streetlights . It certainly beats KL ( m'sia ) in these aspects ! <p> Their ' Orchard Road ' , called " Zhong Shang Lu " <p> In fact Xiamen has a pretty efficient public transport system ! ! ! Their special economic zones after Tiananmen incident ( studied this in college HAHA ) encouraged a lot of foreign investments so the entire city is also very developed . Its actually China 's second best city to live in ! ! <p> The worse thing I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes me wan na shriek at how unhygienic that is T.T <p> Mian xian with TWO EGGS . Chinese ' tradition . <p> IS THIS SORREL LEAVES ? ! ! ! I miss Australia : DD <p> I really like this Popiah . Its different from Singapore 's one because its less moist ! So it holds the shape very well tgthr w the delicious filling : ) <p> Headed back to rest after being welcomed with some very delicious meals . Everything was prepared for us so I 've no idea what exactly were we eating LOL . No I do n't like that . Seriously . I prefer planning my own trip . We stayed at Pan Pacific Hotel Xiamen . <p> The lobby . Quite luxurious rooms we were sleeping in : ) ) <p> Bought their cafe 's macaron ! Its giant macaron , taste good but too huge for my liking . <p> Had breakfast at the hotel twice : ) Its called Caesars ' On 3 . <p> We drank A LOT of local Tie Guan Yin tea . Its a kind of Oolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite good at it ok : P My dad taught me a lot . <p> Overall I like Xiamen quite a bit ! There 's alot of shopping districts which we did n't visit ' cze I was traveling with my family . The most important element lacking in the city IN MY OPINION , is good food ? Its mainly chinese food ! ! Not somewhere I 'd live in for even a month : S <p> So I 'm back now which means DIET STARTS ! I 'm competing with my dad , if I lose 8kg before he loses 5kg , I 'll win S$2000 ! LOL Of course if I lose the game I 'll have to give him S$2000 too . In fact I set 8kg because I know I can drop 5kg easily ( my weight is THAT volatile ) so losing the 6th kg onwards will be my breakthrough ! YESSSS jiayouu . <p> : ) ) BYE FAT FACE . I do n't want to see you anymore . I want my S$2000 and good eating habits forever ! <p> So dieting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the 7kg I gained in NYC in 2months ' time . Share with you guys tomorrow ? ? It works 100% for me , hope it will be useful

Aside from the water ( think water fountain-like jets from the stage ) , fire , smoke , confetti and streamers that were dispensed onstage at various points of the show , the stage itself had its own bag of tricks to display . <p> We were constantly surprised by transformer-like features of the set - a rotating circular platform in the middle of the stage that could split into two levels , two ? carts ? that travelled on the parallel sides of the stage , plus the whole mid-section of the stage could be moved forward and back to suit the performances . <p> Zhou Mi from Super Junior-M in a duet with Victoria from f(x) <p> Throw in two buggies that ferried the performers back and forth the three different parts of the stage , we had a non-stop visual feast . <p> But more important than the stage itself , were the stars of the show that made it all come together . <p> Here are our some of the most notable highlights for the almost four-and-a-half hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ai Ping Lu ( ? , ? ? ) ? Right after his subdued first number , ? Pine Tree/Polaris ? , where he almost made everyone feel desolate , he burst into this Chinese song - complete with sunglasses - that got the crowd exhilarated once again . In perfect accompaniment to the top-notch laser light show was this very catchy tune and his surprisingly energetic dance steps that we couldn ? t get enough of . More of this , less of his down-in-the-dumps tunes please ! <p> Kangta owning the stage in this shades and all-black outfit <p> Best use of Singlish : Eunhyuk ( Super Junior ) During their banter on stage , the Super Junior member decided to up the ante and mentioned that he prepared his greeting in Singlish . He threw in phrases like ? I love you lah ? , ? I miss you lah ? and ? Nice to meet you lah ? and the crowd lapped it up . A+ for effort . <p> Most unfortunate tumble : Yunho ( TVXQ ) We weren ? t sure if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed as if the stage was a little bit too slippery for artistes , there were a couple of falls and near misses , but the award has to go to Yunho , who - during their first song of the night and while running at full speed to one end of the extremely long stage - took a headlong dive into the slick stage floor , and definitely not because he was trying to aim for the mosh pit to crowd surf . He recovered quickly though , while the camera switched its focus onto Changmin , almost as if it was embarassed . <p> Best leggy display : Girl ? s Generation It was hard to not feel pangs of envy with the way the girls constantly flaunted their mile-long gams in microminis . When TaeTiSeo , that ? s Taeyeon , Tiffany and Seohyun , performed ? Twinkle ? , they were clad in black sequinned hot shorts . Later , during ? Gee ? , the girl group slipped into denim shorts that showed off their enviable legs to perfection . Consider us completely jealous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white t-shirt <p> Epitome of coolness : BoA They don ? t call her the Queen of K-Pop for nothing . She exuded a super calm and too-cool-for-school exterior the whole time . It was almost as if nothing could faze her , not even as the rain was beating down during her performance of ? Only One ? . But it ? s for good reason . She blew the crowd away with her hits , as if nothing has changed since the day she first performed them . Plus , she looked super hot too , flashing her trademark dimple to many a fan boy screaming her name . <p> BoA staying cool , calm and collected <p> Super Junior No. 2 : EXO The band made up of 12 members reminded us of how Super Junior started out - a band with a whole lot of testosterone and catchy dance tunes . Though we weren ? t as familiar with their songs , their nifty footwork and infectious songs made us bob to the beat . They are definitely ones to watch . <p> EXO in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment : f(X) Almost seconds before f(x) took the stage for their last song ? Electric Shock ? , it started to drizzle and the very moment they took their spots on the middle platform , the clouds unleashed themselves and it started to pour . But the girl band were such troopers , they continued with their performance in the heavy rain and danced their hearts out for the audience who sat drenched in the bleachers . This got them whopping cheers and rousing applause , and they deserve every single accolade that goes their way . Professionalism at its best . <p> f(x) dancing their hearts out on stage in the rain <p> Most tiring dance routines : TVXQ We surmised that it could be because TVXQ felt ? inadequate ? on stage with only two members instead of eight ( Super Junior ) or twelve ( EXO ) , but it seemed as though TVXQ ? s dance steps were the most intense and complicated , and requiring the most energy . At one point during ? Purple Line ? , Yunho was headbanging like there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance cheoreography was but we felt exhausted for them just being in the audience . <p> Best fangirl moment : ? Just the way you are ? by KyuHyun ( Super Junior ) and Changmin ( TVXQ ) Just when we thought this Bruno Mars song would be a ho-hum one with these two boyish idols each doing a few stanzas , the spotlight suddenly shone on a girl sitting on a chair in the center of the stage . Both Kyuhyun and Changmin ran towards her , and serenaded her , ending it with a group hug , her sandwiched between the both of them . It seems as if the girl was a random member of the audience but we ? ll never know for sure . Anyhow , it was hands-down the best part of the entire night for that fangirl . <p> Most ? fleshy ? display of skin : Jonghyun ( SHINee ) Who knew that hiding underneath that cheeky grin and vocal prowess , was a smokin ? hot body that will put all other boyband members to shame ? When Jonghyun first appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biceps from afar , but it wasn ? t till he appeared topless for his duet with Taemin , that we got a good look at those pecs and abs . All we can say after this is , Siwon had better watch his back ( or shall we say abs ) ! <p> Best use of stage : SHINee SHINee proved they knew their way around the stage , even a stage as complicated as last night ? s . They added plenty of visual interest to their high-energy performance , with their dance steps blending seamlessly into the split-level circular stage that rose to risky heights while carrying four or more members . At one point in their performance , the Shinee members even danced in the pool of water onstage where the water jets were kicking up droplets of water into the already-wet audience , literally making a splash with their ingenuity . <p> SHINee splashing about on stage <p> Most hardworking : Taeyeon ( Girl ? s Generation ) It ? s common knowledge that the leader of the girl band has one of the best voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Cry ? was perfection , with her powering through and hitting all the high notes . But that also means that we saw Taeyeon involved in a total of nine songs ? including her solo and group numbers ( Girl ? s Generation and TaeTiSeo ) . This is compared to BoA ? s

##1024852 <h> There 's no " I " in " Team " but there 's an " I " in " Win " <p> When Michael Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame , he recounted an anecdote about how he single-handedly won a game for the Chicago Bulls , retorting to Tex Winters , assistant head coach : <p> " There 's no " I " in " Team " but there 's an " I " in " Win " " <p> Obviously , a gifted genius like Michael Jordan has the ability in many situations to affect an outcome just by the sheer force of his talent and skills . For the rest of us , I think we can take away a different kind of lesson from this quote from Michael Jordan . <p> I interpret Jordan 's words as such : I , as an individual within a team , must work hard towards my end goal , towards victory . His words tell me that I can not depend on others to work hard nor rely on my teammates to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to work to win , and only then will overall success be gotten . <p> The team in this case , becomes an amalgamation and aggregation of every team member 's contribution .

##1034750 <p> Germany is one of the world 's premier trading nations , with a powerful export sector and a vigorous appetite for imports . It has been the world 's largest exporter since 2003 and also runs a larger trade surplus in goods than any other country . This is only partly counterbalanced by a deficit in trade in services that mainly reflects Germans ' penchant for travelling abroad . German exports grew by 13.7% in local-currency terms in 2006 , to 893.6bn , according to the Federal Statistical Office ( Statistisches Bundesamt ) . The trade surplus increased by 2.3% and reached 161.9bn , as imports grew by 16.5% , to 731.7bn . <p> As in previous years , a strong export performance was the main driver of economic growth . Demand from abroad continued to expand during the first quarter of 2007 in spite of the strengthening of the euro . Imports rose sharply in 2005 and 2006 , primarily because of higher prices for oil and other basic resources . <p> German exporters benefited from the European Union 's enlargement to eastern Europe in 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21.6% in 2006 , to 83.7bn . France remained Germany 's largest trading partner in 2006 , followed by the US , the UK and Italy . The EU is still by far Germany 's most important market ; about 62% of exports go to other EU members . This share has been shrinking slightly as exports to non-EU states , especially Russia and China , increased disproportionately in 2006 . The level of exports to the United States rose despite the euro 's appreciation vis-a-vis the dollar through most of 2006 . The value of exports stood at 78bn in 2006 , 12.6% more than a year earlier . Trade with China has been booming , and in 2006 , unlike the previous year , mainly on the export side . Whereas the value of imports from China increased by 19.4% to 48.8bn , the value of exports soared by 27.5% to 27.5bn . China is now the fifth-largest source of imports into Germany , after France , Netherlands , the UK and the US . <p> Because of the importance of access to foreign markets , the German government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also advocated the inclusion of minimum social standards in trade agreements , for instance during its G8 presidency in 2007 . <p> The EU sets the levels of common tariffs and detailed rules on other import restrictions . It also handles negotiations for its members within the World Trade Organisation and other multilateral bodies . <p> The German government closely supervises trade in sensitive goods ( nuclear material , armaments and dual-use products ) with certain countries . It maintains well-developed systems to supply official export credit and insurance . <p> Germany uses the widely accepted and harmonised Customs Co-operation Council Nomenclature . It levies tariffs ad valorem on the cost-insurance-freight ( cif ) value of imports ; rates vary by product and country of origin . <p> Germany levies no duties on goods from other EU countries , on industrial goods from member states of the European Economic Area ( the EU plus Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway ) or from Switzerland . Imports of non-EU agricultural products are subject to variable EU levies . EU import duties ( 0 -- 20% ) apply to other goods shipped from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from developing countries and are particularly generous for countries in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific . <p> The EU offers trade concessions to countries that are regarded as candidates for membership ( such as Turkey , Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina ) and has signed association agreements with countries such as Morocco , Tunisia and Israel under its Euro-Mediterranean partnership . The agreements provide , among other things , for the incremental implementation of free trade in the area . <p> Germany maintains some import restrictions . Certain barriers are set at the level of the European Union , with which Germany shares a single market for goods and services . <p> Germany applies EU import quotas . Textile quotas were abolished on January 1st 2005 , but the EU passed a protection clause against China in early 2003 , valid until 2008 , under which textile imports from that country can be limited if serious harm to the EU textile markets can be proven . The clause was invoked in April 2005 , but China avoided a trade conflict with the EU by agreeing to limits on growth in exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require special permission from the Federal Office for Economics and Export Control ( Bundesamt fur Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle ) . This applies to iron and steel products from Russia , Kazakhstan and Ukraine ; potassium chloride from Belarus ; and some textile products from Belarus , China , Kosovo , Montenegro , North Korea and Uzbekistan . Separately , special licences are needed to import armaments . Special rules apply to agricultural trade into the entire EU . <p> Germany is subject to the EU 's anti-dumping regulations . This permits the EU to apply countervailing duties on non-EU products that carry prices below their costs of production , but only if the imports cause material injury to EU industry . In April 2006 , for instance , the EU imposed anti-dumping tariffs on shoes from China and Vietnam . Under Article 134 of the so-called EC Treaty ( Treaty Establishing the European Community ) , the European Commission can authorise an individual member state to protect its own market . These powers are rarely used . <p> Germany has the usual array of local buying preferences , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute import barriers , particularly for imports from countries outside the European Economic Area . <p> Outright import bans are rare , and the EU usually imposes for public health or environmental reasons ( for example , hormone-treated beef and protected species ) . In one controversial example , since 1998 the EU has banned the import or growing of genetically modified crops . In July 2004 the European Commission permitted the import of modified maize for animal feed , but Germany and several other EU member states were allowed to continue their ban on maize for human consumption . <p> Exports are tax exempt . <p> Germany has eight duty-free ports : Bremen , Bremerhaven , Cuxhaven , Deggendorf , Duisburg , Emden , Hamburg and Kiel . The two largest ports are Hamburg and Bremen . Bremen 's storage area is about 45 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and additional open-air facilities are available for transshipment and warehousing . Hamburg 's state-controlled storage space is about 162 ha ( 400 acres ) , with additional open space available for transshipment , manufacturing , processing and warehousing . Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport and shipping firms can be found at these ports ; because there is no " official " warehouse , contacting these firms first is the best course of action . <p> The Federal Office for Economics and Export Control ( Bundesamt fur Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle -- BAFA ) sets export authorisation requirements . BAFA provides information and printed material online and on request by phone and fax ; personal visits require an appointment . The latest version of the Export List ( Ausfuhrliste ) is the 105th Amendment , which came into force in July 2006 . The list restricts exports of armaments and dual-use goods , notably information technology , nuclear , chemical and biological technology , aerospace and nautical technology . The EU standard application for export approval must be purchased from commercial sources . <p> There are tight restrictions on the export of dual-use goods to certain countries , and would-be exporters to these countries must specify on their applications for export licences the intended use of the goods . No full embargo was in force in June 2007 . Partial embargos ( mostly weapons , technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , China , Cote d'Ivoire , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Iraq , Iran , Lebanon , Liberia , Montenegro , Myanmar , North Korea , Rwanda , Serbia , Sierra Leone , Somalia , Sudan , Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe , and also against specific individuals and organisations linked to international terrorism . Against Myanmar , moreover , a total investment ban is in force . <p> Germany has continued its catch-all policy requiring exporters of non-listed products to get official permission if their products could also have a military application for the end-user . Germany is a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies , the successor organisation to the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls . <p> Two private companies administer the federal government 's export-insurance system : Euler Hermes Kreditversicherung ( known as Hermes ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers . These companies process applications for Hermes insurance and take the decisions for loans up to 10m . Projects that exceed this limit and that are deemed high-risk or environmentally sensitive are forwarded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal ministries for economy , finance , foreign affairs and economic co-operation . <p> After a wave of consolidation , only three major sources provide private export-credit insurance cover : Euler Hermes ( a subsidiary of Allianz , Germany 's biggest insurer ) , based in Paris ; Coface Deutschland ( formerly called Allgemeine Kredit Coface , which is a subsidiary of the Coface Group of France ) ; and Atradius ( formerly known as Gerling NCM Credit and Finance , which is majority-owned by Swiss Re and Credito y Caucion and Seguros Catalana Occidente , both Spanish insurers ) . These companies rarely insure individual export deals . Instead they supply insurance for total exports to a particular debtor during a specified period . <p> Hermes claims are paid from the federal budget , which is credited with premium payments and any funds recouped from earlier claims . Government-backed insurance covers both commercial and political risks for exports to private-sector firms . It is no longer possible to buy insurance against exchange-rate risks . To increase transparency , export deals worth more than 15m are published on the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export guarantees are available : public-buyer guarantees ( Burgschaften ) for contracts between an exporter and a foreign state or a foreign public entity , which cover only political risks ; and private-buyer guarantees ( Garantien ) for export contracts with private companies , which cover both political and commercial risks . These guarantees may be granted to banks that finance exports for German companies as well as directly to German exporters , both in the period before shipment ( manufacturing-risk cover ) and during shipment ( supplier-credit-risk cover ) . Credit-risk cover is available in the following forms : <p> individual cover for a single transaction ; <p> revolving cover for a German exporter 's annual turnover with a specific buyer ; and <p> comprehensive cover for a German exporter 's entire turnover with various buyers abroad . <p> Coverage can be written for single transactions , but flat-rate coverage ( **33;687;TOOLONG -- APG ) is popular for exporters that supply customers in various countries with payment terms up to one year , since rates are lower and processing fees are waived . Since 2006 all APG applications must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller companies with export sales of up to 1m for deals of up to four months duration . <p> Hermes covers 95% of political and pre-shipment risks and 85% of commercial risk ( 90% for APG coverage ) . Cover for manufacturing risk and for export financing by banks is always 95% of the incurred loss . Since 2002 the government no longer covers economic and political risks for exports to the OECD core countries ( the 15 old EU member states prior to the eastern enlargement in 2004 , Australia , Canada , Iceland , Japan , New Zealand , Norway , Switzerland and the United States ) with a credit period of two years or less . <p> Fees depend on country risk , extent of coverage , amount and maturity of the debt covered , and whether the buyer is a public or private entity . Since May 2006 Hermes has also taken into account the buyer 's risk ranking . For example , for a deal worth 1m to a private buyer with a medium creditworthiness in a medium-risk country with a duration of six months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1,250 . For a five-year maturity , the cost would be 37,145 plus the processing fee . <p> Exporters must obtain government export-credit insurance before any financing at favourable interest rates can be granted by KfW IPEX-Bank , a subsidiary of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau . Under the European Recovery Programme ( ERP ) export-financing programme , KfW IPEX-Bank extends funds at cheap rates for financing exports to developing countries . These credits are subject to the rates set by the OECD consensus on minimum conditions for officially supported export credits . Beneficiaries of the KfW/ERP fund can also apply for additional KfW funding to top up their credits . <p> AKA Export Finance Bank , a consortium of 22 German banks , also provides funds for exports to developing countries , and supplier credits and buyer credits . Loans can be arranged with fixed or flexible interest rates based on Euribor ( European interbank offered rate ) plus a margin that varies widely , depending on the risk involved . <p> AKA finances expenses during production through a supplier credit , either for a single export project or comprehensively for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single export project , the credit amount is limited to 85 -- 90% of the contract value . Hermes export-insurance coverage is obligatory for maturities of more than two years . It grants buyer credits to importers or their banks for volumes of 1m or higher . Loans can be arranged for as much as the contract value minus the down payment and interim payments . Export insurance is a prerequisite for the credits , although 
##1034850 <p> Thanks I know the basic shape of the Hanfu but I not sure what measurements I need to take so i know how much fabric to buy . I was very happy to see someone reply to my topic and I did see the topic but there was not a solid pattern I wanted again thanks for your help ! <p> Hello ! I am the person that was contact for a little bit more info on this particular garment . Yes , I have made one using non-historic methods , with great results . ( http : **31;1546;TOOLONG ) <p> The first thing to ask yourself is if you are planning on making this based on historical accuracy or use modern methods . The reason why this is important is because most of the documentation I have found shows that the widths of fabrics during the Han was no greater than 20 inches wide , due to the size of weaving looms in period . The reason this is important to point out is because the greatest confusion most people run into when working with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are seamlines based on historic sizes of fabrics . <p> Now that we 've gotten this out of the way - here are some different patterns that can assist you . These patterns are ones that I 've downloaded from various history forums and books . There is a fairly recent publication ( Beijing Opera Costumes : The Visual Communication of Character and Culture , by Alexandra Bonds ) that does a WONDERFUL job of making direct correlation between the historic methods of garment construction and the methods that are still used today in constructing operatic costuming . AND it has fantastic patterns ! If you plan on engaging in more sewing projects - I highly recommend it . <p> PATTERN ONE : shows a similar diagram to that on the wiki site <p> PATTERN TWO : Shows a way to cut the fabric , utilizing more historically accurate seams and fabric use , as well as how to include the actual wrap pieces . <p> PATTERN THREE : is a VERY good pattern for a standard crossover , but really shows the seams and cutting instructions well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic seams that I 've been talking about . <p> as for the measuring .... measure yourself in the following areas : <p> * largest part of the chest * center of neck to wrist * top of shoulder to ankle ( or however long you want the garment to be ) * then , measure up from where ever you want the hem to be UP to about 3-5 inches below your armpit . This will help you decide how big or small to cut for your sleeve holes . <p> The hardest part of the Shen-yi specifically is the COLLAR . It sucks . Nothing makes it easy . You will just have to measure a TON of your chosen collar fabric , decide how wide you want it to be , and fit it by hand with pins prior to sewing . If you try to rush it and just serge or stitch it on without fitting it first it will twist , you may not have enough fabric , or any other random problems that can occur . <p> Another important point to make is that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or opening of the side seams , with the Shen-yi I have yet to see any evidence that there was any . It is one solid garment . <p> That 's most of what I can think of for now , I will pop back in if I think of anything else . Otherwise , feel free to message me personally if any other questions come up . <p> Regards , <p> Furen Wu <p> mwhahahak , on 13 October 2009 - 06:25 PM , said : <p> I need some help making a Hanfu that looks like the pic below for a costume .

##1034950 <p> But often also we think they are a bit childish . or chinese men like them childich . Want them childish . <p> The western girls , one part of them , are to often wearing ugly casual clothes . Ugly jeans and simple tee shirt . That makes them sometimes looking like men .. <p> That 's something that make Chinese girl more slim sexy and more attractive compare to the casual wearing western girls part . The clothes tight short clothes . <p> They do n't eat cans pizzas and rarely sodas also . They buy food at the vegetable market , not packaging in the supermarket , that help a lot making them slim . <p> But on the other hand , the western girls that make it feminine , graceful , slim and little skirt , they make it until 50 years old or more . Even when they are married , the foreigner girls , women that work on being pretty , continue to smile to boys . And sometimes pretend not to be married , continue to play ... seduction until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market is tight . only 20 years old until 28 years old . In china it seems that a girl works on being pretty when she is 20 years old until she got married at 28 years old . After finish to be an attractive girl women . One basic trouser and one simple tee shirt , no make up any more , one basic hair cut , finish . <p> In china the sexy 35 years old or 40 , 45 years old women does n't exist , or is very rare . In western countries we have a lot of them . The sexy 40 years old teacher or shop owner that continue discreetly hunting men . <p> In china like everywhere else . The girl makes herself pretty and sexy , and they do that to find a boyfriend with a good job and money and a men strong with muscles handsome and personality . Both sides are looking for something . <p> I 'm a Chinese guy currently in US . I have to say most Chinese girls I 've met are nice and considerate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall they 're honest and know what to do to respect themselves as well as others at the same time . <p> I do n't know if that 's because the girls I met are kind more well-educated than average cuz I 've been in a pretty good college and graduate school for many years . I did hear some stories about Chinese girls being selfish/peacockish/etc ... however I guess this happens everywhere . overall it 's hard for me to pick a girl like this right away from whom I know <p> there 're indeed differences between Chinese girls in China and here in States , girls in China are more traditional like taking care of there family/parents that sort of stuff and American borned ones are more western educated/behaving ..... the ones coming to States halfway , like me ( I 'm a guy though ) , are kind in between , understand both of the thoughts ( though not all of them ) and have some lifestyle from both sides . there 's nothing good or bad among these differences , it totally depends on what you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never understand people who say most Chinese girls dress well ... Some do but a lot of fashion in this country is just terrible ... most people I meet have nice clothes but they do n't seem to understand how to mix them well so they 'll have a great red dress and then they 'll wear a bright green shirt or soemthing crazy with it which just ruins the whole thing ... Not all of course but most that I see . It seems like they are trying to combine Western , Korean and Japanese at the same time and coming out with insanity . <p> yeah that what you see in beijing . people there are famous to be " tu " . tu means farmer looking not interesting on appearence . beijing and the dongbei . In shanghai and in the south we are more lucky . the girls fashion , it 's another world compare to beijing . in the street dring the 5 months summer and in the disco it 's something . Yeah Beijing not the same Uberche . Beijing " tu " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent many weekends in Shanghai , Suzhou , Changzhou , Yangzhou and other cities around there . It 's all the same from what I 've seen . Beijing 's East side has some absolutely beautiful women but the majority everywhere have issues with fashion in my opinion . <p> But at the same time , i think that the ladies here many have the same haircut . Long hairs . Sometimes curly with red color . <p> In Europe more variety of girls heads . Because more variety of haircuts . <p> That ; s my opinion recently . <p> I forgot to mention girls are sly snakes everywhere . Better be carrefull with this species . Every where on earth this species want to work less as possible . and Every where on earth this species want more money as possible from one man or another . Money advantages suckers . Give them nothing . <p> Well , as a average looking chinese girl , i feel really glad that most foreign people here have a good impression on Chinese girls . However , in my point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence and good looking ! <p> &gt; Most of them , in fact sometimes they randomly &gt; might wear nicely , but some other times they might &gt; dress like hell something must be wrong with your sense of fashion.In most people 's eyes , they dress properly and nicely.But there are always some against voice coming from people like you.But who cares , they just dress what they like and be happy . <p> My opinion , when they are 20 to 30 years old . They are very feminine i mean generaly speaking . <p> Mackup , short skirts , this tinny trousers , you see the long legs . You know a skirt is expensive in Europe . Girls do n't have so much or short sexy trousers . And our shops in Europe i mean in the 100000 inhabitants cities , we do n't have such a large choice of clothes . <p> Here chinese ladies have the largest choise on earth for buying clothes . So many diffrent fashion tinny things , at affordable prices . Because of that many of them are so attractive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy 40 years old women . Looks like once they are married , they stop the feminine job . It 's a damn pitty . Because they could make a super sexy show all this mama . Papa play sometimes , and keep it secret . Mama can play also , but must be feminie again , but must keep things secret . We have only one live apparently . <p> it is not rigth to talk about all chinese girls as we do not know all of them . What i experienced in three years in China is that some girls would like to have foreign boyfriend . I have a Chinese wife and i am very happy with her becuase the most important thing is to find the partner who you are going to spend a whole life . It is a kind of weird to ask what you think about chinese girls or something . If you do not have self confidence yourself , please do not write some weird question <p> Bhai Wrote : **40;2146;TOOLONG ... &gt; Girls are the blessing on humankind. they are the &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oncerned , they are true symbol of purity and fu of &gt; angelic beauty .

It became one of the world 's most popular paintings when made into print in the 1960s and 1970s , and is one of the world 's best-selling art prints . The painting is of a Chinese girl and is best known for the unusual skin tone used for her face - a blue-green colour , which gives the painting its popular name " The Green Lady " . The model was the daughter of a restaurant owner Tretchikoff met in San Francisco - the painting is Tretchikoff 's second variation on the theme , after the first ( using a different model ) was destroyed in a robbery at the artist 's studio in South Africa . <p> Uberche Wrote : **40;2188;TOOLONG ... &gt; I 'll never understand people who say most Chinese &gt; girls dress well ...

Where the hell are all the genuine nice girls ? <p> You got ta find them , they do n't go to bars or the usual meet up places . Bookstores , schools ... um ... dorms .. look for Chinese who are studying hard . <p> Wow I find this topic interesting . Chinese girls are no different than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have goals , they have different shapes and sizes . Some are pretty and some are ugly . I 've found that a lot of Western guys ca n't tell the difference between a pretty Chinese girl and an ugly one . Yet the beauty of a Chinese girl is not really the issue at the moment . <p> I 've noticed that we are talking about the conduct of Chinese girls . I 'll give a few of my experiences . <p> Being as it is that I 've been with a few Chinese girls I 've found them to be many things . I 've found them to be caring , giving , supportive , and understanding . Yet I 've also found them to be liars , cheaters , and all around horrible people . Yet it depended on the girl . <p> To be honest I 've been the guy on the side for a married Chinese woman . Me and here are the same age and I still talk to her from time to time but that relationship is n't what it used to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude . I 've been with others that tried to lie to me about many things when I found out they were sleeping with me just so I would do things for them . I 've also seen Chinese girls cheat on their chinese and western boyfriends . <p> Now I am married . My wife is Chinese ( half the reason why I 'm here trying to learn the language ) , and she 's been a lot different from a lot of the other Chinese girls that I 've been in contact with . But again let me say that it has nothing to do with the girls being Chinese or not . Chinese girls no matter how much a lot of them want to say they are different are n't different from girls from other parts of the world . The only thing that is different is the fact that they are from another part of the world . <p> Now as I was saying my wife is different from all the other girls I 've ever met . It does n't matter that she 's Chinese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever " . She just happened to have all of the qualities in a woman that I like . <p> But I will say this for Chinese girls in general . Most of them are pretty decent people . When it comes to Chinese girls becareful of the ones who are from rich families . The ones from rich families play by differnt rules just like the girls from any rich family . Now I 'm not say rich girls are bad , I 'm just saying they understand life differently from us that are middle class and poor . Another big problem is when a western guy has this idea that the girl should be happy she is with him because she is from a poor country and he is n't . He lets his guard down and does n't see things for what they are , that and he could be treating her in an inferior manor as well which will cause a Chinese girl to do a disappearing act just because she can . <p> Again another problem is that a lot of us who are more open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in , and in turn over glorify another country and think that those people do no wrong ... when in all truth humans are humans and you have your scum , and you have your good ones . It 's that simple . <p> hey , my name is umair i am from uk . i know one chinese girl cindy here she is very sweet . i think chinese girls are very beautiful and good looking .. do nt know y did u said that .. do u have any yahoo or hotmail plz doo forward me on my id umairkashi@hotmail.com ..... umairkashi@y ... i will wait for ur reply .. <p> " I 've found that a lot of Western guys ca n't tell the difference between a pretty Chinese girl and an ugly one . " <p> I think it 's more just that we have a wider variety of what we consider beautiful . In China there is a very defined view of beauty . <p> The bar I used to manage had a Chinese waitress who all the Chinese guys thought was really ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what i mean and her face was not the classical beauty but about half the foreign guys who came in would just drool over her all night , I thought she looked really bitchy which I 'm not into ( and she was ) but I know some guys really go for the bitchy look . <p> " Again another problem is that a lot of us who are more open minded in the western world tend to hate the country we live in , and in turn over glorify another country and think that those people do no wrong ... when in all truth humans are humans and you have your scum , and you have your good ones . It 's that simple . " <p> yeah very true . I see it a lot in China with foreingers . I had one American guy who I asked why he came and he went on and on about how much he hated the USA and how evil they were and corrupt and such and I asked him what happened to make him hate the US so much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the CBS building and they through me in jail and did n't give me a fair trial . " hahaha and he really saw this as the USA 's fault . And English guy I met in Nanjing got caught selling pirated software and DVD 's and got HUGE fines levied at him so he came to China to get away from the terrible corrupt English and their horrible anti-freedom laws ... <p> LOL wow ... your story is hilarious about these guys that got into trouble . You are right it does make people seem to be awefully strange . I do n't know ... to be 100% honest with you I hate all countries ... there does n't seem to be a good one out of any of them . I mean do n't get me wrong each country has it 's good things and all ... but I 'm just kinda fed up with humanity ... I 've been understanding why the " Evil Scientists " in those old movies and cartoons wanted to destroy the planet lol . <p> There is nothing wrong with well proportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm not talking so much about the body as much as the face . To many times I 've been out with my friends who would be going on and on about an ugly Asian girl and only because she is exotic to them .... but then again on the flip side . I 've hung out with Chinese guys who thought just about every single thin blonde girl they came across was beautiful ... <p> I think the exotic factor gets in the way to be very honest . Exotic can cover ugly and beauty and just make you simply lust I think lol . <p> what we encountered of red tape can easily find in three level of governments back home in Canada ... <p> even Canada has propaganda as well , Canadian at work do fight each other , no less than work relationship in China . <p> i am kinda of tired of red tape back home as well , just wan na work something to make myself happy , that 's the reason why I immigrated to Canada from China , choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who believe North America has much more freedom , glorified , should rethink again . Vancouver downtown east side is third world country , every month there are people dying on the street , First Nation reserves in my cities usually filled with drunks , ghetto , our federal government just past cheques after cheques to them , nothing different than culture genocides . <p> Homeless populations in Victoria or Vancouver are thousands or more . They just camp in the city parks from 11---7am , which is legal hours , polices are not allowed to evict them .. <p> See , most of countries got their own challenge as well , just depend on how you look at that . <p> Uberche Wrote : **40;2272;TOOLONG ... &gt; " I 've found that a lot of Western guys ca n't tell &gt; the difference between a pretty Chinese girl and &gt; an ugly one .

I 've been to China 2 times . The first time was before I met my wife , the 2nd time was before we were married . As for the exotic factor , it wore off on me a long time ago because of my using girls like toilet paper when I was younger ... and for some odd reason Asian girls would n't leave me alone so I been through a lot of them and started realizing the difference in exotic and pretty . <p> " Dated a lady who was 36 years old for a while and she still had Hello Kitty Underwear .

Also I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? western guys ! ! <p> LOL he must have found a really poor one ... cuz as far as I know Viet girls are just the same as all over girls all over the world . Maybe this girl is more dependent as well as opposed to you being independent . You have to remember not a lot of guys like independent women , this includes guys who say they do , cuz a lot of them do n't . <p> And yes Western guys are more selfish . This is why there are such high divorce rates in western countries . The women are more selfish too , there is a really big " ME " attitude which causes us to want to think of ourselves first .... I 've been having a hard time with this myself but trying to be better about it . <p> And yes I also agree that western people will show you about how life really is . Especially if the person is from the ghetto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the planet . The problem is that especially in the US the government hands out crack and guns to the ghetto people for all sorts of reasons . And it causes things to be really dangerous here . I 'd say Africa is about the only other place on the planet that is more dangerous than the US . <p> And no I disagree that every Chinese girl has a kind heart .

##1035350 <p> Wireless sensor networks may be used to conduct critical tasks like fire detection or surveillance monitoring . It is thus important to guarantee the correctness of such systems by systematically analyzing their behaviors . This task is extremely challenging as the state space of sensor networks is huge , e.g. , due to interleaving of sensors and intra-sensor interrupts . In this work , we develop a method to reduce the state space significantly so that state space exploration methods ( like model checking or systematic testing ) can be applied to a much-smaller state space without missing a counterexample . Our method explores the nature of networked NesC programs and uses a novel two-level partial order reduction approach to reduce both interleaving among sensors and intra-sensor interrupts . Applying partial order reduction for sensor network programs is highly non-trivial , due to the interplay between inter-sensor message passing and interrupts or among interrupts . We define systematic rules for identifying dependence at sensor and network levels so that partial order reduction can be applied effectively . We have proved the soundness of the proposed reduction technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our approach . <p> In the following , we will present two case studies . All necessary materials for re-running the experiments are also provided . <p> Anti Theft Anti-theft is taken from the TinyOS distribution , which represents a real-world application of sensor networks . This applications consist of more than 3000 LOC of the NesC program running on each sensor . <p> Trickle Trickle 4 is a code propagation algorithm intended to reduce network traffic . Trickle controls message sending rate so that each sensor hears a small but enough number of packets to stay up to date .

##1036650 <h> Eating Without Casein <p> Casein is a protein found in the milk of all mammals . Some people are allergic to it , and these people will never , ever enjoy another ice cream . <p> The dairy industry would have you believe that by eating such a snack you are ingesting " great protein . " Let 's investigate the most abundant milk protein , casein . <p> CASEIN is a tenacious glue . Eighty-seven percent of milk is water . Four percent of the remaining thirteen percent is CASEIN . <h> What is Milk Allergy ? <p> A food allergy is defined as any adverse reaction to an otherwise harmless food or food component that involves the body 's immune system . Therefore when talking about a food allergy it only involves the body 's immune system . <p> A food intolerance is when you develop symptoms after eating a food product that your body ca n't deal with adequately . <p> Many people who have an adverse reaction to dairy products think they are allergic to milk this is not always the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have difficulty digesting milk are lactose intolerant , meaning that the digestive system does not produce enough of or any lactase ( an enzyme found in the stomach ) , which breaks down lactose ( the sugar found in dairy products ) , to a simpler sugar which can be digested . <p> Lactose intolerance is no laughing matter but it is not life threatening . A casein allergy can be just that ; an allergy . It may manifest as breathing difficulty , hives and rashes , or stomach cramps , bloating , serious pain in the gut etc leading to inability to get nourishment from food and dangerous weight loss . If you or a loved one suffers from a casein allergy , this page may be of help . ( see Symptoms and diagnosis ) . <h> Symptoms <p> How do you know if someone in your family is Lactose Intolerant or allergic to milk ? The symptoms of a milk protein allergy ( casein ) fall into 3 types of reactions <p> Skin Reactions : <p> Itchy red rash <p> Hives <p> Eczema <p> Swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Allergic " Shiners " ( black eyes ) <p> Stomach and Intestinal Reactions : <p> Abdominal pain and bloating <p> Diarrhea ( usually very runny ) <p> Vomiting <p> Gas/wind <p> Cramps <p> Nose , Throat and Lung Reactions : <p> Runny Nose <p> Sneezing <p> Watery and/or Itchy eyes <p> Coughing <p> Wheezing <p> Shortness of Breath <p> As you can see most of these symptoms can be seen in people who have asthma or hay fever or a cold . They could have indigestion or a reaction to a chemical or plant they handled . Milk is not always the first choice for doctor to look at when you go to them with any or all of the above . <p> However , a milk allergy ( rather than an intolerance ) can be life threatening and an anaphylactic reaction can occur . <p> Anaphylaxis means " Without Protection " . It is a severe reaction by the body to an offending Allergen ( something causing the allergy ) , and it happens very fast , within minutes of exposure . <p> Drugs also can cause a reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stings from insects such as bees , wasps and ants can cause an anaphylactic reaction . <p> An anaphylactic reaction involves more than one system of the body . It can begin with a tingling sensation in the lips , tongue or throat , this progresses to red raised itchy rash , feeling dizzy asthma symptoms , change in blood pressure and loss of consciousness and collapse . <h> Composition of Milk <p> Milk has a number of components . These include lactose ( milk 's sugar ) , up to four varieties of casein and other milk proteins , and fats . <p> The percentage of each of these contained in an ounce of milk varies according to the source of the milk ( which animal ) , where in the milking cycle the milk comes from ( lactose-rich foremilk comes out first , followed by fat-rich hind milk ) , and how long the individual animal has been lactating this time around . ( The milk 's composition is adjusted to the needs of the individual offspring . ) <p> The contents are also affected by the lactating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since certain dietary components can make their way from the mother 's digestive tract into the milk she produces . <h> Beware the Ingredients ! <p> For someone with an allergy , 1/2 of 1% may still be higher than an individual 's tolerance , depending upon how much of a product you eat and how severe your allergy is . <p> Food manufacturers have long understood that glue holds foods together giving them a firmer and more concrete appearance . It is no coincidence that each of the major tuna fish manufacturers have elected to put nature 's perfect glue in their little cans . <h> Products to Seek Out <p> On the other hand , many items , including cakes and brownies and mixes to make them , are completely milk free . Generally speaking , the cheaper an item is , the more likely it is to be milk-free . <h> What About Calcium ? <p> People who can eat absolutely no milk products should watch their calcium intake , especially if pregnant or nursing . Foods like broccoli , sardines and nuts contain significant quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead . <h> What About Goat Milk ? Or Breast Milk ? Or ... ? <p> Casein ( in each of its variants ) and lactose are found in the milk of every single mammal , although in varying ratios . Most people who have an actual allergy to any of these milk components will be unable to consume any animal 's milk . <p> However , there is only an 85% overlap in milk protein makeup across different species , so people who have an unusual milk allergy , or who are merely lactose intolerant , may find that milk other than cow 's milk is digestible . <p> Also , remember that since each mammal has protein and sugar variants in their milk , it 's possible to be allergic to the milk of only one , or one set of , mammals . <p> The exception to the " all milk is dangerous milk " rule is infants . Children under the age of about five ( the age at which children self-wean in non-industrialized countries ) thrive on breast milk , even when they react badly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breast milk are usually reacting to cow 's milk protein in their mother 's diet , protein which migrates from the mother 's gut to her breast milk . <h> Infant Colic and Milk <p> Some number of human infants get colic , which is basically an upset tummy that makes life difficult for the baby and for everyone within hearing distance . Colic may be caused by the fact that the baby 's digestive tract is still immature and can not handle certain dietary components . <p> Of these , the casein variant that is high in cow 's milk but vanishingly low in human milk is the most common culprit . ( Colic may have other causes , too . And some have nothing to do with the baby 's diet . ) <p> Do not , by the way , confuse loose stools with colic . Breastfed infants have very loose , runny stools , and this is perfectly normal . <h> Will My Children Get a Milk Allergy ? <p> The single highest risk factor for developing an allergy or any allergy , is having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergy . The single best way to reduce the risk of developing allergies is to avoid exposure to allergens in the early months of life . <p> For milk allergy , this means that an at-risk baby should be exclusively breastfed and the lactating mother should maintain a strictly dairy-free diet until the baby is at least six months old . <p> And for a variety of healthy reasons , of which allergy is only one , you should aim to continue breastfeeding for 4-5 years . Although solids will , of course , be the bulk of your child 's diet by around 2 years of age . <p> Why is breast milk okay ? It has to do with the relative ratios of lactose and the three casein variants in breast milk as compared to the milk of other mammals . Breast milk is high in lactose but low in the caseins . <p> Also , be aware that once a single allergy is triggered you 're at greater risk of developing other allergies . <p> According to recent research , a factor that significantly reduces the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first six months of life . In other words , if you live with a goat your child will have a significantly reduced risk of any allergies . <p> The theory is that the exotoxins , which are shed by the animals , sort of " teach " your baby 's developing immune system to react appropriately to the various things it comes across . <p> In this case , too much cleanliness is NOT a good thing . <p> Your other challenge comes with the inevitable transition to solids . Children with a personal or family history of allergy or any allergy , including hay fever ; are more likely than other children to develop allergies themselves . <h> Is There Milk in My Medicine ? <p> Sometimes the medicine that is supposed to make you better can make you sicker , instead . <p> Many medicines and vitamins use lactose as a filler . Casein in medicines is not unknown , although it is relatively rare . Depending upon the severity of your allergy , either of these may cause you problems . So what can you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lactose is used as a filler unless the product specifically says " milk free " on the bottle . <p> Several store brands refrain from lactose use . So do most vitamins at GNC . Centrum , on the other hand , has lactose and has caused difficulty for people on the no-milk mailing list . <h> Non Food Uses of Casein <p> Casein is used in some adhesives , paints and beauty products . The furniture in your home is held together by this powerful glue . So too is the label affixed to a bottle of beer . If you are sensitive to casein when you touch or inhale it , you may wish to investigate further . <p> The above opinionated views and information serves to educated and informed consumer .

##1040850 <h> Precise Color Communication <p> Even for objects composed of the same materials , variances may be seen in the colors due to differences in the gloss of the surfaces . For example , why is a duller blue color seen when sandpaper is applied to a shiny or high-gloss blue sample ? <p> When a ball bounces on a wall and returns , it bounces and returns at the same angle . In the same manner , the light , which reflects at the equal but opposite angle from the light source is called the specularly reflected light . This specular component is reflected as if reflected by a mirror . The light that is not specularly reflected , but scattered in many directions , is called diffuse reflectance . The sum of the specular reflectance plus the diffuse reflectance is called the total reflectance . <p> For objects with shiny surfaces , the specularly reflected light is relatively strong and the diffused light is weaker . On rough surfaces with a low gloss , the specular component is weak and the diffused light is stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny surface at the specular angle , the object does not appear to be as blue . This is because the mirror-like reflectance from the light source is added to the color of the sample . Usually , a person looks at the color of the object and ignores the specular reflection of the light source . To measure the color of a specimen in the same manner that it is viewed , the specular reflectance must be excluded and only the diffuse reflectance must be measured . The color of an object can appear different because of differences in the level of specular reflectance . <p> It was understood that the color is viewed differently if the surface condition of the object is changed because people only view the diffused light . However , the colors of objects should not be changed because the materials themselves are the same . How can we recognize the color of the materials themselves ? The amount of specular reflectance and diffuse reflectance changes depending on the surface of the object . However , the total amount of reflected light is always the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a glossy blue plastic part is sanded , the specular reflectance is reduced and the diffuse reflectance increases . This is why the total reflectance ( specular plus diffuse ) should be measured . <p> The position of the light trap in Conditions 3 ( SCE ) and 4 ( SCE ) , as displayed in Figure 24 in Part III-1 , show how the specular reflectance is excluded from the color measurement of the sample . If this trap is replaced with a white plug , as in Conditions 5 ( SCI ) and 6 ( SCI ) , the specular reflectance will be included in the color measurement . The method of color measurement , which excludes the specular reflectance , is called SCE ( Specular Component Excluded ) . If the specular reflectance is included in the color measurement , by completing the sphere with a specular plug , it is called SCI ( Specular Component Included ) . In SCE mode , the specular reflectance is excluded from the measurement and only the diffuse reflectance is measured . This produces a color evaluation which correlates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . When using the SCI mode , the specular reflectance is included with the diffuse reflectance during the measurement process . This type of color evaluation measures total appearance independent of surface conditions . These criteria must be thoroughly considered when an instrument is selected . Some instruments can measure both SCE and SCI simultaneously . <p> The SCE method is effective to verify that the color matches the color standards by visual inspection on the production line . <p> The SCI method is effective when color

The museum 's interior is poorly lit and for the most part its grand collection is laid out with little sense of theme or design , giving the museum a stagnant feel overall .

It 's filled with gardens and shrines and the top of the mountain has a temple dedicated to a much revered Sage and General called Chen Yuan Kwang who lived 1500 years ago . <p> Though the temple itself is lovely enough , more interesting still are the statues surrounding it - carved stone representations of characters well known to anyone familiar with the Chinese classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climb worth it is the view , a sweeping ... <p> The several blocks that make up the Dihua market are Taipei 's best-preserved examples of historic architecture . Building styles range from Fujianese to Baroque to modernist . The area is sometimes called ' Grocery Street ' , and for most of the year it 's thought of as a good place for buying traditional Chinese medicines and herbs , bolts of cloth and sundries . <p> If you 're lucky enough to be in Taipei for the weeks leading up to the Lunar New Year celebrations , Dihua market 's true colours shine , as the area is considered Taipei 's best for traditional New Year foods , party supplies and gifts of all kinds . During these weeks , a festive spirit of bonhomie descends on the market , ... <p> This is Taipei 's oldest residential building .

The home reached its present size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the 1970s this historic home was slated to be destroyed as the road was being widened .

We 're not sure the Lin family would have wanted their house ... <p> More proof that good things come in small packages , the Tien-Ho Temple seems , from the outside , but a narrow ( though exceptionally ornate ) storefront in the busy Ximending district . But walk through the narrow gate and you 'll find one of Central Taipei 's most beautiful Buddhist temples , complete with statues of Matsu , ancient Chinese generals , a bell tower and a small dragon-shaped pond filled with huge carp . <p> The original temple was built during the mid-Qing period and demolished during the last years of Japanese rule to make way for a roadway . The current temple was built in 1948 and holds several ancient statues brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occupying an entire city block , the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall serves as a cultural centre ( concerts , performances and special events ) , a large public park and a museum of the life of the man considered the founder of modern China . <p> A huge statue of Dr Sun sits in a cavernous lobby facing the park to the south . It 's guarded by two implacable sentries - you can watch the changing of the guards , an intricate choreography involving much spinning of bayoneted rifles and precision stepping . This happens twice a day . Morning visitors practising taichi on the grounds provide another kind of choreography . You 'll also find the excellent Discovery Centre of Taipei on the grounds . <p> Like Tokyo 's Ginza , Ximending is the ultraconsumerist heart of Taipei 's mainstream youth culture . This eight-branched intersection dates from the Japanese era and is now chock-full of shops selling fashion , fast food , sneakers , sunglasses , scarves , Sanrio , Sony and spaghetti . If it 's young and trendy , it 's here . <p> The pedestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wuchang St ) is more or less the epicentre , but for the full Ximending experience you 'll really want to explore the smaller alleys . It 's here you 'll find the edgier side of Taiwan 's youth culture , the places they hang and the stores in which they work and shop . <p> Once upon a time this multifaceted botanical garden , the CKS Shilin Residence Park was part of the sprawling estate of Generalissimo and Mrs Chiang Kai-shek . They ruled the gardens with an iron hand , overseeing the pruning , weeding and other daily gardening tasks from their palatial home overlooking the estates , all the while dreaming of their inevitable triumphant retaking of mainland China . <p> When the Generalissimo died , Madame Chiang ( who never much cared for Taiwan ) , wasted no time in moving her official residence to America . For decades the estate and the surrounding gardens were closed to the public . <p> A beautiful oasis in Taipei 's funky west side , the Botanical Gardens has greenhouses featuring a vast variety of lush plants , literature- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taipei 's Botanical Gardens is also considered one of the best places in the world to see the rare Malaysian Night Heron , making the park a major stop on foreign birding tours . That such a rare bird can be seen so close to , let alone inside , a major urban centre is quite amazing , or so our twitcher friends tell us . The Botanical Gardens is where you 'll find the National Museum of History . <p> Right across from Songshan railway station , the Ciyou Temple is dedicated to the goddess Matsu and is one of the oldest in the city . But Ciyou temple has another thing going for it besides age ; noise . Specifically , on the day of Matsu 's birthday , when the temple is said to hold the loudest , most colourful birthday celebrations in Taiwan , resplendent with gongs , music and firecrackers . <p> If you see us at Ciyou temple during the festival , do n't bother yelling . We might see you at Ciyou , but we wo n't be able to hear you or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . <p> If this place does n't bring out the kid in you , than there 's no kid in you to be brought out . The National Taiwan Science Education Centre is one of the coolest children 's museums we 've yet to find in Asia . Interactive exhibits cover the gamut of scientific knowledge , from anatomy ( a walk-through digestive tract ! ) to zoology ( a cat-head-shaped helmet that gives the wearer feline hearing powers ) . <p> Though NTSEC is not fully bilingual , museum staff have gone to great length to include enough English content to make all sections of the museum accessible to non-Chinese speakers . <p> The highly interactive children 's Taipei Children 's Art Museum features artwork by children and regular programmes to encourage children to participate in the creation of art .

##1041351 <h> Lonely Planet review for National Palace Museum <p> The National Palace Museum is home to what could quite easily be termed the world 's largest and finest collection of Chinese art ; it is unfortunate that the overall interior setup of the museum does not match with the grandeur of the collection . The museum 's interior is poorly lit and for the most part its grand collection is laid out with little sense of theme or design , giving the museum a stagnant feel overall . This is especially strange in light of the fact that the exhibits are rotated frequently ; the vast collection ( much of it liberated from mainland China during the last retreat of the KMT ) is far too large to exhibit at any given time . Nonetheless , the sheer volume and beauty of the museum 's treasures still makes it a must visit . <p> Among the treasures on rotation at the National Palace Museum are painting , calligraphy , statues and ceramic and jade . Some pieces date back thousands of years into Chinese history and even prehistory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts inherited from the Forbidden City . Some of the most popular items are always on display - check with the front desk to find out where they are during your visit . <p> The museum offers free guided tours in English at 10am and 3pm .

If you prefer to move about at your own pace , there 's an English headphone guide ( NT200 ) . <h> Beautiful Chinese artifacts , like curio boxes and pottery <h> Great way to spend a rainy day ! <p> I had a great day at the museum and did n't really expect to ! I was blown away by the current exhibition " A Century of Resilient Tradition : Exhibition of the Republic of China 's Diplomatic Archives " which covers the history of the ROC 's international political development through display of treaties and other significant legal documents .

You can also take the MRT to Shilin and take a bus from there . <h> this museum is splendid , even at night : ) <p> Yes , I visited this museum at night , after a culture-night gala dinner as one agenda of Taiwan 's World Design Expo at October 2011 .

##1847052 <p> 10 years ago in Singapore , hawker " western food " is known as fish , chicken , pork or cheap overcooked sirloin steak served with fries , coleslaw and the compulsory canned baked beans . If you 're lucky , they may serve mashed potatoes as an option . This is what I call Singaporean western food . Even my primary school canteen stall does it this way . This is not any specific western country 's cuisine , but simply just Singaporean style western food , tweaked to the general Singaporean 's taste . However in recent years , the Singaporean " western food " scene has improved greatly . Baked beans are no longer customarily served and the usual now is that you get to choose 2 sides among a choice of about 10 . <p> Other than just a simple coffeeshop or hawker centre stall , it has been increasingly popular to sell such western food in coffeeshop western food restaurants . The difference between these and the former is that they have extensive menus and serve restaurant worthy food , sometimes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ones that most Singaporeans are familiar with starts with the letter A and B , but today I 'm going to introduce another one which is a worthy contender , if not better . I used to dine at A and B quite often in the past , but A 's standards have greatly declined even in their very first outlet ( ca n't be a franchise problem ) , and B 's has always been too generous with the fats for my liking and generally does n't taste very unique to remember well . I know delicious food is often the unhealthy food , but generally I do not like my " western food " to be too Americanized in terms of the portion and the oiliness . I like to strike a balance between delicious and healthy . <p> Anyway , what distinguishes LavaRock from A and B is that I find it has a more personal and sincere approach in their cooking . Each dish is carefully marinated with a specific marinade which is best for it . For example , not all pork dishes are marinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is rare as some restaurants/stalls may choose the easy way by having just 1 type of marinade for everything and only vary the sauce in the final product . Each and every recipe is created by the owner who has a passion for cooking , and they often improve their recipes and menus so you can be assured that the food served would n't have declining standards or ubiquitous taste . In fact , nothing here tastes bland . I can see how much effort is being put in to make sure every taste is perfected to the most flavourful . <p> Starting from a single stall in Hougang , they now have 6 outlets . Initially I was wondering whether there would be inconsistency among the different outlets since it is a common thing for restaurants ' standards to slip when it expands rapidly , but actually all marinating and preparation is done at a central kitchen before reaching the various outlets , so if you had the same consideration as me , rest assured that the same great taste is available at any of the 6 outlets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the " Must Try " symbol next to them . This is simply because there are many good items . As seen from the menu , the prices are slightly higher than traditional " western stalls " at coffeeshops , but still significantly lower than what a restaurant would charge . The only difference between a restaurant and LavaRock is that there is no air con and personalized service . The quality of ingredients , cooking technique and presentation of the dishes definitely surpasses the old fashioned " western stall " standards . They insist on putting the sides into individual bowls so that sauces do not intermix . The plating and presentation of the food is restaurant comparable too . You also get to bring your own wine and glasses are provided . Corkage is not chargeable . <p> For each main course , you get to choose 2 sides from the list , as well as either fries or rice . For those who order hot plate main course , you can choose from fries , baked potato , rice or spaghetti , on top of the 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every main course , more than what most other places offer . <p> For those who prefer to have a low carbo meal at a coffeeshop , it is always a good idea to head to the " western stall " because they serve more meat than local food , since local food is always focusing on rice , noodles or maybe prata . However the plan may backfire if the only options of sides given where potato based . I like how LavaRock 's options are quite diversified . For non-refined carbohydrates options you have honey glazed carrots , pineapple salsa , garden salad , buttered corn and coleslaw . For those who wish to have more protein , adding an egg is an option for only a supplement of $0.60 . <p> Garden Salad - this is not the type of salad I usually eat as it 's lettuce dressed in salad cream . I do hope they 'll have more types of salads with vinaigrette based dressings . <p> Pineapple Salsa -- The pineapple salsa is extremely spicy , even the pineapples are . It is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose this . <p> Mash Potato Salad - The potato salad was good in my opinion as the mayonnaise taste is n't too strong . It was pretty much like mashed potato in texture . <p> Butter Potato -- The butter potato was flavourful with slight spice and herbs . It was adequately soft inside too , which is what I seek in potatoes . I abhor hard potatoes . <p> Glazed Carrot - The carrots were steamed first and later glazed with honey . I really liked these carrots as they were quite soft and the flavor of the glaze went well with the carrots . <p> BBQ Baked Beans -- The baked beans are not just canned beans , but with extra ingredients like BBQ sauce and Worcestershire sauce added to enhance the flavor . <p> Butter Corn -- The butter corn was pretty sweet and lightly buttered . I like how it 's plucked for us as eating from the cob is not that easy without using hands . <p> Creamy Potato - if creamy and sinful is your definition of side dishes you may opt for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleslaw -- Same as the above , except with less carbohydrates for this . I generally do not like coleslaw so no comments about this . <p> Pasta Salad -- Pasta salad was never my thing so no comments about this either . I prefer salads without carbohydrates but that 's just me . <p> Mashed Potato -- Quite ordinary perhaps . <p> TexMex Fries -- I like the fries the most among all sides . It was n't too oily , and it was adequately crispy ( not hard ) on the outside , soft inside . This is exactly how I like my fries to be . Chili powder , garlic powder and salt is sprinkled on and the flavours is exactly what I like on my fries . It is good to eat without garlic chili sauce . <p> Buttered Rice -- The butter Thai rice kind of resembled chicken rice , since it was slightly oiled . For fans of flavoured rice this might be for you . <p> Baked Potato -- It was soft inside and has butter and bacon bits . It 's better eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply plain with tomato sauce over it . It was al dente . <p> Mushroom Soup -- $2.50 ( $2.00 with every main course ) <p> This soup is prepared from scratch using white button mushrooms . The soup was bursting with mushroom flavor , and was n't overly creamy to steal the limelight from the mushrooms . For $2.50 it is one pretty good bowl of mushroom soup ! The only issue is that it has to be drunk warm , because when cooled the texture somehow becomes more watery . The portion is very large , so small eaters may like to share this . <p> Golden Fried Button Mushrooms <p> The white button mushroom is deep fried in breaded and becomes tender and cooked inside . Fans of mushrooms may like this . <p> Escargot <p> Most of the appetizers are fried , with exception of escargot . Those looking for a non fried appetizer and would like to be slightly more adventurous can choose this . <p> Black Angus Ribeye ( 250g ) -- $20.90 <p> Baked potatoes , creamy coleslaw and sauted pasta <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grain fed , while the ' normal ' ribeye is from New Zealand and is Grass Fed . For $4 more you get grain fed Angus beef . <p> For all steaks , 3 types of sauces are available -- black pepper , special brown sauce and mushroom sauce . I normally eat steaks without sauces because I like to enjoy the natural flavours of beef . I only use sauces if the beef is of bad quality and tastes bad , which in this case , did n't happen . Anyway , I still sampled the sauces and among the sauces the special brown sauce was the best for me . <p> I am a fan of Angus beef because it makes a good choice of meat for everyday steak ( not literally every day , but just steak without an occasion to splurge ) as wagyu is too indulgent , but for LavaRock I 'd say top up a few more dollars and get the Australia Marble Beef instead . <p> Australia Marble Beef -- $28.90 <p> Baked potatoes , potato salad , baked beans <p> This beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cut is sirloin , but since it has a marbling score of 6 , it is very soft and tender , hence it does n't have the typical chewiness of normal sirloins . Grade 6 is a considered to be a good grade . The entire piece of meat is distinctively oily with beef fats ( I mean this in a good way ) and the seasoning they smeared on the surface resembles the one I had at Fat Cow . Of course , this is not comparable to Fat Cow 's wagyu which is insanely marbled , but is good enough and the difference in meat texture from the Angus steak and regular grass fed beef is very obvious . <p> Golden Crispy Fish - $7.90 <p> Fries , pineapple salsa , buttered corn <p> The fish used for this is Grade A Cream Dory , and it is moist and juicy inside . The panko batter was crispy and did come across as too oily . It maintained its crispiness even after time . I would say that this fish &; chips is above average , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this will definitely suit the typical Singaporean 's taste buds and coming from a fish &; chips lover ( aka me ) I approve of this . <p> Herbed Norwegian Salmon -- $13.90 <p> The salmon was cooked medium . It is very hard to come by non-overcooked salmon in Singapore . In fact , I sort of gave up on salmon in Singapore . When I was told that this was one of the signature dishes , I was kind of skeptical because I am very particular about salmon and overcooking salmon is unacceptable to me . I raised my concerns about overcooking , but was assured that they do cook salmon to medium rare or medium upon requests and that their Norwegian salmon is fresh enough to be cooked this way . I went ahead with this item and it was very impressive ! The salmon was grilled on the edges and skin slightly crispy , but the interior was still moist and juicy . This item was the hot favourite among my 5 dining companions . <p> Honey Mustard Chicken Chop -- $6.90 <p> Butter rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this chicken chop and it is very tender . It is well marinated that the chicken is well flavoured and is n't bland at all . The chicken was grilled to perfection , with some edges slightly charred . I had experiences of tasteless chicken chops and I am glad that it does n't happen here . The honey mustard sauce is on sweet side . For fans of salty food there are other flavours to choose from . In terms of Singaporean chicken chop standards this falls under the " good " category . <p> Sizzling Hot Plate Black Pepper Pork Chop -- $9.90 <p> Spaghetti <p> The pork itself was well marinated to get rid of any odour , and the meat was tender but the black pepper sauce did n't match well . It 's better without the sauce in my opinion because I actually liked the meat itself . Many of us found this to be quite salty , so salt phobic people should opt for other pork chops instead . Not all pork chops here are marinated the same way , so each variation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7.90 <p> Glazed Carrots , creamy pasta , garden salad <p> Rosemary Lamb Chops -- $9.90 <p> Glazed carrots , creamy pasta , buttered rice <p> The cut of lamb used here is lamb shoulder , which has less odor as compared to the loin . The meat itself was tender and the marinating worked well for this to give the meat good flavor . <p> Vongole Aglio Olio with Abalone Clams -- $6.90 <p> This is not the traditional spaghetti alle vongole , but simply aglio olio with clams as the ingredients . There is no white wine in the sauce . The usage of chili padi was quite generous and it was spicy . The addition of abalone clams makes this dish unique , but also gives it a different character from authentic Italian pasta . Those looking for Italian pasta may think twice about this , but those looking for unique pastas can give it a try . <p> I do like how Barilla pasta is used here as it is a brand of pasta I trust . Even for home cooking , if I had to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it costs more than others . One of the most important factors about pasta for me is it being al dente . I can gladly say that this is quite al dente ! Many Singaporean " western stalls " often overcook their spaghetti and I ca n't help but feel offended . <p> Prawn Aglio Olio -- $7.90 <p> For those looking for traditional aglio olio , again , this pasta is not for you . The twist in this dish is that it uses butter along with olive oil . The sauce has a strong butter taste , which sort of overpowers the olive oil completely . It is nowhere as spicy as the vongole version above too . If you are used to traditional aglio olio , it may be quite hard to accept this as the butter and lack of spiciness essentially gives it a new character . The prawns however , were fresh and crunchy . <p> I would like to thank LavaRock for the invitation and warm hospitality . The food has generally surpassed my expectations and I do think I will return soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8/10 <p> Overall : comparing to their counterparts , LavaRock Grill house is one of the best coffeeshop western food I 've tried ! I like their extensive menu , personalize marination and flavouring for every dish , thoughtful plating , low prices and delicious food . <p> I 've heard of Swirls Bake Shop since a couple of months ago but it never piqued my interest because the location was very out of the way and my expectations of cupcakes are not easily met . <p> They are having a bazaar stall at Orchard Central until the 25 th December so I picked up 2 mini ones to try , since I did n't want to commit too many calories on the standard ones . <p> For $2.50 , these are extremely expensive considering the size . <p> My first impression is that these really resemble Magnolia Bakery 's cupcakes in terms of appearance , where the frosting is smeared on top and shapes with a spatula , instead of piping neatly . <p> And the verdict is : it tastes like Magnolia Bakery 's . <p> Whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I personally do not like Magnolia Bakery 's cupcakes so of course I did n't like this . <p> The cake was not the moistest ever , especially comparing to Twelve Cupcakes who managed to get the cake ( chocolate especially ) to be moist and " bouncy " . This one is somewhat moist but still crumbly/ loose . <p> What I did n't like at all was the frosting . This one tastes like it has no meringue in the buttercream . It tastes like simply butter/shortening + sugar + flavour . The frosting was rough and stiffer than meringue buttercream ( be it swiss or Italian meringue ) . Grains of sugar can be felt . You can also see from the appearance that the buttercream frosting looks rough and stiff . Whereas for Twelve Cupcakes , their buttercream is smooth and there are definitely no coarse grains to be felt . Swirls ' buttercream are also on the sweeter side . Do note that it is just my personal conjecture -- I do not know for sure their buttercream recipes . It could be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that leads to this difference , but what I do know for sure is that for these 2 cupcake shops , the end product of their buttercream is very different . Do choose the type you prefer . <p> Then again , they did claim to be American style so probably that 's why they resemble Magnolia Bakery which is popular in America due to its feature in Sex and the City . <p> Overall , I will not recommend Swirls Bake Shop because the cake was unimpressive , the buttercream frosting is not my type at all , and the price is very expensive compared to other cupcakes . <p> When I first stepped into Wimbly Lu , my first impression is that it resembles Open Door Policy , a lot . From mismatched vintage looking furniture , kitchen at the side , exposed brick walls to the glass ceiling and wooden flooring on half the premises only , it really resembles . However , ikea products can be spotted here and there so I guess the difference is that this place seems more homely and child friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait was about 20minutes . The area is not big and business is rather brisk given the very obscure location . Driving is a must because the nearest bus stop is a good 15 minutes ' walk away . <p> Menu wise , this place 's focus is obviously on the desserts and sweet stuff . They also carry a range of fruity beers and ciders . Despite the array of desserts , I already knew what I wanted to try before coming . <p> Every table has a unique tea light holder and I really liked this one . How pretty ! <p> Strawberry-Lime Cider -- $14.00+ <p> The ciders cost $14 for 500ml . I really liked this one . It was fruity and refreshing . <p> Strawberry-Wheat Beer -- $10.00+ <p> The Belgian beers cost $10 for 250ml . This beer was quite palatable with distinct strawberry taste . <p> Waffle with ice cream -- $8.50+ <p> This was what I was here for -- the waffle ! I had it with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce . The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gelare , A &W),; not Belgian waffles . I am a fan of waffles and I can safely say that the one here is a sure pass . What makes it stand out is the chocolate ice cream . Of course , since they are a chocolatier , that their chocolate would be good . The drawback is that the scoop of ice cream is really tiny . <p> Eton 's Mess -- $5.00+ <p> This one really looks like a mess . It has whipped cream , meringue and some berries I think . I did n't really try it . <p> Root Beer Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream -- $6.00+ <p> I am no fan of root beer so I did n't really try it either . <p> Blackout -- $6.00+ <p> This is one really black cake , it turned out black on my camera . It is essentially a chocolate cake , a very rich one . However , it was not as moist as Awfully Chocolate 's . <p> Lava Rock kindly invited me and 3 guests to try their new Thai BBQ Steamboat ( Mookata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House ( 6 outlets ) selling steak and others . <p> Personally my favourite BBQ would be Japanese Yakiniku because of the charcoal grill and good meat . My least favourite is the Korean type which I do not understand the hype it is experiencing right now . I once went to a Korean BBQ buffet which is popular among teenagers due to cheap pricing and had a terrible experience because the smoke was so bad I could n't even open my eyes . The enclosed space had poor ventilation and breathing was a chore too . They used a hot plate for the grill which resulted in terrible smoke . Needless to say , everyone who left the place smelt bad and they even provided Febreeze ( which did not really help ) . It did n't help that I ended up with the worst stomach ache ever . <p> For LavaRock Thai BBQ , it is located in a coffeeshop in Hougang , next to their Grill House outlet . The ventilation is ample and there were several strong power fans to provide comfort and good circulation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a peace of mind . <p> The main difference between Mookata and the typical Chinese BBQ Steamboat at Bugis is that the grill is in the centre , while the soup is surrounding ! The juices from the grilled food will trickle down into the soup , giving it great flavour towards the end . <p> We were given a 3-4pax set , with additional beef and fish skin . The set normally comes with everything but the additional 2 . I have not eaten Mookata before but comparing to pictures from other restaurants , the ingredients used seems to be typical of Mookata . And that includes sausage and crabstick . I initially thought they were there to suit taste buds of kids but I guess it 's a Mookata thing . <p> We chose the chicken soup for our soup base . The owner James explained that the chicken used was free range chicken for best flavour . Indeed the flavour of the broth was very good . The other option was Tom Yum . It was a tough choice to decide on one ! <p> Charcoal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charcoal grill makes a huge difference to the outcome of the cooking . I am glad they stuck to this tradition , unlike some places which deviated by using other types of heat . BBQ should always have charcoal . The cooking process is meant to be slow and steady . The heat is gentle and the soup will not be bubbling hot . I noticed that my meat did not overcook even when left too long on the grill , which is a good thing because I had my fair share of burnt meat at other BBQ concepts . Due to the slow cooking process , the entire meal took around 2 hours to complete , so this is not a quick fix . The charcoal lasted about that long too . <p> These are to be dipped into the soup for 3 seconds ( do not soak ) for best texture . The fried fish skin was really good ! <p> This is the beef after grilling . It is marinated in sesame margarine . The same marinade is used for the pork and the chicken . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked the pork and beef most . It was very tender . The beef tasted up to my expectations but it was the pork which exceeded my expectations . The pork was very tender and well marinated , tasting somewhat like satay but better . The beef is of good and fresh quality so it can be cooked to preferred doneness . This is important because beef is best eaten medium/ medium rare , and if it was n't fresh and must be cooked through , it defeats the purpose of eating beef . Adding $10 for the beef is very worth it . <p> Pork lard was provided to grease the grill pan . Again , it is a Mookata thing because other Mookata restaurants uses lard too . The benefit of this over the common margarine is that it does n't melt too quickly . <p> Towards the end , the grill got really black but it can be changed for a clean one if required . The good thing is that the soot does not stick onto your meat somehow . Also , the process is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mookata is traditionally meant to be eaten with many diners but realistically speaking , it is not very possible because of different dietary restrictions if your party has such . The soup can not be split and whatever is grilled goes into the soup so the end product is a mixture of pork , beef and seafood . There are quite many people who have to abstain from at least one of these , so it can be a challenge to have it together . Do take this into consideration before deciding to go , because it is really not possible to isolate the different food groups , unless you get 2 pots . <p> Overall , the Mookata experience is quite interesting , and I do hope that this becomes more common in Singapore . Currently there are very few places which serve Mookata so you could consider LavaRock if you wish to try . The large set plus extra beef and fish skin is probably only enough for 3 people because I did not leave feeling very full -- only satiated . <p> The total cost of the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai BBQ I guess , especially since the meat here is of good quality . ( around $17 -- $23 per pax , depending on whether you have 3 or 4 sharing ) . It is a much cheaper alternative to Japanese Yakiniku or Korean BBQ for sure ! <p> Special thanks again to LavaRock for the invite ! <p> ***** <p> Food : 7.5/10 <p> Value : 7.5/10 <p> Overall : I like the concept of Mookata and would recommend it to Singaporeans ! <p> Breakfast ( or brunch , when eaten at lunch time ) food is all in the rage now with plenty of new ventures sprouting all over . The mark up for simple breakfast food is quite unjustifiable to me , especially since it is not difficult to prepare yourself . I happened to have all the ingredients I need so I decided to have it for brunch today ! <p> Hungry Bird 's Pancakes <p> ( Makes 8 Pancakes of about 10 -- 12cm in diameter ) <p> Recipe adapted from Martha Stewart <p> Ingredients <p> 1 cup all-purpose flour , ( spooned and leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1/2 teaspoon salt <p> 1 cup milk ( choose a good tasting milk . HL is not milk so please do n't use that ) <p> 2 tablespoons canola oil ( or butter melted , or any oil you like ) <p> 1 large egg <p> 1 tablespoon canola oil ( for greasing ) <p> Directions <p> Whisk together flour , sugar , baking powder , and salt and set aside . <p> In a large enough bowl , whisk together milk , oil , and egg . <p> Add dry ingredients to milk mixture and combine with a whisk until rather smooth . ( do not overbeat ) <p> Heat a frying pan over medium low heat . Grease the pan with oil . <p> Spoon batter and cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst , 1 to 2 minutes . Flip carefully with a thin spatula , and cook until browned on the underside , 1 to 2 minutes more . <p> Repeat until batter is used up . <p> Serve immediately <p> Notes : <p> Bubbles give the pancakes more character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blueberries immediately after spooning batter onto the frying pan . <p> The heat has to be low . About 2 or 3 on the magic cooker is just right . <p> I did not re-grease the pan because it was oily enough ( the batter is oily ) . <p> I made it again , but this time I had not enough milk so it was about half milk half water to make up the amount . I added a bit more baking powder ( I use double acting , because that 's all I have at home ) and I forgot to add sugar . I cooked it at an even lower heat . The results are thick , fluffy pancakes , with a slightly hardened surfaced , very different from the soft McDonald styled pancakes as of above . Tweak the recipe to your preference . <p> I 've been to Royal China once last year and was satisfied with their standards . I would n't say they have the best dim sum in Singapore , because strictly speaking , for each individual item I could name somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 70/100 and above range , thus the whole meal is really pleasant . <p> BBQ Pork Pastry <p> If I had to name an item which Royal China has better than other places in Singapore , it has to be the Char Siew Soh . The pastry is of the perfect flakiness . I have to clarify that I am not a specific fan of char siew soh , and do not usually order this normally from average places , but this rendition here is really good . <p> Peking Duck with Caviar <p> This Peking Duck is also better than most other place 's , but not as fantastic as Paradise Pavillion 's ( $88++ ) . However , from the same league ( about $66++ a duck ) , this is better than the other contenders . <p> Duck with Scallions <p> The remaining meat was stir fired with scallions at an additional charge of $20 . It was really good ! Tender and no animalic duck smell . <p> Roast Pork <p> The skin is crispy , but in the prawn cracker kind of crispiness -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't very warm when served as well . <p> Custard Buns <p> On the menu , they mentioned that their custard buns have mango juice , but I honestly could n't make it out in the taste . The custard was flowy , but perhaps a little too flowy . The bun texture was n't the best either . It was rather rough and dry . Overall , it is not bad , but not anywhere near Taste Paradise / Paradise Pavilion 's standards . <p> Egg Tarts <p> These egg tarts are almost as good as Imperial Treasure Teochew Cuisine 's ( but I heard the consistency is n't always there . If you 're lucky you 'll get really good ones ) . Highly recommended . <p> Century Egg Congee <p> I felt that the flavour of the porridge was lacking , but texture wise it was soft and fluffy enough . <p> Siew Mai <p> Pretty good <p> Har Kau <p> The skin is pretty weird this time , kind of soggy .

Quite a good choice over the common noodles and fried rice . <p> The standard here remains top notch and I hope the next time I get to try more of their non-dim sum items . <p> I am sure many would be curious whether these ' Celebrity Chef ' restaurants which surfaced in Singapore 's two Integrated Resorts over the recent years are really of their reputed award winning standards , or simply just an expensive brand name . I was making the decision between L'Atelier and Joel Robuchon because we had some expiring vouchers , but settled with the former because there was n't really any occasion to justify splurging on the latter . <p> We were provided with ala carte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8 course degustation which cost $260++/pax . <p> L'AMUSE-BOUCHE <p> Foie gras custard with red Porto wine and parmesan foam <p> This was a good start to the meal . The layers of flavours went well together . <p> LE CAVIAR OSCIETRE <p> Ossetra caviar over capellini dressed with fresh tomatoes <p> I think this was where everything sort of started to disappoint . There was nothing memorable about this dish . It was n't bad , but it was n't good , thus unmemorable . <p> LE CRABE ROYAL <p> King crab on a daikon wrapping cannelloni style <p> This one is n't unmemorable , but it was bad . The whole combination did n't seem <p> L'OURSIN <p> Sea urchin on a shellfish custard with creamy corn foam <p> This one was n't too bad . In fact , I sort of liked it . I like how there 's custard below but the flavours were n't extraordinary . <p> LEE FFOOIIEE GGRRAASS <p> Pan seared foie gras with apricots , rosemary and dates <p> As much as I am a foie gras lover , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mentioned this was duck foie gras ) this time , because the execution does no justice to the poor duck . Even budget French bistro Saveur does it better . <p> LA SOLE <p> Dover sole cooked on the bone , basil broth and artichokes <p> When I saw that sole was part of the menu , I already was mentally prepare to not expect anything great . I was right . It was just so ordinary . Rarely can sole/ halibut impress me. this one had hints of unfresh fish smell . <p> LA CAILLE <p> Foie gras filled free-range quail with mashed potatoes <p> My dining partner has this . It was pretty normal . <p> LE BOEUF <p> French-style hanger steak with shallots <p> This cut of meat tends to have some funky smell and taste , and the one serve here did not escape this fate . I did n't like this . However , the cooking was fine and the meat was tender . <p> L'EXOTIQUE <p> Exotic flavours of the island and coconut ice cream <p> I do n't really like coconut and overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Creamy araguani chocolate with cacao sorbet and oreo cookie <p> This one was not so ordinary and in fact , it was pretty good . <p> Chamomile tea to end off the meal . <p> Overall , the food was mediocre at best , with only 2 and a half items among the lot that stood out . The restaurant was pretty crammed , not something deem as good ambiance . The service was quite friendly though . <p> ***** <p> Ambience : 7.5/10 <p> Food : 6/10 <p> Value : 2/10 <p> Overall : this is the first time I 've graded a fail score for value but really , spend your money somewhere else . If I had to name a price for this menu for the value to rise up to a score of 6 the most I would

##1848252 <p> In his first solo show in Asia , Australian artist Tony Lloyd explores the relationship between natural and constructed worlds through his dramatic paintings . Cultivating a subtle style of photo-realism , Lloyd meticulously captures dark and moody atmospheric scenarios , reminiscent of auteurs of film noir , such as Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch . Manipulating the surfaces of his canvasses to create tonal variations that are thoughtfully observed , Lloyd conjures something more akin to a metaphor , disallowing his images to be fully comprehensible , presenting us instead with individual moments of a greater whole . <p> " The image loses its anchor to a particular place , a particular time . The idea of " where " and " when " becomes abstracted . In the imaginary timeframed of painting a sense of timelessness becomes possible and diverse moments can exist concurrently " , says Lloyd . Working from photographic images , which record a fleeting moment of the past , the artist translates into paint enigmatic scenes with ominous undertones that defy the notion of past , present of future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting at RMIT University , gaining his MA in 2001 .

##1849650 <p> The hidden hand of personality in your career by Atul Mathur ? 2004 . All Rights Reserved . Atul Mathur is the author of the ebook " The Secret Of Finding The Right Career Direction . " Web site : http : //atulmathur.com <p> My friend John ( not his real name ) came to me with a work-related problem that could cost him his job . He worked in a multi-national company and his job was to carry out quantitative analysis of equities . <p> His problem : he was prone to committing mistakes in his work . So much so that his boss had already given him an ultimatum to either improve or leave the job in next few months . <p> As we discussed about his background , he casually mentioned that he had once taken a personality test and he remembered he was INTJ . The moment he uttered those four letters , I realized how the hidden hand of his personality was causing John all the trouble at the work . <p> Personality is one of those vague things that we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially its implications on our career . <p> Let 's look at what personality means , how you can find yours , what is the relationship between personality and occupation and finally , what can you do once you know your own personality . <p> Four dimensions of personality Carl Jung , a Swiss psychologist , originally came up with a theory to describe personality . He called it Personality Type . Later , Personality Type was adopted , modified and applied in the real world by an American woman Katharine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers . <p> According to the Personality Type , there are four dimensions of a person 's personality : <p> **25;3743;TOOLONG ( E-I ) : It is about where a person prefers to focus his attention . <p> Sensing-Intuition ( S-N ) : This dimension indicates how a person prefers to get information . <p> Thinking-Feeling ( T-F ) : This dimension reveals how a person prefers to make decisions . <p> Judging-Perceiving ( J-P ) : This dimension measures how a person prefers to deal with the outer world . <p> Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural inclination to use one of the two preferences more than the other . For example , some people may think and then make decisions ( thinking type ) while others may base their decisions on their feelings ( feeling type ) . <p> Knowing our personality means knowing our preferences on each of the four dimensions . Combinations of the above preferences result in 16 distinct personality types as below : <p> Experts say that everyone conforms to one of the 16 personality types . <p> What 's your personality type ? There are three ways to know your personality type : <p> Take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ? ) test , which is one of the most widely used tests for assessing personality type . There are several organizations offering MBTI test for a fee . You can get more information on this test from CPP , Inc. ' s Web site : http : //www.cpp.com . This is the most accurate way of knowing your personality type . <p> Personality and occupation Studies show a clear correlation between people 's personalities and their occupations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in creative occupations , such as architects , writers , research scientists , etc. , were mostly intuitive ( I ) type of people . <p> Findings from another study showed : <p> Majority of the accounts were ST ( sensing-thinking ) type . These are the people who prefer to focus on facts and figures ( sensing ) and use logic and analysis for making decisions ( thinking ) . Incidentally , this is where John was having trouble . He was NT and therefore , his sensing of data/figures was not that strong , resulting in mistakes . <p> Majority of customer service/relations professionals were SF ( sensing-feeling ) type . SF 's like to focus their attention on the outer world ( in this case people ) and also like to employ their feelings . <p> Majority of creative writers were NF ( intuitive-feeling ) type . These people work with their imagination and bring feeling/emotions into their work . <p> Majority of research scientists were NT ( intuitive-thinking ) . They like to use their imagination to go into uncharted territories and also use analytical thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in roles like marketing , sales , customer service , etc. , which allow them to deal with other people . Introverts , on the other hand , would be effective in occupations/roles that leave them alone to work . <p> Studies also show that when people enter into occupations that do not suit their personality , they struggle and eventually leave them . <p> So , what should you do ? For the sake of your own career , you can do the following : <p> Find out your personality type and study closely the characteristics of your type ( from books and the Web ) <p> Embrace work/situations that match with your personality type . <p> Avoid , if possible , work/situations that do not match with your personality type . <p> The bottom line : use the hidden hand 
##1851151 <p> Sunday , 7 It was first Sunday so many turned up for the alms offering opportunity . After one month break , Ven . Chun Zi returned and gave us a Dharma talk . Her topic today is " Aversion " . Aversion is a negative feeling and could make one feel depress and frustrated . Every individual reacts differently to the feeling of aversion . Some felt that there is a dead end , some would make a big fuss and some may choose to remain silent . The negative feelings not only affect our emotion , it also creates a bad impact on our health . Our liver , heart and kidney would be the first to receive this bad impact . In a nutshell , there are 3 types of " Aversion " : - a ) Aversion with a reason ; b ) Aversion without a reason ; c ) Aversion with agreement . Venerable Chun Zhi ended the talk by advising us on how to deal with aversion . She said one needs to practice mindfulness or awareness . Thru practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dealt with it accordingly . Thru learning how to forgive and let go grudges , we would be a happier person . Everyone was reminded of the next Sunday 's event of " Song Pret " , the second half of Thai version of the Chinese 7th month . This would be the sending off after having invited departed relatives and friends 2 weeks ago to share merits accrued through wholesome and meritorious deeds of alms offering , Abhidhamma chanting , etc . The schedules for Introduction to Buddhism and Vipassana Meditation for 2013 are also finalized . Registration is now open for both courses . Please to to Notice Board and click on the link for course dates and registration details . <p> Sunday , 14 - This Sunday 's Dhamma speaker is Brother Sebastian Wong . His topic was " Listening &; Hearing the dhamma as a factor to stream entry " . He shared that getting into the stream entry is very important that it is said to be of higher importance than having lordship over the world . Once a person enters the stream he/she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we do not become stream enterer , to be born in a life where Dhamma is within our reach is considered to be very good as well . The Lord Buddha said that to encounter the Dhamma of the Buddha is extremely difficult and to be born a human being is so rare . Brother Wong shared about the story of the turtle in the ocean , the probability of this turtle coming up for air and put its head through a hole , the size of its head , of a piece of driftwood is how rare a human birth is . As before , Brother Wong advised that when we encounter a monk , we should ask for instructions which will be of long term welfare and benefit to us and not just ask for blessings which is considered short term . When we are advised and we correct our views then it is of long term benefit to us . When we listen to the Dhamma and put what we learnt into practice , we will see the radiance of the Dhamma and have peace of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practise them , it protects our family for we do not take lives and so no harm from revenge will come to us , we do not conduct adultery which in turn harms the spouse and by not stealing from others we also safeguard our neighbours as we do not steal from them . On one occasion Lord Buddha advised Gotami on what qualifies as Buddha 's teaching . The Lord said if the teaching teaches that when it is time to let go , we let go , of self- pride which frees the mind then it is His teaching . This is because when we develop the mind , we develop the wisdom and to free the mind means we do not cling to what leads to samsara . Brother Wong said that Lord Buddha knew that in the future there may be teachings which would be passed on as His , so He advised that we check for consistency in His teaching and compare what is said to teachings which were previously recorded as yardstick to His teaching . Today is also the second part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sangha led the devotees to Abhidhamma chanting , followed by alms offering and Sanghadana ( offering of requisites to the Sangha ) . <p> Sunday , 21 - Third Sunday of the month and scheduled Dhamma speaker , Ven Rathanasara gave a talk on " How to let go of grudges " . He said that before we go into what causes a grudge , we need to firstly know what happens in the mind . Our 5 faculties of eyes , ears , nose , tongue and body come into contact with light , sound , smell , taste and sensations and upon contact with the outside world make thoughts to arise . When we come into contact with nice sounds , we feel happy and when we see nice sights we have pleasant thoughts . Our minds are always attracted ( raga ) to nice things and desire pleasurable and pleasant sensations . If we come into contact with things we do not like , we kick them out ( repulsion ) , we push the thoughts out of our mind . Ven said in Buddhism this is dosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of all this happening in our minds ( moha ) , we do not have the awareness of their arising in the mind . Grudges arise because of raga ( attraction ) , dos a ( hatred , ill will ) and moh a ( Delusion ) . To grudge is a concept we create in our mind to take revenge or cause harm to the other person . Grudges arise from the root of hatred ( dosa ) , anger arises because we do not understand and mindful about the things in life . Human beings complain about the winds , the sun , the rain and many other situations in life . Grudges also arise when we do not like someone , we find faults with the person 's mannerism and from dislike we start to criticise and from words and exchanges we start quarrel resulting in the start of the grudge . Venerable said that keeping a grudge harms a person both physically and mentally . It is like a disease to the mind and as mind is the forerunner of all thoughts , it is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a person to develop high blood pressure due to the anger and from this it can lead to other chronic illnesses to the physical body . To avoid all this it is important that we prevent a grudge from being created in the first place . We have to discard the thoughts which start a grudge by the following 5 ways as taught by the Lord Buddha . 1 . Replace evil thoughts with good thoughts . When we have anger we replace the feeling with loving kindness , when we feel cruelty creeping up , we replace the feeling with compassion , ill with goodwill and jealousy with appreciative joy . According to Venerable all these feelings can be replaced if we practice at it . 2 . Contemplate the danger of having evil thoughts , treat them like viruses . 3 . Divert our attention to other things , forgive the person and forget about taking revenge 4 . Stilling the thoughts formation . Sit somewhere quiet and sense how these are arising and passing . Contemplate on anicca ( impermanence ) , dukkha ( suffering ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving- kindness ) meditation . With meditation practice we are able to replace bad thoughts with good ones . Venerable advises us to put the above 5 into practice simultaneously so that we can eradicate the grudges which have already arisen and prevent grudges from starting . Abbot has been away in Kelantan attending an official ceremony held by the Sultan of Kelantan . He arrived back in the afternoon to attend the volunteers ' meeting on Kathina in November . He gave a brief account of his trip before proceeding with the volunteers meeting . As with all pre- event meetings , the attendees went through all requirements in details . This year 's celebration will be a special one because it also includes the 50th Anniversary of the temple and its founder , Tok Raja . Sangha members and some lay devotees from Kelantan will also be joining the ceremony . The event will begin it 's celebration from Saturday evening of 17 November . All details were carefully covered to ensure a perfect celebration . <p> Sunday , 28 Last Sunday of the month concluded with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3- part talk on " Why Buddhism ? " . Today will be part of a 3- part talk on the topic of why we chose Buddhism as our religion . This Sunday 's Part 1 was about " Buddha , the Great Founder " . Dr Ang said there are 3 main factors to consider when we consider a religion . The Founder -- Who is the Founder of Buddhism - Lord Buddha was a living man like us and he was born like us and went through life as a person with privileged background . Is the founder worthy of respect and does he practise what he taught ? The Buddha started the revolution of casting aside the caste system . Anyone monk who was ordained earlier would be considered a senior irrespective of whether the person is more junior in age or caste . He brought Himself to the level of ordinary people even though He was of higher caste . Lord Buddha had the compassion which is incomparable to other beings and He is truly enlightened . How would an ordinary human being able to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker system ? How is it that He is able to speak all the dialects of India at that time , for when he addressed villages all over His teachings reached the audience 's ears as their own mother tongue . The Buddha taught that we as Buddhists take care of 4 groups of people : our parents , our teachers , our nation and all beings . We would not have this life if not for our parents . Our teachers guide us on our path , the nation provides shelter so to enable us a protected life and all other beings from farmers who cultivated our food to even the smallest of insects have their part to play . Dr Ang would be continuing the other 2 parts of this talk in the following talks at UBT . Kathina celebration is drawing near and volunteers and devotees are beginning to help in areas that need to be done in preparation for the big event . A volunteers ' meeting is scheduled for next Sunday , 4 November after lunch . Anyone who wishes to participate is welcome to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the 3- Day event . Kathina sponsorship registration is still open for anyone/group who wishes to participate
