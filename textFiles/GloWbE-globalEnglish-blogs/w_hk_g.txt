##1132450 <p> We are a group of teachers and researchers from the School of Economics and Finance . Through this blog , we hope to share our views and excitements with the community , our former students and our current students . Comments are welcome ( blog@sef.hku.hk ) . <p> Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer , replaced Steve Jobs as the chief executive of Apple . To step down must have been a heart-wrenching decision to Jobs because Apple is Jobs ' baby literally . No mother will voluntarily abandon the custody of her children , suggesting that Jobs ' health must be in serious condition . <p> The news of Jobs ' departure should matter to many investors as Apple 's shares are widely held by U.S. investors . Currently , Apple is one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of approximately $350 billion . Does the market have confidence in Cook to become a long-term chief executive at Apple ? The answer is unambiguously NO . <p> Following Cook 's announcement , Apple 's shares dropped by 5.15% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 0.65% in the following close . In contrast , S &P; 500 index was nearly flat in the after-markets trading and in the following open . Yet , it dropped by 1.56% in the following close . The unfavorable stock market reaction to Cook 's announcement is in sharp contrast to other CEO appointments at Apple . Table 1 shows that Apple 's shares rose significantly when it hired CEOs from outside the company . Precisely , its stock price rose by 5.7% for John Sculley and 3.08% for Gilbert Amelio when they were named the CEO of Apple , respectively . In contrast , Apple 's shares dropped slightly when its CEOs were promoted from within the firm . <p> Yet , the unfavorable stock market reaction to Cook 's appointment reflects only a portion of the negative impact once Jobs leaves the company permanently . This is because the possibility that Cook will replace Jobs as Apple 's CEO has already been anticipated by the market . Specifically , Jobs had taken three medical leaves prior to his departure announcement . Table 2 presents the stock market reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Similarly , another indication that the market has no great confidence in Cook is that when he was named the chief operating officer of Apple -- a successor for Steve Jobs -- Apple 's shares dropped by 1% while S &P; 500 index rose by 0.3 percent . This stock price reaction was worse than that for Michael Spindler when he was named Apple 's chief operating officer -- its shares rose by 1.5% while S &P; 500 index dropped by 0.18% . <p> The negative stock market reaction to Cook 's appointment is clear and consistent with findings in existing literature . Extant studies find that stock prices rise when firms appoint CEOs through external hiring but drop when they are appointed through internal promotions . Further , current studies also indicate that ability appears higher for CEOs appointed through external hiring rather than internal promotions . <p> Should stockholders be relieved as Apple 's shares fell only slightly following Jobs ' departure announcement ? The answer is affirmative as long as Steve Jobs is still functional and can maintain his influence at Apple . One indication of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the board position . Jobs can still make all major corporate and innovation decisions at Apple . This is vital to Apple as existing studies show that founders add value to companies even when they take merely a chairman position in the companies . Further , Jobs had been successful in running Apple even when he took just a nominal position . Jobs pulled many strings to revive Apple when he was just an unpaid adviser ( and not even the interim CEO ) of Apple in 1997 . In addition , Apple has plenty of cash to retain top talent and fund product innovation : Apple has cash and securities worth approximately $76 billion . Apple will continue to rake in generous profit from its highly successful products , e.g. , iPod , iPhone , and iPad . The product line in the near term has also been established under Jobs ' helm . <p> Nevertheless , product innovation is likely to become a major problem when Jobs leaves Apple permanently . No one can truly replace Steve Jobs , an iconic founder like the late Henry Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership , Apple invented many wildly successful products such as Macintosh , iPod , iPhone , and iPad . Jobs is also a revolutionist . Apple 's success is built on its ability to innovate and expands its reach to other markets . Prior to Jobs ' return in 1997 , Apple was merely a computer company . During the history of Apple from 1980-1997 , the most Apple could earn a single quarter was merely $188 million in net income . Jobs transformed Apple into a trendy consumer electronic company . In particular , Apple made a sizable profit from its widely popular electronic products . Apple 's quarterly net income broke the $1.5 billion mark after iPhone was introduced and shortly reached the $6 billion mark after iPad was introduced . <p> Cook is widely recognized for his ability as an effective manager , particularly for operational matters . Nevertheless , he has no track record in product innovation , the heart and soul of Apple 's success . Further , Cook has no experience in running a large public corporation on his own . As Jobs has literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict whether Cook can even run Apple smoothly once Jobs leaves the company for good . Winning is easy when the best player is on your team . Scottie Pippen won six NBA champions with the Chicago Bulls when he was playing with Michael Jordan but none when Michael Jordan retired . <p> As the business landscape can change rapidly , it is doubtful whether Cook can weather any future dynamic challenges . Competition is ferocious down the road as many companies have positioned themselves to compete directly with Apple . Importantly , Apple is a large complex organization with employees of 46,600 fiercely loyal to Jobs , their charismatic leader . It is unclear whether loyalty is transferable here when Jobs is gone for good . As Apple 's savior , Jobs has been under tremendous pressure from customers , media , shareholders , and critics for numerous issues . Examples of these issues include the options-backdating practices , the unusual compensation practices , especially for granting mega options to executives , declaring no cash dividend , CEO succession plan , and its highly centralized corporate governance practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expectations from Apple 's stakeholders can be quite high for Cook . Can Cook survive under all these challenges ? The answer should be obvious . <p> The author is especially grateful to Tim Hau and Frances Xu for their insightful comments .

##1133052 <h> THE LEGACY OF DENNIS BRAIN <p> Dennis Brain ( 1921-1957 ) <p> From Horn Call April , 1991 Vol . XXI No.2 by Michael Meckna <p> The horn players who picked up where Giovanni Punto left off 150 years previously , restored the four Mozart and two Strauss concertos to the repertory , inspired Hindemith , Britten , and others to write for his instrument , and set the standard for twentieth-century horn soloists accomplished his life work by age thirty-six . We can only speculate about what Dennis Brain might have accomplished had he lived the Biblical allotment of four score and ten years . However , his sterling example is immortal , and a look at this legacy is most appropriate in what would have been the 70th year of his life . <p> Dennis Brain was born on May 17 , 1921 , into a London horn-playing family . Both his father , Aubrey Brain , and uncle , Alfred , Jr. , played professionally , as did their father , Alfred , Sr. However , it was not inevitable that young Dennis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eventually became an oboist after beginning a career in chemistry . Dennis showed an interest in his father 's instrument from the age of three , but was allowed to play a few notes only on Saturday mornings as a treat . Aubrey believed that students should not take up the horn seriously until their teen years , when teeth and embouchure were fully developed . <p> Therefore , Dennis 's first formal music study was on the piano and later on the organ . In 1936 he left St. Paul 's School for the Royal Academy of Music where he studied with his father . Any hint of nepotism must have been erased by Dennis 's having won the prestigious Stokes scholarship in open competition . The young hornist also earnestly continued his keyboard studies , piano with Max Pirani , and organ with the renowed G.D . Cunningham . Dennis made his debut on October 6 , 1938 , when he and his fahter played the First Brandenburg Concerto with the Busch Chamber Players in Queen 's Hall . The event caused much favorable comment , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps up its traditions in the representative of the new generation . Son seconded father with a smoothness and certainty worthy of his name . " <p> During World War II , Brain joined the Royal Air Force Central Band as principal horn . In his smart blue uniform he played concertos throughout Britain , winning immediate success and popularity . A goodwill tour of America brought him an invitation from Stokowski to join the Philadelphia Orchestra after the war , but this was just one of many invitations Brain received when that event took place . Although he eventually took the job of principal horn of the Royal Philharmonic and later principal of the elite Philharmonia Orchestra , he was the most sought-after hornist for chamber music and soloist with orchestra everywhere . He began making a series of now classic recordings of concertos by Mozart , Strauss and Hindemith , as well as numerous chamber works and recital pieces . Seeking new challenges , he began giving concerts in which he both played and conducted , and he founded a wind quintet which quickly won fame . This quintet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just after , while driving back to London , Brain was killed in a car accident . <p> Benjamin Britten has written of that fateful night that " ... it has robbed us of an artist with the unique combination of superb technical command of his instrument , gerat musicianship , a lively and intelligent interest in music of all sorts , and a fine performing temperament , coupled with charming personality . " Nevertheless , we do have a legacy of solo recordings , even if it is a slender one . There are the Mozart , Strauss , and Hindemith concertos , the Britten Serenade , and a handful of recital pieces . ( Columbia was to have Brain record the Haydn Concertos and the Brahms Trio during the winter of 1957-58 . ) The parts he contributed to chamber and orchestral works complete the picture , along with a film of him and Denis Matthews playing the Beethoven Horn Sonata , op. 17 . <p> Brain approaches Beethoven 's classic work with his usual firm , round tone , delicacy of execution , and subtle phrasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil , and Barry Tuckwell , Brain seems almost too delicate , until one bears in mind that Beethoven intended the work as a sonata for horn and piano . That is to say , the two instruments should be equal partners , and Brain must have aimed for this effect . His sound is smaller than Baumann 's , less agressive than Civil 's , and suaver than Tuckwell 's , and he never dominates the piano . ( In fairness it must be said that the alternate interpretation is also valid , portraying the horn as a solitary outsider , a hunter from the woods , who has only just bathed and shaved and begun to learn the sort of **25;56;TOOLONG which the sonatas of Beethoven 's early period generally reflect . ) <p> Brain 's Mozart concertos show a similar style . There is the same blend of assurance and taste that has made him inimitable , and even though recorded during pre-stereo days , the sound is full and rich . Barry Tuckwell 's interpretation may have more coloratura style , and Alan Civil 's may sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smooth tone , clean articulation , and distinctive phrasing . Brain also had a fine talent for composition , as evidenced by the cadenzas to the fist movements of the third and fourth concertos . <p> Not the least of Brain 's achievements was to have inspired additions to the horn literature . Along with Britten and Hindemith , Malcom Arnold , York Bowen , G. Bryan , Peter Racine Fricker , Gordon Jacob , Elisabeth Lutyens , and others wrote music for this musician who seemed to be able to play anything . Britten 's Serenade for tenor , horn , and strings ( 1943 ) , a composition which did much to establish both musician 's fame , is a splendid example of the kind of composer-performer collaboration which continually animates music . Britten once recalled that Brain 's help was invaluable in writing the work and that some of his " happiest musical experiences were conducting it for him and Peter Pears-a succession of wonderful performances progressing from the youthful exuberances and brilliance of the early days to the maturity and deep understanding of the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ten years later Britten wrote a second piece for Brain , again with tenor but this time with piano accompaniment . This is the elegiac Canticle , written to a tragic poem by Edith Sitwell , and Brain set the standard for its performance with his playing of the dark opening , slithering chromatic scales , and thunderous low notes . On final work , now a classic , can be added to this distingished list : Poulenc 's Elegy . Dedicated to Brain 's memory , the piece was premiered exactly a year after his death by Neill Scanders with the composer at the piano . <p> At the beginning of his career Brain played on a Raoux French horn , a twin of his father 's , but in 1951 he changed to a German Alexander to get a more robust sound . This switch from a French to a German horn was a sign of the times . Also a sign of the times was that a brass instrumentalist in general and a horn player in particular could take a place in the solo spotlight . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound plagued with bubbles and cracks , his son showed that it could be an unforgettably beautiful solo instrument . He established performance standards by which players are still measured . Eugene Ormandy spoke for countless admirers when he said , " Dennis Brain had no peer . " <h> A Seventieth-Birthday Tribute <h> I. Dennis as a hornist <p> no one has ever played more sensitively and with such musical phrasing and melancholy <p> the embodiment of correct horn-playing and fundamentally <p> no matter what brand of horn he played , it sounded great <p> his use of air , phrasing and overall musical integrity made him without equal <p> there were and are many technically great horn players , but his taste gave him an edge <p> he was superb ; no one has ever surpassed him ; everything he played seemed to be easy <p> one of the extraordinary hornists of our time ; his technique was the finest and cleanest of anyone of his era . <p> I heard Dennis live only one : Thomas Beecham was conducting an early 1950 's U.S. tour ' Dennis sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trombone , but incredibly accurate <p> no one could make a better soft high entrance <h> II . Dennis as a recording artist <p> Dennis was the first horn soloist to have a significant body of works commercially available in the U.S. facilitating the study of major literature by other hornists as a style , phrasing and other pararmeters of his flawless technique ; I wish the recording industry at that time had advanced further in terms of accurately recording and reproducing live sound <p> after listening to at least two dozen recordings of the Mozart concerti , I always turn to the Dennis Brain recordings as the eptiome of the very highest of Mozart and Strauss concerti albums , and I wanted my horn to sound just like his . <p> a legendary artist who has had the greatest effect in the musical world since Giovanni Punto ; a very meticulous musician <p> those who knew his playing through his recordings were constantly trying to attain his perfection ; may those almost 40-year old recordings be reissued forever <p> as a student , I was so taken by his Villanelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many young players may own only one horn recording , but it is a Dennis Brain recording <p> all of my students are required to hear Brain 's Mozart recordings ; this is the greatest example of what horn playing is all about <p> although his recordings have been around so long , my appreciation for them is renewed every time I see the delight of a young student who has just discovered him ; I still feel the thrill of discovering orchestral recordings such as the little solo at the end of the second of Strauss 's Four Last Songs <p> the first solo horn recording I ever heard was a Columbia 10-inch LP ( catalog number ML 2088 recorded in 1950 ) of Dennis with Walter Susskind and the Philharmonia performing Mozart 's second horn concerto and Dennis with the Hall ? Orchestra performing Mozart 's fourth horn concerto ; I had just taken up the horn after switching from cornet , and that recording inspired me to practice <h> III . Dennis as a person <p> dignified <p> mannerly <p> happy and congenial <p> humorous <p> humble about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretension <p> friendly to all <p> respectful of other people , their ideas and their preformance styles even if they were contrary to his own <h> IV . Dennis as a colleague <p> he brought our entire profession up several notches until we all were ( and continue to be ) very proud of our profession <p> Dennis was truly a colleague of the horn world and the music world in general ; he was one of the very best ambassadors for our profession ; when he toured with the London Symphony he always took time to visit with other hornists and musicians <h> V. Dennis as a role model <p> he is why I wanted to play the horn ; he is still my role model <p> the horn playing of Dennis Brain became the standard against which the efforts of everyone else who followed ( both great and not so great ) has been judged ; like with Mozart , everyone speculates " what would he have done if he lived another 36 years ? " ; all we do know is he will always be an inspiration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brain ( Dennis 's uncle here in Los Angeles ; he was first horn in the Los Angeles Philharmonic and first horn at Twentieth Century Fox studios ; much of his influence filtered down through his students and then to my generations ; it is through Alfred that I also feel a special affinity to Dennis <p> to me , Dennis is the perfect role model for the Classic literature of Haydn , Mozart and Beethoven ; his style and accuracy blended with woodwinds without destroying them ; everything about his horn playing was to be admired and copied <p> it 's hard to imagine what our repertoire would like if Dennis Brain had never been , and I 'd like to think that we pay tribute to his great contribution to the art every time we perform one of the many works written for or dedicated to him <p> we all tried but never quite succeeded 
##1133352 <h> A Window <h> A Fine Day for Kangarooing <p> As winter daily softens her grip I can sense spring in the warmth of the sunlight. ? Thank you again for yesterday 's interesting letter . <p> I enjoyed the part of your essay about spicing your hamburger steaks with nutmeg . It seemed real to me . I can clearly hear the " chop-chop " of your kitchen knife as it attacks the leeks . I can feel the warmth of your kitchen . I can smell it too . <p> Reading your letter really made me hungry for a hamburger steak . So I went directly to a restaurant to have one . At this restaurant they had eight different kinds of hamburger steaks . Believe it or not ! A Texas style and a California style , a Hawaiian flavor , and a Japanese style . The Texas steak was just big , nothing else . That was all there was to it . The Hawaiian steak came garnished with a slice of pineapple . I do n't remember what the California style was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant struck me as rather trendy . All of the waitresses were really cute , and they were also wearing short skirts . <p> However I did n't go to that restaurant to check out its interior or to stare at the waitresses . No , I went there to taste their basic hamburger steak . That 's what I told the waitress . But she apologized and said that they did n't have just a plain steak . Of course I ca n't blame the waitress . After all she did n't decide the menu . But she also was n't wearing such a short skirt that somebody could drop his silverware to look up at her panties . So I ordered a Hawaiian style hamburger steak . While I was eating it the waitress suggested that I just remove the pineapple . The world is such a strange place . All I really wanted was just a simple , ordinary hamburger steak. ? By the way how do you make your hamburger steaks ? After reading your letter , someday I really want to try one of your steaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket machine , and I thought it showed some improvement. ? The point of view was interesting . But I could n't really see the scenery or the situation . Maybe you are trying too hard . After all you ca n't change the world with a sentence . <p> Considering all of your writing I 'd give it about a 70 . And I do think it is improving . Do n't rush it , be patient . Good luck . I 'm looking forward to your next letter. ? By the way , it looks like spring is just around the corner , does n't it ? <p> P.S. Thanks for that box of assorted cookies . They were really good . However since personal fraternization outside of our letters is prohibited , please be more careful in the future and do n't send me any more packages . Thank you nonetheless . <p> P.S.S . In your letter before last I thought you explained your husband 's nervous problem very well . <p> And that was my job for a year when I was 22 . I signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know why it was called that . I got 2000 yen for each letter I wrote , and soon I was writing more than 30 letters every month . " You too will write letters that will echo in the bottom of your friend 's heart " --that was our company 's motto . " After paying a monthly fee and a sign-up fee , the clients write four letters every month . The " Pen Master " ? that is what we were called ? proceeds to edit the letters , offering feedback , guidance , and impressions . <p> Female " Pen Masters " write to men , and male " Pen Masters " write to women . All of my clients were older than me . About 15 were between the ages of 40 to 53 , but most of my clients were between 25 and 35 . I had a rough first month of writing letters . Why did all of my clients write better than me ? Because they were used to writing letters . Up to that point in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However my reputation grew . My clients told me this . After three months my writing power had nearly improved to a " leadership " role . It felt strange to get credit for helping these women . They trusted me and my guidance. ? At that time I did n't really understand , but later I realized that these women were all lonely . It did n't matter who wrote to them . Nor did it matter what they wrote in their letters. ? Maybe we all need to be needed . Maybe we all need to be forgiven . Maybe we all need somebody to share such feelings with . <p> Anyway that 's how I spent the winter and spring when I was 21 going on 22 . Surrounded by this harem of letters like a sea lion with a bad leg . <p> I answered many different kinds of letters . I answered boring letters . I answered pleasing letters and sad letters . I worked there for only one year but it felt like three . When I gave my notice my clients expressed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . It did n't have any point . But I had my own misgivings about quitting . I realized that I might never have a second chance to meet so many honest people . <p> Speaking of hamburger steaks , I finally did eat one cooked by that woman ( from my first letter ) . She was 32 , married but no kids . Her husband worked for the fifth most famous commercial firm in the world . When I wrote to tell her that I 'd be quitting at the end of the month , she invited me to her apartment for lunch . She promised to make me a basic hamburger steak . Even though such contact was against the company 's fraternization policy I accepted readily. ? I just could n't suppress my curiosity . Her apartment was near the Otachu train line . It was a neat , tidy , apartment , quite appropriate for a couple with no children . The furniture and the interior , even her sweater , they were n't so expensive but they looked nice . She looked younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked . Company policy also prohibited us from disclosing our ages . <p> Even though at first we were caught off guard , soon we loosened up and relaxed . It felt like we were two people who had become friends after just missing the same train and waiting together for the next one . We ate our steak and drank our coffee . The atmosphere was good . You could see the train from her 3rd story window . That day the weather was great . A lot of futons were being aired out on verandas . You could hear the whap-whap-whap of housewives beating them with bamboo brooms . The sound seemed to be coming from the bottom of a dry well , yet you could n't really tell how far away it was . The hamburger steak tasted great . It was spiced just right , and it was really juicy too . It was also covered with the just the right amount of gravy . After our coffee while listening to Burt Bacharach we started to tell our life stories . I did n't really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the talking . She told me that when she was a student she wanted to be a writer . She was a fan of the books of Franciose Sagan . Her story " Do you like Brahms ? " was one of her favorites . It was n't that I did n't like Sagan . She 's ok . People say she 's boring but I do n't really agree . <p> " But I ca n't write anything , " she complained . <p> " It 's never too late to start , " I suggested . <p> " But you are the one who told me that I ca n't write very well , " she said smiling . <p> I blushed . I used to blush often when I was 22 . <p> " But I think there 's a lot of truth in your writing . " She did n't say anything , but a wisp of a smile slipped across her face . " Your letter made me want to try one of your hamburger steaks . " <p> " You were probably just hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought . <p> A train passed under the window , with its dry clack-clack sound . <p> I suddenly realized that it was 5:00 . I had to go . I apologized to her and started to leave . " Your husband will be home soon , so I suppose you have to start dinner . " <p> " He always comes home very late , " she said , resting her head in her hands . " He generally does n't get home until after midnight . " <p> " He sounds busy . " <p> " I guess so . " She hesitated for a moment . " As I mentioned in my letters we do n't get along that well . " I did n't have an answer for that . <p> " But that 's ok , " she said softly . I thought it was ok too . " Thanks again for writing me all those letters . I really enjoyed them . " <p> " Me too , " I said . " And thank you for the hamburger steak . " <p> Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apartment I think of her hamburger steak . I do n't remember which window is hers .

##1138152 <p> In tertiary writing , all essays should begin with an opening paragraph ( an introduction ) , which may include a : Setting ( background information ) Statement of purpose Summary of main points <p> WRITING Task The dominance of black people in US sport is due to sociological rather than physiological factors . Discuss . EXAMPLE : Since World War II popular American sports such as Baseball , Basketball and Field and Track have seen the qualitative and quantitative dominance of black ( Afro-America ) athletes . The purpose of this essay is to examine the relative importance of the sociological and physiological factors which have contributed to this phenomenon . It will be argued that , despite some tentative evidence of physiological differences , the factors which determine black pre-eminence in sport are primarily sociological . <p> Strategies for writing paragraphs : 1 . Begin each paragraph with a summary sentence - a sentence which contains the main point of the paragraph . 2 . Continue the paragraph by giving more information about the main point . This might involve : giving an explanation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Sample Essay 1 It is a fact of life that the development of science and technology has been accompanied by a decline in traditional culture . In my opinion , this is not necessarily a bad thing , because some aspects of traditional culture hamper progress an d should be abandoned Moreover , it is natural that people should want to find new ways of doing things . In the first place , science and technology have cleared up many matters that were mysterious to us in the past . For instance , we now know that thunder and lightning are not caused by gods being angry , but are normal natural phenomena . As a result , a large number of harmful superstitions have disappeared , and nobody regrets their passing . In the second place , our everyday lives have been made more convenient by scientific and technological inventions . Nowadays electric lights have replaced the traditional oil lamps , and computers enable us to make quicker and more accurate calculations . Even more important is the fact that television brings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science and technology actually help to preserve the useful and pleasant parts of traditional culture . Take the celebration of the Chinese Lantern Festival for example . Lanterns are now designed with modern technology and materials to make them more attractive , and they are powered by electricity , which is safer than candles . Therefore , for the above reasons , I welcome the development of science and technology . Advances in science and technology have brought us many benefits . At the same time , they have eliminated the bad parts of traditional culture while preserving the good parts . <p> Sample Essay 3 It is an undeniable fact that scientific and technological developments bring great benefits to people . Especially since the Industrial Revolution took place , our lives have been made much more convenient by inventions such as trains , airplanes and computers . But I think that the loss of our traditional culture is too high a price to pay for this . In the first place , our culture has formed the customs and values of our people for centuries . We must let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow machines to make our decisions for us . A comfortable but spiritually empty life , without the traditional bonds of kinship and friendship would not be worth living . Secondly , it is obvious that people are anxious to preserve their culture . For instance , Chinese people who use computers and cars during the day sit down to watch Peking opera and eat traditional food in the evening . Especially when people move to other countries they become homesick and form national culture societies . Last but not least , we should make science and technology serve traditional culture . This can be done by making festivals and other cultural occasions more widely known , using radio and television . In addition , we should strengthen our family ties by using the latest developments in telecommunications , such as email . In conclusion , I think we should never allow science and technology to dazzle our eyes so that we lose sight of our cultural values . On the contrary , we should use the discoveries of science and technology to reinforce our fine cultural traditions .

Remember , your ideas do n't need to be original , only relevant to the answer . If it is difficult for you to think of examples you might find it helpful to focus on some specific aspects of the topic .

##1143052 <h> Challenges to a Lasting Relationship <p> The vast majority of relationships can and should be saved and revived . In almost every case , couples can learn how to keep their relationships alive and growing , and reap ? ? ? ? ? ? ? the rich rewards of real and lasting love . Twenty-two years of family therapy practice has given me the certainty that almost any relationship can be turned into a great one if the people involved are willing . <p> I realize these are bold statements , but the statistics of my family therapy practice speak for themselves . <p> More than 98 percent of the married couples in my practice who learn the skills ( which I also teach in my book ) , make up instead of break up , and have very happy and love-filled partnerships . <p> More than 98 percent of the singles who use these same skills enter committed relationships or get married to partners they love . <p> Perhaps even more striking is the success rate of my couples who have experienced adultery . Whereas infidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of breakups nationwide , this statistic can be cut down to 2 percent if couples learn the skills to get to the root of the problem and work through it . I know it 's possible because 98 percent of the couples in my therapy practice who have experienced adultery discover their relationship is worth keeping . These couples stay together because they wake up their love and need for each other and make a conscious choice to commit to the relationship , move toward forgiveness , and stay together . <p> Dead ends are turning points <p> Those of believe you 've reached a dead end ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? in your relationship or in your dating are actually at the perfect point to turn things around .

The success rate of my patients who use these tools and skills in their relationships is so dramatically higher than the national averages that I felt compelled to share this information with as many people as I could ? so that you can have as much success in your relationships as my patients are having . <p> Too many people break up before they make up a solid couple . At the onset ? ? ? ? of a relationship or marriage , there 's fascination ? ? ? ? , the promise of untold ? ? ? ? ? ? happiness , and the thrill of the chase . But at some point things begin to change . One partner may begin to withdraw for no obvious reason , leaving the once-pursued confused and insecure . At this point many relationships stop before they 've really started . There comes a point in every relationship where we either wake up , or we break up . <p> Every relationship holds the potential for " sudden shutdowns " . What 's both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually solidify your partnership if you know what to do . There is no perfect relationship or person out there , so stop looking for perfection and work with the partner you have or the one you 're about to start a relationship with . Do n't wait for the " right time " , move now ! Every relationship offers the experience we need to perfect our skills . In fact , the relationship process offers the perfect opportunity for personal as well as relationship growth . <p> Most relationships can be saved but you have to wake up , shake up and possibly even break up before you can make up . Married couples can learn how to stay together and reap the harvest of real and lasting love . Singles can learn how to keep a relationship growing , instead of stopping it before it starts . The truth is that men and women are actually very much alike even though the ways we behave and express ourselves can make it seem like " men are from Mars and women are from Venus . " Both men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and enjoy the ride ! <p> Forget the rule books <p> The first step in beating the odds ? ? ? ? is to throw away your rule books ? ? ? ? ? ? ! Misguided rules like " Do n't make the first move " , " Do n't sleep with him ( or her ) until you get what you want " , or the flip side of that : " Seduce him ( or her ) to get what you want " , " Make her jealous " , " Make him chase you " , " Wait at least one week before you call back for another date " , and " Play Hard to Get " , are leading us further away from each other , instead of bringing us together . These rules may appear to work while you 're dating , but after you 're married , just try playing " Hard to Get " when it 's time to take out the garbage or the baby is crying ! <p> When you use rules that do n't work , your anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need tools : straight answers , skills , dialogue , and action steps that work ! I call these tools Smart Heart Skills because we must use our heads and our hearts to create the relationships we 'd love to have . <p> Forget the rigid rules if you want to create and sustain a love-filled relationship . Thousands more relationships would be in full swing right now if women would give up rules such as " Men have to make the first move " . Women are more prepared in many ways to make the first move . Our socialization and upbringing ? ? ? ? ? ? ? makes us more comfortable with connection skills . As children , while we were orchestrating a night on the town for our Barbie and Ken dolls , the boys were making battle plans with their GI Joes .

Women have been unwisely taught to use sex as a way to get men to comply with ? ? ? ? ? ? ? their wishes . This is one of the most destructive rules around .

##1144352 <p> What can be done in order to make sure that no one in the world goes hungry ? Generally speaking , the human race has the information and experience to do this . However , humans have so far not been wise enough to make correct decisions . <p> In the European Union ( EU ) , where 81% of the land is farmed , there is plenty of food , in fact often too much . Farmers have the right to sell their crops to the EU . For example , if the apple harvest is very good and there are so many apples on the market that farmers can not sell them , the EU will buy apples from the farmers and throw them away . And the fact that farmers are also paid by the EU for not growing crops surprises many people . If they leave some of their fields free and do not plant anything , they will still receive money from the EU . There is a similar system in the USA . <p> It has been proved that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops either to feed their family or to sell , whichever they choose . However , although this happens in China , it does not happen in some other countries , like India . There , most of the land is owned by rich people who pay peasants very little money to work in the fields for them . If the peasants could farm the land themselves , food production would be much higher . What is needed is a change in land ownership , and it has been suggested that the land should be shared equally among the peasants . The problem is that most politicians in India are landowners . They would not vote to lose their land and wealth , even if it resulted in a fairer society . <p> Many less-developed countries are in debt because they borrowed money from richer countries in order to develop industry . Unfortunately they find it difficult to repay this money . As a result , farmers are forced to plant " cash crops " , like coffee , tea , cocoa , nuts and tobacco that are sold abroad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that much of the land is used for crops that will never feed the population . If fewer cash crops were grown , more food could be produced and there would be less or no starvation . <p> Many western countries raise and butcher a large number of beef cattle . The problem with beef cattle is that 10 kilograms of grain is needed to produce just one kilogram of meat . In the USA , for example , 75% of the grain is used to feed animals . This grain could be used to feed humans , rather than animals . However , in hilly , dry or mountainous areas where it is impossible to grow crops , it makes very good sense to keep sheep or goats . These provide milk , meat and wool ,

##1148650 <h> Purchasing <h> Useful Information <h> Extras <h> My Story <p> Hello , my name is Jonathan . I 'm the webmaster of HongKongTripGuide.com <p> That 's me in the picture to the right . I 'm trying Kau Cim at the Wong Tai Sin Temple in Hong Kong . <p> I 'd like to share my story of how my interest in travelling eventually lead to me building a travel website about Hong Kong . <p> It all started back in 2010 when my wife ( fiance at the time ) and I took a trip to Hong Kong and Japan . We spent 2.5 weeks in Hong Kong and 2 weeks in Japan . <p> While we were in Hong Kong we visited as many tourist attractions , malls , shopping markets , and parks as we could in our short time in the city . I always had a camera in my hand , taking pictures or videos of all the interesting things I saw . <p> My wife has family that we were able to stay with in Hong Kong . This saved us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite expensive . <p> My wife 's family showed us around the city whenever they had some free time . They also had great suggestions of things to do if we did n't have plans for part of our day . It was very helpful to stay with people who have lived in Hong Kong for a long time and know the city very well . <p> I wrote in a journal daily so I could remember what we did each day and what the names of the places we visited are called . <p> When we returned to Canada after our trip was over , we looked over my pictures , watched the videos I recorded , and read through my journal . After reliving all the things we did in Hong Kong , my wife and I both agreed this was our best vacation ever ! <p> I felt very fortunate that we knew people that could show us around Hong Kong and help us if something did n't make sense . I kept thinking it 'd be nice if there was some way to help out other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I know there are many people out there who want to travel to Hong Kong , but do n't have the same kind of insider information that my wife 's family shared with us . It 's difficult being out on your own in a part of the world you do n't know . <p> So I asked myself " How can I share valuable travel information with others ? " <h> The solution was right in front of me <p> At the time my sister had been building a website about romantic ideas for a couple years . She suggested that I build a website about Hong Kong travel . I could put useful travel information ( and pictures ) on my website . This information could help others find things to do in Hong Kong , as well as things to watch out for . You can visit my sister 's romantic website by Clicking Here . <p> I told her " That sounds like a great idea , but I do n't know anything about building a website .

##1148652 <h> Purchasing <h> Useful Information <h> Extras <h> Star Ferry <p> The Star Ferry is a double decker ferry that transports passengers from one side of the Victoria Harbour to the other side . It 's a very scenic ride that anyone visiting Hong Kong should experience for themselves . <p> A ferry service named the Kowloon Ferry Company began transporting people across the Victoria Harbour in 1880 . In 1898 the Kowloon Ferry Company changed its name to the Star Ferry Company . The ferry service still operates under that name today . <p> Before the first underwater tunnel was built between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island in 1972 , this ferry service was the only way for people and vehicles to get from one side of the Victoria Harbour to the other . Making these Ferries a very important form of transportation in Hong Kong . <p> Today there are 3 underwater tunnels that allow vehicles and the MTR to go between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island . <p> Since the underwater tunnels are quite congested , a lot of people choose to ride the Ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . It 's a cheap and relaxing alternative to taking a car or bus . <p> There are 3 piers where you can get on one of the ferries . They are the Tsim Sha Tsui pier in Kowloon , and the Central and Wan Chai piers in Hong Kong Island . Note that the Hung Hom Pier in Kowloon is no longer in service . <p> From any of these piers you can ride from one side of the Victoria Harbour to the other . If you 're interested in a longer ride , you can take a 1 hour ferry tour of the harbour . The 1 hour harbour tour gives you a more in depth look at all the sights on both sides of the harbour . Tickets for these rides can be purchased at any of the Star Ferry piers . <p> You can also hire a special ferry called the Classic Ferry for functions such as weddings , anniversaries and birthdays . The maximum capacity for the function is 300 people . A cruise around the Victoria Harbour can add a little extra excitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1 hour harbour tour on the Star Ferry . The upper deck of the ferry was very relaxing and had lots of seats and tables for people to enjoy their ride and look out the windows . They had some information about its history as well as a map of the routes it sails . They also had some old memorabilia that you could look at . <p> It was quite windy and rainy that day , so visibility was not as good as I would 've liked . You could n't see the top of a lot of the tall buildings in the harbour . The wind made the ferry sway from side to side quite a bit as well . After about 40 minutes on the ferry I started feeling sick . If you get sick on boats easily , try to pick a day thats not very windy . Otherwise the harbour tour may not be the best ride for you . You may be better off with a short ride crossing the harbour instead . You still get to experience the ride , and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 hour Harbour Tour route <p> The Star Ferry is something everyone should experience if they visit Hong Kong .

##1151550 <p> Praesidia for persons under 18 years may be established with the approval of the Curia and subject to any special conditions which may be deemed necessary . See chapter 14 , paragraph 22 . <p> The only real way of learning the Legion is to work its system . Lectures are often given urging the young to undertake the apostolate when they go out into the world , but such lectures , however excellent , are but dry bones compared with the living body of actual practice . Moreover , without some actual training , an intention or desire to begin apostolic work is of little value . Inexperience is easily intimidated , or if a beginning is made along one 's own lines , it will almost assuredly end in a morass . <p> It is to be regarded as an essential condition that at least the President of such a praesidium should be an adult . A second adult officer would be desirable with a view to providing for the absence of the President , and for the possibilities of expansion . If these senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officering the junior praesidium satisfies their work obligation . But , if they are members of the junior praesidium only , they must perform for it a substantial active work proportioned to their adult capacity . These officers should , if at all possible , be experienced legionaries , who understand perfectly the Legion system , and who are otherwise fitted to accomplish in these youthful legionaries the purpose which the Legion has in view in setting up the praesidium . That purpose is not primarily the doing of a certain amount of useful work , but the training and spiritualising of its members , and the preparing of them to take their place in the ordinary ranks of the Legion when school-days are finished . <p> Obviously the allocutio will hold a doubly important place in the system by reason of the inability of many of the young legionaries to master the contents of the handbook through their own reading of it . Therefore , the Spiritual Director ( or in his absence the President ) should base every allocutio on the handbook . A small section should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple way as to make it certain that every member fully understands it . The handbook should be ploughed through in this way week after week , from start to finish , and then returned upon . But indeed , the termination of junior membership comes so rapidly that there may not be the opportunity of covering the ground twice for the same legionaries . Each defective allocutio , accordingly , represents an opportunity thrown away , a loss which can not be made good . <p> If the handbook can be systematically studied after the method recommended in appendix 10 , Study of the Faith , it will provide a most useful course , without being felt to be " just a school task . " It will be invaluable training to these future props of the senior Legion . <p> As the works adopted by senior praesidia will probably not be available for a praesidium of this type , ingenuity will be required to provide each member weekly with a substantial active task fully equivalent to his capacity . Many juniors are capable of doing work which is recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reached 16 years should be given work which would not be accepted from seniors . The works of the praesidium should be diversified . Different works will educate in different ways . As each member can not do all the works , the next best way of getting an all-round training is to watch all of them being done by others . Moreover the proceedings of the praesidium gain in interest . <p> A minimum of one hour 's work per week , that is one-half of the senior obligation , may be accepted from the junior member . <p> Suggestions for the work are : - <p> ( a ) Distribution of the miraculous medal after the following plan . At each meeting one or two medals ( a fixed number ) are served out to each legionary . They are to regard these as a ration of ammunition , which as soldiers of Mary they must use to the greatest advantage , by giving them , if possible , to non-Catholics or neglectful Catholics . This idea stirs the imagination and induces sacrifice . They should be instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be asked and as to the utilisation of openings . <p> ( b ) Winning of auxiliary members . This will include the instructing of their recruits in the saying of the prayers , also the periodic visitation of them so as to ensure their fidelity . <p> ( c ) Endeavouring to have at least one additional person every week undertake : attendance at Holy Mass daily , or the practice of some devotion , or to join a sodality , the Apostleship of Prayer , or some Catholic society . <p> ( d ) Bringing of young children to Holy Mass and the Sacraments . <p> ( e ) Serving Mass . <p> ( f ) Teaching the Catechism and recruiting for catechism classes . <p> ( g ) Visitation of children in a hospital or other institution , or in their own homes . <p> ( h ) Visitation of the infirm and the blind and the performing for them of all sorts of needed services . <p> It is most strongly urged that every junior praesidium should have at least two members on each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( g ) , ( h ) . Those works , properly done , represent superb training for the young legionaries engaged on them , and would set the proper sort of standard for the other works of the praesidium . <p> It would be permissible for a junior to perform his work in company with a senior legionary . <p> In the case of internal praesidia it would be desirable to provide the members with ordinary active work outside . But Superiors , mindful of their responsibility , will fear lest this privilege be abused and may imagine other dangers . As to these apprehensions : ( a ) If those legionaries were in junior praesidia outside , they would be doing that ordinary work ; ( b ) The future is only provided for by training . If there be no liberty now , there is no training for the time of unrestricted liberty . That outside work , safeguarded by the double discipline of college and Legion , can be made an ideal preparation . <p> It is in order to establish a praesidium in a college where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to hold meetings during that period . During that time the members may be able to work in the praesidia in their home towns . <p> It should be brought home to the members that their own holiness is not only the main object of the Legion but also the mainspring of the Legion 's work . Hence , they should be encouraged to pray and make sacrifices for the intentions of the praesidium . But these exercises should not be assigned to the members , and they should not be reported on at the meeting . It is particularly emphasised that spiritual exercises can not substitute for the active work . If they are performed , it must be in addition to the active work . <p> Special thought must be given by the members to the preparing of their reports , and they should be diligently educated by their officers in the manner of furnishing a report . The nature of their work will not usually provide much material for an interesting or detailed report , so a special effort will be needed to render the proceedings interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior Legion , fighting the Lord 's battles in difficult and often dangerous circumstances and with many great enterprises in hand , will vitalise their own less enterprising work , and will catch the imagination of these youthful legionaries ( a process which is helped by everything in the Legion system ) . This will preserve them , and many through them , from the disposition to regard religion as a mere imposed routine . If the latter idea takes root in the impressionable years , harm has been done for which the most resplendent scholastic attainments will not compensate . <p> The probation rule does not apply to junior members ; nor will they take the legionary Promise ; nor sit on a senior Curia . But in all other respects the full routine of prayers , system and meetings , inclusive of the secret bag collection , must be scrupulously followed , just as in the case of a senior praesidium . <p> On transfer from junior to senior membership , the ordinary probation term must be fulfilled . <p> A senior legionary serving in a junior praesidium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praesidium , should take it in that junior one . The contemplation of the ceremony will deeply impress the juniors and should cause them to look forward to the day when they themselves will perfect their membership by taking the Promise . <p> It has often been suggested that the prayers should be modified so as to facilitate the membership of children . The inadmissibility of such proposals should be evident from a reading of this chapter , which indicates that junior membership should be an approximation to senior membership . There is no question of " junior " meaning " trivial . " High ideals of action and devotion are to be placed before the junior members , who should , in general , be expected to play the part of leaders among other young people . It is manifest that this standard can not be reached by any child who , after some instruction , is incapable of saying the full Legion prayers intelligently . <p> Similarly , propositions are made that a simplified handbook be provided for the use of juniors . This is discussed in section 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents and all others in authority should co-operate fully with the legionary programme on which so much depends . Those young people are being fashioned into what St. Louis-Marie de Montfort calls : " a legion of valiant soldiers of Jesus and Mary to combat the world , the devil and corrupted nature in those more than ever perilous days which are to come . " As simple in its ideas and structure as a pulley or a lever or other device for multiplying power , the Legion is able to make vivid the whole circle of Catholic Doctrine and to turn it into motive-power for every Christian purpose . But also there is an immediate outpouring of this power . It fills schooltime , playtime , home , and every other time , with holy , practical idealism . It gives its members a new vision of things , which is equivalent to making the world different for them - a new outlook : - <p> ( a ) On the Church , once they have realised that they are its soldiers , with a definite place in its warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) On the everyday round and task . As a tiny point of light illuminates a room , so the little Legion task gives a new meaning to the whole course of the week . What the members learn and practise in the praesidium they will live in their ordinary life . <p> ( c ) On their neighbour , in whom they have been taught to see and serve Christ . <p> ( d ) On their home , which they have learned to surround with the atmosphere of Nazareth . <p> ( e ) On helping at home ( or in the school if the praesidium be an internal one ) in the spirit of the Legion , that is of Mary at Nazareth ; seeking for work instead of trying to escape it ; choosing the most unpleasant tasks ; putting one 's heart into the doing of the least things ; being always sweetness and thoughtfulness itself ; working always for Jesus and preserving the sense of his presence . <p> ( f ) On school , for they will have absorbed to some extent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teachers , books , rules and study in a different light . Accordingly , they will get things from school which others would not get . So that , even if the Legion did represent time taken from study ( which is the common objection ) , the net effect would be incomparable gain . <p> ( g ) On " duty " and " discipline . " These two all-important things , which are so odious to the young because so misunderstood by them , will be made comprehensible and beautiful when linked with those other two words : " Mary " and " Legion . " <p> ( h ) On prayer , when they realise that it is not a mere custom-imposed task but a source of power , the support of their work , and their valuable contribution to the Legion treasury and thence to the Church . <p> Perhaps it is not too much to claim that in the proper working of a praesidium on the foregoing lines lies one of the greatest possible educative influences which could be brought to bear on the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to the christian character , and will serve as a mould out of which will come in number holy and reliant young people , a joy to their parents and superiors , and a mainstay to the Church . <p> But all this programme , all these hopes , will be frustrated by the junior praesidium which does not give its members suitable work or which otherwise neglects the rules . That praesidium is a deforming mould . It is prejudicing its members and everybody else against the Legion . It would represent a service to the Legion to suppress it . <p> " Youth must not simply be considered as an object of pastoral concern for the Church : in fact , young people are and ought to be encouraged to be active on behalf of the Church as leading characters in evangelisation and participants in the renewal of society . Youth is a time of an especially intensive discovery of a ' self ' and ' a choice of life ' . It is a time for growth which ought to progress ' in wisdom , age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:52 ) ( CL 46 ) 2 . SEMINARY PRAESIDIA <p> " It is particularly important to prepare future priests for cooperation with the laity . The Council says ' they should be willing to listen to lay people , give brotherly consideration to their wishes and recognise their experience and competence in the different fields of human activity . . . ' The recent Synod too has insisted upon pastoral solicitude for the laity : ' The student should become capable of proposing and introducing the lay faithful , the young especially , to the different vocations . . . Above all it is necessary that he be able to teach and support the laity in their vocation to be present in and to transform the world with the light of the Gospel , by recognising this task of theirs and showing respect for it ' . " ( PDV 59 ) <p> It is evident that a competent knowledge of such an effective and widespread organisation , as is the Legion , would be a valuable asset to future priests and religious . Academic knowledge of it , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership . The establishment of praesidia for seminarians therefore , assumes great importance . In cases where internal praesidia are not possible , those in formation would greatly benefit from membership of external praesidia . In both internal and external praesidia the members would be thoroughly grounded in the theory and practice of the Legion and given what one might call a complete philosophy of the apostolate . When eventually they proceed to their assignments , they will have a good grasp of how the Legion and other apostolic groups should operate . <p> In regard to internal praesidia especially , the following should be noted : <p> ( a ) It is essential that a fair amount of time be available for the weekly meeting . It would be difficult to conduct a meeting in less than an hour , and every effort should be made to allow it a little more time . The order of the meeting , as described in this handbook , shall be followed exactly . <p> ( b ) A main consideration is the allocation of active work to each member . Without substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that time is limited , that suitable work may not be easy to find in the circumstances of seminary life , and that study of the handbook is given special attention , a minimum of one hour a week should be spent on active work . The possible lack of variety in the work must be compensated for by richness of spirit . The work must be done with sheer perfection and with emphasis on the note of union with Mary . <p> The selection of works will depend on the circumstances and rules of the house . Some suggestions are : the visitation of homes , hospitals and other institutions , instruction of converts , teaching of catechism , preparation of adults and children for the sacraments . It is very important that any works undertaken should tie in with pastoral training programmes set up by superiors . <p> ( c ) The reports to the praesidium must not be routine phrases . They should be vivid and interesting . Success in this direction will render the members masters in the art of making reports and qualified to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding in the future . <p> ( d ) Duties of a disciplinary or of a purely supervisory charcter should not be assigned by a praesidium . Such work would tend to make members of the Legion ( and then the Legion itself ) unpopular with their fellows . <p> ( e ) Membership should be completely voluntary . Anything that savours of compulsion or even of college routine would operate detrimentally . In order to stress the voluntary nature of Legion membership , it is a good idea to hold the praesidium meeting during free time . <p> ( f ) The praesidium shall be so conducted , both as regards meetings and activities , as not to interfere in the slightest way with the horarium and rules of the house . On the other hand , the conditions of active membership of the Legion must not be altered , for this would defeat the whole purpose in view . In practice , it will be found that the faithful working of such a praesidium will intensify the attitude of the students towards their 
##1151551 <p> Mary was so utterly full of charity that she was found worthy to conceive and bring into the world him who is Charity itself . The Legion of Mary , depending for its very life on devotedness to her and imitation of her , must necessarily be distinguished by this selfsame quality of intense charity . It must be full of charity : then only will it bring charity into the world . It is important , therefore , that the following directives be carefully observed . 1 . For entry to the ranks of the Legion , there shall be no social , racial , national or colour discrimination . Fitness for membership is to be the only test . The legionary apostolate will accomplish even more by indirect action , that is , as the leaven in the community , than directly by the works in hand . If the entire community is to be brought fully under the influence of legionary action , it follows that the Legion 's ranks must contain representatives of every section of the community . 2 . Within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual charity among the members , all distinctions being non-existent . If love is due to those whom the legionary serves , it is no less due to one 's fellow-members . The spirit of distinction is evidence of the absence of the first qualification for membership , which is the spirit of love . The whole idea and spirit of the Legion is one of intense charity and sympathy , which before radiating its warmth outside must first of all burn brightly and strongly on the domestic hearth of the itself . " By this everyone will know you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . " ( Jn 13:35 ) <p> Charity practised in its ranks will soon be practised at large . Divisions removed by membership are on the way to being removed from people outside . 3 . Towards other organisations , whose aims are compatible with the Church 's mission , there should be a spirit of readiness to give cooperation and assistance whenever possible . Not all Catholics can be brought into the Legion 's own ranks for its requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to participate in some way in the work of the Church . Legionaries can further this through their apostolate and personal contacts . It should be noted , however , that whatever cooperation is given should not place additional burdens on legionaries to the detriment of their own apostolate . It is important , also , that there be discernment in regard to the degree and type of assistance which is given and to whom it is given . In this connection , reference should also be made to the sections ' Control of the work by the Praesidium ' ( ch 39 , no. 6 ) and ' The intimate nature of the legionary work must be safeguarded ' ( ch 39 , no. 8 ) . 4 . Towards the Pastors of the Church there should be shown the filial love due to them as spiritual fathers and shepherds . Legionaries should share their anxieties and help them by prayer and , as far as possible , by active work so that they may be better able to overcome difficulties and carry out their duties with greater success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of communicating divine truth and graces of the sacraments , it should be the legionaries ' concern to keep people in touch with these bearers of divine gifts and to repair the link where it has been broken . <p> This is especially necessary in the case of those who are in anyway alienated from the clergy for reasons , justified or unjustified . <p> People who are seriously ill can be very reluctant to consult a doctor . Often it takes one 's marriage partner , family or friend to supply the necessary encouragement . <p> When spiritual health is at stake , much depends on the quality of charity in those who are close to the one needing help . <p> The formation of legionaries helps them to take the initiative in mediating between priests and souls , and to do so with gentle refinement . This is an exquisite form of charity . They act as agents of the Good Shepherd who calls them , through their baptism to enter into his work . <p> " If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy gong or a clanging cymbal . And if I have prophetic powers , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing . If I give away all my possessions , and if I hand over my body so that I may boast , but do not have love , I gain nothing . Love is patient ; love is kind ; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude . It does not insist on its own way ; it is not irritable or resentful ; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing truth . It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Love never ends . But as for prophecies , they will come to an end ; as for tongues , they will cease ; as for knowledge , it will come 
##1151552 <p> Study could advantageously be carried on by some or all of the members of a praesidium as an addition to their other work . Certain types of praesidia should undertake it as a matter of course , for example , internal and Junior praesidia and those which specialise in the giving of instruction . <p> The intense spirit of prayer and the devotional system of the Legion secures an admirable approach to such study and averts the disadvantageous possibilities which sometimes attach . The self-sufficient , the knowledge-proud , and such like , who would enter only to disturb and to drop out , will be repelled by the system . On the other hand , the system will hold to membership those whom the quickly-spent novelty of study would not retain . <p> Moreover , the success of the study will be guaranteed by its being undertaken in a spirit of union with her whose seeking of light was so humble , so simple , that it forms ever the perfect model for its pursuit : " How can this be ? " ( Lk 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Divine Wisdom , the Eternal Truth , the True Light . She remains the guardian of this treasure . To her must come those who wish to draw from it . Those legionaries will see in their weekly praesidium meeting a clustering round their lovely Mother , a twining of their hands in hers so full of the treasures of knowledge which they seek . <p> Thus the salient characteristic is that the legionary approaches his work of study from the angle of devotion rather than as an intellectual exercise . Another distinctive feature is that the study is not based on a lecture system ; partly because the latter could not be accommodated to the praesidium system ; but still more because it is a human tendency to relax in the face of a situation where one or a few assume all the work and all the responsibility , as the lecturer does . Moreover , in practice a lecture is graded to the maximum intelligence of the audience , and hence presents difficulties to the bulk of the hearers . The result is that the subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quickly forgotten . Again , the proportion of those who listen to a clever lecture in an appreciative , but otherwise completely inert mental condition , is quite remarkable . <p> On the other hand , in the Legion system the member is not allowed to relax . Each one is called upon to render an account of his work . This ensures in his case - on a different grade , it is true , but with equal intensity - the assumption of the effort and the responsibility which in the lecture system falls practically entirely on the lecturer . The member is not merely a listener . His mental state is active , not merely receptive . He is definitely at work . At the same time his progress is checked and supervised . <p> The report of each member is delivered sitting . His textbook is before him . Any notes he may have taken are beside him . There is nothing in the surroundings to deprive him of confidence . His report is couched in his own phraseology , and conveys his own thoughts and difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ear . There may be comment or questioning from others . Then the next report is taken . It will be seen that the meeting progresses , not as a motor swiftly carrying its passengers over the ground , but as the plough and harrow painfully tearing it up . By the time the chapter of a book has been dug and re-dug by the succeeding reports of the members of the praesidium , it will certainly be understood by all , and therefore remembered . <p> The work of study being one with the general work of the praesidium , it is certain that it will be animated with the active spirit of the Legion , which will urge the members to put their knowledge to practical use . To that end , praesidia which have made progress in studies , should consider the taking up of classes , instruction work , Catholic Evidence Guild work , and other means of radiating the special knowledge which the members have acquired . Incidentally , they can not fail to spread abroad in the Legion a greater desire to be well-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion must tend to diffuse itself to the general population through the medium of the innumerable avenues of legionary contact . Thus , a step is made towards " the removing of that deepest disgrace of Catholic peoples , the ignorance of Divine religion . " ( Pope Pius XI : Motu Proprio , 29 June , 1923 ) <p> The very first book to be studied should be the Legion handbook . Indeed , it is the essential duty for the legionary . For , unless the Legion system is properly understood , it can not be successfully applied to the work of study or to any type of work . All would regard it as a senseless proceeding to erect a house without looking to its foundations . It would be equally futile to seek to build the edifice of study on the foundation of the Legion system , without giving the latter the solidity which only comes from a complete knowledge of it . <p> The branches of study which could most profitably be undertaken under the supervision of the Spiritual Director would be : - Dogma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church History , Moral Theology . <p> A definite portion of the meeting - possibly part of the time following the Allocutio - should be earmarked for the consideration of this work . Special care should be given to this part of the agenda so as to provide a firm framework for this section of the meeting and thereby ensure that it will not develop into a mere desultory discussion . <p> At each meeting a section of the course will be set for subsequent private study by the members . The members must apply themselves to this work with a high degree of legionary thoroughness and devotion , for there is a tendency to drift , without realising it , into negligent and unworthy performance . The actual study is free from the effective observation of any but heavenly witnesses . Moreover , the praesidium is not an ordinary school-class . It is easy to produce a passable report to it , even where the study has been carelessly done . <p> At each meeting , the members must individually report on their week 's work . In their reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of the week 's reading . Members , however , should be discouraged from lightly bringing forward difficulties of a kind which could be solved by a little additional effort on their part . <p> Self-help and individual effort on the part of the members should be encouraged as much as possible . Care should be exercised that the discussions do not err into unnecessary or undesirable channels , and that points too deep or in any way misleading or irrelevant are not pursued . In all these matters , the chief reliance of the praesidium will , of course , be the Spiritual Director . <p> It is stressed that the work-obligation of each member can only be discharged by the performance of a substantial active weekly task . It may not be satisfied , not even in part , by study . <p> " How closely allied are purity and light ! The purest souls are those to whom God gives the most light . That is why our Blessed Lady is of all creatures the most illumined . It has been said of her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Church styles her the Seat of Wisdom . It follows that our studies , our contemplations , our whole life , should gravitate ever more closely around that Woman , of all women the most blessed , the Mother of the Light of light-the Word made flesh . For God has clothed that incomparable creature with the sun , and has set her to cast the light of Jesus over the entire world and into every soul which will open to receive

##1154050 <h> Nietzsche : Hegel and Schopenhauer <p> Hegel and the German idealists objected to Kant 's noumenon . The utterly independent world in itself had no explanatory role beyond grounding human morality and dignity . The world-we-know is purely a product of mind--an expression of reason . Hegel 's slogan was " The real is the rational , the rational real . " For Hegel , God was the inner , subjective side of the world as object--the accumulation of the concept of ' self ' or ' subject . ' The structure of reason ( subject-predicate ) applied to the whole or absolute reality generated the concepts of God-world . World history is the history of God 's idea of the world working itself out logically . <p> Schopenhauer was much more pessimistic ? he drew heavily from Buddhism . He found life and history infused not only with ideas and reason , but also with desire and consequent suffering . The world is both will and idea and the will leads to an insatiable clinging to these mental creations . The result is that life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1844 in Prussian Saxony in a Lutheran 1 ( Protestant ) culture . His father a Lutheran priest died while Nietzsche was quite young and Nietzsche was raised in a family of women : his mother , grandmother , two maiden aunts and a sister . His physical illness made him dependent on them most of his life . <p> Nietzsche 's specialties were philology 2 and classical Greek thought . He was brilliant and became a full professor at the age of 25 . However his chronic ill health forced him to retire from teaching ten years later . He suffered from migraine headaches , stomach upset , insomnia , and bad eyesight . He spend a lonely , solitary life in poverty but producing philosophical works of stunning style at a phenomenal rate . In the next ten years he wrote twelve books ( including his masterpiece in four volumes ) . The year before he went insane was amazingly productive . In 1888 , he wrote five books . The next year , he went insane ( probably of syphilis ) and died in 1890 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " slogan is not a religious statement , but a broadside against Western culture--against rationalism . It is not merely that an immortal divine being has died . What is dead is a way Westerners had of looking at themselves and their relation with the world . God and reason were ways of seeing Humans as central and important in the nature of things . We are in the image of God and like God in having rational minds . God , our father , created the world for us according to principles of reason . <p> The marriage of Reason ( Philosophy ) and religion ( Christianity ) produced an offsprint--science . Now science was turning on the parental union . It told us reality was neither conscious nor intellectual nor purposive . The world is a random , mechanistic , purposeless flow of atoms ? something quite alien to our " rational souls . " Humans and their social world are not at the center of creation , but an insignificant accident in an insignificant corner of the universe . <p> In some remote corner of the universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge . That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of " world history " ? ? yet only a minute . After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold , and the clever animals had to die . One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated how wretched , how shadowy and flighty , how aimless and arbitrary , the human intellect appears in nature . <p> Nietzsche hones in on the metaphysical character of Western thought and its pattern of trying to derive a morality from metaphysics . Beginning with Socrates and Plato , the culture had tried to treat a rational reality as the source of values and knowledge of them . The forms were knowable , real and the source of guidance . God " embodies " the union of metaphysics and value and , as we saw with Descartes , guarantees our knowledge of reality . Science 's view of reality as unconscious , unknowing , purposeless and valueless made Descartes ' intellectual charade psychologically necessary . Otherwise we lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we can no longer fool ourselves . We see through Descartes ' desperate verbal tricks and know , whether we dare admit it or not , that the real world is valueless . When Nietzsche announces " God is dead " he means rational reality can no longer can play the roles shaped out by the Rationalists . We can not accept this truth , but we have already killed " God . " <p> The Christian God did help hold metaphysics and ethics together as science developed , but it was a patchwork job , in need of constant repair as science destroyed one form of support after another . First it destroyed our conception of ourselves at the center , then as deliberate creations in God 's likeness . Each time religion adapts to a scientific discovery , another comes along to disturb the system . <p> Descartes , Kant and Hegel all tried in their own desperate ways to defend the precious link inherited from Plato and classical Greek thought . They tried to salvage the myth of a real-world basis for human significance , importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that we can no longer fool ourselves . We have not merely lost one particular religious version but the possibility of ever again believing such myth . We have become aware , as we have patched up the God story time after time , of the succession of myths and of how badly we need them . That very awareness undermines the effectiveness of future myths . In appreciating that we need the myths , we become less capable of believing them . <p> Nietzsche opposed the optimistic attachment to reason in both Kant and Hegel . The world is indeed a creation , but not a creation of anything as bland as the mind or reason , it is a creation of pure will . We create the world we know out of blind passion . We invent philosophical systems to compensate for our psychological weaknesses . Reason is just a self-deceptive disguise for our will to power . Once we have seen through the claims of reason , we lose our God . We can no longer deceive ourselves with the vanities of reason and its preposterous claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God " has stopped working socially . Intellectually and culturally , God is dead . <p> Belief in the myth of God-reason demeans mankind , but the absence of the myth paralyzes us . Without the belief in an absolute , real foundation of our values , something as rational as we are and therefore knowable , we are suspended over nothingness , gripped with existential angst , nausea , alienation from ourselves . No longer able to accept the " is-ought " justification , but still needing it , we tremble in the face of our meaninglessness . <p> Nietzsche 's message is not totally a negative one : the terror of meaninglessness . He thinks the important message is also a joyous one , the opportunity to restructure the whole enterprise of philosophy . Instead of using reason to construct a metaphysical reality and then base a morality on it , his awareness allows us directly and honestly to choose , to will our morality . We can then create new myths which affirm our chosen values . We give up the blind faith that our myths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce metaphysical myths that have worth to us . Godlike , we now can create reality to conform to our chosen morality . <p> The first task is to choose a morality . How ? For that Nietzsche says we should study and understand the nature and geneology of morality . Nietzsche divides moralities into two categories : master and slave moralities . The slave moralities are not merely moralities of actual economic and social slaves , but of people who merely react to something " hated . " The are enslaved by their failure to choose a value rather than a disvalue . <p> Slave morality gives primary definition to ' evil ' . It defines ' evil ' and ' sin ' in great and lurid detail and its positive advice consists of " do n't do evil . " Good has no more content than avoiding sin . It tells you what not to do instead of what to do . It is a negative , nihilistic , resentment morality . Anti-communism , anti-Semitism , anti-anything moral attitudes are slave moralities . <p> Master moralities , by contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gives positive content to ' good ' and regards ' bad ' merely as the absence of good--hence a " good-bad morality " in contrast to a " good-evil morality . " Because the master morality is not reacting to some other person or thing , not resenting or negating something hated , it is a morality of mastery--self mastery . We choose and affirm things that promote our will to power . We joyously affirm existence , life , the will to power . <p> Christianity is Nietzsche 's favorite examples of a decadent , slave morality . It is not due merely its values of meekness , but its deep-seated hatred of life , of the natural passions and desires . What makes Nietzsche 's treatment of religion interesting is that he does not try to disprove God or Christ , he tries rather to get us to see Christianity as a kind of sickness--a sickness of the soul . <p> The disease had its origins , however , not merely in the religious sources . It began with Greek philosophy . Nietzsche traces the slave morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration of the intellect over the body and its passions was transformed into the self-hatred of Christianity . Socrates aspired for a world in which his mind could wander free among the forms without the " dreaded body " to hinder it . Nietzsche diagnoses this as aspiring to death . <p> A revaluation of all values , this question mark , so black , so tremendous that it casts shadows upon the man who puts it down-such a destiny of a task compels one to run into the sun every moment to shake off a heavy , all-too-heavy seriousness . Every means is proper for this ; every " case " a case of luck . Especially , war . War has always been the great wisdom of all spirits who have become too inward , too profound ; even in a wound there is the power to heal . . . . <p> Another mode of convalescence-under certain circumstances even more to my liking-is sounding out idols , There are more idols than realities in the world : that is my " evil eye " for this world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions here with a hammer , and , perhaps , to hear as a reply that famous hollow sound which speaks of bloated entrails-what a delight for one who has ears even behind his ears , for me , an old psychologist and pied piper before whom just that which would remain silent must become out spoken . <p> This essay too-the title betrays it-is above all a recreation , a spot of sunshine , a leap sideways into the idleness of a psychologist . Perhaps a new war , too ? And are new idols sounded out ? This little essay is a great declaration of war ; and regarding the sounding out of idols , this time they are not just idols of the age , but eternal idols. which are here touched with a hammer as with a tuning fork : there are altogether no older , no more convinced , no more puffed-up idols-and none more hollow . That does not prevent them from being those in which people have the most faith ; nor does one ever say " idol , " especially not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerning life , the wisest men of all ages have judged alike : it is no good . Always and everywhere one has heard the same sound from their mouths-a sound full of doubt , full of melancholy , full of weariness of life , full of resistance to life . Even Socrates said , as he died : " To live-that means to be sick a long time : I owe Asclepius the Savior a rooster . " Even Socrates was tired of it . What does that evidence ? What does it evince ? Formerly one would have said ( oh , it has been said , and loud enough , and especially by our pessimists ) : At least something of all this must be true ! The consensus of the sages evidences the truth . " Shall we still talk like that today ? May we ? " At least something must be sick here , " we retort . These wisest men of all ages- they should first be scrutinized closely . Were they all perhaps shaky on their legs ? late ? tottery ? decadents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raven , inspired by a little whiff of carrion ? <p> 2 <p> This irreverent thought that the great sages are declining types first occurred to me precisely in a case where both learned and unlearned prejudice most strongly oppose it : I recognized Socrates and Plato as symptoms of degeneration , tools of the Greek dissolution , pseudo-Greek , anti-Greek ( Birth of Tragedy , 1872 ) . The consensus of the sages-I comprehended this ever more clearly-proves least of all that they were right in what they agreed on : it shows rather that they themselves , these wisest men , agreed in some physiological respect , and hence adopted the same negative attitude to life-had to adopt it . Judgments , judgments of value , concerning life , for it or against it , can , in the end , never be true : they have value only as symptoms , they are worthy of consideration only as symptoms ; in themselves such judgments are stupidities . One must by all means stretch out one 's fingers and make the attempt to grasp this amazing finesse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not by the living , for they are an interested party , even a bone of contention , and not judges ; not by the dead , for a different reason . For a philosopher to see a problem in the value of life is thus an objection to him , a question mark concerning his wisdom , an un-wisdom . Indeed ? All these great wise men-they were not only decadents but not wise at all ? But I return to the problem of Socrates . <p> 3 <p> In origin , Socrates belonged to the lowest class : Socrates was plebs . We know , we can still see for ourselves how ugly he was . But ugliness , in itself an objection , is among the Greeks almost a refutation . Was Socrates a Greek at all ? Ugliness is often enough the expression of a development that has been crossed , thwarted by crossing . Or it appears as declining development . The anthropologists among the criminologists tell us that the typical criminal is ugly : monster in appearance = monster in motivation . But the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least that would not be contradicted by the famous judgment of the physiognomist which sounded so offensive to the friends of Socrates . A foreigner who knew about faces once passed through Athens and told Socrates to his face that he was a monster-that he harbored in himself all the bad vices and appetites . And Socrates merely answered : " You know me , sir ! " <p> 4 <p> Not only does the admitted wantonness and anarchy of his instincts suggest that Socrates was decadent , so too does the hypertrophy of the logical faculty and that barbed malice that distinguishes him . Neither should we forget those auditory hallucinations which , as " Socrates ' Demon , " have been interpreted religiously . Everything in him is exaggerated , buffo , a caricature ; everything is at the same time concealed , ulterior , subterranean . I seek to comprehend what idiosyncrasy begot that Socratic equation of reason , virtue , and happiness that most bizarre of all equations , which , moreover is opposed to all the instincts of the earlier Greeks . <p> 5 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What really happened there ? Above all , a noble taste is thus vanquished , with dialectics the plebs come to the top . Before Socrates , dialectic manners were repudiated in good society : they were considered bad manners , they were compromising . The young were warned against them . Furthermore , all such presentations of one 's reasons were distrusted . Honest things , like honest men , do not carry their reasons in their hands like that . It is indecent to show all five fingers . What must first be proved is worth little . Wherever authority still forms part of good bearing , where one does not give reasons but commands , the dialectician is a kind of buffoon : one laughs at him , one does not take him seriously . Socrates was the buffoon who got himself taken seriously : what really happened there ? <p> 6 <p> One chooses dialectic only when one has no other means . One knows that one arouses mistrust with it , that it is not very persuasive . . . . <p> 7 <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebeian ressentiment ? Does he , as one oppressed , enjoy his own ferocity in the knife-thrusts of his syllogisms ? Does he avenge himself on the noble people whom he fascinates ? As a dialectician , one holds a merciless tool in one 's hand ; one can become a tyrant by means of it ; one compromises those one conquers . The dialectician leaves it to his opponent to prove that he is no idiot : he makes one furious and helpless at the same time . The dialectician renders the intellect of his opponent power less . Indeed ? Is dialectic only a form of revenge in Socrates ? <p> . . . . <p> 10 <p> When one finds it necessary to turn reason into a tyrant , as Socrates did , the danger can not be slight that something else will play the tyrant . Rationality was then hit upon as the savior ; neither Socrates nor his " patients " had any choice about being rational : it was de rigueur , it was their last resort . The fanaticism with which all Greek reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was danger , there was but one choice : either to perish or to be absurdly rational . The moralism of the Greek philosophers from Plato on is pathologically conditioned ; so is their esteem of dialectics . Reason=virture=happiness , that means merely that one must imitate Socrates and counter the dark appetites with a permanent daylight - the daylight of reason . One must be clever , clear , bright at any price : any concession to the instincts , to the unconscious , leads downward . <p> 11 <p> I have given to understand how it was that Socrates fascinated : he seemed to be a physician , a savior . Is it necessary to go on to demonstrate the error in his faith in " rationality at any price " ? It is a self-deception on the part of philosophers and moralists if they believe that they are extricating themselves from decadence when they merely wage war against it . . . . Socrates was a misunderstanding ; the whole improvement-morality , including the Christian , was a misunderstanding . The most blinding daylight ; rationality at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious , without instinct , in opposition to the instincts-all this too was a mere disease , another disease , and by no means a return to " virtue , " to " health , " to happiness . To have to fight the instincts-that is the formula of decadence : as long as life is ascending , happiness equals instinct . <p> 12 <p> Did he himself still comprehend this , this most brilliant of all self-outwitters ? Was this what he said to himself in the end , in the wisdom of his courage to die ? Socrates wanted to die : not Athens , but he himself chose the hemlock ; he forced Athens to sentence him . " Socrates is no physician , " he said softly to himself ; " here death alone is the physician . Socrates himself has merely been sick a long time . " ( Twilight of the Idols , Preface and Ch. 1 ) <p> As Nietzsche saw it , the whole role of " reason " in Western philosophy has to been to falsify reality , to create non-existent worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially lying priests . <p> " REASON " IN PHILOSOPHY <p> 1 <p> You ask me which of the philosophers ' traits are really idiosyncrasies ? For example , their lack of historical sense , their hatred of the very idea of becoming , their Egypticism . They think that they show their respect for a subject when they de-historicize it , sub specie aeterni - when they turn it into a mummy . All that philosophers have handled for thousands of years have been conceptual-mummies ; nothing real escaped their grasp alive . When these honorable idolaters of concepts worship something , they kill it and stuff it ; they threaten the life of everything they worship . Death , change , old age , as well as procreation and growth , are to their minds objections , never refutations . Whatever has being does not become ; whatever becomes does not have being . Now they all believe , desperately even , in what has being . But since they never grasp it , they seek for reasons why it is kept from them . " There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from perceiving that which has being : where is the deceiver ? " " We have found him , " they cry ecstatically ; " it is the senses ! These senses , which are so immoral in other ways too , deceive us concerning the true world . Moral : let us free ourselves from the deception of the senses , from becoming , from history , from lies ; history is nothing but faith in the senses , faith in lies . Moral : let us say No to all who have faith in the senses , to all the rest of mankind ; they are all ' mob . ' Let us be philosophers ! Let us be mummies ! Let us represent monotono-theism by adopting the expression of a gravedigger ! And above all , away with the body , this wretched idee fixe of the senses , disfigured by all the fallacies of logic , refuted , even impossible , although it is impudent enough to behave as if it were real . " <p> 2 <p> With the highest respect , I except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk rejected the testimony of the senses because they showed multiplicity and change , he rejected their testimony because they showed things as if they had permanence and unity . Heraclitus too did the senses an injustice . They lie neither in the way the Eleatics believed , nor as he believed they do not lie at all . What we make of their testimony , that alone introduces lies ; for example , the lie of unity , the lie of thinghood , of substance , of permanence . " Reason " is the cause of our falsification of the testimony of the senses . Insofar as the senses show becoming , passing away , and change , they do not lie . But Heraclitus will remain eternally right with his assertion that being is an empty fiction . The " apparent " world is the only one : the " real " world has only been lyingly added . <p> . . . . <p> 5 <p> At long last , let us contrast the very different manner in which we conceive the problem of error and appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Formerly , alteration , change , any becoming at all , were taken as proof of mere appearance , as an indication that there must be something which led us astray . Today , conversely , precisely insofar as the prejudice of reason forces us to posit unity , identity , permanence , substance , cause , thinghood , being , we see ourselves somehow caught in error , compelled into error . So certain are we , on the basis of rigorous examination , that this is where the error lies . It is no different in this case than with the movement of the sun : there our eye is the constant advocate of error , here it is our language . In its origin language belongs in the age of the most rudimentary form of psychology . We enter a realm of crude fetishism when we summon before consciousness the basic presuppositions of the metaphysics of language , in plain talk , the presuppositions of reason . Everywhere it sees a doer and doing ; it believes in will as the cause ; it believes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ego as substance , and it projects this faith in the ego-substance upon all things ? only thereby does it first create the concept of " thing . " Everywhere " being " is thought in , foisted on , pushed underneath ? as the cause ; the concept of being follows , and is a derivative of , the concept of ego . In the beginning there is that great calamity of an error that the will is something which is effective , that will is a capacity . Today we know that it is only a word . Very much later , in a world which was in a thousand ways more enlightened , philosophers , to their great surprise , became aware of the sureness , the subjective certainty , in our handling of the categories of reason : they concluded that these categories could not be derived from anything empirical ? for everything empirical plainly contradicted them . Where then do they originate ? And in India , as in Greece , the same mistake was made : " We must once have been at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower one , which would have been the truth ) ; we must have been divine , for we have reason ! " Indeed , nothing has yet possessed a more naive power of persuasion than the error concerning being , as it has been formulated by the Eleatics , for ex ample . After all , every word we say and every sentence speak in its favor . Even the opponents of the Eleatics still succumbed to the seduction of their concept of being : Democritus , among others , when he invented his atom ? " Reason " in language ? A deceptive old woman ! I am afraid we can not get rid of God because we still believe in grammar . ( Twilight of the Idols , Ch. 2 ) <p> Here , Nietzsche broaches one of his most modern insights , that the fabled truths of reason in Western philosophy are hallucinations caused by Indo-European grammar . We will return to it in the last section . Before we pursue that , let us look at his conclusion in " Twilight " -- the acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " REAL WORLD " FINALLY BECAME A MYTH <p> The History of an Error <p> 1 . The real world ? attainable by the wise , the pious , the virtuous man ; he dwells in it , he is it . ( The oldest form of the idea , relatively sensible , simple , and convincing . A transformation of the sentence , " I , Plato , am the truth . " ) <p> 2 . The real world ? unattainable for now , but promised to the wise , the pious , the virtuous man ( " to the sinner who repents " ) . ( Progress of the idea : it grows more subtle , more enticing , more incomprehensible ? it becomes a woman , it becomes Christian . ) <p> 3 . The real world ? unattainable , indemonstrable , unpromisable ; but even merely thought of ? a consolation , an obligation , an imperative . ( At bottom , the same old sun , but shining through mist and skepticism . The idea grown elusive , pale , Nordic , Knigsbergian . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , unattained . And being unattained , also unknown . Consequently , not consoling , redeeming , or obligating : how could something unknown obligate us ? ( Gray dawn . The first yawnings of reason . The cockcrow of positivism. ) 3 <p> 6 . We have abolished the real world . What world is left ? The apparent world perhaps ? But no ! with the real world we have also abolished the apparent world ! ( Mid-day ; moment of the shortest shadow ; end of the longest error ; high point of humanity ; INCIPIT ZARATHUSTRA . ) <p> ( Twilight of the Idols Ch. 4 ) <p> We go from Plato to Christianity to Kant ( note the reference to Konigsberg ) . Kant , remember , tried to derive human dignity and pure moral duty from our base in his " Noumenal world . " <p> The second step reminds us that Christianity is the popular embodiment of Greek rationalism . The Christian " real world " is heaven ( not so distant from Plato 's realm of ideas ) . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting discussion of Christianity . A good Christian views oneself and all mankind as condemned at birth , as hopeless sinners . Christianity partakes most enthusiastically of Socrates illness--of hatred of this life and longing for the other--death . Nietzsche views Christianity 's constant talk of the glories of " the other world " and its denigration of " the natural world " as a disguised longing for death--a hatred of life , of our nature . Christianity distills ' evil ' out of all natural instincts . <p> One should not embellish or dress up Christianity : it has waged a war to the death against this higher type of man , it has excommunicated all the fundamental instincts of this type , it has distilled evil , the Evil One , out of these instincts -the strong human being as the type of reprehensibility , as the ' outcast ' . Christianity has taken the side of everything weak , base , ill-constituted , it has made an ideal out of opposition to the preservative instincts of strong life ; it has depraved the reason even of the intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellectuality as sinful , as misleading , as temptations The most deplorable example : the depraving of Pascal , who believed his reason had been depraved by original sin while it had only been depraved by his Christianity ! ( The Anti-Christ 5 ) <p> Christianity conceals its self-hatred , Nietzsche argues , behind a smokescreen of valuing something beyond life . It takes the form of inventing a reality other than " this . " Its affection for the imagined reality conceals its hatred of this one . Even its values ( pity , mercy ) consist in valuing declining types--a mask for nihilism--the worship of ultimate nothingness . <p> Pity on the whole thwarts the law of evolution , which is the law of selection It preserves what is ripe for destruction ; it defends life 's disinherited and condemned ; through the abundance of the ill ? constituted of all kinds which it retains in life it gives life itself a gloomy and questionable aspect . One has ventured to call pity a virtue ( ? in every noble morality it counts as weakness ? ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtue , the ground and origin of all virtue ? only , to be sure , from the viewpoint of a nihilistic philosophy which inscribed Denial of Life on its escutcheon ? a fact always to be kept in view . Schopenhauer was within his rights in this : life is denied , made more worthy of denial by pity ? pity is practical nihilism . To say it again , this depressive and contagious instinct thwarts those instincts bent on preserving and enhancing the value of life : both as a multiplier of misery and as a conservator of everything miserable it is one of the chief instruments for the advancement of decadence ? pity persuades to nothingness ! . . . One does not say ' nothingness ' : one says ' the Beyond ' ; or ' God ' ; or true life ' ; or Nirvana , redemption , blessedness .... This innocent rhetoric from the domain of religio ? moral idiosyncrasy at once appears much less innocent when one grasps which tendency is here draping the mantle of sublime words about itself : the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore pity became for him a virtue .... Aristotle , as is well known , saw in pity a morbid and dangerous condition which one did well to get at from time to time with a purgative : he understood tragedy as a purgative . <p> The Anti-Christ 7 <p> Nietzsche goes on to contrast Christianity unfavorably with Buddhism . It is not on the grounds that one of them hates life and the other embraces it . They differ in their honesty and integrity in stating their shared hatred of life . Like Christianity , Nietzsche says , Buddhism is a decadance religion--a religion that favors death . However , it is far more intellectual . It 's longing for death is clear and direct . It is set against a background belief in reincarnation--we are caught up in a cycle of rebirth . Eternal life is our inescapable curse ! The goal of Buddhism is to be able finally to die and stay dead--that is Nirvana ( like the blowing out of a candle ) . <p> The other difference is that Buddhism makes its openly nihilistic goal achievable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double-bind between its doctrine of " original sin " and its predestination . This means that we hate ourselves as sinners , but as sinners have no power to do anything about it . We have to await God 's " grace " ? something totally out of our control . Only that supernatural intervention can transform us . <p> In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point . Nothing but imaginary causes ( ' God ' , ' soul ' , ' ego ' , ' spirit ' , ' free will ' ? or ' unfree will ' ) : nothing but imaginary effects ( ' sin ' , ' redemption ' , ' grace ' , ' punishment ' , ' forgiveness of sins ' ) . A traffic between imaginary beings ( ' God ' , ' spirits ' , ' souls ' ) ; an imaginary natural science ( anthropocentric ; complete lack of the concept of natural causes ) ; an imaginary psychology ( nothing but self ? misunderstandings , interpretations of pleasant or unpleasant general feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of the sign ? language of religio ? moral idiosyncrasy ? ' repentance ' , ' sting of conscience ' , ' temptation by the Devils , ' the proximity of God ' ) ; an imaginary teleology ( ' the kingdom of God ' , s the Last Judgement ' , ' eternal life ' ) . ? This purely fictitious world is distinguished from the world of dreams , very much to its disadvantage , by the fact that the latter mirrors actuality , while the former falsifies , disvalues and denies actuality . Once the concept s nature ' had been devised as the concept antithetical to ' God ' , ' natural ' had to be the word for ' reprehensible ' ? this entire fictional world has its roots in hatred of the natural ( ? actuality I ? ) , it is the expression of a profound discontent with the actual ....

They belong together as nihilistic religions ? they are decadence religions ? but they are distinguished from one another in the most remarkable way . The critic of Christianity is profoundly grateful to Indian scholars that one is now able to compare these two religions . ? Buddhism is a hundred times more realistic than Christianity ? it has the heritage of a cool and objective posing of problems in its composition , it arrives after a philosophical movement lasting hundreds of years ; the concept ' God ' is already abolished by the time it arrives .

The two physiological facts upon which it rests and on which it fixes its eyes are : firstly an excessive excitability of sensibility which expresses itself as a refined capacity for pain , then an over ? intellectuality , a too great preoccupation with concepts and logical procedures under which the personal instinct has sustained harm to the advantage of the ' impersonal ' ( ? both of them conditions which at any rate some of my readers , the objective ones , will know from experience , as I do ) . on the basis of these physiological conditions a state of depression has arisen : against this depression Buddha takes hygienic measures . He opposes it with life in the open air , the wandering life ; with moderation and fastidiousness as regards food ; with caution towards all alcoholic spirits ; likewise with caution towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no anxiety , either for oneself or for others . He demands ideas which produce repose or cheerfulness ? he devises means for disaccustoming oneself to others . He understands benevolence , being kind , as health ? promoting . Prayer is excluded , as is asceticism ; no categorical imperative , no compulsion at all , not even within the monastic community ( ? one can leave it ? ) . All these would have the effect of increasing that excessive excitability . For this reason too he demands no struggle against those who think differently ; his teaching resists nothing more than it resists the feeling of revengefulness , of antipathy , of ressintiment ( ? ? ' enmity is not ended by enmity ' : the moving refrain of the whole of Buddhism . . . ) . And quite rightly : it is precisely these emotions which would be thoroughly unhealthy with regard to the main dietetic objective . The spiritual weariness he discovered and which expressed itself as an excessive ' objectivity ' ( that is to say weakening of individual interest , loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he combated by directing even the spiritual interests back to the individual person . In the teaching of Buddha egoism becomes a duty : the ' one thing needful ' , the ' how can you get rid of suffering ' regulates and circumscribes the entire spiritual diet ( ? one may perhaps call to mind . that Athenian who likewise made war on pure ' scientificality ' , Socrates , who elevated personal egoism to morality even in the domain of problems ) . <p> The Anti-Christ 20 <p> The precondition for Buddhism is a very mild climate , very gentle and liberal customs , no militarism ; and that it is the higher and even learned classes in which the movement has its home . The supreme goal is cheerfulness , stillness absence of desire , and this goal is achieved . Buddhism is not a religion in which one merely aspires after perfection : perfection is the normal case . <p> In Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and oppressed come into the foreground : it is the lowest classes which seek their salvation in it . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience ? inquisition is practiced as a specific against boredom ; here an emotional attitude towards a power , called ' God ' , is kept constantly alive ( through prayer ) ; here the highest things are considered unachievable , gifts , ' grace ' . Here public openness is also lacking ; the hole ? and ? corner , the dark chamber is Christian . Here the body is despised , hygiene repudiated as sensuality ; the Church even resists cleanliness ( ? the first measure taken by the Christians after the expulsion of the Moors was the closure of the public baths , of which Cordova alone possessed 270 ) . A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian ; hatred of those who think differently ; the will to persecute . Gloomy and exciting ideas stand in the foreground ; the states most highly desired and designated by the highest names are epileptoid states ; diet is selected so as to encourage morbid phenomena and to over ? excite the nerves . Mortal hostility against the masters of the earth , against the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret competition ( ? one allows them the ' body ' , one wants only the ' soul ' ) : that is also Christian . Hatred of mind , of pride , courage , freedom , libertinage of mind is Christian ; hatred of the senses , of the joy of the senses , of joy in general is Christian . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 21 <p> Buddhism , to say it again , is a hundred times colder , more veracious , more objective . It no longer needs to make its suffering and capacity for pain decent to itself by interpreting it as sin ? ? it merely says what it feels : ' I suffer ' . To the barbarian on the contrary , suffering in itself is not decent : he first requires it to be interpreted before he will admit to himself that he suffers ( his instinct directs him rather to deny he is suffering , to a silent endurance ) . Here the word ' Devil ' was a blessing : one had an overwhelming and fearful enemy ? one did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an enemy. ? ? <p> Christianity has a number of subtleties in its foundations which belong to the Orient . Above all , it knows that it is in itself a matter of absolute indifference whether a thing be true , but a matter of the highest importance to what extent it is believed to be true . Truth and the belief that something is true : two completely diverse worlds of interest , almost antithetical worlds ? one gets to them by fundamentally different roads . To be knowledgeable in this ? in the Orient that is almost enough to constitute a sage : thus the Brahmins understood it , thus Plato understands it , thus does every student of esoteric wisdom understand it . If , for example , there is happiness to be found in believing oneself redeemed from sin , it is not necessary for a man first to be sinful , but for him to feel himself sinful . If , however , it is belief as such which is necessary above all else , then one has to bring reason , knowledge , inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . ? Intense hope is a much stronger stimulant to life than any single instance of happiness which actually occurs . Sufferers have to be sustained by a hope which can not be refuted by any actuality ? ? which is not done away with by any fulfilment : a hope in the Beyond . ( It was precisely on account of this capacity for keeping the unhappy in suspense that the Greeks considered hope the evil of evils , the actual malignant evil : it remained behind in the box of evil. ) ? so that love shall be possible , God has to be a person ; so that the lowest instincts shall have a voice , God has to be young . To satisfy the ardour of the women a handsome saint is moved into the foreground , to satisfy that of the men a Mary . This on the presupposition that Christianity desires to become master on a soil where the worship of Adonis or Aphrodite has already determined the concept of what religious worship is . The requirement of chastity increases the vehemence and inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer , more enthusiastic , more soulful . ? Love is the state in which man sees things most of all as they are not . The illusion ? creating force is there at its height , likewise the sweetening and transforming force . One endures more when in love than one otherwise would , one tolerates everything . The point was to devise a religion in which love is possible : with that one is beyond the worst that life can offer ? one no longer even sees it . ? so much for the three Christian virtues faith , hope and charity : I call them the three Christian schrewdnesses . ? ? Buddhism is too late , too positivistic still to be shrewd in this fashion . <p> The Anti-Christ 23 <p> Christianity lands its believers in a double bind . They must hate themselves as irredeemable sinners and then they have to give up any hope of changing themselves . Only grace can do that . It relies on the arbitrary decision of God to intervene . Nothing their own actions can make them better . Buddhism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate path that will lead one finally to reach the goal of non-existence . <p> Nietzsche 's views on Christianity are so negative , it may be hard to imagine that he inspired a " God is Dead " movement in the middle of the 20th century that transformed Western religion . ( This also explains why modern Christians will find Nietzsche 's criticisms off-target or old fashioned . ) Nietzsche 's critique transfigured Christianity into the more " liberal " versions we know today . The possibility of a Nietzschean Christianity rests on Nietzsche 's insistence that the errors in Christianity are not due to Christ . His view of Christ is surprisingly positive ! <p> What are the ' glad tidings ' ? True life , eternal life is found ? it is not promised , it is here , it is within you ; as life lived in love , in love without deduction or exclusion , without distance . Everyone is a child of God ? Jesus definitely claims nothing for himself alone ? as a child of God everyone is equal to everyone else .... To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worse misunderstanding is the word ' genius ' ! Our whole concept , our cultural concept ' spirit ' had no meaning whatever in the world Jesus lived in . To speak with the precision of the physiologist a quite different word would rather be in place here : the word idiot . We recognize a condition of morbid susceptibility of the sense of touch which makes it shrink back in horror from every contact , every grasping of a firm object . Translate such a physiological habitus into its ultimate logic ? ? as instinctive hatred of every reality , as flight into the ' ungraspable ' , into the ' inconceivable ' , as antipathy towards every form , every spacial and temporal concept , towards everything firm , all that is custom , institution , Church , as being at home in a world undisturbed by reality of any kind , a merely ' inner world , a ' real ' world , an ' eternal ' world .... ' The kingdom of God is within you ' . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 29 <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally that this antirealist can speak at all . Among Indians he would have made use of Sankhyam concepts , among Chinese those of Laozi and would not have felt the difference .. ? One could , with some freedom of expression , call Jesus a ' free spirit ' ? he cares nothing for what is fixed : the word killeth , everything fixed killeth The concept , the experience ' life ' in the only form he knows it is opposed to any kind of word , formula , law , faith , dogma . He speaks only of the inmost thing : ' life ' or ' truth ' or ' light ' is his expression for the inmost thing ? everything else , the whole of reality , the whole of nature , language itself , possesses for him merely the value of a sign , a metaphor . ? on this point one must make absolutely no mistake , however much Christian , that is to say ecclesiastical prejudice , may tempt one to do so : such a symbolist par excellence s tands outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , all natural science , all experience of the world , all acquirements , all politics , all psychology , all books , all art ? his ' knowledge ' is precisely the pure folly of the fact that anything of this kind exists . He has not so much as heard of culture , he does not need to fight against it ? he does not deny it .... The same applies to the state , to society and the entire civic order , to work , to war ? ? he never had reason to deny ' the world ' , he had no notion of the ecclesiastical concept ' world ' .... Denial is precisely what is totally impossible ? for him . ? Dialectics are likewise lacking , the idea is lacking that a faith , a ' truth ' could be proved by reasons ( ? his proofs are inner ' lights ' , inner feelings of pleasure and self ? affirmations , nothing but ' proofs by potency ' ? ) . Neither can such a doctrine argue : it simply does not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know how to imagine an opinion contrary to its own .... Where it encounters one it will , with the most heartfelt sympathy , lament the ' blindness ' ? for it sees the ' light ' ? but it will make no objection . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 32 <p> The life of the redeemer was nothing else than this practice his death too was nothing else .... He no longer required any formulas , any rites for communicating with God ? not even prayer . He has settled his accounts with the whole Jewish penance ? and ? reconciliation doctrine ; he knows that it is through the practice of one 's life that one feels ' divine ' , ' blessed ' , ' evangelic ' , at all times a ' child of God ' . It is not ' penance ' , not ' prayer for forgiveness ' which leads to God : evangelic practice alone leads to God , it is God ! ? What was abolished with the Evangel was the Judaism of the concepts ' sin ' , ' forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith ' ? the whole of Jewish ecclesiastical teaching was denied in the ' glad tidings ' . <p> The profound instinct for how one would have to live in order to feel oneself ' in Heaven ' , to feel oneself ' eternal ' while in every other condition one by no means feels oneself ' in Heaven ' : this alone is the psychological reality of ' redemption ' . ? A new way of living , not a new belief . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 33 <p> The ' kingdom of Heaven ' is a condition of the heart ? not something that comes ' upon the earth ' or ' after death ' . The entire concept of natural death is lacking in the Gospel : death is not a bridge , not a transition , it is lacking because it belongs to quite another world , a merely apparent world useful only for the purpose of symbolism . The ' hour of death ' is rot a Christian concept ? the ' hour ' , time , physical life and its crises , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidings ' . . . . The ' kingdom of God ' is not something one waits for ; it has no yesterday or tomorrow , it does not come ' in a thousand years ' ? it is an experience within a heart ; it is everywhere , it is nowhere . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 34 <p> So Christ himself was a kind of mystic who ( as we will see later ) resembles the Zen master in his emphasis on practice and his focus on this life . He did not want people to yearn for another world , but to focus on this one . He was himself a re-evaluator of values who set out to overturn the " laws . " However , if this was the message of Christ , where did Christianity go wrong ? <p> ? Our age is proud of its historical sense : how was it able to make itself believe in the nonsensical notion that the crude miracle ? worker and redeemer fable comes at the commencement of Christianity ? and that everything spiritual and symbolic is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity ? and that from the very death on the Cross ? is the history of progressively cruder misunderstanding of an original symbolism . With every extension of Christianity over even broader , even ruder masses in whom the preconditions out of which it was born were more and more lacking , it became increasingly necessary to vulgarize , to barbarize Christianity ; it absorbed the doctrines and rites of every subterranean cult of the Imperium Romanum , it absorbed the absurdities of every sort of morbid reason . The fate of Christianity lies in the necessity for its faith itself to grow as morbid , low and vulgar as the requirements it was intended to satisfy were morbid , low and vulgar . As the Church , this morbid barbaric itself finally assumes power ? the Church , that form of mortal hostility to all integrity , to all loftiness of soul , to discipline of spirit , to all open ? hearted and benevolent humanity . ? Christian values ? noble values : it is only we , we emancipated spirits , who have restored this greatest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real culprit , the one who changed Christianity from a this-word , life-affirming outlook to a decadent one was someone from the Greek-Roman Culture--St . Paul . He was the source of the anti-sex , anti-life , anti-female , anti-instinct tone that settled into Christian institutions . <p> ? To resume , I shall now relate the real history of Christianity . ? The word ' Christianity ' is already a misunderstanding ? in reality there has been only one Christian , and he died on the Cross . The ' Evangel ' died on the Cross . What was called ' Evangel ' from this moment onwards was already the opposite of what he had lived : ' bad tidings ' , a dysangel . It is false to the point of absurdity to see in a ' belief ' , perchance the belief in redemption through Christ , the distinguishing characteristic of the Christian : only Christian pra e , a life such as he who died on the Cross lived , is Christian .... Even today such a life is possible , for certain men even necessary : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Not a belief but a doing , above all a not ? doing of many things , a different being .... States of consciousness , beliefs of any kind , holding something to be true for example ? every psychologist knows this ? are a matter of complete indifference and of the fifth rank compared with the value of the instincts : to speak more strictly , the whole concept of spiritual causality is false . To reduce being a Christian , Christianness , to a holding something to be true , to a mere phenomenality of consciousness , means to negate Christianness . In fact , there have been no Christians at all . The ' Christian ' , that which has been called Christian for two millennia , is merely a psychological self ? misunderstanding . <p> The Anti-Christ 39 <p> ? And now an absurd problem came up : ' How could God have permitted that ? ' For this question the deranged reason of the ? little community found a downright terrifyingly absurd answer : God gave his Son for the forgiveness of sins , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Gospel ! The guilt sacrifice , and that in its most repulsive , barbaric form , the sacrifice of the innocent man for the sins of the guiltyl What atrocious paganism ? For Jesus had done away with the concept ' guilt ' itself ? he had denied any chasm between God and man , he lived this unity of God and man as his ' glad tidings ' .... And not as a special prerogative ! ? From now on there is introduced into the type of the redeemer step by step : the doctrine of a Judgement and a Second Coming , the doctrine of his death as a sacrificial death , the doctrine of the Resurrection with which the entire concept ' blessedness ' , the whole and sole reality of the Evangel , is juggled away ? for the benefit of a state after death ! . . . Paul , with that rabbinical insolence which characterizes him in every respect , rationalized this interpretation , this indecency of an interpretation , thus : ' If Christ is not resurrected from the dead our faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises , the impudent doctrine of personal immortality .... Paul himself even taught it as a reward ! . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 41 <p> One sees what came to an end with the death on the Cross . a new , an absolutely primary beginning to a Buddhistic peace movement , to an actual and not merely promised happiness on earth . For this remains ? I have already emphasized it ? the basic distinction between the two decadance religions : Buddhism makes no promises but keeps them , Christianity makes a thousand promises but keeps none . ? On the heels of the ' glad tidings came the worst of all : those of Paul . In Paul was embodied the antithetical type to the ' bringer of glad tidings ' the genius of hatred , of the vision of hatred , of the inexorable logic of hatred . What did this dysangelist not sacrifice to his hatred ! The redeemer above all : he nailed him to his Cross <p> The life , the example , the teaching , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel ? nothing was left once this hate ? obsessed false ? coiner had grasped what alone he could make use of . Not the reality , not the historical truth I . . . And once more the priestly instinct of the Jew perpetrated the same great crime against history ? it simply erased the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity , it devised for itself a history of primitive Christianity . More : it falsified the history of Israel over again so as to make this history seem the pre ? history of its act : all the prophets had spoken of its ' redeemer ' .... The Church subsequently falsified even the history of mankind into the pre ? history of Christianity .... The type of the redeemer , the doctrine , the practice , the death , the meaning of the death , even the sequel to the death ? nothing was left untouched , nothing was left bearing even the remotest resemblance to reality . Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that entire existence beyond this existence ? in the lie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no use at all of the redeemer 's life ? he needed the death on the Cross and something in addition .... To regard as honest a Paul whose home was the principal centre of Stoic enlightenment when he makes of a hallucination the proof that the redeemer is still living , or even to believe his story that he had this hallucination , would be a real niaiserie on the part of a psychologist : Paul willed the end , consequently he willed the means .... What he himself did not believe was believed by the idiots among whom he cast his teaching . ? His requirement was power ; with Paul the priest again sought power ? he could employ only those concepts , teachings , symbols with which one tyrannizes over masses , forms herds . What was the only thing Mohammed later borrowed from Christianity ? The invention of Paul , his means for establishing a priestly tyranny , for forming herds : the belief in immortality ? that is to say the doctrine of ' judgement ' . . . . <p> The Anti-Christ 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anti-realism consists in giving up the faith that we are getting closer and closer to some ultimate truth about reality and values . Our theories are interpretations of the world akin to interpretation of texts . The textual scholar starts from a distinction between an original meaning and an interpretation . However , when we think of the actual work of an interpreter , we see the claim that there is an original meaning of a text as an expression of her will to create something . She wants an understanding better than the one she inherits from past scholars . What makes it better ? Not its resemblance to any original , but how satisfactory it is to the interpreter herself . We interpret texts out of our will to create--our will to power . <p> Similarly in science , Nietzsche argues , we do not constantly get closer to some original , basic reality , we merely try to make the theories of past scientists more satisfying--give us more power over events , ourselves , others , etc . The myth of the original or absolute reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is dead " means we must give up the very notion of the real world . That myth no longer plays any useful function . We do not give up values . We create values ; we create myths to conform to our values ; we create out of sheer will . Why have philosophers , priests , humans in general been this self-deceptive about their creative drive , their will to power ? Nietzsche blames it on " human weakness , " the " dominance of numbers " and " the cleverness of the lower forms " of humans . <p> However , like the Daoist and the 20th century philosopher , Nietzsche also sees a linguistic source for the persistence of an Indo-European belief in " the real world , " in the substantial self ( the ego/soul ) and in God . Its source is not in reason , but in grammar . Westerners think the subject-predicate sentence structure is the structure of reason , while it is in fact only the structure of Indo-European languages . Because they believe that every truth has a subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must believe in the individual self : Descartes ' ' I ' which does the thinking . For every action there must be an agent--this is a truth of grammar . <p> There are still harmless self-observers who believe ' immediate certainties ' exist , for example ' I think ' ... But I shall reiterate a hundred times ' immediate certainty ' like ' absolute knowledge ' and ' thing in itself ' , contains a contradiction in terms ... when I analyze the event expressed in the sentence ' I think ' I acquire a series of rash assertions which are difficult , perhaps impossible , to prove - for example . that it is I which thinks , that it has to be a something at all which thinks that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of an entity thought of as a has cause , that an ' I ' exists , finally that what is designated by ' thinking ' has already been determined -- that I know what thinking is . . . In this way the philosopher acquires in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of metaphysical questions . . . : ' Whence do I take the concept thinking ? Why do I believe in cause and effeect ? What gives me the right to speak of an I . . . an I as cause . . . an I as cause of thoughts ? ' . . . ( Beyond Good and Evil 16. ) 5 <p> This clever grammatical trick is an attempt to hold the rationalist world together even as science tears it apart . Descartes , as we saw , thought he could prove that a " thinking thing " exists . Nietzsche points out that his argument ( like that of Parmenides ) merely depends on the grammatical assumption that a complete subject-predicate sentence can only be true if the subject term refers . So " I . . . . " entails that I exist as much as does " I think . " The real advantage of " I think " lies in the fact that we can not imagine it false . <p> Such utterances create a particular kind of paradox . Let us call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conflict between what we say and the speech act of actually saying it ) . Descartes exploits that point to note the paradox in the thought " I am not thinking . " He concludes , hence , that thinking the thought is incompatible with its being false . Given that it is true whenever we think it , he can next take Parmenides ' step : the subject term must refer to something that exists . <p> Descartes use of the Ontological argument is a similar grammatical trick . From thinking that every predicate is a quality which things can have , we suppose that the subject , who has all the positive qualities to the greatest degree , must have existence to the greatest degree . This is a grammatical trick , not a truth of logic . <p> Since every truth has a subject-predicate structure . We can ideally sum up all truth in a subject predicate form . The-sum-of-all-subjects is **25;2498;TOOLONG . What is the universal subject ? God . What is the universal Object ? The world . Reason is the structure that unites God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ... The singular family resemblance between all Indian , Greek and German philosophizing is easy enough to explain Where there exists a language affinity it is quite impossible , thanks to the common philosophy of grammar ? I mean thanks to unconscious domination and directing by similar grammatical functions ? to avoid everything being prepared in advance for a similar evolution and succession of philosophical systems : just as the road seems to be barred to certain other possibilities of world interpretation . . . . BGE 20 6 <p> What unites Indian thought ( Buddhism ) and Greek thought ( Christianity ) is a shared Indo-European grammar and the concepts of soul , subject , object , mind etc. that are inherent in it . What the philosopher has called " reason " is just " interpretation according to a scheme we can not throw off--a grammatical scheme . " " Reason in Language--a deceitful old woman . I fear we are not getting rid of God because we still believe in grammar . " <h> Questions for Review and Discussion <p> 1 . " Life is good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " than is " Life is suffering ?

##1154350 <p> The forex market The Foreign Exchange market which is often referred to as the " Forex " or " FX markets " is the largest , most liquid , most transparent financial market in the world . Daily average turnover has now exceeded 2 trillion USD . All the U.S. equity markets combined do not reach 3% of the total volume traded on the FX market . Unlike other financial markets , where for the most part you can only profit in rising markets , in the FX market whenever one enters into a position he is long ( bought ) one currency and short ( sold ) another currency simultaneously which means as opposed to other cyclical financial markets in the FX markets there are endless opportunities . <p> Basic Concepts The term Foreign Exchange means the transferring of one currency into another simultaneously . Since currencies are traded in pairs , to profit from an exchange rate move you need to buy the currency that you expect will strengthen and sell the other . For example if you believed that the Euro ( EUR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would buy the EUR/USD ; or in other words buy the EUR and sell the USD . Alternatively , if you believed that the EUR was going to depreciate against the USD then you would sell the EUR/USD ; or sell the EUR and buy the USD . As can be seen there is no need to wait for a bullish market to profit , for at any given moment , one currency will be strengthening against another . The FX market is therefore constantly producing opportunities to invest . <p> Who Trades in the FX Market ? Foreign exchange traders can be separated into two groups , hedgers and speculators . Hedgers : Governments , companies ( exporters and importers ) and some investors have foreign exchange exposure . Adverse movements between their local or domestic currency and the foreign currency of the group they are either doing business with ( for the exchange of goods and services ) or investing in will affect their bottom line . This is the core of all foreign exchange trading ; however it only makes up approximately 5% of the actual market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , corporations and individuals -- create artificial rate exposure in order to profit from the variations or movements in the price.we trade off-exchange forex transactions . <p> Currency Pairs Currency Pairs : Each currency is recognized by a three letter code . For example EUR ( is the EURO and refers to the European currency ) , USD ( is the United States Dollar ) . The worlds leading currencies ( often referred to as the majors ) are the EUR , USD , JPY ( Japanese Yen ) , GBP ( the British Pound or Sterling ) , CHF ( the Swiss franc ) , AUD ( the Australian Dollar ) and the CAD ( the Canadian Dollar ) . Currencies are traded in pairs and are displayed as such . There is always the three letter currency code a slash and another three letter currency code . The first currency displayed refers to the " base " , " leading " or " primary currency " ; the second currency refers to the " secondary currency " . For instance when looking at the EUR/USD the EUR is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " currency pair " or " currency cross " is then followed by a number ; this is typically a five digit number with a decimal point after the first , for instance 1.2660 . The number represents the ratio of one currency against the other , and can be read as " the amount of the secondary currency needed in order to have one unit of the major currency " . In the example just given , EUR/USD 1.2660 , one would require 1 Dollar and 26.6 cents to exchange for 1 Euro . <p> Bid and Ask or Buy and Sell There are always two numbers given after the currency pair , the first always has a smaller numerical value then the second . This can once again be shown using the same example ( EUR/USD 1.2660 1.2663 ) . The first number is known as the " Bid " or " Sell " and the second number is known as the " Ask " , the " Offer " or " Buy " . The smaller number or the Bid ( Sell ) ( 1.2660 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy the secondary currency ; sell the EUR and buy the USD . The second price the Ask ( BUY ) ( 1.2663 ) represents the price where one can buy the major currency and sell the secondary ; buy the EUR and sell the USD . In the trading window below the trader is able to buy the EUR against the USD at 1.2847 or sell the EUR and buy the USD at 1.2844 . The trader is also able to buy the USD against the JPY at 117.60 and sell the USD and buy the JPY at 117.57 . <p> Calculating your P &L; As discussed above the foreign exchange rate represents the value of one unit in the major currency in the terms of a secondary currency . Since when opening a trade you exercise the trade in a set amount of the major currency and when closing the trade you do so in the same amount , the profit or loss generated by the round trip ( open and close ) trade will be in the secondary currency . For example if a trader sells 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his net position in EUR is zero ( 100,000-100,000 ) however his USD is not . The USD position is calculated as follows 100,000*1.2820= $128,200 long and -100,000*1.2760= -$127,600 short . The profit or loss is always in the second currency . For simplicity 's sake the P &L; statements often show the P &L; in USD terms . In this case the profit on the trade is $600 . As can be seen from the Open position window below in Ticket number 411 the trader has Bought 20,000 EUR against the USD at 1.2806 the current rate to close is 1.2844 , therefore the trader has

There are over 16,000 buses involved in the operations of the bus system in Shanghai , with a daily average passenger flow exceeding 7 million . In contrast , the low-carbon buses running through the Expo Site carry about 0.9 million passenger maximum per day . " The Expo Site utilizes 1% of the bus fleet available in Shanghai to carry 10% passenger flow in this cosmopolitan city , " said Hong Renchu . Mr. Liu , a Shanghai citizen , has visited the Expo Site for over a dozen times . Each time he basically travelled by bus in the Expo Site . On taking the low-carbon bus , Liu said , " It 's very clean . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cell Technology Revolution <p> ? The electric buses running through the Expo Site have their advantages and disadvantages as well . <p> The super-capacitor buses are noted for swift charging . But they have limited capacity , and what is worse , up to 25% energy is converted into heat energy in the course of charging , causing a waste of energy . Hong Renchu said that the super-capacitor vehicles have a relatively lower cost if observed from the perspective of the current services . The super-capacitor vehicles are used to run the Expo Boulevard Line . The buses of such type had once been put into passenger-carrying operations of Line 11 . This time , the continued driving distance was extended to 4 kilometers through technical upgrading . Originally , the bus would have to raise up its plait to charge for one minute every time it stops by a bus stop . And now , they can afford a distance of two to three stops before getting charged . The pure electric capacity buses are noted for considerably large capacity . But it takes longer time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands for continuous operations . ? The pure electric capacity buses are used on both the Cross-River Line and GuoZhan Line . When the cell reaches its minimum quantity level , the driver will drive the bus to the charging room for charging . The charging station is equipped with a total of 120 sets of back-up batteries , enough to meet the prompt demand for cell replacement . It takes more than 2 hours to charge a battery and a fully charged battery will drive the bus for about 80 kilometers . " There still is room for improvement of these two kinds of technologies and we look forward to a cell revolution , " said Hong Renchu . The low-carbon buses running in the Expo Site offer supports in terms of both technology and data to the low-carbon buses in the future . The future low-carbon buses will be running with better quality and improved reliability . " But it still takes time for the new energy bus to get developed . It took 10 years for the earlier gas engine to be upgraded to the diesel engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new energy to get upgraded . " He also points out that the development trend of low-carbon bus is represented by the hybrid vehicles , which are noted for such advantages as higher fuel efficiency and more environmental friendliness . For instance , there is no more black smoke emitted when starting up a vehicle
