Eamon , will you tell Brenda that I got her message that she would pass my message on to you . Actually you probably wo n't have seen that message yet . Howya Brenda , how 's things in the office ? Will you pass this message on to Eamon , as well as the previous message and then send me another message saying that you 'll pass this message on . Thanks . <p> So lads , I 'm sure you 're just dying to hear how things have been going for me since my last letter a week ago . In fact , the silence that greeted my last letter was such that I can only assume that everyone is just waiting for news from Kildare , but you really just do n't want to pester me with replies in case I get offended . Thanks for being so polite , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sensibilities by responding en masse . <p> ANYWAY ... there 's been no activity from my tormentors since last week so you can wipe your collective brows and breathe out again . I 'm sure you were deeply worried , so that should put you at your ease . Breathe in ... hold ... aaaaaaand release . Actually what happened was , I composed a letter to the solicitor - you remember him , he threatened me on behalf of someone/something despite me not having had any physical contact with anyone involved . Basically I used his own tactic and threatened him back . Well it 's only fair now is n't it ? This lot surely ca n't think they can threaten people and not consider the consequences ? That would imply that society is not actually equal and I 'm sure that 's not the case at all , know what I mean ? And I know I have n't got oodles of money or a sharp business suit to add weight to my threats , but sure we ca n't all be as lucky as these guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Speaking of threats , do you know where I was on Thursday and Friday of last week ? I was down in Limerick at Appletown Farm . Maybe you 've heard of it . It 's where Seamus Sherlock lives with his 5 children and his animals . Still not ringing any bells ? Ah c'm on guys , you must have heard of this man and how Bank of Scotland have slapped him with an eviction order even though he 's been trying to come to an arrangement . No ? You MUST have heard about the constant stream of people from all over the country who are turning up to support him since he was threatened with eviction OVER TWO WEEKS AGO ! Still not shaking the brain cells ? Jaysus lads . You surely must have heard about the enormous support he 's been getting outside of Ireland , from the UK , to Spain , to California , to Tunisia ? About how he 's not going to back down ? About how the ' sheriff ' whoever that is , to increase the intimidation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faced with a squad of parasites at his front gate ? That 's very psychopathic behaviour would n't you say ? Hello ! ! ! Is this registering at all ? About how only one of those esteemed people we think represent us has shown support ? Howya Tom , how 're things in the Kingdom ? <p> And another thing you might want to consider ... we may be having our wallets squeezed by you lot to keep you in the lifestyle to which you seem to feel entitled , but everyone who has been supporting Seamus has done so without unvouched expenses , travel allowances , or even a guarantee of having a few quid next week to feed the hamsters . Yet they still go because they feel that this is something worth fighting for . Hit the google button and type in ' basic right and wrong ' or ' common decency ' . I expect a 4-page essay in my inbox by next week . If you feel you ca n't handle this task , may I suggest an evening course instead ? <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe you 're from the general area . I guess the Bilderberg gang hold a far greater attraction to you now than standing up for someone from your own county . But hey , that 's your choice . At least you still have choices . Your career is more important to you than what happens to a decent man from your own county . Ah well ... <p> Now the only reason why I could be there at all last week was because , as I 'm sure you 'll remember from my previous letter , I 'm self-employed so I do n't have a guarantee of on-going work . I get long periods of time where there 's just no work out there at all . Well at the end of last week , I did have a little bit of time which I felt would be put to good use by trying in my own little way to help out someone who not only is in a much worse position than me , but has been an advocate for people in financial distress . Is n't it strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , cut off a beacon of light to other people ? Again , surely that would n't happen in a fair and just society like ours . <p> So there ya go . Seamus Sherlock is n't going anywhere and I 'm not going anywhere . That 's two . I suggest you start to brace yourselves lads , because your complete inability to deal with this issue coupled with your total betrayal of the Irish people and absolute incompetence is about to catch up with you . We 've had enough and we 're taking a stand . <p> Oh , and just so you ca n't say that you do n't know about Seamus and 
##3758551 <p> An Irish Divers Group based near the village of Muff have SLAMMED the recent Children 's referendum saying it had nothing to do with the rights of Children at all and instead , is just the latest attempt in the dismantling of the constitution altogether , before a race of aliens from the planet ' VOTRON ' invade and the government hands over Ireland 's sovereignty completely . <p> The random group , not known for their prowess in constitutional law or political jurisprudence , made the comments while out for a dip in Sheephaven Bay on Saturday , shortly after visiting their local polling station to tell the government that they plan on telling the invading aliens to feck the hell off by voting " No . " <p> A lot of Donegal people believe that voting Yes in any referendum gradually reduces the resolve of the Irish people so that if an alien army was ever to come down to earth , Ireland would be completely docile to their demands . <p> Barry ' Buff ' Bluff from Muff , president of the Irish Divers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of Ulster knew it .

##3759652 <h> 360 Games No Longer Have To Be In High Definition <p> Since it launched in 2005 developers have had to adhere to a number of guidelines set down my Microsoft . One of these meant that games had to run at a resolution of 1280x720 aka 720p . This meant that all titles for the 360 had to be in high definition . <p> Today Dave Jeffries in his column on industry site Develop revealed that Microsoft have dropped this requirement meaning that from no on developers can if they decide to release game in lower standard definition . <p> While this may come as big news to some it will not mark the first time that the 360 has had non high definition games released upon it . Halo 3 is the biggest example of a title which Microsoft allowed to be released in less than high definition .

##3764750 <p> G'day . I am doing a Masters in English at the Australian defence force Academy but my subject is History -- or perhaps I should say : historical . It is a story that has never been told . It is about a number of Australian soldiers in World War 1 who went on leave to Ireland and did not return -- some not for some time , others never . Australian soldiers who , after fighting alongside the British in the Middle East and Europe , found themselves in Ireland fighting with the Irish Republican Army against Britain . <p> My original Proposal was to write a biography of my one of my grandfathers , Australian born of Irish parents , Cornelius Patrick Casey , AKA No 20 Corporal Patrick Cornelius Casey , Military Medal , 13th Battalion . His experience provided me with the template to read the 5,865 service records in NAA series B2455 : Irish born men and women who enlisted in the AIF . <p> At the outbreak war , Australia is commonly described as more unified than at any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country , to fight for freedom or just to get a gun and have a go . Yet 1 in 4 of those Australians was of Irish descent . <p> On 30 September 1914 , just 12 days after Britain had promised Home Rule to Ireland once the war was over , Cornelius Patrick Casey enlisted at Randwick Racecourse . On page two of the Attestation Papers every soldier signed on joining the AIF there is the OATH TO BE TAKEN BY PERSONS BEING ENLISTED I ... swear that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lord the King in the Australian Imperial Force ... and that I will resist His Majesty 's enemies and cause His Majesty 's peace to be kept and maintained ; <p> Underneath , on Con 's , is the signature CP Casey but the " C " stands apart like an afterthought or a later addition in a different hand , a sign that Con may not have been so loyal to the King . There were 90 Irish born men who , for a variety of reasons , recanted their aliases . Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born " Australian invert his Christian names ? An explanation might be inferred from an observation made by John Lucy of the 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Rifles , one of the first NCOs to be promoted to the officer class in the British Army , that in the officers ' mess " after dinner , the water was removed from the table , lest anyone pass his glass over it during the loyal toast , signifying that the toast was ' to the king across the water . ' " Also , when Ireland erupted into Civil War after the creation of the Free State in 1922 , there were two main sticking points ; one of which was signing the Oath of Loyalty to the King . Was Con 's alias the act of a subject person , a way of lying to maintain his honesty ? <p> After enlistment , Con 's story is classic Digger . He landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 where he was twice wounded , he refused the offer of repatriation and , under Lieutenant Harry Murray ( who would became Australia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit of the Evacuation . A Diehard . <p> Subsequent to his wounds on Gallipoli , Con retrained as a stretcher bearer and in the next year on the Western Front was twice Mentioned in Dispatches and twice nominated for the Distinguished Conduct Medal before being awarded the Military Medal for the Battle of Messines in June 1917 . During that time , he saw action at Pozieres , Mouquet Farm , through the Somme Winter , at Stormy Trench and at Bullecourt . He had lost part of a finger and part of his eyesight , had toes amputated from trench foot , his lungs and heart damaged from gas and his back wrecked through carrying men through Somme mud . He had also been twice promoted so that by August 1917 he was a Corporal and head of the 4th Brigade stretcher bearers . Then , on 12 August 1917 , Con went on leave to Ireland <p> There , according to Colonel John Williams , CO APC London , there were " no food , lighting , or drink restrictions , and a soldier could have a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . ( It was , he added ) a perfect haven for absentees and deserters . " Con stayed mostly at the family farm in Glenanaar in East Limerick . His uncle Patrick , the head of the house , was a Sergeant in the Irish Volunteers and his aunts were active in the women 's paramilitary , known as the Cumann na mBan . Ireland at the time was recovering from the shock of Easter 1916 and the executions and mass deportations that followed it and fighting , as were Australians at home , against Conscription . <p> Con was not the only Digger overstaying his leave . In 1918 , at the request of the British Army in Ireland , Colonel Williams travelled throughout the country conducting a study on the feasibility of setting up APC posts in Ireland . In his report of 18 April 1918 , RE VISIT OF A.P.M. , A.I.F DEPOTS IN U.K. TO IRELAND , Williams concluded that , although , as the British had insisted , there were many Diggers AWL in Ireland who were actively assisted by the local people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the cultural sensitivity to operate in such a volatile situation . Whilst he talked about what the Irish were doing for the Diggers , he at no time assayed what the Australians were doing for them -- the assumption being , I suppose , that they were drifters , deserters , deadbeats and cowards . <p> Not all Irish Diggers returned to Australia . One , Tipperary born , 2417 James Gorman of the 55th Battalion AIF went AWL when discharged from Camberwell Hospital in England on 30th October 1917 . He became Lieutenant in his home town , Hollyford Company of the South Tipperary Brigade of the IRA and was active up until the Truce training Volunteers , assisting in the Knocklong Rescue and taking leading parts in barracks attacks at Hollyford , Cappawhite and Rearcross and in the Thomastown Ambush . Soldier , publican , poet , adventurer , dancer and musician , Jim was described by both Ernie O'Malley and Dan Breen and in numerous Witness Statements collected in BMH Dublin as iconic Digger : sunbrowned , with lined and leathery skin , a laconic sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crack shot . In 1924 , after the Civil War in which he did not participate , Jim emigrated to the USA where his 3 sons served in the Army in WW2 , one paying the ultimate price . <p> Gorman was one 64 Irish born men discharged for DESERTION when the AIF was clearing the books on 1 April 1920 ( is that date meaningful ? ) . 168 others were Discharged when demobilised in England . A large number , like my grandfather , had extended periods AWL in Ireland but returned to Australia . Dublin born 818 Driver John O'Neill was discharged in Australia in December 1919 then returned to Ireland where , as his service record states , he was " killed in an ambush on 6 March 1921 . " Tipperary born 22529 Gunner Michael McGrath 23 Howitzer Bde was a casualty of the Civil War . He was discharged in England and re-emerges as a Lieutenant in the Clonmel Company on the Republican side . He died in custody after capture by Free State Army in May1923 . <p> Just as the reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defining part of the Digger myth , so was it a characteristic of the Irish born Digger but perhaps even moreso suggesting that the red tabbed staff officers may have been just a little too British for them . There are countless incidences of AWL and insubordination . A couple of anecdotes : 3761 Pte Philip Bolger 29 Battalion was court martialled for " Using disloyal words regarding the soverign " 3409 Patrick Joseph Golden 9/31 Bn was Court Martialled for insubordinate language &; threatening violence upon 2nd Lieut Strachan " You are only a Scotch bastard and require fucking , and I will do it ( for you ) . " 34 Private William RYAN of the 8 Bde MGCo at COI 6/11/16 On October 5th 1916 had to explain an injury he received while on leave at the family home in Waterford . " One day I was talking to my father , I believe it was the 8th of October 1916 , about the Sinn Fein movement and was excited . It was just after dinner and we were still sitting at table . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , I brought my hand holding the knife down with a bang on the table and in so doing , struck my other hand which was resting on the table with the knife , cutting it severely . <p> At his Court Martial at AIF Headquarters in Horseferry Road , London 11 November 1919 , Con did not speak in his defence . There were two Statements of Mitigation . One , from his Battalion CO now OIC Repatriation , Major General J.M.A Durrant , stated ... during his service with the unit his conduct was exemplary . He was distinguished for courage and his fearless example ; a splendid leader and one of the bravest men I have seen in action . The other after detailing his record of service added that ... suffering from a grievance which he does not choose to disclose , he went AWL and thus spoiled one of the finest records of any soldier who ever left Australia . <p> Con was held prisoner at Lewes Detention Barracks , reduced to the rank of Private and his sentence was twice reduced -- from 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con 's silence at his Court martial is emblematic of the silence that has enshrouded this issue for almost a century . The Irish in their recounts of the War of Independence were careful not to name anyone who returned to England or any of the Commonwealth countries for fear of the reach of the tentacles of Empire . For those , like my grandfather , who returned to Australia , it meant living a double life and never telling the story of their days in Ireland and this was easily masked under the common reticence to talk about the war . It was a confirmation of another duality : their identities as both Australian and Irish . A duality that would not be celebrated till after their deaths when Australia would finally acknowledge what it had always tried , in wilful ignorance of human nature , to suppress , that human beings can not be forced to forget who they are , that ours is a multicultural society and our cultural richness lies in our diversity and in the diversity of stories that flow from this . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official historian Charles Bean , while trying to explain the extraordinary response to the outbreak of war , states that few Australians ... were fully acquainted with the philosophy underlying the Prussian attitude . But its visible results were well known to them all .... they had read of the unconscionable principles of the military bureaucracy of Prussia , and their instinct for freedom revolted against its pompous hectoring , its cynical intrigue , its tyrannous oppressions in time of peace , its ugly menace in times of war . They therefore exalted the struggle into one which should " save the world for democracy , " establish the sanctity of treaties , and , if possible , inaugurate a reign of justice and rid the world of the whole system of war . Substitute " few " with " Irish " and " Prussia " with British and the attitude underlying the decision of those Australian soldiers of Irish descent who felt it more important to fight for the freedom of their ancestral homeland than to continue with the British Army show how central was their action to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forgotten by history . How many of them there were and from which of the allied countries they came is still unknown . Now that they are dead , their stories can at last be told . <h> About the author <h> Comments <h> 4 Responses to " The Diggers and the IRA , by Kerry Casey " <p> 3761 Private Philip Bolger mentioned above was on leave having been shot while on duty in France in December 1917 . How he came to join the AIF is a worthy tale in it 's own right . He signed up in 1916 and went to France , where he fought with the 29th regiment . He was allowed home to Kilrush , County Clare to recooperate . When he was returning to his regiment , he went drinking in Ennistymon while his train was delayed . A passanger on the train was the Countess Markievich , who provoked Philip and two British Soldiers named Keane , also from Kilrush , to side with the Sinn Fein rebels . The resultant fall out for all three was extraordinary . Philip escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later reduced . The AIF did n't execute any soldier during WW1 . The Keanes fared less well and were extremely lucky not to die as a result of the escapade . Philip returned to his unit and was subsequently awarded a DCM for bravery at Morlancourt in July 1918 . After the war , he returned to Australia and lost contact with his family in Ireland . It 's believed he died a pauper around 1936 . <p> My grandfather , John Levy " Jack " O'Connor , fought with the 3rd Bn AIF on Gallipoli and later the 20th in Belgium and France . After wounding on Gallipoli he was nursed in London by his future wife , Mary Ellen Long of Tuamgraney , Co . Clare . On various periods of leave Jack visited Ireland , as did his twin brother Colin Campbell O'Connor , also in the AIF . <p> While visiting the relatives ' farm in Tuamgraney in 1979 an anecdote was recounted to me . One of the O'Connor boys , while on leave in Ireland , was court martialled for assaulting a British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . There is no record of such an event in the service records of either brother . Can anyone advise me how I might pursue this story further ?

##3764751 <p> Sen O'Sullivan ( 1906-1964 ) was an Irish painter and print maker who composed work featuring amon de Valera , Douglas Hyde , WB Yeats , and James Joyce . He also designed the cover for ' The Capuchin Annual ' . He began exhibiting at the Royal Hibernian Academy ( RHA ) in 1926 , at the age of 20 , contributing an average of six paintings a year until his death . Most of his works were portraits interspersed with landscape painting of the West of Ireland . In 1928 he became the youngest ever associate member of the RHA , and in 1931 was elected an academician . During his distinguished career as portraitist , O'Sullivan drew or painted portraits of many of the leading political and cultural figures in Ireland including Maude Gonne , Brendan Behan , James Larkin , Alice Milligan , Bulmer Hobson , Sir Chester Beatty and Ernie O'Malley .

##3768551 <h> Second stage funding a real problem for Irish start-ups <p> Despite the recent growth in multinational exports , the domestic economy is still flagging badly and the long term health of the country is reliant on our homegrown businesses and the future of today 's fledgling start-ups . Fergal Gallagher spoke to Dr. Ciara Leonard , programme manager at NovaUCD , the business incubation and innovation centre at Ireland 's largest university about her work , the health of Ireland 's start-ups and the difficulties in securing funding in the middle of a recession . <p> With various organisations like enterprise boards and the NDRC Launchpad program where does NovaUCD fit in the business incubation area in Ireland ? <p> Obviously we 're based in the largest university in Ireland and that 's the key difference between us and other programs . Our remit is quite wide , we provide education in entrepreneurship and education to staff and students , help researchers commercialise their research and facilitate partnerships between industries and the University . <p> Lastly , we help incubate start-ups and we currently have 40 companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university research groups , like BiancaMed and others are spin in companies from outside . It 's different in each case but on average the businesses stay with us for 3-4 years . <p> Dr. Ciara Leonard , programme manager NovaUCD <p> What do you look for in businesses to qualify for NovaUCD ? <p> There are three key requirements : <p> Start-up less than 3 years old <p> Knowledge intensive business <p> Need/Desire to collaborate with UCD <p> You have to be doing something knowledge intensive and innovative , that could be anything from biomedical research to developing intellectual property or software . Also you have to be doing something unique . We have all types of innovative companies from medical devices and bio tech to renewable energy and obviously ICT . <p> Lastly you have to either already be collaborating with UCD or have the intention or need to collaborate with the university . The reason for that is that if you are n't working with UCD you do n't need to be here . There are huge benefits for both sides , companies get access to the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn innovative new ideas and techniques some have their technology licensed and students get work placements . <p> What does NovaUCD offer the businesses coming in to the program ? <p> Modern facility includes a coffee shop and courtyard for entrepreneurs to gather <p> We have a purpose built state of the art facility and it 's a nice environment to work in with others facing similar challenges . There are a range enterprise programs including business plans development but one of the most important aspects is that we introduce companies to and assist in pitches to venture capitalists and angels . <p> We provide access to free professional legal , tax , banking and marketing advice up from our partners . We also run a range of training and workshops for the participants . We also provide a lot of PR which can be a help when pitching to VCs if your company has had press coverage . This is vital for high tech firms as often they are pre-revenue for a number of years and because of that they need to raise venture capital . <p> Overall I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention all the programs but most important is that if they need advice in a particular area we can find someone in UCD 's network that with expertise in that area who will be willing to help them . <p> What is the environment like in Ireland in general for start-ups at the moment ? <p> I think the environment is quite good . We 've got a plethora of incubation programs , mainly on the university campuses but also other accelerator programs like the start-up boot camp and NDRC Launchpad . We 're quite lucky to have all these support services that are n't available in lots of other countries . We 're really focused on the high tech sector and the reason is that that 's where the funding is from places like Enterprise Ireland . <p> How difficult is it for companies to get investment from VCs and angels in the current climate ? <p> At the early stage in the seed round we have the most venture capital per capita available of any country in Europe . That 's because we 've a number of new funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds are ; Delta Partners , Kernel Capital , ACT Venture Capital and AIB Seed Capital . <p> We also have a network of angel connections like IRUS , HBAN and also , the regional business incubation centres in Dublin and Cork have their own angel funds . These are where angels come together to form an investment syndicate . That 's quite a new phenomenon and it 's making a difference with early stage funding . If an angel invests in a start-up usually Enterprise Ireland will match that investment up to 250,000 . <p> The real problem is getting second stage funding . There really is n't the same level of VC available at this stage . The companies that have been successful here have raised money from international funds , but the problem there is that you have to prove that there is an international market for your product . You have customer traction abroad to get the money and yet sometimes you need the investment to get customer traction so it can be tricky . <p> What more can we do as a country to encourage entrepreneurship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only at universities but we need to instil an entrepreneurial mindset in schools at primary and second level . This is done through experimental learning and problem solving and getting away from the rote learning model . We 're not necessarily going to have those students founding businesses straight out of school or college but if they have that creative spirit they 're more likely to be innovative within the companies they work for . Obviously we need more investment and VCs but the more entrepreneurs we create in this country the more likely they are to invest in future projects , there 's a ripple effect . <p> I think we 're quite risk averse in this country and we need to encourage students to go into innovative areas rather than traditional professions like medicine and law . I think we need more role models , the more successful businesses we create the more likely children are going to think ' I can do that ' . <p> Is the bankruptcy law in Ireland a deterrent to entrepreneurs ? <p> I think it 's a problem but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spirit do n't go into a business expecting to fail . Where it will make a difference is if that person does fail they ca n't have a second chance . She/he might start a second or third business that is a huge success but

##3852652 <h> Online Dating in Ireland <h> Main menu <h> Post navigation <h> Irish Dating For Men and Women <p> When you speak of the Irish , talk often turns to luck . According to Wikipedia , this can be a tongue and cheek discussion of luck , since the Irish have fallen victim to many woes over the centuries . Another entry cited that when you catch a Leprechaun , you 'll get a piece of gold -- which certainly would be lucky ! <p> So how can you leverage the good luck of the Irish to turn your Irish Dating luck around ? Let 's base the love-life shift on the shamrock 's three heart-shaped leaves : <p> 1 ) Begin thinking of yourself as lucky in love <p> Lucky people usually think of themselves as lucky which further promotes more good luck . They expect to be lucky . So how would your love-life change if you felt lucky in love ? You might feel more attractive to the opposite s*e*x . You might not fear rejection as much . You might imagine suddenly finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? <p> This concept mirrors " The Secret " and the Universal Law of Attraction which states " Like attracts like . " What that really means is that positive thinking attracts more positive thinking . And believing you are lucky in love will attract energy that makes you -- you 've got it -- lucky in love . What have you got to lose ? <p> 2 ) Follow the rainbow to find the Leprechaun 's pot of gold <p> Or the romantic partner you 've been seeking . Hmmm . How does that apply ? Well , rainbows seem like a bit of magic from the Universe and Leprechauns certainly have a magical quality . So can you stretch to believe that meeting the right person for you is part of the magic of the Universe and bound to happen ? People find love every day . Why not you ? <p> Personally , on my Irish Dating journey , sometimes what pulled me through the rougher times was reminding myself that everything has a purpose ( even if we do n't know it . ) So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a partner . And I chose to believe that the reasons behind it all , the good and the bad , were the lessons I needed to learn to FIND HIM . Holding onto that faith tightly , kept me going when I felt down . I got to the point where I knew undeniably that I was going to find the right partner for me . And I did . If I can do it , I know you can too . <p> 3 ) Get your own piece of gold to remind yourself that you are lucky <p> If you did meet a Leprechaun who rewarded you with a piece of gold , you 'd probably never let go of it right ? Well , what if you found your own talisman to remind you of your good fortune ? You could get something like : <p> One of those popular necklaces with a horseshoe ( for more good luck of course ) <p> A small coin stamped with lucky symbols to carry with you ( Celtic stores carry them ) <p> Or find a lucky pebble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter .

##3855151 <h> Managing Your Wealth <h> Managing your wealth in the face of uncertainty <p> By Johnny McNamara , Director MCN Associates <p> Over the past 12 months I have had many people contact me wondering how they should manage their wealth given the uncertain future of the Euro . <p> Most of these people have been desperate to manage your wealth and have been looking at all kinds of solutions . Some talked about moving all of their money to other currencies , others talked about moving their money to foreign bank accounts and one lady even told me how she had buried a large portion of her money such was her fear . <p> Given this backdrop of panic , It is important to step back from the doom and gloom headlines and look at the effects of your decisions and how you can manage your money in this time of great uncertainty . <p> Firstly , it is important to note that I do not believe that the Euro will disband . Even if it were to break up , it would most likely take years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any currency break-up would , in my opinion , require a lead time to allow industries and markets to adjust and avoid the global melt down that would follow a sudden collapse . <h> Managing your Wealth if the Euro was to disband <p> If the Euro was do disband what effect would that have on those of us living in Ireland ? <p> If this were to happen , there would have to be a new unit of currency created in Ireland , presumably we would revert back to Punts . The value of the Euros you hold would then have to convert in to the new units at the specified exchange rate similar to what happened when the Euro was first introduced . <p> Likewise , the value of your debts and assets would also be converted/valued in the new units as would the units that you get paid your wages in . The net result is that your buying power should remain relatively unchanged . <p> You can argue that the cost of importing foreign goods and raw materials will increase given the likely devaluation of the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While this may be true to an extent if there were break up in the Euro , other countries would also revert back to new units of currency . <p> While the value of the new units may depreciate against other stronger currencies this may not be the case against other currencies . So while the Irish Units may be weak against say a new Deutschmark that would not necessarily be the case against other units of currency such as a Lire or Peseta . In fact some would argue that a new Irish currency would remain relatively strong compared to other countries new currencies given the debt levels in some of these countries . <p> " My friend has transferred all of their money to another currency ..... " <h> Managing Your Wealth in a Foreign Currency <p> Let 's look at the idea of moving your money in to a foreign currency and how this may affect you . <p> By transferring money from Euros to another currency at this stage you will immediately be faced with exchange rate fluctuations that may instantly devalue the money that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the devaluation of the Swiss Franc during the summer of 2011 which saw the value drop about 8% overnight to see how the value of your holdings could be impacted . <p> I would see the transferring of your wealth in to other currencies as engaging in currency speculation which is high risk by nature . It is an immediate and real risk that you would be taking on which may prove far more costly in the long run . <p> The simple fact is that , at present , if you live in Ireland in order to buy goods and service you will need to use Euros . Therefore , before you can spend you must have Euros in your possession . <p> Where your money is not held in Euros , you will need to transfer your funds back to this currency . This not only incurs transaction costs but also leaves you open to the volatility in currency markets . <p> So what should I do with my money / savings ? <p> The answer to this is that it will depend on your own needs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you need to make informed decisions and look at the possible risks and outcomes from your decisions . Too often I find that people are influenced by casual conversation with friends , acquaintances and even what they over-hear in bars and restaurants . This is very much like the concept of Chinese whispers where the truth is often exaggerated for effect . The right solution for you can only be explored and found by engaging with a Financial expert such as MCN Associates where a holistic approach can be taken assessing your needs , goals and objectives . <p> Only from this and informed logical decisions be made to suit you . <p> If you would like to discuss your needs why not ring us today on 353 1 230 9000 and we will be 
##3856551 <p> In the wake of much discussion at its recent AGM , Cycling Ireland has decided to introduce an immediate amnesty for those riders looking to move up a category or indeed move down one . <p> The move is aimed at getting more riders in the lower categories to move up to the higher grades and increase the number of A1 and A2 riders in the home peloton . <p> There were a combined total of 360 riders racing in those two categories on home roads in 2012 . Prior to its AGM , Cycling Ireland issued a position paper for debate suggesting it wanted to increase that number by around 200 . <p> It also said it wanted those riders with some experience to progress more quickly out of the A4 ranks . <p> With the aim of stimulating that progression , Cycling Ireland has today announced its re-grading amnesty . It appears to be based on the expectation that the movement will be overwhelmingly up a grade rather than down . <p> It has also been announced that any points accrued by riders in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no 50 per cent reduction in that carry over . <p> Added to that measure , any A1 or A2 riders in their second year in those categories who did not score six points or more in 2012 will remain at those grades for 2013 ; there will be no automatic downward re-grading . <p> This is aimed at maintaining as many existing A1 and A2 riders as possible at those categories , with the other measures seeking to move A4 and A3 riders up through the ranks . <p> Below , we 've included in full the Cycling Ireland statement on the issue , and a useful link under it for those looking to apply for a re-grade online . <p> Before the AGM we published a piece around this whole issue which may make useful reading in light of today 's announcement . You 'll find that story here . <h> Cycling Ireland Grading Statement <p> 2013 Amnesty Details : <p> Upgrading &; Downgrading of Full Competition Racing Categories <p> The Board has taken into account the feelings expressed at the AGM relative to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders through the categories . As an interim measure it is agreed that riders may apply in writing to CI for a one category upgrade . <p> A4 , A3 and A2 2013 licence applicants wishing to avail of the upgrading amnesty must submit their request before 1st April 2013 by completing the relevant form on our website in advance of renewing their 2013 membership . Please note that a rider can only avail of this amnesty once on his first licence application of the year . <p> Once upgraded , the rider remains in that category for the rest of the year unless enough points are amassed from race results for a further category upgrade . It should be noted that juniors may not be graded above A3 . <p> The requirements of Chapter T3 point 2. c , point 3. c , d and e. relative to points gained in 2012 will be suspended for riders moving into 2013 , in other words points obtained by riders in 2012 will be carried over without a 50% reduction . Those riders in their 2nd year as an A1 or A2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words no rider will AUTOMATICALLY downgrade . Notwithstanding any rider who wishes to avail of the rules relating to downgrading may do so by completing the relevant form in advance of renewing their licence . <p> In Summary : <p> Amnesty available to all 2013 Full Competition licence applicants to upgrade one racing category ; <p> A1 &; A2 riders who have not amassed 6 points in their second year in that category are NOT automatically downgraded , they must REQUEST a downgrade <p> Both upgrades and downgrades can only be requested by completing the relevant online form below , this should be done in advance of your 2013 licence application and has a cut-off date of 01st April 2013 ; <p> CI reserve the authority to approve or decline upgrade and downgrade requests . <p> Upon successful approval of your upgrade or downgrade request , CI will progress your membership application to payment stage and notify you of same . <p> If you want to apply for the regrading , you can click on this page here on
