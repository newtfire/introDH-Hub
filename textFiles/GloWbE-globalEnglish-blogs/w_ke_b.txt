Did n't have much time until my folks left for South Africa and Namibia so we had to use the time we had to ensure I had everything I needed . That meant racing around town trying to find every bit and bob suggested by Tucan Travel for the tour . Could n't acquire everything but managed to check off a decent number of items on the very long list . This post , however , is not about my shopping requirements . It is more about my thoughts and feelings ( yes , one of those deep reflective type posts ) regarding the up-and-coming trip . <p> Looking at all my ticket and tour voucher printouts , it is obvious that I am going on this trip yet it is still rather surreal . A bit like a dream you could say . Considering that I have done a fair amount of travelling in the past , it should n't . Perhaps this is due to the fact that this it is my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during our travels and it 's easy to just sit back and enjoy the ride while they organise and plan everything . Now it all rests on my shoulders . Making sure I have the right tickets , documents and mental state for this expedition makes me nervous . Not a bad " I 'm going to be sick " type nervousness . It 's more like jumping on a snowboard for the first time . Looking forward to the rush but nervous you might face-plant a tree trunk in the process . Let 's call them " pre-tour jitters " . <p> The realisation of it all will probably poke me in the eye the moment I actually start packing my bag . Currently , it 's sitting on my spare bed next to the massive assortment of goodies needed for the tour . Once those goodies start migrating into the bag will probably be the affirmation needed for all this to sink in . I suppose I will get to that a week before I depart so I have enough time to identify anything outstanding and get that sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this darn travel insurance . I think I should dedicate a blog post to my trials and tribulations regarding the nightmare which is travel insurance : / -- do n't want to end up like the guy in the main image ! <p> But this post is not meant to be negative ! I feel like a little child on Christmas eve . Will Santa come ? And if so , what will he bring ? That " ants-in-your-pants " type excitement is here to keep me from relaxing . I have met a few of the people on the tour and they seem like a great bunch . The tours and trips offered during our stay in South America are amazing . The experiences to be had are out-of-this-world . I have enough anticipation to fuel a small country ! Meet me in person and you would n't know it . Never been one of those hoppity-skip or " whooo girl " type people ( if you know what I mean ) so you " d be forgiven for thinking that I am a Dexter ( not the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type ( I have used a lot of hyphens in the post huh ) . <p> Just have a few last things to tick off . Basically finished ( just some final tweaks ) the website for Baracuda Diving Kenya which you can check out using the link provided . *ADVERT* Remember to call them up when you are next in Mombasa and want to experience the thrills of diving on our fantastic reef ! *END ADVERT* Otherwise not all that much left . Sad having to turn down possible sources of income yet time is running out and I do not want to be stuck with commitments I can not complete . <p> Alas , my fingers have gotten away from me . I 'm sure that is enough rambling from my side . Will try get at least 2 more posts out before I leave and then I hope there is a decent amount of 
##3638450 <h> Post navigation <h> " What Not To Do In A Kenyan Club " : Part 1 <p> Good , because more and more , I do n't and , at this juncture , I think I 'd like for someone to tell me . There was a time when I was assuredly resolved that I knew and understood this nutty city we call home , but alas -- in the wise words of the Americans -- who'da thunk it ? The lunacy has no end , people . <p> It all started when Sarah insisted that I go out the other night . She said I 'd find " inspiration " out there . <p> So it was that I found myself **26;1560;TOOLONG into Skylux : some new club in Westlands that I had never heard about . Apparently that was the venue for the night as about 4 different unrelated groups of friends and co-workers had independently found themselves there . But it seems only 3 of those groups made it in . <p> The fourth was at the entrance engaged in what seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do NOT call the bouncer " an idiot " . <p> I do n't care if the guy just stole your lunch money and took a piss on your Weetabix . Heck , he could 've sucker punched your baby and French kissed your wife . Let it go . He is bigger than you . His friends are bigger than him . You can accidentally become a casualty -- or worse , a snack . I had a bouncer friend once . I went a few months without seeing him and then when we finally linked up , he hugged me so enthusiastically , he broke most of my torso . And that was only while greeting me . <p> This bouncer , however , was not greeting us . Nor was he my friend . This guy looked like he ate bowls of steamed human heads for breakfast and then open roasted the corpses for lunch . For dinner he came to clubs like this and then waited for an excuse . He was now looking hungry -- and angry -- pointing at one of my cohorts . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would point from a distance . No , he was about 2 inches away from this guy and he was pointing straight into his chest as though he was trying to tickle his heart -- violently . Apparently , my boy could n't enter the club because he was wearing a green t-shirt . Curious , I asked whether the issue was the color or the fact that it was a t-shirt . But at that very same moment my boy called the burly bear of a man " IDIOT ! " <p> Suffice it to say , he did not need his feet to find himself standing outside the club . Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay outside . <p> By this time I had resorted to sneak in . <p> Rule #2 : Co-ordinate your Chips . <p> I got to the top floor and immediately ran into another guy I know from ... somewhere . He tapped me on the shoulder , we exchanged business cards and then some smoking hot pair of legs walked by . Now , I 'm seldom one to judge a woman by her physical attributes but wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and he 's nonchalantly tapping her on the shoulder . She turns . They hug . Clearly they know each other . And judging by the hug , they know each other well . See , there 's a rule about body percentage contact ; the more contact made in a hug , the more likely they are/have been soiling sheets . So while they 're standing there in that locked embrace , ignoring me , another equally interesting case study walks out of the club . I 'm tempted to try and " halla " at this one , seeing as I 'm tired of spectating these two f**k-buddies get their hug on . Right as I do this , Girl#2 peeps over my shoulder and then calls out my boy by name . Angrily . <p> He lets go of the other girl and then begins to st-utt-er ... stutt-ter . Then she points at the other mini-skirt donning girl and starts yelling out profanities . My boy looked over at me and tried to pass the baton . But right then , my buddies from downstairs -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green t-shirt guy . I wanted to help ( not really ) but now I was being dragged into the club . I left him out there to sort out these two women he was cheating on as a third one emerged , even more livid . I have not heard of or from the man since . <p> Now I 'm inside SkyLux and it 's a lovely place . I was trying to enjoy it and walk around but first I had to make a pitstop at the bar . Out of nowhere , this random broad introduces herself to me and , 2 minutes later , begins ... ehm ... it 's not ' dancing ' when it 's done the way she did it . She was trying to grind the pants off my legs or something . Right then , some big dude taps my shoulder and then taps hers . <p> She smiles . I piss myself . <p> Rule #3 : Do NOT introduce me to your husband . <p> I 'm recently single and somewhat indifferent about the whole matter . Suffice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to life than just trying to make a relationship work and sometimes that wake up call is very necessary . Given that I was in this mind frame , I really was not interested in what the little lady had to offer . In fact , I was not here for the ladies , I was here to drink a Red Bull , puff an Embassy Lights and then be on my merry way . <p> But how was I going to explain that to this folklore Giant before he ground my bones and used them for salt on the rhino he was going to have for a midnight snack in a few minutes ? I could n't think of anything , so I looked over to the smiling lass on my lap . I wanted her to just say " I was just dancing " or something to that conclusive effect and then walk away with Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum and his acute sense of smell . Instead what does she do ? <p> She pulls her skirt down -- and by ' skirt ' I mean ' that belt of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Hey baby , remember John ? " The leviathan nods , confused . I do the same . <p> " Well this is John 's cousin 's friend 's co-worker , iCon . He lives in X-Neighborhood and works at x-establishment on Monday to Saturday , 8am to 5pm . He hangs out at these places and ... well , he 's just a good friend and I really wanted to dance with him . " <p> Let me break that down for you . She gives this dude my full CV and FAQ then says " I really wanted to dance with him . " While smiling . And still on my lap . I knew I was dead -- everybody did . I did n't even see my life flash before my eyes ; just the grim reaper walking into the club and then pointing at me with a smile on his faceless skull . <p> Turns out the husband was a little bit of an idiot . OK , a lot . So he got confused by what she had said , grunted twice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shook my hand and then picked up his wife , stuffed her in his pocket and climbed back up the Bean Stalk. * <p> Now not only do I live in fear of him ever descending when he 's hungry and knowing exactly where to find me , I also have to worry about those three scandalously hot broads outside who probably think less of me by association -- and my boy who 's not entirely happy I did n't help him mop up his mess . But my greatest fear is that one day , I 'll walk into that club and the bouncer will think I was the guy that called him an idiot . <p> It is for these reasons that I have penned my Will and Testament . <p> I have also invested in dental coverage . Because at this rate , you never know . <h> 12 thoughts on " " What Not To Do In A Kenyan Club " : Part 1 " <p> That was a one and a half clubbing experience . Never look a bouncer straight in the eye unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone you have known for quite a long time and not just after a few monthly nights in the club . <p> Never take your chips to the same place you took the last one or even let one know where you hang out when you are not with her . On that same note of chips , never go to a club within three months of it 's opening . You are bound to bump into all your chips on that one night and it is hell after that . <p> *DEAD* . You are hilarious ! ! ( As always ) And clearly I was right . See ? Huh ? *whispering- is there a cheque with these mumblings , seeing as I helped* Beanstalk ? Really ? LOL . I stay away from bouncers since I 'm pretty sure they can break me with a dirty look . <p> How come you never see this bouncers ( giants ) during the day . Maybe slaughtering and roasting the unfortunate clubbers that they capture at night . Most tend to be clean shaven ( adding to the tough guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whats with that guys ) and some of them with one blow to the head will send you packing to the next kingdom due to their 
##3638451 <p> The Manager asked me to email him first , which I did . He then asked for my number so he could call me . I gave it to him . Five minutes later , he sent another email asking for an alternate number , because he could n't get me on my Safaricom number . Why ? Because Safaricom has no network in my house . I live a ten minute drive from the CBD -- when there 's no traffic . The only service provider with network inside my house is Yu . <p> The Manager and I had a 6 minute conversation in which I did n't say very much because I was completely shell-shocked . As in I was so mad my hands were shaking . He explained that Safaricom is asking for that information in direct response to CCK , and that we should not assume that they are stealing information from us . Direct quote . <p> I explained that my issue was n't with the information they wanted . My issue was that I needed to know whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm that information because I could n't get through to Customer Care . He then suggested that I should have tried emailing Safaricom , or checking for the information on their website . <p> Yeah , that whole 24-7 Customer Care thing is very useful when I can get the same info from an email or a website , yes ? <p> He further explained that since they have millions of customers , they ca n't possibly call each one of us to get the CCK info , that 's why they sent a text message . Perfectly understandable . And yes , they sent the message in two batches . Mr Manager says that when a text says Safaricom , it means that it comes from Safaricom . <p> Mr Manager suggested -- among other things -- that I should write a post explaining that the 232 is not a scam . <p> Ok . The 232 is not a scam . <p> The Manager also suggested that instead of blogging the problem , I should have sent them an email when I could n't get through to Safaricom Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the next sentence . <p> Say ... I do n't suppose you guys could have sent me an email specifying that this info was for CCK , so that I could , you know , verify the IP and stuff like that ? Coming from safcom.co.ke , it would probably be less suspicious than a mass text . I 'm just saying . Where 's that soap box ? <p> Mr Manager , the whole point of a blog is to express personal opinions . My opinions are mine , and I 'm entitled to them . I would gladly have done a more positive blog if you were doing a more positive job . As long as I 'm not giving a hate speech or breaking any law , I have a NEW constitutional right to blog as I see fit . I voted yes . Also , note that this post was NOT negative , it was simply an open query . <p> No , Mr Manager it is NOT okay to blame me for not getting through to your Customer Care Centre , and suggesting that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have checked the website for information . Even if I DID know about 234 -- which I do n't -- and even if I DO live online , that 's what Customer Care is for . <p> I had serious issues with your tone Mr Manager . I did not like the way you spoke to me . I felt patronised and belittled . I do n't know what prompted you to take that tone , but it was not appreciated . At all . You could have handled it better and your attitude needs a lot of work . You should be ashamed of yourself . Age and even managerial positions are no excuse to bully people , and I do NOT like being bullied . <p> Safaricom is providing substandard service , so much so that I 'm on another network . You call me on your network , you do n't get through , you call me on a competing network , and you STILL talk to me like you 're doing me a favour ? Well excuse me ! <p> Mr Manager , I have three cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each phone has its own dedicated line -- Zain , Yu , and Safaricom . There 's method to the madness , but it does get a bit cumbersome , so thank you for giving me the excuse to get rid of one . I only kept the Safaricom line for Mpesa and to pay my electricity bills . I am now quite happy to go to Stima Plaza or wherever , queue for hours , and pay my bills from there . <p> Safaricom is one of the most successful companies in Kenya , but it sucks raw eggs . I voiced a genuine concern , and instead I get a ticking off . I was worried about being scammed , and instead of assuaging my concerns , you blame me for being cautious . <p> It would have been extremely satisfying to express these sentiments during the phone call , but I was much too appalled to say anything except ' ok ' , and I tuned you out after about two minutes . I would like to use far stronger words now , but two hours later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As and for you Justus , we have bones to pick . One , I did not imply that Safaricom were implicit , even though I did once get a call from a stalker who works for Safaricom and picked my number out of the database . I know who the person is , but I had n't spoken to him since before the age of cell phones , so that was just creepy . <p> When I said inside job , I meant that the scammer called the man 's wife , which means he was an insider to the family . Two , before I blogged , I tried to enquire , through Safaricom Customer Care , which is the logical place to ask about stuff like this . <p> Three , Safaricom announced on radio that Mpesa users did not have to register . It 's not an assumption I pulled out of thin air , so there 's no need to take that tone with me . The text did not say anything about CCK , it simply asked for information that Safaricom already has . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are registered via Zap or Mpesa , and since Yu were nice enough to register my phone personally during a phone call to Customer Care , the land mark thing was news to me . It would not have killed someone at Customer Care to simply explain that . I 'm sure they would have . If they had answered the effing phone . <p> Finally , I am sweet , and I am intelligent . I was simply asking Safaricom whether the 232 text came from them . So I 'm taking your advice . I 'm manning up as you suggested . But just for the record , I 'm a lady . <p> Now , Yu , you rock . Your ads rock . That dude singing to his chickens will forever hold a place in my heart . But ... about those endless text promotions ... stop . Please . And Zain , good clarity , great prices , but you need more ZAP outlets . Seriously . I 'm watching you , so keep sharp . <h> About 3CB <h> 31 thoughts on " Dear Safaricom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safaricom needs to STYLE UP ! When am in a neighboring country my mom can not get through to my Safaricom line ( i also only keep mine for mPesa ) and we use Zain -- apparently she says that her line can not call mine due to " insufficient credit " she needs to have more than 200sh on the fone to call me regardless of whether it will cost her 50sh or less . <p> As for calling you on an early sato morning to BULLY you ? ? ? ! ! ! ! $$$$$ and then after hearing your voice to still tell you to MAN UP ! ! LOLest ! i hope they are reading your post and all the bad bile on FB thats going around and revamping their modus operandi -- whatever happened to The Customer is ALWAYS right ? <p> The Manager for Mpesa division has just called to apologise for his tone yesterday , and to ask if there 's anything he can do to retain me as a customer of Safaricom . <p> I responded that I appreciate the apology ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have broken my sim card and thrown it away . I suggested that he call 5 random Safaricom customers and resolve their problems . That defines true customer care . <p> So , any random problems that need resolving ? He 's watching this spot so feel free to let him know ... <p> Job well done , 3CB . I am not surprised at the rudeness , just disappointed , this is not an isolated incident , and it is part of the Safaricom culture . A chance to clarify their messages , a chance to get feedback that they could use to improve their customer service offerings , and they blow it . Your concerns are concerns that many in the same situation would have . If senior management is reading this , many of your high value customers are getting sick and tired of this behaviour . Fix it . No excuses , no deflecting , no bs , own the problem and fix it . <p> Yaaay ! Kudos to you for fighting back . It 's about time someone put Big Suffericon in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the point of thinking they have a right to be condescending towards their customers . <p> If you so wish to report Mr. Manager to higher authority , I will be gracious to facilitate this . Let 's just say I have access to the powers that be at Big Safcon . <p> Thanks for the offer , but he already apologised . Plus , he 's fixing my neighbour 's network , so it 's all good . You could still use your contacts to whine about other things and improve service for the customers that are left though ... <p> Diasporadical and many other KBW blogs are like my favourite haunts . But am greatly distressed by the current trend of bashing the guy on top that 's currently floating around . It 's a free country so I guess everyone has a right to express their opinions therefore you have every right to whinecelebrate anything as long as its not deemed ' HATE SPEECH ' I had issues with my Safcom line , moved to ZAIN .. got the same issues and now am back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a free world . I had some problems with NIC bank ... moed to Equity , found it worse and am now back at NIC though with another bank also ! Point am driving is that people will always hate the guy at the top . Man United , Real Madrid , CocaCola , Microsoft . I guess with great success and power comes great expectations and responsibilities . So I guess when people start really hating on me , probably it will be coz am the guy at the top ! <p> PS : I do not condone big successful people and companies infringing on the rights of others but remember ... it 's a capitalist world ... <p> You 're probably right , but I doubt I 'd go back . Pride . And my big head . Besides , I have two other lines , and I just paid my electricity bill through Zap , so my Safcom line was/is redundant , even if I had n't already broken the sim card and thrown it away . <p> Still , if the whining and ranting has improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've promised to fix network issues in my building , then I 'm happy <p> I love this blog .. if you think being a safcon customer sucks try doing business with them . it sucks majorly ! ! ! ! ! im glad they read this blog , because i for one with show up when they are shut down and carted off in small little pieces after YU , ZAIN and Orange take over ... their services suck , their employess suck ( MARINGO ya SAFCOM is legendary ) and im disappointed because Michael Joseph did a damn good job of building that company from scratch . His legacy is shit now , because of a bunch of feel good pissy faces managers who have an " i work for safaricom so i am god attitude " ... okay enough venting for the day <p> Went through a similar experience , though I did n't persist long enough to get an apology if there ever was going to be one . I just kept counting to 10 ... I understand that customer care staff may be overwhelmed , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember which side their bread is buttered . I complained officially and whether any action was taken or not , it 's hard to 
##3638452 <h> Post navigation <h> The Revolution Kenya Will Never Know <p> First I 'm going to tell you why I do not care -and frankly , have never cared -- about our new constitution . Then I 'm going to tell you why I 'm not a patriot . But let me start by telling you why you 're all cowards . <p> It 's 2010 : 80 years after Harry Thuku formed the EAA , 60 years after Kenyatta was imprisoned as the leader of the Mau Mau ; half a century since over 150,000 innocent Kenyans were dehumanized during the Mau Mau Uprising , with over 1 million others being displaced and held in concentration camps . It 's also been 40 some years since we brought down the Union Jack and raised our own flag and yet here we stand acting like a bunch of senseless slaves . <p> Here we sit , comfortable in our couches and our lives , content with talking about how f*cked up everything is ; and even more content to not do anything about it . <p> Proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of corruption &; police brutality , being parcel to pathetic road systems &; overcrowded prisons , illiteracy , backward cultures , racism and tribalism ... More dramatically , proud to be Kenyan not despite those things but because of them . <p> Here we stand , a nation of the poor , disenfranchised and discriminated against , holding our heads high as though the fight has long been over . They say if you ca n't beat them , join them . Kenyans stopped trying to beat them with the previous generation . Our generation ; the first truly free generation ; consists of sheeple who follow Western trends blindly and have mastered the art of finding the easy way out . Be it in crying foul and sitting on benches outside the Hilton Hotel waiting for jobs to descend from the sky , or in becoming professional beggars with hair braid schemes that never come to fruition ; we are afraid of the struggle , the sweat and the blood we 'd have to shed . We are the generation of complacent professional beggars . We 're afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control which walls to push in and when . <p> Now , just to be clear , when I say " we " or " Kenyans " , I do n't mean all of us . I just mean the critical mass . Because at the end of the day , the critical mass is all that matters . Because even if 100 people decide to move left , there 's 40 million more who can move right . And this does n't mean all 40 million need to be behind a cause : in fact , you do n't even need 20 million . All you need is a dedicated million or two to put their feet down , raise their fists up and say " Change something or we will . " That 's all you need for a revolution : a dedicated number of people to get angry at everything that 's wrong . And not get angry and start fighting each other , but get angry and do something about it . <p> Instead we sit at home throwing verbal darts at the 9pm news and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celebrating . As if we won something . <p> The constitution -- bless the souls that worked for it -- might as well be bad toilet paper if this is the population we 're going to rely on to enforce it . A people that expects the government to ensure we got our due . This government ? I 'm sorry , am I meant to believe that the last constitution had enough provisions for them to thrive and get rich , but not us ? And if so , how exactly is this one going to be different ? Kibaki , Raila or otherwise , THEY DO N'T GIVE A SH*T ABOUT YOU , ME OR ANYTHING WE REPRESENT . Nobody will spoon feed you anything . You have to fight for your own rights . Stand up and demand them . We keep this nation moving , together , we can make it stop and listen . Constitution or not , we should all be resolved to make a change . <p> But alas , that wo n't happen . <p> Many times , I bite my tongue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's be real , as a unit of people , we DO NOT have our act together . We do n't speak with one voice because we 're constantly bickering and arguing with each other . And we do this for so long , that the most corrupt among us slither their way up the ladder . Once they do , you know what we do ? We still our hands out and start begging . <p> A wise friend told me that people get the leaders they deserve . Next time you look at our leaders and shake your head , do n't feel disappointed in them , feel responsible and ashamed in yourself and your people . For all the complaining we constantly do , is n't it amusing that the government for the past few decades consists of essentially the same people playing musical chairs every election . <p> If the leadership is the problem , why do n't we just get rid of them ? All of them ? Why are n't there more politically active youths really kicking up dust and preaching revolution ? Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , maybe this time , after 3 decades of being at the helm of this sinking ship , this time he 'll actually do something . I mean , does n't it kinda piss you off that ' Hope ' , according to the youth , looks like this ? <p> Clowns , jesters , goons , and pariahs disguised as businessmen or lawyers . And that 's just the best of them . The rest of them -- the majority at that -- are oversized parasitical leeches and sloths in business suits sucking the sap out of this country and its people . When times get hard , they tighten your belt and go on vacation . When times are good , they tighten your belt even more and take their friends on vacation too . <p> Greed rules this country in ways some people will never understand . And not because they 're stupid either . It 's simply beyond their realm of comprehension . You ca n't possibly explain to a hard working cleaner in a building who rakes in 5,000/= a month that Sonko did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The gap between the rich and the poor is not thousands vs. hundreds of thousands or hundreds vs millions . In Kenya , it 's a battle of pennies vs. billions and if you do n't have enough to play the game , you shut up and stay on the sidelines . <p> And those sidelines are crowded with professional beggars , proud of their condition , scared of what they deserve , hoping for change to come . <p> I refuse to be one of them . I refuse to be comfortable . I refuse to be content and -- because a change is needed -- I refuse to be proud of this country . Because this is not the Kenya We Deserve . It 's not the Kenya We Want . It 's not even the Kenya we work for . This is the Kenya that 's been shoved into our lap like prison gruel by the fat fingers of greedy wardens , as they say " Eat it or starve . " <p> I 'd rather starve than partake in this . I 'd rather they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my country ; forcefully if need be . Why ? <p> Because I 'm more Malcolm X than Martin Luther , more Huey P. than Mother Theresa . I do n't believe we can take this lying down and they 'll eventually realize the wrong in their ways . Kenyans that they are , they KNOW what they 're doing is wrong , and are proud of it . So although I may not do it on this blog all the time because ... well , it 's tiring and depressing and ultimately pointless , I do so in my personal life . As we all should . It 's not about getting in the comments and being up and rowdy saying " We are n't content , we are n't complacent " . OK , fine , then what are YOU doing about it ? At the end of the day , it 's about getting out there and not masking your anger . It 's about sparking the revolution we 'll never see if you content yourself with ... this . <p> Like Malcolm and Huey , I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I raise my voice . <p> It 's sad to see people resigned to being disadvantaged . <p> Apologies for the occasionally colorful language . This was written in one sitting . One very angry sitting . <h> 26 thoughts on " The Revolution Kenya Will Never Know " <p> Tell you what , I 've always wondered what them Thai redshirts-and yellow ones I think-have that makes them so passionate about their country that we do nt have . These guys , a million of them , take to the streets for a month till shit gets done . We are just too keen on self preservation as a people and as individuals to do shit . But this is our land , we 'll or rather I , will sink with this ship . Why I do n't know . Call it blind patriotism . <p> WOW . Thats a lot of angry .

Insightful Post ! <p> as much as i feel your pain and anger at the way things are ( esp the face of the ' future ' eek ! ) , i 've been priveledged to see that under that cloud of greedy shortsighted loudmouths we so galantly call our leaders are a movement of workers transforming small parts of our country bit by bit , or in a very practical sense tree by tree . i have seen areas that were previously considered arid and unproductive , turned into little havens of running water , treed paths and so much fruit ! and there are many of those .. i cant wait to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place by these goons in their few moments of sobriety , take effect . i am a proud kenyan , simply for the hope of better things and the sweat of the few who actually work for the better of the country . <p> Blind optimism is what we 're plagued with . A new constitutional dispensation was never meant to solve our problems but it does have the potential of laying the foundation for a better Kenya . Now is the time to push for the reforms that we would allow us to realise our Vision 2030 . <p> I think what 's fundamentally wrong with Kenyans is that we 've suffered the worst form of betrayal : betrayal by our so-called liberators . In succession since we were " liberated " from colonialism , each liberation has been a lesson in disillusionment . Uhuru brought us the plunder of Nyayo era , the second liberation from Nyayo brought us post-election violence , Anglo-leasing and more disillusionment . We 've now been liberated by a new constitution and , as aptly illustrated in this post , hope that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the same youths were the foot soldiers in the PEV .... Until we liberate ourselves and stop putting so much stock on external interveners , be they Messianic figures who promise to turn Mombasa into a Dubai in 5 years , or a piece of document promulgated on a day when balloons refuse to fly , we shall never be free . <p> I read this post as soon as you wrote it , but I was n't sure how to respond . I think I suffer from what AnonyMiss called blind optimism . I cross the road whenever I see a cop and curse them daily for randomly arresting my siblings , but I still feel proud and I would n't want to live anywhere else . Ever . <p> Early this morning , I tried to figure out why that is exactly . I read a quote on FB that said ' Patriotism is believing your country is better than any other , simply because you were born there . ' The only other country I 've lived in is Tanzania , and every day , I ached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel transformed the second I saw the traffic lights on Mombasa Road . <p> There 's a lot that I 'd like to change , but somehow , it does n't make me angry or even vaguely revolutionary . I like the new constitution because it theoretically changed two things that were important to me -- abortion , and dual citizenship . Of course , with 47 counties , it also made GHC what is it called now , Social Studies ? immensely harder for my baby , but we ca n't win them all . <p> My revolution is the silent kind . I choose to stay positive , smile at the world , thrive , survive , and make my change in my own small way . For me , that 's more than enough . <p> The first part was knee-jerk defense position ( If things are so bad ... what have YOU done about it ? ) which lasted all of 30 seconds . <p> And then I got it . <p> We have a tenant mentality . <p> If you own your crib , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode is to keep it looking its best . You 'll do the housekeeping and flay the hide of anyone who has the temerity to dump garbage in your backyard . Tenants on the other hand have some authority who 's expected to come in and rectify/solve/save/ the day on every issue from leaky faucets to neighborhood insecurity . After all ... you do n't own the house do you ? <p> The revolution sought is not the big bang method . Change happens in small bits .. almost imperceptibly . Much like the tide coming in . And all boats get lifted by the tide ... be they huge cargo container ships , or dhows . So we start small . Get people to care for their hoods . Then they care for their towns . Then for their country . <p> Sounds like a post I would have done in 2002 , the naive 19 year old who spent 2 unpaid nights at the local ECK Office , participating in the vote counting and tallying , because in my heart I believed this was a new beginning and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> Well , 8 years later , I would n't say I 've given up on this country ( I no longer vote ) , but I 'm very realistic on my expectations as a Kenyan . We are a certain kind of people , love comfort zones and as such , no day will we sacrifice to see this country be at a better place politically , unless it 's involuntary ( in the case of a coup or civil war ) . What does that mean for me as an individual ? I 'm no longer invested in our politics . They make good comedy . I 'm more concerned in what Kellie is doing to make the world ( not just Kenya ) a better place , whether it 's by choosing not to litter , or helping one more child get education , I sleep easy at night , and ignore everyone who accuses me of being the reason we have bad leadership . <p> If not a revolution , Kenya definitely wil need a biblical plague ! We need a new beginning . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay , economic greed and political instability that our country is engulfed in has reached irreversible proportions . We 're way beyond needing a revolution ! <p> Angry indeed ! ! And let us all say Amen .... ok now go out and do something about it . What you ask ? Well that depends on your talents , passion , skills , and ability . Volunteer . Have u ever considered teaching someone how to read , write ? Ever said wsup to a parki and gotten to know them assuming they are not holding a knife to your throat . Have you ever considered teaching someone how to put together a resume , be an excellent interviewee ? How about how to use a computer , ms office ? Ever wondered what all these ngo 's do in AFRICA . Ever thought about giving a few hours of your week or month or year to making a difference in someone 's life . Am tired of watching foreigners come here , get inspired/moved by all our hopelessness and change lives with simple ideas , why can we see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its our damn country . Truth is , the most sustainable change will come from us . To EACH ONE TEACH ONE ! ! So get a bunch of friends you drink with , hang out with and brainstorm things to do , for your people . SPARE A BEER a day and save a child ! ! ! ! ! ! 180 can buy food even for a parki . You can adopt one by feeding them , mentor them , treat them like they are human . Cos beneath it all , we are all human and do nt mind people who care about us . Go to a school as ask what you can do to help . If your into medicine teach someone how to deliver a baby in your shags . Do you know more than 6,000 women die giving birth in kenya . Ya its 2010 alright . Find those women groups and teach them some business skills etc etc . ABOVE ALL , tell people around you to quit whining and DO SOMETHING ! ! ! ! ! ! PS : Apologies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just have one issue-we 're too dependent on emotion . Think about it- how many of us have been to the same children 's home more than once ? The spinal injury hospital ? KNH children 's cancer ward ? <p> Anyone heard of Afya Kenya Foundation ? It 's an organisation that provides health care for those who ca n't afford it . They raise the funds as well as doing the actual work : Check ups , treatment , dispensing drugs , blood drives , community clean ups ... the full deal . Who runs it ? A couple of guys barely out of campus ( Actually I think some of them are still there ... ) . Look them up . They do it and do it ... and do it again . <p> My point : If you 're going to do something , do it ... And keep doing it . If all we 're going to do is wait til we 're emotionally charged/touched then hey ... All we 'll ever remain with is a whole bunch of blog posts and good intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like you and see what you can do about whatever you like . @miss simple : emotions are good when they drive us to action .. and that is the missing link . I gave up on waiting on govt or anyone . I will beg for money on the street in the bar if its going back to the community and making services available for the same people that give of their time and money . I just feel like a lot of peeps are waiting on some external salvation and do nt realize that it lies within themselves to change things . <p> Emotion is a good as a starter but for most people it can not be the fuel that drives us . I 'm talking about emotion and not passion . Emotion is that ' wow , I feel good today lemme give a coin to the lady at the corner ' feeling . It never lasts beyond the day . <p> What I need is passion . That 's what keeps me going even when I do n't feel like being a good citizen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cares ... or even when despite all my efforts my work still seems to amount to nothing . <p> Passion is what drives you . Get disillusioned for a day ... but do n't give up ! <p> Mh . The everyday Kenyan doing what he/she does best -- counting the ills and totally ignoring the many strides made this far . But the most depressing remark in this whole post must be : " The constitution -- bless the souls that worked for it -- might as well be bad toilet paper " . <p> Any Kenyan who did n't appreciate that the fact that for once , we were discussing issues and not personalities during the constitution-making process is one Kenyan who needs more than a pair of glasses to see that Kenya is coming of age , though at a slower pace . <p> And yes , this remark continues to sound more pathetic by the day and as the " bad toilet paper " continues to steered us to demand better from our leaders &; judge our leaders not by where they come from or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the content of their character . Change may not be happening pap , but buddy , it is happening . <p> Mh . The everyday Kenyan doing what he/she does best -- counting the ills and totally ignoring the many strides made this far .

##3640050 <h> The launch of Somali Week Festival 2012 <p> By : Ayan Mahamoud E-mail : ayanmahamoud@khayd.org The launch of Somali Week Festival 2012 Friday , 19th October 2012 , 6.00pm Oxford House Derbyshire Street , E2 6HG London , E2 6HG For more information and ticket please email info@kayd.org Kayd Somali Arts and Culture and partners would like to invite you to Somali Week Festival 2012 which will take place from Friday 19th to 28th October , Oxford House , The programme and tickets for all the events are now available . To access the programme click here : http : **35;4234;TOOLONG ... Somali Week Festival 2012 will focus on the theme of ' COURAGE ' . Our understanding of ' courage ' is not one of gun-toting aggression , but a belief in peace and tolerance as essential principles ; about dreaming the seemingly impossible , challenging the status quo in the name of collaboration and fruitful coexistence . In that sense it emphasises empathy , tolerance and personal integrity in a context of uncertainty . The acceptance that this kind of courage must necessarily exist without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the end ' is paramount . Tolerance and empathy in the certain knowledge of a positive outcome do not require courage . We are delighted that the theme of this year 's festival , ' courage ' , will be introduced by a great playwright , educationalist and poet , Said Saleh and the festival will be launched by Hon Rushanara Ali , MP for Tower Hamlets . Somali Week Festival is an integral part of Black History Month and offers the best of Somali arts and culture , both old and new . The festival offers a mix of events including poetry , literature , panel discussions , documentary film screenings , music and theatre . Through these different artistic forms , Somali Week Festival has explored a variety of themes in past years and has become a widely recognized and anticipated annual event in the UK . We are inviting artists , writers , campaigners , investors and people from civil society , both Somali and non-Somali , from Somaliland and Somalia , North America as well as from the UK and other European countries , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , identity , peace and development . We are honoured to welcome international guests , including Mahamed Ibrahim Warsame " Hadraawi " , Said Saleh Ahmed , Hussein Sheikh Ahmed ' Kaddare ' , Hassan Qawdhan , Musse Ali Faruur , Abdidhuh Yusuf , Giorgio Banti , Prof Abdallah Mansuur , Mohamed Daahir Afrah , Evan Christopher , Iara Lee , Ali Hasan ' Banfas ' , Abdilahi Awad awadgale , , Ismail Abdi Ibrahim ' Basbaas ' , Roland Marchal and more . At the launch , some of our visiting artists from Somalia and Somaliland such as Muse Ali Faruur , Hassan Qawdhan , Abdidhuuh Yusuf together with UK based poets , Abdillahi Bootaan will recite some of their poetry and the English translations will be provided by James Byrne , poet and editor of Wolf Poetry Magazine , Clare Pollard , poet from Poetry Translation Centre and Rob Inglis . The evening will conclude with a talk with Award winning poet and thinker 
##3641350 <h> Post navigation <h> Victor 's Faith Story <p> I am a rather reserved person , so putting my picture and story out there for others to read is not my cup of tea ; but I felt compelled to share the things that God has done for me . <p> I am an entreprenuer running an I.T firm and recently , business has been quite challenging . There are a number of jobs that are doing that have very stringent contracts . <p> Recently we 've had loads of challenges with some of the contracts that we got into . Some of the clauses in the contracts had very stiff penalties if stipulated high quality standards are not met . <p> Yet at a time when we had a lot of work to get done , we would undergo untimely and unprecedented black-outs that would cause great disruption to our work -- and this was one among many things just not working out . <p> It became so bad that at one point we had only one goal -- Stay afloat ! It was no longer about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not incur huge penalties . This was a trying time ! <p> Earlier in the year , before things had gotten difficult , I heard about the relocation , and knowing what Mavuno meant to me , I knew I had to give . Based on earlier projections , I made a pledge of 50,000/= . But it was n't long after making this pledge that the business challenges set in . <p> It was then that I realized that the situation had become very dire , and that fulfilling this pledge would be a very daunting task . Still , I had made the pledge , and was completely committed to fulfilling it . <p> Just last week , an amazing thing happened that convinced me that God was with me even through this period . There is an organization that owed me money from a while back , but since this was a very long time ago I had written it off and totally forgotten about it . <p> Then out of the complete blue , something amazing happened -- someone from the organisation calls me up . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was owed , and was wondering if I they could pay me back . " Can you pay me back ? Of course ! ! " I honestly could n't believe it ! <p> As soon as I got my cheque , I did n't even think twice . I knew that even though the business has not picked up yet , this provision came directly from God in response to my faith . I did n't think twice . <p> The biggest lesson I have learnt out of this is that God does some of His best works during our times of frailty ; it was only when I was feeling down and out that I could really appreciate that phone call when it came . And however tough things seem , God is always with us . <p> My honest encouragement to anyone considering giving a gift in faith to do so cheerfully , because God is not asking us to do something FOR Him , He 's asking us to do it WITH Him . Its a privilege to be part of this vision ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen Amen and to God be all the glory ! ! Its been a faith lesson for me over the past few weeks and truly l can say God is faithful to those who put their faith in Him . Active Faith needs impossibilities <p> It 's refreshing reading your story victor . I was in the same frame of mind when I attended the last vision night . Listening to this amazing stories while in the middle of poor 1st &; 2nd quarters of 2012 in business . Your story &; pastor M 's has given me greater resolve to pledge in 
##3641351 <h> Post navigation <h> My Faith Story -- Kanjii Mbugua <p> When Pastor Muriithi gave the challenge in January 2012 about giving towards the relocation , my wife and I had no doubt that we were going to participate . The last time that Mavuno relocated , we gave , and what it did for our faith could not be quantified , so we knew we were in . The challenge was for one month 's salary , broken down over a four month window . But Pastor M proceeded to say something that really challenged me -- he said he felt compelled to give his in one month and watch as God sorted him out . <p> That was such a huge challenge , and driving home , my wife and I left feeling we could do it in one month . However at some point , " sense " seemed to get the better of us -- after all , it was January , a month when school fees had to be paid , not to mention a horde of other financial commitments . Four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted to the initial four month breakdown . <p> To be honest , I really do n't know what happened next , because God just seemed to convict us to do it in one month , and my wife and I found ourselves writing cheques . This was going to be a massive sacrifice , especially since for many businesses , and especially for us in the entertainment industry , January is a notoriously slow business period . Giving required serious financial re-organisation and spending adjustments -- but we were committed , and went ahead to do it . <p> It was then that God checked in , and vindicated our faith in ways we never would have imagined . We had been hoping and praying for growth in our business , but could never have forseen the miraculous thing God was about to bring our way . Amazing doors of opportunity started to fly open , and within the first quarter of 2012 , God blessed us so amazingly that , get this ... our sales quadrupled ! ! In other words , and we believe strongly there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our sales volumes in the first quarter of 2012 surpassed our entire gross in the whole of 2011 ! All glory to God ! <p> We were stunned ! How can one explain a four-fold increase in business other than a faithful God responding to the faith of His children ? <p> The lessons my family and I have have learnt in this season could never have been taught other than in the school of faith . We realized that God means it when He says His ways are higher than our ways ( Isaiah 55:8 ) . There we were trying to make our own plans and conserve our resources to take care of us , when all along God had much bigger plans . The huge take out for me and my family is that when God gives you the opportunity to do something big for God 's kingdom , do it ! And do it without expectations that God owes you and will do something in return . Do it because it is the right thing to do , and watch as God builds your faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not a joke . And He has given us the opportunity to partner with Him . I 'm glad we have taken the opportunity , because as we did we have seen our confidence in Him built up and our faith grown in amazing ways . All glory to God ! <h> 10 thoughts on " My Faith Story -- Kanjii Mbugua " <p> Just read through this blog and I find that it has a strong leaning towards this theory : give and you will receive -- and I just find it not only dishonest but repulsive that as a Church , you can use this mantra to fund raise . I am not in any way discounting the miracles experienced but I find that it is wrong that all the stories in this blog revolve around the theme ' I/we gave to God and He gave us back much more ' . When you give , you are not participating in an investment club . God is not santa claus in the sky , a seasoned fund manager , a multiplier of money , blessings and gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His own means , through His covenants or just at His own pleasure . He does n't need any form of prompting to bless someone . The story of Cain teaches us that there are no guarantees in offering a sacrifice to God , none at all . You may not be offering any guarantee , but you may be planting seeds of hope in some . That hope may be false hope . In that way , you may just be facilitating a Cain experience for your congregants . <p> Your comment pains me because you seem to have a somewhat limited understanding of what is being talked about here ( I may be wrong ) .. Did you read the part where Kanji said " The huge take out for me and my family is that when God gives you the opportunity to do something big for God 's kingdom , do it ! And do it without expectations that God owes you and will do something in return . Do it because it is the right thing to do , and watch as God builds your faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do , not because we are expecting back . But on the contrary our God says " Give and it will come back to you , good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over .... " Remember that Sunday School awesome song ? ? ? God says it .... Is He man that He should lie ? ? ? ? <p> I was like you at some point . But Let me just tell you in short , there is a reason why it is called faith Giving . When gave in my pledge , I received a call for a consultancy I had not applied for and as we speak , a contract for 1.6Million ! What is that ? <p> You do n't have to believe , but God does promise that when you give , you receive a good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over . It is not only a biblical principal but also a Universal law . I know beyond any doubt now , that it actually works . <p> Your comment pains me because you seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about here ( I may be wrong ) .. Did you read the part where Kanji said " The huge take out for me and my family is that when God gives you the opportunity to do something big for God 's kingdom , do it !

But on the contrary our God says " Give and it will come back to you , good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over .... " Remember that Sunday School awesome song ? ? ? God says it .... Is He man that He should lie ? ? ? ? <p> Dear Nairobian , its ok to feel and think that way , the reason God Blesses those who give , and give cheerfully is because its not easy to give , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all have things to do with our money , even the billionaires still have commitments with their money . <p> I will honour my pledge not based on people 's testimonies but based on the fact that I will have nowhere to worship come next year , Mavuno has been a blessing to my life . Before i would go for years without attending church , but today i do n't wonna miss any sermon , i leave the service blessed and informed . I used to go all the way to resurrection garden , to pray and have a quiet time with God , 
##3641352 <h> Post navigation <h> Prayers That Availed Much <p> Three weeks ago , long after attending two vision nights and many having countless conversations with God , I felt a strong conviction to honor my first pledge . <p> This was hard for me to do because as an intern , I only get an allowance that provides for a few of my needs . I also get financial support from my family . I pretty much do n't have a source of income . <p> God convicted me to give ALL my allowance in the month of June to honor part of the pledge I had made in faith , as a leader serving in Mavuno . This was a very hard time to give as my graduation was just around the corner and my family was n't in a position to cater to all the expenses that went with it . Basically , I needed the money ! <p> As tempting as it was to choose not to listen to God , I could n't get myself to use this cash and so I gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review my pledge upwards in faith , overflowing with the passion of fulfilling God 's work . <p> I remember praying to God and telling him that it is my heart 's desire for my faith to grow ; a desperate need for God to show up in faithfulness after I had stepped out in faith . I also prayed that he would transform me to see Him as the ultimate Provider . I knew He would still be glorified even if I did n't have a faith testimony in the end . My heart 's desire <p> About a week later , during one of the June Sunday service , Kanjii prayed and proclaimed that Sunday was business unusual . I claimed this word and responded in faith through praise but did not expect what God was about to do . <p> He asked us to share with our neighbor what we are trusting God for and I shared about my family and my finances . I was trusting that God would provide for my family and I. Ten minutes later , deeply consumed in worship , my good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that He has heard your prayers and He has asked me to do something that I have to do now , " and reaches into his wallet gets money out and hands it to me . <p> At this point I 'm in awe ! Yet it it 's crystal clear to me that only He can lead a stranger to give me what I found out later to be double of what I had given ! It could only be Him who . <p> ALL GLORY AND PRAISE TO HIM ! <p> I am challenged to give even more . I believe that it is not about the amount or that this is a weird , unexplainable reward scheme . I understand that it 's about who I serve , who I am givin to . God is more than able and willing to provide in times of need . <p> But how often do we ask Him and ask for the right reasons ? How many times do we truly see Him as the ultimate Provider ? <p> I challenge you today , student , low income earner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations from you . Give to God whatever you have in your hand and give with the right intention , with the heart to call Him King and He will respond ; for He is faithful ! <p> The prayers of the righteous truly availeth much ! I look forward to seeing the greater and mightier things He has in store for us 
##3643950 <h> Post Lewa Run at Wahome 's <p> Gray , gloomy , bitter cold July was here and thankfully edging to a close ..... Having resolved to a monthly dose of the Swaras , it was that time again ... <p> The whiff of a party/run and the promise of a scenic trail were enough to convince me to disown my TembeaKenya comrades on their latest Elephant Hill ( Yes , there is actually a place called that in Kenya , Aberdares ) expedition . Clearly , many a Swara bit the bait , as was evidenced by the sheer number of members present , all cajoled by this cocktail of run , fun and sun . Swaras truly take the work hard , play hard philosophy very seriously ... <p> As set by precedent , I was expecting the run to be a recipe of nature , adventure and torture all present in equal measure , and this run did not disappoint . <p> Enter , Saturday 21 July 2012 , I had convinced a recruit ( my cousin ) to come experience firsthand what this Swara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Enroute to Wahome 's , numerous calls to unknown persons were made informing all and sundry that Mteja hatapatikana as she was would be running with the City Gazelles .... Yes you read right ... flashback to my youth days .... I would say this is a classic case of the broken telephone game that ends up corrupting the message which in this case led to the baptism of Swaras to a supposedly more hip name ... City Gazelles . <p> We arrived unfashionably late and pretty much missed all the route instructions ... but we did catch wind of the route having S , M and L markings denoting the short , medium and long routes , so S is all we had to look out for . <p> Please note that my cousin 's participation had been negotiated on the premise of a walk run concoction of a supposedly 10 kilometer trail which at the briefing had miraculously grown miles to 13 kilometers . <p> The first half of the run was very enjoyable , the scenery evolving as we steered on through the Karen plains and brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that saw us proceed to the Oloolua Nature Trail for the main dish . <p> As we approached the Mbagathi Ridge on our way down to the Oloolua Trail we met Swaras ( whom I consider elite having accumulated numerous Swara running miles ) masked with face and limb expressions that either likened that of lions satiated after the kill or exertion and relief of Swaras having managed to escape being the days meal .... <p> My recruit , seemed to settle with the later and suggested we take the short cut and skip the trail ... now being a TembeaKenya enthusiast I would hear none of this . Having seen numerous instagrams of Oloolua and marked it in my travel bucket list , this was as good as any opportunity to tick it off my list ..... <p> So there we went opting to walk down the steep descent to the main dish that was Oloolua ... The place was truly an outward bound expedition , the chirping of the birds , the topography of the land and clean air reminiscent of the of the country side , something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( On a side note , did anyone see a waterfall or have the Tembeakenya pictures being photo shopped ? ) <p> Soon the ups , downs and curves of the Oloolua trail took its toll ... this loop of nature was non ending and at the back of our minds the climb back up to the Mbagathi ridge kept haunting us ! ! <p> At one point , we met up with a first timer Swara whose reserve tank was quickly draining off also looking for the nearest way out ... strategy came into play and we decided to ask the guards for the shortest route out of this feast . But they were clearly enjoying the sight of our struggles and adamantly insisted that we should do the entire loop and see what the place had to offer . <p> Grudgingly we dragged our feet through the course and eventually saw the exit . Our climb out back to the Mbagathi Ridge was a heated commission of enquiry on where on earth the supposedly short route was ? As is the case of many commissions of enquiry in Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did any Swara see these elusive S/M/L markings ? If any were spotted we do need to either consult our opticians or lodge a refund claim from our nursery school teachers as we clearly do n't know how these letters are drawn/look .... Another point of order that was entrusted to the commission of enquiry is the mathematical accuracy of the Swaras route mapping equipment ... We had surely covered 13 kilometers , a distance that was verified by our newly found friend 's GPS tracking device . Having to explain this multiplying kilometers parable to these aspiring Swaras was a fete best left to Mr. Chairman ... I pled the fifth only hinting that this parable is a result of either a mission to exceed expectations or the sadistic nature of our trail markers . <p> There was no convincing this batch to attempt another step , I was informed and I quote " I agreed to come do 10 kilometers which turned into 13 , now you want me to do 16 ! ! You must be joking , you go right ahead to the finish line , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough said , we patched on the nearest slab and waited for next matatu to take us to the grazing plains that was Wahome 's place . <p> And did we wait ! ! Clearly the folk of Karen have no need for these mechanical creatures . Our wait in the blazing sun ( yes the sun had to smile on us ) was long , not even the threatening sun could force this recruits to move another step . As the minutes chimed away ideas of hitch hiking evolved , the argument being it 's the better option given we were three versus the one ... the 3:1 ratio and the fact that we looked like an oxymoron being fully dressed in exercise gear yet asking for reprieve in the form of a lift clearly worked against us . A tour van offered to stop but its final destination was Karen Blixen really ..... Now for comic relief or is the true measure of desperation , my recruit wanted us to board a water tank whose driver seemed eager to give us a ride , talk of gymnastics how were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? <p> Finally , the matatu came and soon we could see the Promised Land ... ironically , we did meet other Swaras galloping in ... all congratulating us on our perseverance ... little did they know the tales and tolls that led us to this finale ... <p> Unfortunately , we only got to enjoy the refuelling snacks and missed out on the real party due to impromptu family obligations , but we did get to meet some of the Swara fraternity and share in the parable of the multiplying kilometers .... <p> Am not sure if my recruit or our newly found friend will join the Swara fraternity or the Swara 's -never ever club ! ! ! but I will definitely wake up in August to join you again as you know the saying goes ... <p> " Every morning in Africa , a Gazelle wakes up . It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed . Every morning a Lion wakes up . It knows it must outrun the slowest Gazelle or it will starve to death . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gazelle ... when the sun comes up in Africa , you 'd better be running ! ! ! 
##3643951 <h> The First Ever Juba Marathon <p> Today Saturday May 26 , 2012 , the first ever Juba Marathon was held . The Swaras were represented by me -- Carol K- , Allan ( formerly known as Smooth Operator ) , Ndungu ( did n't realize that he too is a Juba home buddy ) and Charles D , an honorary Swara by association . I need to retrace ; initially the Juba Marathon was scheduled for April 26 , 2012 , however the week of the marathon , the organizers discovered that they were not ready so the marathon was postponed by a month to today . Given this change , I forgot all about this marathon ! Yes , I did . That means my training was 20 percent at best -- you know a leisurely run after work- limited to 10km and zero long run . In addition , in the last couple of weeks I have used the running trail as a gossiping venue to catch up with friends as we walk leisurely ! You know , physical activity geared towards preventing heart disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from the marathon organizers telling me that the Juba Marathon was on as planned ! This call sent me into confusion but true to my running instincts and Swaraness , I emailed Allan , Charles and others with this development . Allan responded immediately with a resounding , yes and an offer to pick me up at 0615 hrs ! I could n't say no , so I agreed to it and by association got Charles to agree to participate as well . I was leaning towards a no no to this marathon but the Swara guilt , coupled with Wahome 's words that a 21km is one that a committed Swara can be run with minimal training and Katwa 's advice on how to run a 42km without training helped me make the right decision ! <p> Fast forward to Saturday morning 0645hrs ! Allan arrived as planned and calmly drove us to the start venue . I was secretly glad to see a sizable crowd including Ndungu who I last saw in Lewa last year . I walked over to him for the holas and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly introduced myself as a Swara and brought in the other Swaras for intros ! The fury of getting the race numbers , stabling them on our t-shirts etc began . All the time we were watching the clock . A 0700hr start time for the 21km was planned but we kept getting delayed and the Juba sun was furiously rising . The delay was getting the 21km runners really nervous because we all are familiar with the brutal Juba sun . We kicked off at 0745hours and ran through the streets of Juba , did a good hill climb at 6-10km , ran through the markets negotiating through people , cars , bodas bodas , rickshaws and the very familiar Juba smell . I had lots of cheers ( yea , female , African and all ) running along side many men . At one of the markets my cheering crowd got into it with a truck driver who cut in front of me . They stopped the driver and started screaming obscenities at him and as I ran off shouted " you can kill him for all I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrained body , the frenzy , the hot sun , dust all too much to bear . At 17km I ran out of water . I asked the volunteers manning the run for water and the response was , " you are almost done . " Even with all this , I finished strong and so did the other Swaras . Ndungu was right up there but Allan , Charles and I enjoyed a 2hr 15min finish ! <p> Now here is the best part ! I came third among the female 21km runners and in reality I was second because the number 1 cheated . She did not run the course but being Juba she acted like she did and the organizers had no way proving that she did not suffer like we did . For the first time I found myself on a podium ! Yes , podium you know do in the IAAF championship events ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I think they took some professional pictures . I also got a cash prize of US$ 100 or the equivalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am richer by $100 . I think if I keep this up I can supplement my monthly income pretty well ! I would love to buy some fruits for the Swaras but am so-o far away so I 
##3651450 <h> Twenty-One <p> Depression runs so deep , sometimes I feel like my whole life is darkness . My veins run black with sadness , my arteries carry blood away from my miserable heart , bringing lifeless blood to my flaccid limbs . I am hopeless , climbing , crawling , desparately clawing out of a deep pit that I have created for myself . <p> Yet here I am in a place where coming across a person with HIV is more common than spotting a celebrity in LA ; where corrugated tin houses line the pot-hole filled , dirt roads of every village ; where a few hours ' walk will bring you to a water source that inevitably provides you with an array of illness-inducing diseases and I am at my very best . <p> Let me share with you the bright light of my life , Kenya . <p> At our group devotional last night , we discussed the difference between a North American 's perception of poverty versus a developing country 's definition of poverty . The main difference is that North Americans describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries understand poverty to be an inability to be recognized in society , a failure to be heard , a lack of meaningful existence . <p> From my perspective , our work at Nazareth Hospital and the Allamano School in Kenya in art therapy attempts to return to children their rightful and meaningful existence that was taken away by their abusers . One of my favorite exercises asks children to circle 10 positive adjectives that describe themselves out of a list of about 50 positive characteristics including things like " organized , humorous , energetic , friendly , conscientious , loyal , intelligent , beautiful , confident , humble and patient . " <p> Today , I had one specific child who had family issues that set him back at an early age and was classified with a severe learning disorder . He has had to work individually with a teacher to perfect his skills in order to keep up with the other children in his class . Upon asking him to circle 10 positive characteristics , he was very shy and I had to explain all of the definitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , he still had not circled any of them . I encouraged him to circle one that I knew to be true . That word was " humorous " . He can always make me laugh . As soon as he got rolling , I looked away to help the other children in my group , and as soon as I looked back a few minutes later he had 21 words circled ! If anyone knew his devastating story , they would not have expected him to circle any of those words . But through the extensive work of his dedicated teachers , he has made tremendous progress , and gained incredible confidence that most children with that kind of setback could never have achieved . <p> So at the end of the day when I lay in my twin bed after a lukewarm shower and reflect on my day , I am reminded not of a land plagued with plight , but of a humble country where artistry is expressed on banana leaves , where strangers call me sister and where children can find 21 positive characteristics about themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me serene for a long time . <p> by Ruthie Rand
