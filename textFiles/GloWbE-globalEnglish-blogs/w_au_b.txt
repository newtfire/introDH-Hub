The report was released on the first day of the International Wildlife Management Congress held in Durban , South Africa in July , 2012 . <p> President and CEO of HIS , Ph.D Andrew Rowan says , ' Managers of elephant populations in reserves and parks in Africa will find the information useful , and they can use this non-lethal , science-based , humane and effective alternative to culling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> In question and answer format , the document describes the science behind elephant contraception and its successful use in the management of populations of African elephants in 14 reserves and parks in South Africa . <p> Using a vaccine that currently treats more than 112 mammals , including deer and wild horse populations in the United States , immunocontraception occurs in female elephants who receive a dose of the protein Porcine Zona Pellucida ( PZP ) . PZP is delivered via dart guns and causes no pain or stress to the animal . It stimulates an antibody response that blocks sperm penetration into the egg and hence prevents fertilisation and pregnancy . In field trials to date , the vaccine has proved to be remarkably effective , but females must receive an annual booster dose . <p> The report , Free-ranging African Elephant Immunocontraception : A new paradigm for elephant management , was written by elephant immunocontraception experts Dr. Henk Bertschinger , a veterinarian and professor at the University of Pretoria , South Africa ; Audrey Delsink Kettles , an African elephant behavioral specialist and field director for HSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management specialist with Global Supplies Inc. of South Africa . <p> Research findings documented in the report include information such as : <p> The technique is reversible as females not vaccinated in subsequent years become fertile again . This allows managers flexibility when dealing with different elephant populations . <p> The vaccine is not a hormone and no behavioural abnormalities have been observed in vaccinated females . <p> Males in populations where the breeding females are vaccinated behave normally . <p> Females who are pregnant when vaccinated give birth to normal calves . <p> HSI and its parent affiliate The Humane Society of the United States have funded research and development in African elephant immunocontraception for more than a decade , and HSI continues to fund its application . The report contains firsthand accounts from some of the 
##3284350 <h> 24 July 2012 <h> Development - or what do our people really want ? <p> MICHAEL DOM <p> WE SAY THAT WHAT OUR PEOPLE WANT is development . But are we providing a convenient title to argue a process and an end which is a natural desire of all human societies , traditional and modern ; to move towards a better state of existence within the bounds of their own cultural identity ? <p> By Martyn Namorong 's analogy it made common sense that we should obtain a steel axe when our fathers saw the use of it . <p> This may not in itself have created an inferiority complex because , in their context , a better axe was a necessity for survival . <p> What may have created the inferiority complex , and perpetuate it today , was an inability to understand and appreciate the changes - and therefore be prepared for the impact to human society and our cultural lifestyles . <p> The point of conflict is not technology per se and what we assume to be ' development ' , but how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all society 's experience , and which we in our modern intellect may wrongly call development . <p> In the axe-trading fiasco , the resulting unacknowledged changes that the use of such a technology created were not anticipated , although it seemed only logical that a better tool was needed to make chopping up trees a little easier . <p> The steel axe was an advance in our technology , a development which was very relevant in the traditional intellect to how we lived our lives . <p> But eventually village men found themselves with more time on their hands and quite likely no idea what to do with it . <p> Perhaps at the time no one appreciated what might happen to our cultural ways when this simple but very useful tool , the steel axe , came into the hands of village men and thus freed up time which was now spent in idleness that we were , culturally at least , unprepared for . <p> Questioning if such changes or associated interferences into traditional society are perpetuated by the white folk who first traded us steel axes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if given a choice today , our ancestors would still go for the steel axe , so let 's not regress . <p> The best use we can make of history is to see how and where the mistakes were made in the past so that we can plan to minimise our own mistakes in the future . Now is the right time to decide . <p> Today we are still trading for ' better ' technologies that improve our lives but we should now be able to understand and appreciate what those simple changes in technology of any kind ( or development as we like to call the process ) can do to our culture and the way we want to live our lives . <p> The challenge we face is having , for the most part , dishonourable leaders who take the power of decision making away from the people for their own greedy benefit . <p> The problem with many of PNG 's political leaders is that they assumed that they should dictate how we live our lives , how we develop and progress as a society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western forms of government that we had been taught and indeed that our forefathers had accepted by default . <p> The self aggrandizement of the position of leader at the sacrifice of the community did not happen to such an extreme in our traditional societies , where the leaders were also bound by customary laws . Not so today . <p> Political leaders should be a reflection of the values of society which gives them mandate and right to rule and not vice versa . <p> The characteristics of democracy also existed in our traditional egalitarian tribal systems and perhaps it was not too farfetched to believe that those ideals could be sustained and transmogrified into a new political model . <p> So what our people want , and what we would term development , is that which allows our culture to continue to take its natural course of history , albeit with external **29;2259;TOOLONG that our society <h> Comments <p> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post . <p> Disagreeing is all right . <p> Not everyone was a sailor , nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine did not pass knowledge on to just anyone . <p> Specialization creates class barriers - shait happens . <p> But a tool is as useful as the hands it is placed in . So again , in the steel axe fiasco , some used it to chop wood , others hacked their enemies ( or family ) to death still others made beautiful carvings . <p> It is not for us to feel insulted that our people , as isolated societies , never had the chance to merge into a larger community on their own , before we were ' discovered ' . <p> I concede that some traditional communities had made great advances . But the nation was non existent . <p> We may need to embrace that reality before we start to advocate ' doing things by our PNG ways ' , a ' way ' which until we were colonized did not in fact exist - collectively . <p> The rhetoric of it ( ' PNG ways ' ) is the present disunity of political parties , the diverse party groups , with no apparent ideals nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheque book of the charlatans in charge . <p> And what appear to be PNG ways is actually , according to our leaders , ' my way or the highway ' . <p> On another key point Martyn , " the pursuit of knowledge , art and technology " was by those of better smarts , higher intelligence - almost a separate class altogether - and with greater knowledge comes greater status and/or power . <p> We may have had this in our elders and chief system or more crudely during initiation and through the herbal bush doctors and magic men/women . <p> But to the majority of our anacestors the world was still shrouded in darkness and mystery - we were still emerging into the light , developing our conciousness of the world and our place in it . <p> All of a sudden the rest of the world rocked up to our front door and gave us a steel axe . <p> What I 'm concerned about is your average Joe ; when he had chopped down his tree , and had nada mucho to do , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe get up to today ? <p> On that point Martyn , perhaps what you have advocated earlier about making the 5 Directive Principles enforceable by law , which I believe is impractical , should rather be to have them inculcated in the minds of our school children throughout the education system . <p> We are willing to memorize an oath well enough , but what about the core of what we swear to - what do we beleive in , where are we going , how do we each intend to contribute to getting there . <p> You mention the idleness of many men . John F also mentions this . We 've been hearing about these PNG men not having anything to fill in their time due to some form of " progress ' . The women , the carers of society , still have plenty to do ! <p> I guess many problems have arisen in PNG society since I left at the end of 1983 , which have caused massive problems and not enough thought has been given to working out ways to solve them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that allows PNG culture to take its natural course in history . <p> In Australia we now have many retired people , men and women , and its going to grow . But do they sit around being idle ? <p> Some may , but over the years there has been the growth of plenty of activities for them to join . There are the local Probus clubs with visiting speakers , bush walks , educational trips , etc There has been the rise of The Men 's Shed where men can join together and share their skills e.g. in carpentry etc . <p> The list of activities for the retired is growing by the day . In our culture , people like to socialize and they do n't really like being idle . Many become involved with volunteer charity work of various kinds , and Martyn saw that in action in Brisbane . <p> I hope the new parliament will have thinking members who will be observant of all the small local problems and will try to work out ways to solve them . <p> I fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich the country will become if it has all these mines and gas wells etc . The ordinary people at the grass-roots level have many problems which can be solved , often without much

##3284452 <h> 07 November 2012 <h> Privatising state enterprises : benefits &; constraints <p> PRIVATIZING STATE-OWNED enterprises ( SOEs ) is a tough ask for public enterprise in developing economies like Papua New Guinea 's and may be a poor option unless certain ground rules are followed . <p> The appropriate role of SOEs in the economic development of a nation has historically aroused strong feelings . <p> The private sector aims at profitability and efficiency of resources to gain a maximal outcome . The public sector , the place where SOEs are conceived and born , aims at service delivery to the people with government bearing the risk . <p> It is argued that the private sector is more efficient and enterprising than SOEs in terms of personal involvement , higher accountability , lesser bureaucracy , greater delegation of authority and more efficiency of resource use . <p> Privatization is not new concept in PNG ; there was a rash of it in the late 1990s and early 2000s . <p> But the privatization of SOEs in this way was not the best choice due to their monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of developmental and social dimensions such as the cost of the goods and services a monopolized private enterprise can extract . <p> In a developing economy like PNG , there are certain problems that must be addressed that might obstruct a successful privatization : <p> 1 . Lack of an efficient private sector <p> 2 . Scarcity of professional manpower <p> 3 . Poorly developed financial markets <p> 4 . Inadequate infrastructure and support services <p> 5 . Partially commercialized services and industries <p> 6 . Low level of socio-economic development <p> A better approach than privatizing an SOE may be to corporatize it . In such a situation , the state owned corporations are being to free them from bureaucratic restraints while guaranteeing accountability . <p> One of the main issues to consider before privatizing SOEs is the level of market competition . The absence of competition indicates that privatisation may not be advisable , and that government-sponsored restructuring may be preferable . <p> If privatizations are to occur , they may need to be postponed until measures are effected to improve market competition . <p> If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privatized SOEs do not abuse their market power . <p> One downside of SOEs is that they can ' crowd out ' private enterprises because of the privileges resulting from their government ownership or sponsorship . <p> The funds government borrows to support SOEs , for instance , are funds not available for private sector investment . <p> For an economic and political environment to be conducive for privatization , there are certain factors to be considered . <p> Privatization must be politically desirable to the leadership and constituencies , the political benefits must outweigh the political costs . <p> Privatization must be politically achievable . The may mean enacting reforms and overcoming opposition , either by compensating the losers or by compelling them to comply despite their losses . <p> The SOE reform promise must be credible . Investors must have confidence in the government that it will not re-nationalize the privatized firms and SOE employees who fear they may lose out in reform must accept that the government will deliver on any promises of future compensation . <p> There are many reasons for the privatization of SOEs : mismanagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of providing goods and services . <p> Add to these inefficient operations , maintenance and service delivery arising in part from weak competition or from monopoly positions . <p> Include the constraint on pricing policies by governments wishing to provide subsidized or cheap services for political reasons , preventing the SOEs from recovering their full operational and investment costs . <p> Such government behaviour is one of the major reasons for privatization , because SOEs can provide inherently unprofitable goods and services and inhibit the emergence of privately owned businesses . <p> A change in ownership from public to private can be expected to lead to an improvement in economic performance . However , efficiency

##3285551 <p> There is a little debate going on how one should pronounce or call , what I will refer to as French macarons . Two almond meringue discs joined together by a flavoured filling . Macaron is the French spelling and pronunciation , and some say that in English it is macaroon and pronounced that way . <p> How do I pronounce those ' biscuits ' that Sydney has gone nuts for , and Adriano Zumbo has become famous baking . I pronounce them macaron . When I hear people refer to them as macaroons , it effects me like somebody dragging their nails down a blackboard , shudder ! <p> When I was growing up you did n't see macarons in the local cake shop , they just did n't exist . See picture below . <p> Well , I am sure you could find them in France , I am 100% sure there were , I just did n't grow up in France . I grew up in Australia , where every cake shop had macaroons , coconut meringue mounds . You could purchase small ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chocolate , even ones with glace cherries on top . See picture below . <p> You do n't see macaroons very often these days . Macarons on the other hand are everywhere , from specialty stores to the freezer section of the supermarket . <p> It is a shame , as macaroons are delicious . The coconut turns all toasty when they are being baked . The outside is crisp and crunchy while the inside stays moist and slightly chewy . They smell amazing when baking , like somebody toasting coconut covered marshmallows . <p> Macaroons are extremely simple to make , unlike the macaron . Just make sure that you keep whipping your eggs and sugar until all the sugar has dissolved into the mixture , very important . This stops your macaroons ' bleeding ' . I also use a mix of desiccated and shredded coconut to give them a more interesting texture . <p> Coconut Macaroons Makes around 30 <p> Ingredients <p> 2 eggs , separated <p> 1/4t salt <p> 2/3c caster sugar <p> 2c desiccated coconut <p> 1c shredded coconut <p> 1 . Preheat oven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone mixer or hand mixer to beat eggs whites and salt until soft peaks form . If using stand alone mixer use your whipping attachment . 3 . Then beat in egg yolks one at a time . 4 . Very gradually add sugar , making sure well incorporated after each addition . Beat until sugar has completely dissolved , this can take a while . 5 . Stir in coconut and mix through the mixture well . 6 . Line baking trays with baking paper and spoon level tablespoons of mixture on to them . 7 . Bake until golden brown , roughly 15minutes . Cool slightly on trays before removing to wire racks . Store in an airtight container for up to a week . <p> Dear Belly Rumbles ' reader , do tell , are you camp macaron or macaroon ? <p> I shudder too when people pronounce macarons as macaroons . I do have to agree with you that the coconut macaroon biscuit is usually over looked . Dad used to work at a bakery and bring these babies home , and it 's no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making them myself , they do look rather easy ! Tina @ bitemeshowme recently posted .. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen , Hollywood -- California USA <p> Hehe people can be so funny about the pronunciation . I know people that get really mad if people call them macaroons !

Inc stands alone in mass of eating options in Cronulla , it does not play on the seaside location look and feel , instead it would easily be at home in Newtown or Darlinghurst . Josh and I grab a table and I pinch a menu from one of the neighbouring ones . We are promptly bought over another menu , so we do n't have to share , by a person I take to be the owner . <p> While perusing the menu , we are asked if we would like to order drinks , and we do . Freshly squeezed orange juice and a chocolate milkshake . The juice is freshly squeezed , not freshly squeezed from a bottle and the chocolate milkshake is served in the cutest 500ml old style milk bottle . The best thing is , it tastes awesome . Best milkshake I have tried in a long time , they remind me of the famed Parry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; omelettes , mixed berry pancakes , eggs on toast , a big breakfast , a vegie brekkie , homemade banana bread , organic spelt maple muesli , various extras and a kids breakfast menu . The breakfast menu looks very tempting and we feel a return visit would be warranted to try it out . <p> We are here for lunch and there are lots of options to choose from , schnitzel &; salad , wraps , BLT , burgers , pizzas , vegetarian moussaka and various salads . After much deliberation and advice from staff , lunch decisions are made . After ordering , our meals arrive quite quickly . Inc 's Open BLT ; bacon , lettuce , tomato , homemade Caesar sauce on freshly baked flat bread , served with fries , $12.50 . The BLT is definitely open , the filling is actually sitting on top of the flat roll . Something we have n't seen before , but the bacon is cooked the way we like it , on the crispy not soggy side . The homemade Caesar sauce , is light and makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $14.00 . <p> Cheese and bacon burger ; homemade beef patty , bacon , cheese , mustard , relish , fries and salad , $14.00 . I am quite over being served burgers that are piled so high you ca n't get your mouth around them . It is refreshing that Inc 's burger is the size that a burger should be , no deconstructing to eat it but you have to stretch your mouth to get it around it . Large moist beef patty and a bun that is neither too crunchy nor soft , it 's just right . Both meals are generous in size , taste great and are great value for the price . <p> Inc 's philosophy is ' deliver the freshest &; tastiest food to our customers with warmth , integrity and a friendly smile ' , and they do . <p> Would I recommend ? Yes I would . Inc is open for breakfast , lunch , dinner and dessert . They are also licensed with a range of beers and cocktails by the jug . <p> As much as I love high stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat .

##3289851 <h> Time for NSW to take chemical leaks seriously <p> NSW is not doing enough to prevent excessive environmental damage from chemical leaks : it is more common than many people realise for liquid wastes to be discharged into waterways . <p> The NSW Environment Protection Agency ( EPA ) is responsible for regulating the disposal of waste discharges from medium and large operations into the environment . For each location this is done through a licence called an Environmental Protection Licence ( EPL ) . These licences are commonly known as " pollution licences " . <p> A recent research paper in the Environmental and Planning Law Journal examined the current regulation of water pollution in NSW . It identified many failures which are causing water pollution and environmental degradation . <p> The EPA has been reconstituted with amendments to its legislation and can now impose severe new penalties for causing pollution and also for any failure to promptly report pollution . This was a direct result of a NSW Government inquiry . While this is a major improvement , so many of the pollution licences specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and damage . <h> Pollution licences are n't working <p> Pollution licences ( EPLs ) are not preventing environmental contamination . Recently , a highly hazardous material ( sodium chromate ) was released from the Orica Kooragang Island industrial complex near Newcastle to the Stockton residential area . The general public was only informed of the potentially carcinogenic " fallout " three days after the incident . Both industry ( Orica ) and the regulator ( the EPA ) were criticised . <p> Collecting water samples from wastewater spilling from the Canyon Coal Mine . Ian Wright <p> Click to enlarge <p> The upper Coxs River illustrates the issues with EPLs . This river , in the western Blue Mountains of NSW , has more than 22 licensed premises discharging waste to waterways . The upper Coxs is a sensitive and highly valued region . The river has identified values of ecosystem protection , irrigation , livestock water supply , fishing , visual amenity and recreation . It is also one of the largest rivers flowing into Lake Burragorang , the giant domestic water reservoir behind Warragamba Dam , the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two coal-fired power stations in the area . The older power station ( Wallerawang ) has an EPL licence to release waste water that does not match the pollutants released . Remarkably the EPL failed to regulate salinity , as the discharge had a level of salinity measured at up to 2,380 S/cm . This is nearly seven times the Australian water guideline for protection of aquatic ecosystems . It 's about 50 times higher than background levels of salinity ( in upstream clean reaches of local freshwater streams ) . The current EPL for this facility has no discharge limits for salinity . <p> This discharge also includes highly elevated heavy metals , such as copper . Again , there were no discharge limits for copper or other heavy metals in the waste discharge . <p> In 2009 , the Blue Mountains Conservation Society took Delta to court over this discharge , using data I collected . The Wallerawang Power Station is now in the process of an ambitious upgrade to its treatment of wastewater , following an out-of-court settlement . Delta Electricity have also requested the EPA to licence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy metals . <h> Coal causing cumulative impacts <p> Another criticism of water pollution licensing in NSW is the lack of consideration of cumulative impacts . The upper Coxs River includes more than 20 other licenced discharge points in addition to the Wallerawang Power Station . There are two sewage treatment plants ( Lithgow and Wallerawang ) and a very large and growing number of coal mines that " dewater " waste water that collects as part of their mining operation and is pumped out to nearby waterways . <p> Water pollution from coal mining is more persistent and ecologically damaging than many people realise . A nearby coal mine , the Canyon Coal Mine , operated for about 70 years before closing in 1997 . This has been the subject of several research papers as contaminated drainage still emerges today and every day from a mine shaft that emerges near the edge of the cliff lines in the spectacular and highly valued Grose River valley . <p> Grose River above the Canyon coal mine waste inflow . Ian Wright <p> Click to enlarge <p> This area is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a National Park , a declared Wilderness area , a declared Wild River , and is also part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area . These protections have not prevented or even remediated any of the water pollution effects from the legacy of this coal mining operation . <p> One study of aquatic ecosystems of the Grose River using freshwater invertebrates , showed that more than 10km of the river was ecologically degraded by toxic water originating from the coal mine . Water chemistry suggested that toxic levels of zinc were responsible for the pollution and ecological degradation . <p> The NSW EPA accepted the surrender of the EPL ( #558 ) when commercial mining ceased , even though polluted water continued to emerge from the mine . It appears that this pollution discharge now occurs in a regulatory vacuum . When it was in operation , the EPL allowed the mine to release highly elevated levels of zinc , hundreds of time higher than ecosystem protection guidelines recommend . <h> Time to make a change <p> Reforms of water pollution licensing are needed in NSW . Licences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points . Licences need to include concentration limits and monitoring requirements for all environmentally hazardous pollutants in each discharge . <p> The NSW Government demanded this type of information from Sydney Water when it was corporatised . Providing the information turned out to be an important incentive for Sydney Water to clean up beaches , and particularly its discharge of sewage into the ocean ( some may remember the 1980s fight against sewage pollution at Bondi , Malabar and North Head ) . The standard of treatment was improved and the quality of water for swimming has improved . This example of good pollution management has turned out to be a very isolated one . <p> The cumulative impact of all licensed discharges needs to be considered . The EPA should publicly explain the rationale for its EPL discharge limit decisions , particularly for its discharge pollutant concentrations for key pollutants . <p> The NSW Government has made one very important step towards improved regulation of pollution . In the aftermath of the August 2011 Orica case , EPL licence holders are now required to make all environmental monitoring data publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transparency of water pollution in NSW . I hope that it helps the community understand what potentially dangerous chemicals may be discharge in their local environment . However , people may be disappointed that in so many cases the EPLs for water pollution fail to specify limits for the most damaging chemicals in the waste 
##3295150 <h> Hoegaarden vs the best beer ever .. <p> I went out to the garage earlier and bought two bottles of Hoegaarden in from the beer fridge . One was the commercial version out of a plastic wrapped four pack bought from Aldi a week ago . The other , a custom Hoegaarden recipe from U-Brew-It , tweaked with dried orange peel and coriander seed added at the hopping ( flavour ) stage of the brew . When it was bottled on Friday , we knew it was good , the question was always going to be , " How does it compare to the original ? " <p> To ensure the flavour remained untainted , the homebrew was refrigerated as soon as I got home Friday night . The brews at U-Brew It contain no preservatives , so , even though filtered , they can start secondary fermentation if kept at the wrong ( or is that right ) temperature . I 've found this secondary fermentation imparts a yeasty taste to the beer . <p> Upon opening the plastic wrap , I noticed the commercial Hoegaarden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to head comparison . As the homebrew was carbonated , I decided to sample the commercial Hoegaarden with and without the lees , the dead yeast on the bottom of the bottle . <p> Upon opening the bottles , I found it difficult to detect a difference in the aromas . Both were slightly sweet , with a hint of spice . Pouring the beers out , the differences became immediately obvious . I poured both gently into untilted glasses , a pair of Chambly glasses from a tasting night . The Hoegaarden was light yellow in colour with plenty of head retention , whilst the homebrew was almost ale like in colour with the head fading within a minute . Sampling the aromas again , I now noticed a hint of malt in the homebrew , and a clear odour of yeast in the commercial version . A fruity , sweet spice aroma was still prominent in both beers . <p> The taste . I tried the Hoegaarden first , as it was the benchmark after all . My first reaction was , " light on taste , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was now the homebrew 's turn . Upon the first sip , I was surprised that there was no immediate tell that these were different beers . I was happy that they were extremely similar in taste . If anything the homebrew had more flavour , nicer on the palette with more body to it . With the extra body , as a consequence , it did have more of a malty taste to it . <p> I emptied the remaining beer into both glasses having stirred up the lees in the Hoegaarden . The head by now was non-existent on the homebrew , while still holding strong on the commercial beer . With the added lees , the yeasty taste was more prominent in the Hoegaarden , with the malt really coming through in the homebrew . This was probably a result of me sampling each one mouthful at a time , so the differences were being accentuated , whilst for all intents and purposes , the beers were very similar in taste . <p> Having brewed the homebrew I 'm very happy with the results . Next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spice and hops , though I would revisit the malt mixture to lighten the colour and lesson the malty taste . All in all , a job very well done

##3307350 <h> Latest Tweets <h> Search <h> White noise <h> Posted <h> Categories <h> Comments <h> I ended my <p> last post with an assurance that if anything major changed in my life , I 'd be back to update . For those few that do regularly visit here , it is therefore perhaps a little bit worrisome that I have n't returned sooner than now . But never mind , you might be thinking , the fact that I am now reading these fresh words would logically mean that the aforementioned major event must have occurred . While I admire your logic , dear reader , I am afraid that I must both verify it and deny it at the same time . In other words : has anything changed since my last post ? Well , yes and no . <p> The yes ca n't be denied ; Louise and I have , in the last two weeks , moved into a new house , ending a year 's worth of living dependently . That mystical quantity , " a year 's supply of " , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grateful , very , very grateful , for the kindnesses that have been extended to us by friends and family alike in asking us to take up residence within their homes , they were n't our walls to live within or , in my case , stare at . So the advent of having a space to call our own , albeit per annum payable per fortnight , is a revelation ; the importance of which ca n't be understated . <p> So that 's the yes : firm , solid . Like a bass drum kick , it strikes and does n't stick around . The no is more like a guitar chord , played through a reverb pedal . It is made up of smaller fragments and repeated again and again , day after day . Uncertainty , frustration , pessimism , stress , pressure , and a rapidly diminishing bank account . The plan was to move cities . The plan fell through , and that was fine : P-town is n't so bad , after all . And there was hope : a job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industrial partner . It would just take a little while to get going , as contracts had to be written and intellectual property sorted out . <p> That was three months ago . Since then my savings have dripped slowly out of my accounts , waiting for that regular injection that will/might come when whatever strings are holding proceedings up are either cut or brought into a fine bow . The worst thing is a lack of any starting date . If I knew a starting date it would be , as Louise put it , just like school holidays , in that you know when you need to go back and thus take every advantage of the time you have off . As it stands I am stuck in a house with no car , dreading the thought of having to talk to anybody because I know their first question will be something along the well-intentioned ( and well-tensioned ) lines of So Have You Heard Back About The Job Yet ? The answer to which has already moved from a thorough explanation of IP issues through to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a series of grunts and pitching whatever objects are handy at the interrogator . <p> The temptation is to just write off two-thousand and twelve entirely and go ... I du n no , work at a monastery or some such . Discussions about picking up temporary work or a casual contract have been entered into by Louise and I , but the aforementioned pessimism ( and a severely irritating lack of Internet access ) usually puts paid to that very quickly . There 's the feeling , no matter how self-aware I am of the fact that it is very much a Bullshit Privileged White Person Feeling , that events have been a touch unfair on me . That perhaps , after almost a decade of education , a job might not have been too much to ask for . Anyway , like I said , a BPWPF , and one I try not to rest on for any significant period of time , lest I become completely insufferable rather than merely depressing . <p> I have switched modes of interaction quite significantly , becoming almost exclusively a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music production , and even the small concession I made while playing games of making video reviews ( although that is mainly due to the lack of Internet ) . I have tried to occupy myself by learning a programming language , and the fundamentals of music theory , but neither have really captured my interest in a way that would allow me to throw myself completely in them . I feel that I am living in a vacuum , and that slowly , surely , that vacuum is sucking my will out through my pores . I 've heard exercise helps a lot . Maybe that will be my next stop . At the very least it will alleviate the boredom-snacks I 've been indulging in . There has to be a better word for those : something fancy like can't-aps or bore d'oeuvres ? <p> Alright , enough

##3312350 <p> Just like we humans need insurance , likewise our pets also need insurance . This insurance is important , as if your pet gets sick , or gets injured , or if he meets with some accident , then the veterinary cost will be paid by the insurance company . There are some insurance covers that will pay compensation if your pet dies all of a sudden , or if he gets stolen or lost . The pet insurance has become essential nowadays as the cost of treatment has increased significantly , and all of us want to give the best possible treatment to our pets . As dog is the most popular pet and man 's best friend , the concept of dog insurance has gained much popularity . <p> Basic information about the policy : <p> Well before , you start contemplating about the policy ; there are few basic things that every dog owner should know . The dog insurance can be done for any pet dog in the age group of 8 weeks to 8 years . Only the dogs that are exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be insured . At the time of the proposal , it is a must that a veterinary doctor is present for valuation . The dog that has been insured has to be identified by any of the following ways like Tattooing , Photograph , or Nose Print . Apart from these , other normal details like the age , sex , identification marks , breed , etc. should be clearly marked . The details of the pedigree record and the kennel club record have to be submitted . The premium that has to be paid is the 5% of the insurance amount . <p> The range of the policy cover : <p> The dog insurance generally covers your pet dog against death that can be due to illness , or accident , and also against any disease that is contracted after the commencement of the policy . There are certain cases , where the insurance company will not pay anything , like if the dog has rabies , Distemper , Viral Hepatitis , Viral enteritis , Leptospirosis , etc . There is one option here ; if the dog was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease occurred just before 15 days of the insurance started , then the insurance company will pay the compensation . If the death of the dog occurs due to any third party fault , then if this clause was covered , you will get insurance cover . <p> The process of claiming insurance : <p> The process of filing for insurance claim is quite simple . You have to intimate the insurance company from whom you have taken the dog insurance , and then you have to fill the form , and attach the death certificate issued by the veterinary doctor . A post mortem report is required , along with a photograph supporting your dog 's death . <p> Benefits of having an insurance cover : <p> The most common benefit of dog insurance is that the veterinary bills can be claimed . Also the cost of medicine is covered under this insurance . If suddenly your dog has to undergo an operation , then all the cost will be borne by the insurance company . Keeping a pet is a very costly affair , and on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then insurance comes as a big financial relief . http : **45;3665;TOOLONG is a good option for getting your pet dog insured and keeps yourself free from all the worries related to his illness or theft .

##3314351 <p> We heard about these issues in May , when a little birdie told us about problems with RT , Qualcomm and Texas Instruments . And we wrote at the time that HP 's Qualcomm-chip based tablet " may not happen this year " . <p> Just to be clear , the RT version of Windows 8 runs on ARM chips from Nvidia , Qualcomm and Texas Instruments , and it will not have the backward compatibility of Intel-based Windows 8 . <p> Whether these issues are PC company-specific , chipmaker-specific , RT-specific or a combination of all three , is n't clear yet . <p> Patrick Moorhead , president of Moor Insights &; Strategy , told CNET this week , that one ARM chipmaker is making more progress than the others . <p> Nvidia -- which by no coincidence is in Microsoft 's RT Surface tablet -- is ahead of the other two ARM companies , because it has a long history of working with Windows drivers , among other reasons , according to Moorhead . <p> There are broader issues too , though . Microsoft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : RT is the first mainstream version of Windows to run on ARM chips . <p> How cautious is Microsoft ? As we wrote in May , Nvidia , Qualcomm and Texas Instruments were initially assigned two " slots " each , for devices . " ARM is restricted to two designs each , meaning six total initial designs , " said a source at the time . <p> One of those slots was for the Qualcomm-based HP device , referenced above . <p> So , Microsoft is obviously worried about quality control , which means issues , possibly major ones , are inevitable . <p> A best-case scenario is a staggered release of RT tablets , laptops and hybrids . With some versions , eg , those based on Nvidia chips , probably appearing earlier than others . <h> Video You Might Like <h> Add Your Comment 2 <p> Agree with trebor83 .

Click here for full bio . <h> Search <h> 29 August 2012 <h> Good Government Goes Missing <p> This week , there have been two significant events that encapsulate the failure of Labor 's approach to government . <p> The first was the announced changes to the floor price of their flawed and damaging carbon tax . It shows , once again , that Labor 's policy decisions are hasty and ill-considered . <p> Gillard and Co have persistently lectured those who disagree with their carbon tax , saying that we risk being left behind . We have been told about the millions of ' green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nonsense . <p> We were also lectured about the successful green economies of Spain , California and their ilk . In repeated media interviews , our Prime Minister 's claims about the economic strength of these states was accepted without question . Conveniently ignored was the accrued debt and unemployment the green policy agenda was driving . The end result is now apparent for all to see , which makes Labor 's persistent pursuit down the same path even more ridiculous now than it was then . <p> Labor 's backflip on the floor price of their carbon tax and decision to link it to the European emissions trading scheme is astounding . On one hand , it is an admission that they got their initial carbon tax wrong and have finally seen the damage it will do to our economy . On the other hand , rather than scrap it altogether , they have decided to link it to one of the most corrupt and ineffective schemes operating in the world today . <p> Europe 's ETS has been mired in controversy since inception . Allegations of corruption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated that around 90 per cent of European ETS trades were linked to one dodgy scheme or another . <p> One should also look at the broader track record of Euro-zone economic management and even the most charitable assessment would call into question the wisdom of following in their footsteps . <p> But such is the lot of a desperate government , prepared to sell us out to justify their grip on power . <p> There was another grubby display of the lust for power on our front pages this week .

It shows , once again , that Labor 's policy decisions are hasty and ill-considered . <p> Gillard and Co have persistently lectured those who disagree with their carbon tax , saying that we risk being left behind . We have been told about the millions of ' green jobs ' that will be generated . It has all been nonsense . <p> We were also lectured about the successful green economies of Spain , California and their ilk . In repeated media interviews , our Prime Minister 's claims about the economic strength of these states was accepted without question . Conveniently ignored was the accrued debt and unemployment the green policy agenda was driving . The end result is now apparent for all to see , which makes Labor 's persistent pursuit down the same path even more ridiculous now than it was then . <p> Labor 's backflip on the floor price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European emissions trading scheme is astounding . On one hand , it is an admission that they got their initial carbon tax wrong and have finally seen the damage it will do to our economy . On the other hand , rather than scrap it altogether , they have decided to link it to one of the most corrupt and ineffective schemes operating in the world today . <p> Europe 's ETS has been mired in controversy since inception . Allegations of corruption and tax dodges linked to permit trading abound . One pundit estimated that around 90 per cent of European ETS trades were linked to one dodgy scheme or another . <p> One should also look at the broader track record of Euro-zone economic management and even the most charitable assessment would call into question the wisdom of following in their footsteps . <p> But such is the lot of a desperate government , prepared to sell us out to justify their grip on power . <p> There was another grubby display of the lust for power on our front pages this week . The militant unions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government . <p> Many Australians would be horrified to see the motley crue of union thugs and standover men attacking police or intimidating workers .

Click here for full bio . <p> Search CoryBernardi.com <h> Search <h> 17 September 2012 <h> A Rude Awakening <p> The dreadful protests by Islamic fundamentalists in Sydney on the weekend were the portend of what I have been consistently warning my colleagues and the Australian population about for a number of years . These warnings have earned me a great deal of criticism from fellow politicians and some members of the media . However , they have been well received by a grateful public who have been struggling with the cultural relativism being practised by too many of our opinion makers . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our country would never be realised . For the rest of my life , I would gladly have worn the slurs of ' racist ' and ' bigot ' received in response to my concerns about Islam if it allowed Australia to avoid the problems that extremists have caused overseas . <p> What occurred in Western Europe a decade ago is now happening here . Even the signs held aloft during the Sydney riots carried the same suggestion as those from protests in the UK - " behead those who insult Islam " . It should serve as a wake-up call to the nave and just plain foolish who are in denial that a significant problem is emerging in Australia . <p> The nave cling to the romantic idealisation of the generations of migrants who have successfully settled in Australia , thinking things will continue just as they have in the past . They proclaim multiculturalism as a triumph of tolerance when in fact it undermines the cultural values and cohesiveness that brings a nation together . Our culture is built upon the two great pillars of Western civilisation -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these great strengths to be undermined by supporting calls for any form of legal plurality or the indulgence of cultural practices that go against our social norms is to abandon reason . <p> Unfortunately , both have taken place in recent times . In a week when four people were arrested for allowing or performing female genital mutilation on two young girls , it is worth being reminded that some suggest we should allow and facilitate a ritual pinprick of girls ' genitals to appease this abhorrent cultural practice . <p> To appease a tiny minority , many Australians now unknowingly consume Halal slaughtered livestock . The government have considered changing laws to accommodate sharia compliant finance and others have joined calls for sharia to be applied for matrimonial disputes . This is just the tip of the iceberg . <p> It is easy to dismiss the practices of the last week as the result of some crazy extremists . That is the convenient route for those who know very little about the fundamentalist Islamic agenda and understand little of their mission worldwide . <p> This has been evident in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fundamentalists have taken advantage of the welfare state , weak lawmakers and fear to implement their agenda at a significant cost to western culture . <p> It is now a punishable crime to criticise Islam in some Western nations . Dutch politician Geert Wilders was once prevented from entering the UK because the government was scared of public unrest by Islamic militants . He was painted as an extremist while those that sought to kill him were deemed culturally misunderstood . <p> The fear that the West has of offending Islam is further evidenced by the apology tweeted by one US Embassy about the supposed cause of the riots that left an ambassador and others killed in Libya . Notwithstanding their subsequent retraction of this position , it is concerning that their first instinct was to blame themselves for the work of one individual and the response of thousands of fanatics . <p> The mainstream media go to great lengths to put the case of how these fundamentalists are not the true face of Islam but do n't question the ' religion of peace ' defence coming from someone wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is heartening that some Islamic leaders have condemned the weekend 's riots but doubts are cast because these are some of the same people and organisations that have called for legal plurality , polygamy and have previously defended hate speech . <p> When are our political and community leaders going to wake up to the fact that what is going on here is exactly the same process that has caused such chaos in some comparable nations ? <p> There can be no tolerance of the fundamentalists ' objectives in this country . Whether it be segregated swimming hours , dehumanising facial coverings or demands for sharia law , every indulgence

Indeed , up until this week the last time I actually started writing for a publication I 'd never appeared in before was when I started at Lifehacker back in May 2008 . <p> That 's one of the reasons I was particularly pleased that a story I pitched to Crikey yesterday got accepted and wound up in today 's email and on the site ( accessible only to Crikey subscribers , sorry ) . I would n't actually have thought of pitching anything from LCA , which is a heavily technical event , to a general-interest news publication , but Jeff Waugh suggested on Twitter that I should give it a try , and then I had one of those fairly rare Eureka moments where I suddenly saw how the story -- covering the controversial ACTA treaty and the tech community 's reaction to it -- should be structured .

##3328251 <p> If you 're familiar with CliffsNotes , you know that they 're shortcut guides written to present and explain topics quickly and more efficiently ( rather than reading or studying a topic in length ) . <p> Although there is absolutely no shortcut for obtaining customer loyalty , the notes below explain some of the best tips to understand how to gain customer loyalty . It 's up to you to implement and add your own spin to them for your particular business and market . <p> Chapter 1 : Know Your Customers <p> The main way to know your customers is to listen to them . I recently read an article about how the $1 billion dollar company , Lululemon , got to those numbers by listening to their customers . Their CEO spends hours each week in stores observing customers , listening to what they 're saying and then using the feedback to adjust products and stores . Their staff eavesdrops on customers as they fold clothes near the fitting rooms ( purposely placed there ) so they can overhear rants and raves . Customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chalkboard that are relayed back to headquarters . <p> Knowing your customers allows you to interact with them beyond dollars and cents because it 's not about ' selling ' anymore ; customers are too smart for that now . What 's important is understanding what motivates them ( eavesdrop if you have to ) , engage them strategically ( chalkboard example ) and finally influence them to make a decision . You wo n't know how to do any of this unless you know them . Start listening . <p> Chapter 2 : Create Positive Experiences <p> Everyone loves a positive experience ; up to 89% of consumers will tell others of their positive experiences and absolutely any business can do it because even small actions matter . <p> After arriving home from their stay , the family realized their son left his teddy bear at the hotel . That night the family received a call from the hotel to say they found it and they would send it home the next day . When the teddy bear arrived , he came with the following : <p> photos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart , hanging out with other teddy bears and working behind the desk <p> a personalized staff ID card <p> Guess what happened ? The story was seen by millions of people on social networks , made news in other countries but most importantly , touched the hearts of the family and many others around the world , creating one of the best types of engagement -- emotional engagement . <p> Chapter 3 : KEEP Engaging <p> One of the worst things you can do after you 've engaged , is to stop engaging . Why go through all the trouble to create positive experiences , train your staff , gain customers and then forget about them ? Continue the engagement through personalized , fun emails , great content , responsive social media interactions , personal attention , feedback and more . Continue to evolve your efforts and keep them guessing about what you 're going to offer them next ( people love mystery ) . See this post on specific ways bricks and mortars can create customer engagement . <p> Take this away : <p> Customer engagement strengthens your brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your customers . Having a customer-centric mind frame , taking the initiative and having a little bit of creativity can go a long way in gaining the kind of customers you want : Customer Evangelists . <p> What chapters do you want to add to the ' CliffsNotes for Customer Engagement ' ?

##3329650 <h> A Little Bit Country She Wore What <p> by Melissa Suger on October 15 , 2012 <p> A few weeks ago I popped down to the post office for the second time in one day to fetch a parcel no one could seem to find . To say I was grumpy would be an understatement except that I was REALLY excited for this package to get here so I absolutely got over it . My package was found and with it there was a second , smaller parcel with my name written in unfamiliar handwriting ... My name was even spelt right , which hardly ever happens with unsolicited parcels so I was surprised . Hmmmm . The plot thickens . <p> Thankfully this person had also been as diligent with their portion of the parcel addressing type section thing and there was the name of the mystery sender . A friend who 's not so far away any more . she drove through my town recently enough and wondered if I lived nearby . ARGH . Someone who I 've never really had a decent amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like is my friend . A real friend . She 's an Internet celeb , so try not to be jealous , I bet she 'd be your friend too if you asked . She 's just lovely like that . Any ideas who ? I 'll tell you later and be a name dropping weirdo , promise . But first let 's talk about this adorable navy dress that was IN the parcel . <p> This dress could have been made for me and my tan boots and belt . It was like it was lined up for us from the start . the colour , I love . The pattern . The cut and the style . All great for me . PLUS it 's a light cotton sort of material and I plan on wearing it all year round . When I finally , FINALLY put my boots away trust me , it was even too hot when I took these photos but I was DETERMINED I have some cute eBay tan strappy heels that will take their place . Win . Suffice to say I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##3331651 <p> The spate of so called ' green-on-blue ' attacks , where members of the Afghan National Security Forces kill Coalition soldiers , has been one of the most destabilising threats to our resolve and commitment to the war in Afghanistan . <p> A total of fifty-nine Coalition soldiers , including seven Australians , have died at the hands of rogue Afghan forces . However , Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs continue to be the most deadly risk in Afghanistan . <p> The sad fact is that long after Coalition forces have departed , IEDs will remain a serious risk to life and freedom of movement across Afghanistan for civilians . They 're an evil legacy from an unconventional war against a complex enemy . <p> As of October 2012 , 1322 Coalition soldiers have been killed by IEDs . Between 2009 and 2012 , IEDs accounted for approximately 50 per cent of all Coalition fatalities , while almost half of all Australian soldiers killed in action were from IEDs , with eighteen wounded . <p> According to the Pentagon 's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in 2011 , when US forces were at their peak and fighting raged across the country . <p> The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) monitoring of civilian casualties reveals that IEDs killed 340 civilians and injured a further 599 over the past nine months , an increase of almost 30 per cent compared to the same period last year . <p> While the Taliban are cunning , their reckless asymmetric warfare tactics often result in the use of enough explosive material to destroy a tank being planted with a mechanism which can be set off by the footstep of child . <p> After the 2014 withdrawal , and regardless of whether Afghanistan descends into a new phase of conflict , civilians will continue to be killed by IEDs because nobody knows where most of them are located . <p> Forget about building schools and medical clinics if your path is sown with misplaced IEDs . <p> This is despite the fact that spilling the blood of ' innocent Muslims ' is a crime , according to the Taliban 's spiritual leader Mullah Omar . In Dawlatabad District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 19th of October this year , a civilian bus taking guests to a wedding drove over a pressure plate IED on a busy public road , killing 18 women with another seven injured , including six children . <p> A " pressure plate " means that when you step on the plate it completes the circuit and detonates the explosives . The other possible mechanism is a mobile phone . <p> A telltale sign of a mobile phone controlled device is the " trigger-point " . The IED is placed in line with a tree or post and the guy on the phone waits until your vehicle is lined up before sending the signal via his device . <p> The end result is the same . <p> Regardless of whether you are a soldier , aid worker , farmer , woman or child , IEDs are indiscriminate . In 2011 , 36 per cent of all the children killed , as well as 46 per cent of women , were killed by IEDs . <p> In 2010 an IED missed my vehicle by metres , another IED targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a good friend of mine was seriously wounded in an IED attack in Ghazni Province . <p> This was around the time when it became evident that Iranian expertise had begun to find its way into Afghanistan , resulting in more sophisticated and devastating IEDs which are made from a shape charge mine known as the ' Dragon ' . <p> In 2011 , I worked alongside one of the world 's leading experts on land mines , Roger Gagen , who is implementing a massive United Nations funded de-mining program in South Sudan . <p> Roger Gagen explained that he was able to implement a generally methodical operation because most conventional military forces tend to have a structured , patterned approach to how they lay out their land mines . <p> As you can imagine , being an unconventional , unstructured rag-tag bunch of hillbillies , the Taliban have no maps showing the lay-out of their IED program . Normally the only person who knows where they are located is the person who planted them in the first place . <p> When I asked Taliban commander Mullah Hossiar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main civilian transport routes , he could not , saying " many fighters who laid the IEDs have been killed and we have no idea where they are . " <p> Ironically , we hear nothing from international non-government organisations , and virtually none are focused on helping local people identify IEDs and remove them . <p> You can bet all of the emeralds in Panjshir Valley that if these had been landmines left by Australian or US forces , we would have heard vociferous cries from human rights groups demanding that something be done . <p> However , one of the most respected organisations in the world , the HALO Trust , which has been clearing landmines in Afghanistan for years , has no program for IEDs . <p> While there will be many challenges beyond the withdrawal of all international forces from Afghanistan , IEDs will tragically claim the lives of even more soldiers and civilians . They will leave a deadly legacy , which will continue to threaten the lives and limbs of local women , children and the Afghan people long after we have all gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 06/11/12 <p> The less bombs after we go , then , I 'd say , the better . <p> And if there is to be a settlement with the Taliban which would amount to a ceasefire and a recognition of some cultural quirks that are not an insult to common man - not to mention women - then to stay and continue fighting would be to our credit . Our enemy should not be able to accept any propositions with the prospect of continuing war not on the table . They do n't eat sugar . Let 's , then , give them what they need . <h> A Concerned Citizen says : <p> 08:45am 06/11/12 <p> I 'd agree- we might as well accept the Taliban are merely waiting for us to leave , the only power we REALLY have is to impose some conditions on our earlier departure ( as a result , we benefit more as we get out sooner ) . Tell the Taliban to remove the IEDs , among a few other demands , and we can get the hell out of there . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan is a huge waste of time , and almost everybody we are apparently ' helping ' does n't deserve our help at all ( not Karzai , not the army , not the opium growers , and none of the millions of fundamentalists ) . The only people worth protecting ( girls getting educated ) we failed to protect as the Taliban managed to get to them under our own guard . <h> Gregg says : <p> 07:38am 06/11/12 <p> " Ironically , we hear nothing from international non-government organisations , and virtually none are focused on helping local people identify IEDs and remove them . " <p> It hardly ought to be a job for locals to do any removing and not even the seeking out for identification . Certainly , it could help for them to be aware and alert but then it is likely that the IEDS are readily observable for if they were , you would think that could happen with the military there now and numbers of blasts would be down . <p> Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia civillians along with people in some African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something that the late Princess Diana supported . Yes , there 's no doubting that Afghanistan is going to be one hell of a place for many decades . <p> An interesting question to put to supporting politicians now and more so than a What If scenario , but put to them " It is expected that on leaving Afghanistan , there will again be much violence with the Taliban seeking to take control and at the very best a civil war conflict . " Question : " As a leader of one of the allies , what level of future engagement with military forces would you support and why ? " Only expect something of a vague , well , of course it 'll depend sort of answer . <h> VJR says : <p> 08:27am 06/11/12 <p> The Americans have spent hundreds of million trying to defeat IEDs with little success judging by the number of soldiers killed or wounded by these devices . Like so many wars in the past unexploded bombs and mines will cause death for many years to come . Best way to avoid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't seen to get any real change by going to war . In the end after we leave the the war lords return and the people in the middle who have suffered the most get nothing . <h> subotic 's name be praised ! says : <p> 09:44am 06/11/12 <p> I 'd give it 5 years after The Coallition of the Willing pull out says we should be able to rock back in and take it all . <p> 5 years is more than enuff time to let the Taliban kill all the region 's female population , ensuring that it would be impossible to regenerate the religious ideology thru the option of birth . Then , with all the Taliban in-fighting , there would n't be a sustainable recruitment option available , coz ai n't no-one being born , rite ? <p> Let ' em kill themselves , we can then rock back in and grab the black gold , and Allah can sort the rest out later .... <h> TheRealDave says : <p> 10:11am 06/11/12 <p> I 'm kinda wondering why you would contrast a figure given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure over 9 months ? Seems a bit incongrous to me ... especially given that the fact that 80% of ALL civilians casualties over the past decade are directly attributable to Taliban/Militia forces . <p> And the threat is not limited to just IEDs placed in the past decade - there are still untold tens of thosands of Soviet era mines scattered all over the place as well . They 'll still be in the ground after 2014 . <h> DBO says : <p> 10:34am 06/11/12 <p> After visiting Vietnam a couple of years ago I was horrified to learn that there are still in excess of 30,000 Australian mines in the area surrounding the old army base at Nui Dat . I would have thought that in latter years the Australian government should have made a humanitarian gesture by attempting to remove as many of these as possible . <h> Robert S McCormick says : <p> 10:42am 06/11/12 <p> Does anyone really imagine that once the foreign troops have left that the Taliban will not take over ? Yes there are Taliban in Pakistan . In all probability they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban in Afghanistan . The vast majority of them will be Afghan Citizens . What is to be done about them ? They ca n't be driven out of their own country . If they could be , where would the go ? Even the puppet President of Afghanistan has called for " All foreign troops to leave " . We are told that Al Qaeda was driven out of Afghanistan years ago . That was the reason given for the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in the first place . To drive Al Qaeda out . If they now want to drive out the Taliban then the chances are they will have to drive out 75% or more of Afghanistan 's own citizens . Surely what is being done in Afghanistan by foreign troops is only putting off the inevitable Evil Day when the Taliban take over again . Is the price of even one more young Australian being killed there worth it ? <h> Swamp Thing says : <p> 01:12pm 06/11/12 <p> Oh what a game it all is . Jason , how does the casualty return for allied troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest ) . Given the operational tempo - how do the dead &; maimed stack up against road deaths in Australia over the same period ? ( again favourably &; they are absolutely ' needless ' ) . I will go out on a limb and say that the number of our troops killed in the ' ghan is quite a bit lower than the number usually killed by various means ( in and out of uniform ) in the same time interval while stationed at home . What used to be called ' ordinary wastage ' in other words . You are right in a sense though - so long as the required ruthlessness &; aggression on our part is lacking ' we ' are wasting time &; resources over there .

Walker says : <p> 03:45pm 06/11/12 <p> Personally I think they need to revert back to their civil war . In fact send all those here home to fight for what they want . How many here keep bagging out the allied forces . Send them home now ! ! They do n't like fighting for their country but are willing to use turmoil in their host countries , you can see why their countries possibly let them go , first class trouble makers . <p> Most living here live as they did back there so they will slip back easily , religious burkas , that they were fighting against are OK here now ? ?

Australians should be thinking only of the Australian soldiers killed for no good reason in that crappy country , whose crappy people ca n't look after their own country . <p> Shame on all Australian politicians who think it 's a good idea for our soldiers to be there at all .

##3331652 <p> Three days after the election and punters will no doubt be biting their nails until the independents strike a deal with Gillard or Abbott to form a government . We 're still holding millions of dollars on the election result , and they could be waiting a week or so to be paid out on a head-to-head bet . <p> What 's clear is that punters who backed a hung parliament at $6.00 will be among the only ones celebrating at this stage . <p> With the wash up then showing about 73 seats in the bag for Labor and as many as 73 for the Coalition , punters did n't take much of a rest after a late night awaiting a result on Saturday . <p> On Sunday morning they came in strongly behind Tony Abbott to seize the Lodge , with Sportingbet immediately taking two bets of $5000 on them at $1.50 and $1.45 . <p> The Coalition saw strong betting throughout the day as punters assumed that that the conservative independents -- Oakeshott , Windsor and Katter -- would line up with the Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking better in Denison , and a distinct possibility in Hasluck , punters headed back toward Labor , who shortened into $2.15 while the Coalition slid to $1.65 -- but not before we took a few more big bets on the Coalition with $26,000 at $1.55 and $10,000 at $1.60 . <p> Right now , the two parties are almost neck and neck with Labor slightly better backed to form government at $1.85 and the Coalition paying $1.90 . <p> The election outcome is in doubt but there were a number of big results in some marginal seats that may have surprised voters and the media , but were called weeks out by punters . <p> A few weeks back we saw odds on a number of Labor seats in NSW and Queensland slide the Coalition 's way despite the government being strongly backed in the head-to-head market . <p> Now it appears punters got it right in Macarthur , Macquarie and -- once again -- in Bennelong , where Labor was hurt when the announcement of the Parramatta-Epping rail link backfired . <p> Punters probably got it most wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the big upset . Liberal Darren Jameson had shortened into $1.20 ahead of polling day following big money coming in behind him , yet lost to Labor 's Deb O'Neill . <p> In Queensland punters again picked a number of seats where Labor would be ejected well out from the poll , including Dawson , Flynn , Leichardt , Longman and Forde . <p> Punters have a habit of getting elections right and this was no exception . <p> Although Labor ran pronounced favourites , in the last 24 hours we saw the Coalition backed from $3.60 to $2.60 and a hung parliament backed from $3.50 to $2.80 showing punters thought it was going to be as close as it has turned out to be . <h> Chaos says : <h> Karen-Maree Kelly says : <p> 11:46am 25/08/10 <p> A shallow Queensland electorate - succumbing to the trickery of Abbott and his cohort 's " two proxy-state elections " is the shocker ! What will eventuate is a failed Abbott minority government being returned to the polls within twelve months . An uncollared , unmuzzled PM Abbott is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' has it been now since we 've heard a single utterance from " The Real Tony ? ! " Oh he is not too far away , and he fully understamds " the supreme challenge of his life " has not been delivered to him via a single ounce of political prowess .

##3331751 <p> The world has either been destroyed or under threat of destruction so many times it has almost lost meaning . This is where debut director Lorene Scafaria , the writer of the hipster rom-com Nick and Norah 's Infinite Playlist , begins in some ways . Devoid of Aerosmith songs or roughnecks trained as astronauts , Scafaria muses on the nature of love and human relationships when they are put under the ultimate strain . Seeking A Friend For the End of the World is a continuation on a theme for Scafaria , although here she does it within the context of the most extreme of time constraints . Her goal is to find that meaning within the apocalypse by taking the most intimate approach possible . <p> Following the announcement that asteroid heading towards Earth is unstoppable , Dodge Petersen 's ( Steve Carell ) wife Linda ( real-life spouse Nancy Carell ) leaves him without a word . While all of Dodge 's friends and colleagues spend their end days indulging in hedonism , including guilt-free sex and drugs , Dodge finds that his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life for his last moments on the planet . After meeting Penny Lockhart ( Keira Knightley ) crying on his fire-escape , unable to return home to the UK to be with her family , Dodge 's life begins to change . They soon embark on a mission across country to find someone with a plane for Penny , while Dodge wants to re-connect with the great lost love of his life . <p> Scafaria 's previous film placed two unlikely companions on the path to romance during an impromptu road trip , and in many ways Seeking A Friend For the End of the World is a variation on this same theme . That there is a predetermined end-point to this saga , one that begins as a gloomy tragedy , only heightens the romance . Scafaria 's script is also incredibly funny , and while it may occasionally fall back on the episodic nature of the road movie , it nevertheless fills its running time with a plethora of great cameos and amusing moments . The most memorable of these is friendly trucker ( William Petersen ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a love-in at a roadside diner featuring well-placed cameos from comedian T.J. Miller and Community ' s Gillian Jacobs . <p> Yet the heart and soul of the film lies with Carell and Knightley , who respectively bring warmth and humanity to this most uplifting of tales . Carell often plays characters who are losers , but just as he did with Crazy , Stupid , Love , he restrains his typical dysfunctional characters and remains true to the script and to the character he is portraying . Knightley stays on the right side of twee , breaking hearts with her fragility and charming with her quirks and pretty amazing record collection . Seeking A Friend For the End of the World might be about the death of all life on Earth , but it will remind you of the beauty of love and the simple pleasures of living . <p> Seeking A Friend For the End of the World was in limited in release in 
##3730151 <h> Thoughts on terrorism , security and human rights , with a focus on Australia . <h> Main menu <h> Post navigation <h> Is there really a right to silence ? <p> The Age reported yesterday that 350 Victorians have been compelled to answer questions about drug trafficking , murder and corruption before a government-appointed Chief Examiner . This little-known body was set up to investigate Melbourne 's gangland killings , and people who refuse to answer questions can face five years in jail . <p> Civil libertarians and legal bodies objected strongly , arguing that the right to silence is one of our most fundamental rights . <p> This had me wondering : is the right to silence a fundamental human right ? Or is it a lesser right , which is ok to override at times ? <p> Put another way , if you have information that can help stop murderers , why should you have the right to keep silent about it ? But also , is it dangerous to give the state the power to coerce information out of you , and what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? <p> This demonstrates the most common argument in favour of the right to silence , which is the protection against incriminating yourself , so that police and prosecutors ca n't coerce or trick you into making a false confession . <p> When pondering this on Twitter , some Tweeps kindly raised a second objection : that arguing the state has the right to coerce information out of people is one step towards justifying torture . <p> However , the right to silence has often been denied without resulting in anything approaching these disaster scenarios . One example is ASIO 's questioning powers , the most controversial coercive questioning powers in this country . <p> Currently , if ASIO believe you have information relevant to a terrorist act , they can detain you for questioning , and threaten you with five years of jail for refusing to answer . However , if they intended to mistreat you or induce a false confession , they would face the following hurdles : <p> - They must get approval from the Attorney-General before questioning you . <p> - They must get further approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge or magistrate from a federal court . <p> - Another independent authority , usually a retired superior court judge , will monitor the entire interrogation . They must ensure you are aware of your right to complain to the Inspector ? General of Intelligence and Security , the Ombudsman and to a police complaints agency . <p> - The interrogation must be videotaped . <p> - You can have a lawyer with you , though it might not be the lawyer of your choice . <p> - Anything you say can not be used in a prosecution against you , though it may influence the direction of an investigation . <p> ( These are detailed in section 34 of the ASIO Act , and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Annual Report . It 's worth remembering that many of these safeguards were not in the original ASIO amendments introduced after 9-11 , and it was the ALP under Crean and Beazley who forced the Howard government to include these protections . ) <p> The ASIO example suggests the right to silence can be overridden while still protecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights can be protected , it is hard to see why the right to silence should be considered a fundamental human right that trumps the need to tackle serious crime . <p> As for Victoria 's Chief Examiner , I 'm not sure if its questioning powers are constrained by as many safeguards as ASIO 's are . Also , it has used its powers much more frequently than ASIO , having coercively questioned 350 people since 2005 , while ASIO has coercively questioned 11 people since 2004-2005 ( judging by its annual reports to Parliament ) . <p> So it would be good to know more about what the Chief Examiner is up to , but it 's unlikely to be very sinister . The Age article points out that the Chief Examiner requires Supreme Court approval before using its special powers , that the Special Investigations Monitor gave it a clean report , and that none of the 350 people coercively questioned lodged a complaint . <p> Lastly , denying the right to silence when investigating serious crimes is not a radical step . Bret Walker SC , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " powers to compel persons to attend and answer questions concerning the suspected wrongdoing of others " are common , and have been used by " bodies such as the Australian Crime Commission , the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , the Australian Securities and Investments Commission , the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Crime Commission . " <p> Given this , my view is that the right to silence is not a fundamental human right . It is a procedural right , which has developed in our legal system for very good reasons , but is not inviolable . It can be justifiably denied in some circumstances , as long

##3735752 <p> GO IF YOU 'RE AFTER : A body like Lara Croft and a long-term plan to get it <p> When the word ' Glamazon ' was dreamed up , former Chadwick 's model Wendy La Roche may have very well been the reference point . At 5 ' 10 and without an inch of fat to spare , the immaculately presented mother of two is equal parts beauty queen and warrior athlete . <p> La Roche is an advocate of holistic training , nutrition and lifestyle reform , and credits her grandmother for introducing her to the importance of organically grown fruit and veggies as a child . A fan of combining resistance , weight and cardio training , La Roche is adamant that women should not be afraid of weight-based training . In combination with cardio , she enthuses that muscle development " will change your body shape and have you looking and feeling fitter , stronger and younger . " <p> Clients in the La Roche stable range from those who have never trained before to those seeking a body sculpting ' stage-ready ' form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme to an individual 's needs and goals . The weak-of-will be warned however , that the dreaded squat thrust manoeuvre that trainers innocently call ' burpees ' are a La Roche favourite and partly because they can be performed just about anywhere . <p> The reformed " skinny fashion model " lists placing first in the amateur fitness category at a New York-based international bodybuilding competition as one of the most exciting moments in her life . " I have seen and been able to achieve some incredible body transformations , " she says . " The first was my own . " <p> GO IF YOU 'RE AFTER : An attitude and discipline realignment , served with a side of grunt <p> This tattooed-and-toned discipline enthusiast is a walking example of not doing things by halves -- and yet it was an accident that propelled Nathan Schrag into the fi tness industry in the first place . Training to be a navy clearance diver in his early military days , his lung collapsed and he was told he would never dive again . Instead , he became a certifi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training School . Now he 's chief bootcamp instructor and high performance coach at Absolute Bootcamp . <p> Having served for ten years in the military , Schrag says the influence it has had on his style is twofold . " On the one hand I was lucky enough to train with our military 's best -- Special Forces -- and learn what it takes to push body and mind to new limits . On the other hand I was tasked with moulding the newest recruits from civilian to military mindset . " <p> You might think that applying the skills and discipline intended for military personnel to the average weekend fitness warrior would be a challenge , but Schrag laughs that notion off . When people seek his help , he points out , they 're paying for the service and are not willing to waste their money . In fact , heaven help you if you waste this man 's time . There is a good reason why the award-winning trainer is known for complete transformations , both physically and emotionally . As he recalls : " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join us . Within five minutes she was crying and telling me quite forcefully , ' I want my money back , I am not doing that anymore . ' I convinced her to stay . That was five years ago and she is still with us today , only now she 's leading the way at each session ... especially boxing . " <p> Pocket rocket Hollie Sheehan may not at first glance look like an imposing fitness force -- until a change of clothes reveals a super hero-like transformation . Give her a pole and a pair of hot pants and she effortlessly demonstrates feats of strength and grace that to the casual observer seem scientifically impossible . <p> Starting dance at just six years old , Sheehan has always followed the philosophy of " healthy body , healthy mind " . Describing pole dancing as " a combination of the two things I love -- strength and dance , " she goes on to explain : " in pole fitness there is a lot more strength , endurance and athleticism . It 's a lot less provocative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> This is far from a hobby for Sheehan . A passionate enthusiast , she has competed at state level in the Miss Pole Victoria competition . Her favourite trick , the ' Iron X ' , sounds a little like a circus tutorial . " Coming from an inverted position using only your arms to hold on , you take your legs out away from the pole whilst holding your body parallel to the floor , extending arms and legs wide in an X shape . " <p> Classes are strength and flexibility based and suitable for any women over 18 . They incorporate a warm up , strength session including training drills , cardio section and cool-down , and there wo n't be a body part left unattended to . <p> Not content with a simple pole ? Perhaps consider attending one of Sheehan 's aerial hoop classes or advanced conditioning sessions . As the woman herself says : " It has proven to be the most effective form of exercise I 've ever done in terms of my fitness level and how my body has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look like the intimidating , muscle-bound trainers you 're used to , but do n't be fooled .

As Michael states , " The element of heat helps facilitate deeper , more rapid change in a person 's physical and emotional state . " <p> The Houghtons ' interest in alternative practices has been long-ranging . At 21 the young Americans joined the Peace Corps . They later volunteered in the Philippines for three years and later pursued their newfound love of travel to Japan and other Asian countries , always experimenting with different types of diet and exercise . They observed that " there were many ways to eat , many ways to observe time and pace of life , many ways to respond to similar aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chiropractor it led to further exploration of the body 's natural healing ability , which in turn inspired the couple , over many years , to study various types of physical exercise . <p> Introduced to the practice of Bikram by a book and cassette tape given to Susan by her sister , the Houghtons began at home , doing what they could with a heater and mirror in their walk-in wardrobe . Ten years later , the pair own a studio and host 40 classes a week that are heavily sought after by students of diverse abilities and ages ranging from ten up to 80 . <p> Adventure trekker , trainer and endurance runner Sam Rowse credits his athletic ability to his mum 's desperation for a bit of peace and quiet . " I had four brothers , " he says , " and we are all very energetic and competitive . In order to run down our batteries Mum encouraged exercise , specifically running and swimming . " <p> The former travel agent and competitive runner was inspired to combine his love of trekking and travel after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned feeling overwhelmed and wanting to share the experience with everyone , " he recalls . <p> Since cofounding Stafford &; Rowse Train and Trek , he 's led many local and overseas treks , listing Mount Rinjani on the island of Lombok in Indonesia as his favourite destination , with its 4,000m active volcano . " Three times I have trekked to the summit while it 's been erupting and while it sounds dangerous it 's truly magnificent at the same time . " <p> Taking clients on guided overseas treks or preparing them to tackle something solo , the Stafford and Rowse crew have helped clients achieve goals as simple as walking to the top of their street right through to tackling the Everest base camp . Rowse and his team offer resistance and strength training in their Sandringham studio to work on the legs , back and core muscles . They also lead two walks a month around Victoria , within easy reach of the city . <p> Faced with a distinct lack of team trekking options close to home , Stafford and Rowse created the local 30/50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option for those who want an accessible team challenge without having to travel overseas .

##3736652 <h> Wine and chestnuts <p> It 's been a bit of a foody weekend . Saturday morning saw Tanya and I explore the markets of Lausanne , which are held every Saturday and every Wednesday . I must admit that in Canberra I often meant to go out to Epic for the Sunday markets , but rarely did ; this reflects badly on me , but also demonstrates one of the reasons why I 'm pleased to to have such easy access to locally grown produce . The markets fill up street upon street of the pedestrian parts of the old town , spilling down from Place du Riponne and into Place de la Palud , two of the central squares , and adding some farm-brought charm to the chic shopping streets . <p> Lausanne 's Saturday markets . <p> Supplies bought , we headed out of town to Lavaux , the wine producing region of terraced vineyards just to the east of Lausanne . The vines go from right up high down to Lac Lman , and although I 'm sure this has been said a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a UNESCO listed area . It 's just so pretty . I took a lot of photos and we wandered through the vines to the little village of Rivaz . It must be harvest season , because there were people picking grapes and the smell of the fruit was thick in the air . <p> The Lavaux wine region . <p> A glass of wine on a terrace with a view . <p> On Sunday we went to the Fte de la Chtaigne -- the Celebration of The Chestnut ! It was held in a town called Fully , which makes for all sorts of great jokes . Really the most surprising thing about the festival was that it was about so much more than just chestnuts . There were chestnuts there to be sure , all being roasted and put into paper bags and enjoyed with wine , but there were also all sorts of other stalls -- leather workers , clogs , bags , bands playing , jewellery , and local produce by the barrow-load . There are so many more types of cured meats than I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bottle of quince liqueur . We were also thwarted not once but twice by a touristic train that promised to take us to see the chestnut farms , but was always full . I suspect a chestnut-related conspiracy . Chestnuts obviously are important here : where everywhere else in Switzerland I have seen nothing but orderly conduct from everyone , the smell of chestnuts in the air sent people into an uncharacteristic frenzy of pushing and shoving at trains , busses and at the stalls themselves . The chestnuts were pretty good though , so I guess I can see why . <p> ... of just about anything else . Tim did a much better job of documenting the day , both in photos and in text ! In the afternoon , we had high hopes of 
##3737052 <h> On Cloud Nine in a Hot Air Balloon on the Gold Coast <p> Early this morning , four of us floated above the Gold Coast in a hot air balloon and we are still feeling high from the incredible experience ! <p> After a scenic drive from our accommodations through the Gold Coast hinterland , we arrived at our launching site in Canungra just after 5am ; our first steps on to the field , we witnessed a spectacular sight -- the sun and our balloon slowly rising together . Our excitement grew as the giant balloon became more inflated with every blast of fire until it was finally full and towering above us . <p> For some perspective , the balloon , which weighs 350kg , stands taller than a ten-storey building and has room in it to hold 350,000 basketballs when inflated . <p> This impressive aircraft is unique in that it has no wings , no seats , no motor and " no good-looking hostesses " , joked one of our entertaining guides , Jason . Perhaps the most fun feature is the balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are at the whim of the natural winds ' speeds and directions . <p> After a short safety briefing , the group of us eagerly piled in to the balloon 's comfortable , padded basket . We were absolutely amazed when the hot air lifted all 15 people , a heavy balloon and 270L of propane off the ground and into the sky with ease ! While the majority of the flight was spent peacefully floating , the balloon ascended surprisingly fast ; in fact , a balloon of that size can ascend at 500f ( 150m ) per minute . <p> Thanks to our launching location having no air traffic control restrictions , we were able to fly high ! Soaring through the skies at heights of over 1300m , we looked down on the clouds and marvelled at stunning views reaching from the coast to the mountain ranges in the Gold Coast hinterland . <p> All parties on board busily pointed out the area 's sights , such as the glimmering ocean in the distance , the peak of Mount Barney , the vast , green farm fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By slowly spinning the balloon in the air , our experienced pilot , Blake , ensured all guests were able to enjoy panoramic views . <p> As we floated above the picturesque countryside , Blake provided with interesting tidbits on some of the region 's features . For example , he explained Bromelton Lagoon , a seemingly small and shallow body of water , was created by a meteorite and is actually 100f ( 30m ) deep . <p> After gaining a gorgeous , new perspective of the Gold Coast on the 45-minute flight , Blake bounced the basket a few times on the ground and safely landed us . But the adventure did not end there ; next , Jason drove us to a charming nearby winery , O'Reilly 's , for a champagne breakfast . <p> While it was still early , we felt it only right to indulge in a glass of champagne for tradition 's sake . After all , when hot air balloons were first invented in the 18th century , they were made of paper and , because of this risky design , pilots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So downed the bubbly we did ! <p> We also dug into a delicious meal while sitting on the porch amidst the beautiful vineyard . We indulged in a continental spread of fresh fruits , hot croissants , cereal and yogurt , followed by a hot breakfast of eggs , bacon , sausages , toast , hash browns and beans . <p> After brekkie , we enjoyed a full wine tasting session , sampling several of O'Reilly 's finest wines . Feeling very relaxed , we took a stroll around the winery 's gorgeous grounds , before returning home -- a splendid way to complete a perfect morning . <p> For any of those interested , we highly recommend Gold Coast hinterland and vineyard ballooning ! Be sure to bring your cameras -- this tour is packed with amazing photo opportunities ! Alternatively , you can order the professional photos the company takes online . <p> Thanks Jason , Blake and the rest of the Hot Air crew for this memorable morning ! Several hours later ,
