Be calm . When you step into a hawker center , you will be at once faced with around 100 food stalls all with a number of signs like this <p> Do n't be intimidated . Take your time until you find something exactly to your liking . Do n't worry , all of it will taste good . <p> Number 2 . Many of the stalls are in fact serving the same thing so it 's not like you have infinite choices . A lot serve either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The popular ones are easy to find because they have long queues . <p> Number 3 . Sit near where you 'll buy food or buy food near where you 'll sit . It 's easy to get lost otherwise . <p> This is a blog by April and Camille . It 's a tip sheet of sorts containing our thoughts on places we 've stayed in and eaten at . We rely a lot on other bloggers and reviewers when we choose a place to try 
##3559651 <h> Donna <p> Part of living in a great city like London is that it has so many beautiful places . You can just about think of a place and I 'm sure you can find that in and around London . One of the favourite place I love shooting in is in and around Tower Bridge/Tower of London . It has great historic buildings and landmarks along with modern buildings . <p> A great benefit to the place is that there are a lot of tourists in the area . Why is it beneficial ? Well , if you 're testing with a new/aspiring model having a bunch of tourists around you puts the model at ease as everyone is taking photos ! It eases them and makes them less self-conscious . Exactly what you need when you 're trying to shoot photos . I believe discomfort is obvious in front of the camera and it would show on the photos . Whereas discomfort of a photographer behind the camera or anyone else involved in the shoot could be cleverly disguised or denied . You just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Donna . She 's been modelling for a few years so that always helps . I met her through a mutual photographer friend who shot her a few years ago . After months of exchanging emails and text we finally set a date , met and worked together . We were helped by the talented Ms Rileen Chua on makeup . As usual , not only was she the makeup artist , she was also my ever willing assistant . One of the things I did on this test shoot which I have n't done so in a long time was to shoot on film . At the time , I only had the Fuji PRO 400H . I would have preferred to have shot it on Kodak Portra . I do use the Fuji quite a lot during Autumn . One of the reasons why I 'm so looking forward to this Autumn . I 'm happy to be shooting on film again . <p> It was a great summer evening . I was getting frustrated with models flaking out and with the Olympics making it harder to book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the Olympics . I did get to watch the only event I wanted to watch ; Beach Volleyball . I also spent some time at the park and got to lunch with the Mayor himself . We had McDs ! <p> I 'm looking forward to working with Donna in the future and also the autumn/winter shoots . It 'd be a challenging few months on location ! Just the 
##3559652 <h> Motivation <p> I 'm another year older . But am I another year wiser ? I 'd like to think so . <p> This past year has been really challenging for me . I had a lot of questions for myself . Should I pick up the camera again ? Should I come back ? What do I want from this ? Do I even need this ? What 's my motivation ? <p> Around this time of the year , I always have these questions . <p> Let me back up a bit and please indulge me on this . It 's my birthday after all . <p> I was born on 30 th October 1980 along with my identical twin brother Mark . I grew up knowing that I had a twin brother , who died just a few days after we were born . I knew since I was little that I had a twin brother . My mother also tricked me by showing me a photo of me when I was about 3 years old next to a mirror and told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , line and sinker ! I knew from the start that I had a twin brother . The fact was n't hidden from me to " save me from the trauma " of having a dead brother ; which I am very thankful for . <p> I grew up always looking for something , something inside me that was gone . I just could n't put my finger on it . I grew up happy ( it 's only recently I turned grumpy ) but I knew something was missing . Do n't get me wrong , it was n't vital for my happiness or wholeness , I 'm just well aware that something is missing . People often say that identical twins have some special connection . Maybe part of me is looking for that connection that does n't exist any more due to Mark 's death . <p> So every year , I have this review . Have I lived enough for Mark and I ? What would he say to me about all those missed opportunities , the wasted time ? Could he have done better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in life , I also tend to ask " Why me ? " . <p> Last year , I went back home to the Philippines and one of my biggest priorities was to find Mark 's grave . <p> Unfortunately , the person that last took me there passed away a few months before I got there . It had been more than 10 years since I was last there . Another unfortunate thing was that Mark was buried in Manila North Cemetery . Let me tell you something about the place , it 's huge and it 's literally filled to the rafters . I saw a high-rise building of graves ! I 'm not kidding ! To make the matters worse , there is a WHOLE COMMUNITY living there ! Imagine going to a neighbourhood where people live side by side to the dead . Surreal . The 4 th unfortunate thing about it was that my surname , dela Cruz is like the Smiths of the Philippines ! Everyone is related to a dela Cruz one way or another ! My forefathers were at it like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The day came to search for Mark so I dragged my cousin Carlo to the cemetery ; I was intent on finding Mark 's grave . To be fair my 83-year-old grandmother gave me a bit of a clue but it was n't enough to pin point the location and the people inside ( the cemetery/community ) were very helpful ( those that were sober anyway ) . I spent 5 hours looking for his grave under the searing tropical sun . I ended up with sunburn on the back of my neck . I was thirsty and tired . But I knew I was close ... I could almost feel his presence , hear his voice call out to me . <p> I found my brother . I somehow felt this connection even though I know that under this grave was just a box of bones . I somehow felt connected , I cried . Asked my cousin to give me a moment with my brothers ( I had another brother , John Andrew , who passed away as a baby too ) . I apologised to my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them about the things I 've done , places I 've been , people I 've met and I 've told them about my family . Things that they never had the chance to experience but I have been blessed to . I was in bits , I was crying in the midst of these graves but it was one of the happiest moments of my life . I knew I was going to find him and I was right . <p> Our first ever " complete " family portrait . <p> So what has this to do with what I want to do on this website , my Facebook page , my Twitter profile and so on ? Motivation ; to do the best that I can do and to be the best of what/who I am . There are people in this world , that I 'm sure would grab opportunities that we , who live in the Western World have in our hands . Do n't waste it . <p> Life is too precious . <p> Do I still ask " why me ? " . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else could 
##3559751 <h> November 26 , 2012 <h> A KOREAN 'S LOVE FOR THE PHILIPPINES <p> This was written years ago from a Korean who has a heart , ripped to shreds for our country . Here is an excerpt from his letter . <p> " My Short Essay About The Philippines . " <p> by Jaeyoun Kim . ( ? ? ? ) <p> Filipinos always complain about the corruption in the Philippines . Do you really think the corruption is the problem of the Philippines ? <p> I do not think so . I strongly believe that the problem is the lack of love for the Philippines <p> Let me first talk about my country , Korea . It might help you understand my point . After the Korean War , South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world . <p> Koreans had to start from scratch because entire country was destroyed after the Korean War , and we had no natural resources . <p> Koreans used to talk about the Philippines , for Filipinos were very rich in Asia . We envy Filipinos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Koreans died of famine . My father &; brother also died because of famine . Korean government was very corrupt and is still very corrupt beyond your imagination , but Korea was able to develop dramatically because Koreans really did their best for the common good with their heart burning with patriotism . <p> Koreans did not work just for themselves but also for their neighborhood and country . <p> Education inspired young men with the spirit of patriotism . <p> 40 years ago , President Park took over the government to reform Korea . He tried to borrow money from other countries , but it was not possible to get a loan and attract a foreign investment because the economic situation of South Korea was so bad . Korea had only three factories . So , President Park sent many mine workers and nurses to Germany so that they could send money to Korea to build a factory . They had to go through horrible experience . <p> In 1964 , President Park Chung-hee visited Germany to borrow money . Hundred of Koreans in Germany came to the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Park . They asked to him , " President , when can we be well off ? That was the only question everyone asked to him . President Park cried with them and promised them that Korea would be well off if everyone works hard for Korea , and the President of Germany got the strong impression on them and lent money to Korea . <p> So , President Park was able to build many factories in Korea . He always asked Koreans to love their country from their heart . <p> Many Korean scientists and engineers in the USA came back to Korea to help developing country because they wanted their country to be well off . Though they received very small salary , they did their best for Korea . They always hoped that their children would live in well off country . <p> My parents always brought me to the places where poor and physically handicapped people live . They wanted me to understand their life and help them . Have you cried for the Philippines ? I have cried for my country several times . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . <p> I have been to the New Bilibid prison . What made me sad in the prison were the prisoners who do not have any love for their country . They go to mass and work for church . They pray everyday . <p> However , they do not love the Philippines . I talked to two prisoners at the maximum-security compound , and both of them said that they would leave the Philippines right after they are released from the prison . They said that they would start a new life in other countries and never come back to the Philippines . <p> Many Koreans have a great love for Korea so that we were able to share our wealth with our neighborhood . The owners of factory and company distributed their profit to their employees fairly so that employees could buy what they needed and saved money for the future and their children . <p> When I was in Korea , I had a very strong faith and wanted to serve in a church . However , when I came to the Philippines , I completely lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many unbelievable situations in the Philippines . Street kids always make me sad , and I see them everyday . <p> The Philippines is the most " religious " country in Asia , they say . But there are too many poor people here . People go to church every Sunday to pray , but nothing has been changed . <p> My parents came to the Philippines last week and saw this situation . They told me that Korea was much poorer than the present Philippines when they were young . They are so sorry that there are so many beggars and street kids . When we went to Pagsanjan , I forced my parents to take a boat because it would be fun . <p> However , they were not happy after taking a boat . They said that they would not take the boat again because they were sympathized the boatmen , for the boatmen were very poor and had a small frame . Most of people just took a boat and enjoyed it . But , my parents did not enjoy it because of love for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was very young told me that if we just go to church without changing ourselves , we are not Christians indeed . Faith should come with action . She added that I have to love Filipinos and do good things for them because all of us are same and have received a great love from God . I want Filipinos to love their neighborhood and country as much as they love God so that the Philippines will be well off . <p> I am sure that love is the keyword , which Filipinos should remember . We can not change the sinful structure at once . It should start from person . Love must start in everybody , in a small scale and have to grow . A lot of things happen if we open up to love . Let 's put away our prejudices and look at our worries with our new eyes . <p> If you have a child , teach them how to love the Philippines .

##3564251 <h> Social Media Capital of the World is The Philippines <p> Who else will it be but The Philippines ! In a recent report from ComScore and 247wallst , the Philippines has been named as the Social Media Capital of the World , ranking the South-East Asian country as the top market for Facebook with 92.9 percent of its online population visiting Facebook.com in February 2011 . Years ago , The Philippines was tagged as the " SMS capital of the world " . <p> At present , the Philippines continues to hold the top spot for Facebook penetration and also ranks highest in share of time spent on social networking properties across the world , making it the most social media-addicted market globally . Of the total time spent online in April 2011 by the Philippines ' online audience , 41.3 percent was spent on social networking sites . Russia and Venezuela followed closely , with a 39.7 percent and 33.2 percent share of time spent on social networking , respectively . <p> Here are data from ComScore : <p> Take note that the numbers were based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% of the 95 million Filipinos are online . So roughly , there are 26.5 million Filipinos actively accessing Facebook . That number is huge ! <p> What would this mean to us Filipinos ? It means that we have this endless love affair with anything technology-related -- be it using a mobile phone or a computer . The good thing about it is , we almost always , turn this craziness into something useful . How many new start-ups and online businesses have risen over the years because of our love for social media ? Many . Maybe in the future this will result into more Filipinos turning tech savvies . And that will be good for the country , wo n't it ? <h> About <p> This is my blog . Call me Eric . Or Ric . Or Ek .

##3570251 <h> BEYONC : THE END OF THE WORLD DESIGN COMPETITION <p> Some think it will be the end of the world , some think it will be the start of a new golden age , and most think it will be nothing more than another winter solstice . <p> Regardless of individual opinion , on 12/21/12 , the famous Mayan calendar will finally come to an end . To us here at Rivalation , if there 's ever been a great time to throw a benefit concert celebrating life on Earth , that time is midnight on December 22nd , 2012 , the very first moment after the close of the Mayan calendar . <p> If there 's ever been a great place to throw a benefit concert celebrating life on Earth , that place is the iconic heart of Mayan civilization , the towering pyramid in Chichen Itza , Mexico , the greatest cultural epicenter in Mayan history . <p> If there 's ever been a great superstar to headline this event , one uniting voice with the power to bring human beings around the world together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise hope about the conservation of our planet , to celebrate the remarkable accomplishments of mankind so far , that superstar is Beyonc . <p> And if there 's ever been a designer to create Beyonc 's outfit for this remarkable event , the outfit that will undoubtedly become part of fashion lore forever , the one outfit that the world will always connect with Beyonc as the dress she wore at the end of the world , with the soaring pyramid of Chichen Itza at her back , with the whole world watching , we think that designer is you ... THE CHALLENGE What if Beyonc was really chosen to perform a concert at the end of the world ? And what if you were really chosen to design the outfits for her and her backup singers ? <p> The seconds would be counting down to midnight ... <p> The dark silhouette of Chichen Itza would be emblazoned against the night sky ... <p> The slow pulse of music would start rising through the crowd ... <p> This , quite literally , would be a once in a lifetime event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert at the Mayan pyramid of Chichen Itza at midnight on December 22nd , 2012 . <p> The whole world would be abuzz about the end of the Mayan calendar . Families from almost every country on the planet would be tuned in to watch the concert , and it would be you who was responsible for creating the outfit that would forever be associated in their minds with this moment . <p> Although the concert at the end of the world is a fictional concept , your challenge is to create stylish outfits for Beyonc and her backup singers , outfits that marry Beyonc 's always courageous and tasteful fashion sense with the **25;5763;TOOLONG theme of the concert . Will you design primitive outfits that match the towering pyramid of Chichen Itza behind them ? Will you design futuristic outfits that celebrate what lies ahead for human beings and our planet ? <p> Will the outfits be conservative and elegant or risqu and dangerous ?

##3831351 <p> To celebrate the 5th year since Bikram Yoga Manila has been established , they are offering free yoga classes to the public at their 2 studios for the whole month of November and December 2010 . They are offering for free their Monday to Friday 8:30/9 am and 4/4:30 pm classes to all first timers to Bikram yoga ( kindly consult our schedule online as we have different schedules at each studio ) . <p> I asked them what first timers mean : " First timers is our term for anyone who has never taken a class at any of our studios .

##3831352 <p> Important Reminder ! Since this is a " green race " , please bring your own hydration equipment . No cups will be provided during the race , but there will be water stations where you can fill up your hydration equipment . <p> solar energy foundation is a holistic organization as documented by the motorcycle diaries shown at gmanews tv channel 11. but given the above average registration fees and hydration issues it is doubtful that this race will muster the needed number of registrants. let us hope that the organizers will tweak the race details to convince most runners to join . <p> @rod : you have a point because a seasoned runner can finish a 10K distance without hydration. how ? load up a 500-ml sports drink before running and you can last the 10K distance . this is what i had been doing during weekends under the condition that the run is for fun and not for PR . <p> mga kaibigan , 10Km lang naman yan . for me as an amateur runner , I can finish this without hydrating my self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrating him/her self unless you finish 10Km in 2 hours ! LOL <p> there is no wrong thing on what i said ? yes it is .. research before you react .. what i just want to imply is that we must know how much would be given to the advocacy .. <p> in milo run alone , if you are running for 10k or higher the registration is 500pesos for the advocacy of giving shoes to public school children . as for me , no problem with the advocacy .. but do you know that in that registration fee/ amount , only ten pesos goes to the advocacy , yes it is .. Php10 from that of Php500 .. now differentiate and balance which is have the edge- the advocacy as the frontline of the run or the business . <p> Just think , analyze and learn ! <p> as you clearly implied " we are entitled to our own opinion " <p> truly I do respect your opinion and i expect you
