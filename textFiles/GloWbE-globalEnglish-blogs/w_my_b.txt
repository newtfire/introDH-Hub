The concept album built on ideas explored by the band in their live shows and earlier recordings , but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member , principal composer , and lyricist Syd Barrett . The Dark Side of the Moon 's themes include conflict , greed , the passage of time and mental illness , the latter partly inspired by Barrett 's deteriorating mental state . <p> ' Baju bundle ' is actually a mixed Malay &; English word .

##3542451 <h> Tuesday , September 25 , 2012 <p> Do not get the impression that these are just another kind of bread rolls , they are not . It has a special ingredient that is tapioca flour , just this flour alone and no other flour to make these bread rolls . When i first came across this recipe , i was very tempted to try . First of all , it is very easy and quick to make , if you get ready all the ingredients , it will just take you around half an hour to get a batch of these done . Secondly , you do nt need to do any kneading , no arms exercise and can ignore your electric mixer for a moment . However , you will need a blender to do the job and the job i 'm referring here is just blend in everything together , blitzzz .. that 's it , pour it into your mini muffin pan or cases and then put it into the oven . Simple , right ? <p> i do not have a mini muffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till 3/4 full <p> puffed up ! <p> As these are made from tapioca flour , it does not have a bread or bun texture . When i had my first bite , it was a little crispy and as i continued eating , i thought it resembles something like a mochi . That chewy texture of a mochi , i also like the flavour here , cheesy and a little salty . I had these together with a bowl of pumpkin soup ( recipe will be shared later ) , the rolls were nice , the soup was delicious and i 'm happy . It was mentioned that these rolls are best to be eaten when it 's warm and not recommended to reheat it . Not to worry , this is also a small recipe , makes around 15 small rolls . <p> optional : you can sprinkle extra cheese on the top and any herbs you like to add . <p> Method : 1 . Preheat oven to 400F/205C . Place egg , milk , oil , tapioca flour and salt in a blender and blend till smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter into your mini muffin pan ( spray lightly with a nonstick spray or oil them first ) , filling each about 3/4 full 2 . Bake for 15-20 minutes until puffed up and golden . Remove from oven and cool for a few minutes before removing them from pan . Serve warm . <p> This is indeed unique and special ! Have not made anything baked with tapioca flour except our local kuih ! And it is so fluffy and springy ! Looks good and sounds delicious with pumpkin soup ! I think that I could finish half a dozen , no problem ! : ) <p> like a cream puff texture ... I would like to try this out too ... easy job : ) I am getting lazier by the day and looking for easy things to do LOL ! Yours definitely looks mouthwatering . I can imagine ... the cheesy flavor in it : ) <p> Wah , I think I will like this Lena . There is this bakery here in Sg that has this mochi bread that is selling like hotcakes ! I must try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be rich ! ! LOL ! *kidding* Mmm .... cheesy , chewy , I like ! <p> i noticed you signed in a different name no more anonymous , officially a dreamer i prefer this , it 's a better nickname dreamer my friend , a good poem composer . <p> i wld like to be a little kay poh chi do you hv a blog , i wld like to see do nt be shy if you do , just tell me all i know is that you come from miri like anything cheesy and also kolo mee finish schooling or up to form three practise kungfu , silat or taichi dreamer a thambi or a tangachi besides writing , what is your hobby sorry sorry , i really very kay poh chi ciao now ! i 'm here giggling crazily soon my boss is going to fire me ! <p> Mmmm ... these look delicious . I love the look of that crisp outside and almost choux-paste-like inside ! I 've never used tapioca flour before , but I 'm going to keep my eye out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding your rolls to the BYOB bread basket this month : ) <h> About Me <p> A bird with frozen wings , that 's me , wishing i could spread my wings more freely , but still the bird can chirp happily , in her kitchen and in front of the TV .

The film company two nights ago celebrated with a big crab banquet . The lead actors led Aarif Rahman ( Lee Chi Ting ) , Terence Yin ( Wan Chi Wai ) and Chin Kar Lok in the celebration . Speaking of his girlfriend Lynn Xiong ( Hung Doi Lam ) ' s sexy calendar shoot , Sing Sing praised Lynn as a super model and was pretty in any shoot . <p> Two nights ago film company boss Bill Kong Chi Keung put in 38,000 for the lucky draw . Ka Fai and Sing Sing also put in 8,000 each . Leung Ka Fai continued to make fun of Sing Sing and girlfriend Lynn 's overseas holiday and joked that he has never been the Maldives . Sing Sing only said that he never said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucky drawing prizes . Ka Fai said , " We walk the beat ! We definitely have several tens of thousands in the pocket ! " Sing Sing immediately praised Ka Fai and joked , " Now this is an elder ! You see how much he is making ! " Sing Sing did not leave until the end and posed for photos with the media and the team . Sing Sing later said that the success of the film required coordination from all aspects . He looked back at LOVE FOR LIFE ( JUI OI ) that he spent all his effort thinking that he would be able to win an award but finally his dream went empty handed . Thus he felt the box office was especially important . Speaking of COLD 's 27 million and was likely to break this year 's Hong Kong film record of 31 million , Sing Sing admitted that he was full of confidence in the film .

" I have been in the Hong Kong film industry for 30 years , I have known and crossed many people and understood each organization 's rules of the game . " He even joked that all of Hong Kong owed his money because some did not go to the movies , some even made counterfeits . Would he consider working on another Shaw film ? He did not directly respond and only said that he would participate in any good Hong Kong film production . As for pursuing the salary , he declined to talk further . " I have a lot of debts to collect . " Last week at Chin Kar Lok 's wedding banquet Ka Fai reportedly kissed a fashion director . He avoided the subject and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> TVB executive Elaine Lok Yi Ling said about Leung Ka Fai 's salary , " No way ! Is it true ? It 's been so long , the check has been issued .

Thanks ! <p> Great to know that my posts were helpful to you in preparing for your Tokyo trip . I stayed at an apartment in Shinjuku . Staying in apartments can have it 's own issues though . There will be no one to assist you and some of the apartments are difficult to locate . So if it 's your first time to Tokyo , i would suggest a hotel or something similar . On the other hand , staying in an apartment gives you a feel of what it 's like to live as a local so if you 'll like to try it

I ca n't wait for next year 's celebration because Carmen promised to be back ! Everyone here please be our witness : D <p> So anyways , it was a mellow and simple dinner among 14 of us . The 14 of us with le moustaches . And I must thank Cindy again for the hard work in preparing the props ! <p> I mean it when I said mellow and simple . Besides the moustache party prop , we had nothing else fancy . Everyone just came with the dress code of " Like A Sir with a hint of mint or blue " and we had catch-up talks , laughs and food together . Just that . It was a relaxed and a nice one since I have n't hang out with the bunch for months . <p> #01 <p> Even the cafe was picked randomly and all the birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work-war with HOMEDEC . I simply searched for " Cozy Cafe in KL " in Google and Namoo On The Park was one of the results that caught my attention . And of course , the first impression of its entrance itself was good enough for me to book the tables there already ! Haha ! <p> #02 And so , it was my first trip to the cafe . I find it really cozy and the environment is very much to my liking too . The food was nice too ! I had bibimbap and most of the others had their signature bibi rice burger . Some had their spicy rice cake and some had their kimchi soup . All was up to standard and no one complained ! Honestly , I do n't mind paying a second visit there for their dessert that I 've missed during this dinner : ) <p> Blogging back to the birthday dinner ... <p> #03 That 's Cindy and I in blue and mint . We did n't dress exactly Like A Sir but we had similar round and cute collars to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> #05 Cindy and Luiz . <p> #06 Bryan and the hipster mermaid , Lie Peh !

If there was a best dress award for the birthday dinner , the winner would probably be Ginny ! : D Cute kan ! And on the side note , my moustache matched me just perfectly in the picture above . Teehee ! <p> #10 The fishball clan and Daryl . <p> #11 The playful ones . <p> #12 The birthday girls again ! And thank you Bryan for the birthday cake . It was quite a surprise to me because I did n't expect anyone from the invitees to bring us a birthday cake ! I thought we would go cake-less this year .

##3825652 <h> MERDEKA , MERDEKA , MERDEKA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> " Right from the moment when I became Prime Minister , my aim , my thinking , my planning and as a matter of fact my whole heart was set on building up a prosperous and happy Malayan society . " Tunku Abdul Rahman <p> Very early in the morning on August 31 , members of the public began to file through the entrance gates of ' Stadium Merdeka ' to witness the Independence ceremony . A large rectangular carpeted dais stood at the center of the stadium . The Rulers , sheltered by yellow silk umbrellas were already in position on the dais . The ' Paramount Ruler ' sat in the centre with the Duke on his right and Tunku on his left . The Duke handed the Constitutional Instrument to Tunku .

Perhaps Tunku Abdul Rahman 's greatest single achievement was in giving Malaysians a sense of pride and nationhood . <p> Often , when the very image of Tunku crosses my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country that I was born to . A country filled with great people , great places , great food and most of all , the sense of patriotism that
