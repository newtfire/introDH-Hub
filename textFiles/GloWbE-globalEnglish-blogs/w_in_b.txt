It was indeed a revolution in technology , and entire world acknowledged it , however the buyer in the market is not impressed , here is why ... <p> For most of the middle class Indians , owning a car is a status symbol , Tata nano does not help in creating a status symbol . The car itself has no issues , it has everything to become a proud owner of , but the Tatas and the media have ruined the image by calling it a car for the poor . It 's a no brainer that the middle class do not want to be categorized as poor or middle class , even if they are one . <p> At the other extreme are Apple products , where the technology being sold is a bit over hyped , and the price for them in some cases can not be justified , but I know many who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The core of Tata Nano 's innovation was in having a vision for a unique car , partnering with SMEs , pushing its engineering staff to " do more with less " and in making the engine more efficient . All these also contributed in achieving a significantly less manufacturing cost -- a first of its kind cost innovation , however sometimes , the most innovative feature of your solution is best kept hidden from your customers . <p> Imagine one of following three scenarios ... <p> 1 ) If Tata had never used the word ' Cheap car ' in any of their communications . If they had simply put this car at par with all other entry level cars , and provide incredible free goodies or discount or best of all - free petrol for years ! They could as well afford to replace the whole car after 5 years ! 2 ) If they would have used their technology advancements to provide C class/ sedan features at hatchback/ entry level prices . You might argue that the purpose of making a car affordable wo n't be achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a concept of - finally a nano ( small ) car has arrived , or having a message " why spend more " instead of " spend less coz your are poor " <p> So how did the low cost airlines pull it off ? Low cost airlines worked because the flights did n't taxi into your garage . No one really had to exhibit their boarding passes . <p> In the already crowded tablet market in India , the Government of India is talking about launching a tablet for $35 for students and maybe $50 for others . Question is -- how are they going to position it ? Hope they do n't launch it as a tablet for the poor man ! <p> The message for corporate innovation leaders is - Technology Innovation must go in hand with Design , Business and Marketing innovation . Market research is not the best way to feel the pulse of your customers , and innovation also needs a cultural touch . <p> In fact , any good marketer will tell you the significance of pricing . Pricing makes a statement every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determine what statement you wish to make with your product . <p> Cost-plus pricing strategy is a poor strategy . Pricing should be driven by customers ' willingness to pay . <p> My last comment is about positioning . It has to do with desirability of the product . Who is your target segment ? If it is two wheeler and rickshaw drivers , then thats what you will need to target . In that case , you are not competing with the average car buyer . How has Nano facilitated this positioning with its communications ? I do not know , but that is something worth looking into . <p> Its a shame that the Tata 's are not able to commercialize their true innovation to the extent they should have . <p> Absolutely right . It is the narrow vision which results in such catastrophes and I will even doubt is technical superiority , there is nothing in it except being cheap . Interesting it is now showcased with another similar product line , <p> " The Tata Nano was an innovation designed to bring affordable cars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industries-owned Goldplus has made an unaffordable car designed to appeal to the masses 
##3392552 <p> What Hair Straightener Will be the Best ? When someone asks for your best straightener a couple of words that come to Cheap GHD New Wave Limited Edition thoughts are " fast , tough , secure and high quality " . These just occur to be the words that precisely describe a tourmaline ceramic straightener which are regarded as the best straighteners on the marketplace because of the combined systems of the two highest quality materials within the beauty industry . Tourmaline is really a natural gemstone that used to be seen in jewellery and decorations but was later on discovered to be an excellent warmth conductor and ideal for straightening hair . <p> They are now pulverized and molded to make extra sleek plates that react negatively when heated . This reaction generates an overpowering amount of negative ions ( more than ceramic and titanium ) which smooth each strand and balance the hair to reveal magnificently gentle and shiny locks . This happens since the unfavorable ions neutralize the chaotic positive ions which are brought on by pollution , excessive warmth and rough natural effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimizes hair straightening time so your hair will be uncovered to warmth for less time which significantly benefits your hair 's well being . <p> When this marvelous gem is mixed with ceramic the results that this hybrid plate has to offer are completely amazing thanks to ceramic 's impeccably sleek surface area which is famous for its equal warmth distribution and consistent temperature ranges . To not mention that ceramic has its personal ionic element that added up to tourmaline 's ionic technology will create the silkiest , smoothest and most vibrant hair which will last longer and look more healthy . Ceramic can also be well-known for its natural far infrared heating which carefully warms and seals every strand from the within out to guard them from harm and to retain natural moisture which gives hair a brilliant glossy shine along with a wholesome appearance . But these extraordinary Cheap GHD Deluxe Midnight Collection Hair Straighteners would not be total without

##3407552 <h> Homeland 2x04 -- New Car Smell <p> Carrie proved herself and her theories in this episode marking one of the most pivotal moments some of us were waiting for to see , Homeland is indeed more intriguing and amazing than ever . In this latest episode , we get to see things getting a lot better for Carrie while a lot worse for Brody . <p> This episode , " New Car Smell " was written by Meredith Stiehm and directed by David Semel . It begins with Saul visiting Estes in order to show Brody 's video confession . They both decides to spy on Brody for now hoping to get some information on what al-Qaeda is planning next . Carrie is back , which is something I was really hoping for and after last week 's episode , I wanted things to get a bit better for her . So no one else in the CIA knows about this plan except for them , cameras are set up every where ( except for Brody 's own house of course ) and his phones are tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes , that is outside of the surveillance areas . A new analyst , Peter Quinn ( Rupert Friend ) is also assigned on Estes ' insistence . Carrie and he sort of take their time to get along , you can see the friction , of course Carrie was n't expecting someone she did n't even heard about taking control of this mission she has everything to do . Things between Brody and Jessica have also reached a point where she literally ca n't stand Brody 's lies after lies and he had to leave the house and " sleep somewhere else . " While dropping off his daughter , she smells something " smoky " in the car which makes Brody a bit nervous , which as you all know is because of what happened in the last episode . Brody leaves his car at the car wash and gets a taxi . One of my favorite moments in this episode came when Carrie meets Brody for the first time since the day he made her go through all that she did . Quinn tells Carrie to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wants him to think that Carrie is back and not only that but she might just be on to something , on to him . Which works because he indeed tries to get as much insight info he can from Carrie and Danes once again holding her emotions and wearing the fake delightful smile and a bit of ease delivers a great performance while Brody is spooked literally . <p> Lauder suddenly shows up at Brody 's house demanding to meet him , Jessica tries calling Brody but he does n't answer as usual . It 's funny how he is needed at the exact moment his ass is on the line somewhere else , this is what happens when you live a double life . But no worries , Mike is always here to rescue Jessica in these kind of situations when Brody is away and he does but while doing so , both him and Lauder agrees on the fact that Brody is n't the same guy that he was before and Lauder still determined that he was working for someone and what happened there , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse for Brody , his daughter is experiencing what looks like teenage love with VP 's son . Both of them have this very sweet moment inside the Washington Monument , you heard it right ! <p> Brody heads to the bar as both Quinn and Carrie are watching his every move , they have cameras installed from the room he is staying in to the exact place where he was going to sit and have a few shots of alcohol to get ready for something he was going to do . After finding that much-needed courage , Brody calls Carrie and invites her to have drinks together wanting to " Bury the Hatchet " . Carrie 's face suddenly changes with both joy that their mission is going ahead and with other mixed feelings because its clear that she is going to face her past , the one that matters to her alongside the one that haunted her . Claire Danes yet again in stunning ways deliver an amazing and subtle performance during the moments where she is talking with Brody . Things seems to be going well as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of why she is back in the game but Carrie holds herself from giving him even the slightest of hint . But Brody plays it smart too and in a very sweet/friendly tone starts talking about her ECT treatment and how difficult it must have been for her both during and after the treatments . Carrie 's face drops immediately , she is confronted by her past once again but this time it was n't the one the mattered to her but it was the bitter one . That exact moment I knew Carrie was going to say that 's it , enough playing let 's get down to business . She is certain that Brody got the hint when she had that moment of anger and she wanted to stay but Quinn and Saul directs her to get back at once . <p> I suddenly started feeling a bit tensed with a feeling of certain thrill as she heads up to confront Brody one last time and possibly blow up the cover . She shows up at his door , Brody 's face lit up by the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cover , revealing all that she knows about Brody and what he did and what he was going to do . Calling him a traitor and a terrorist while revealing the fact that she loved him . This is what I was talking about , I really feel bad for Carrie and all that she 's been through . There was n't one thing , this man completely destroyed her on every level . Carrie has been psychologically damaged by everything that happened but more so by the fact that she developed feelings for the man who was going to blow up the vice president and many other people . You could see here too , when Brody is taken away after Quinn immediately calls up for back up , with hood on his face and a feeling of " I finally did it " , she also had some tears in her eyes . No matter how much good she feels about the man finally being caught , the past that haunted her finally sort of getting a much-needed comfort , she still could n't hide her feelings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered . Brody is now arrested , things are getting much exciting this season and its crazy when you think it 's just the 4th episode and we just might possibly be in for a finale of our life time , I

I have had lengthy conversations with Matthew Mott and am aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Championship games in 2012 ) and the hard work that lies ahead of us , but I am determined to help bring success back to the club . I feel I still have a lot to offer in all formats of the game . " <p> Warwickshire have taken the unusual step of offering overseas player Jeetan Patel a two-year deal . Patel , an off-spinner from New Zealand , was a key member of the Bears ' LV= County Championship winning side , taking 51 wickets . <p> The last overseas player that the club offered a multi-year contract to was Pakistan batsman Younis Khan , who had a change of heart and never arrived , although Warwickshire Director of Cricket Ashley Giles is expecting no such problems with Patel . <p> He said , " ' Jeets ' has been offered a two-year contract and it 's all agreed . Last time we offered a two-year to an overseas player was Younis Khan but I think we have got a bit more comfort with Jeets ! He has n't signed it yet but he likes it here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any problem . It is a position that is crucial to what we are trying to build here and he has been brilliant for us . <p> " Getting him back for another two years will also give us a bit more to time to work with Chris Metters . We had hoped Metts would be a year further on but he got injured so he needs another couple of years . " <p> In sadder news , the club has announced that the former manager of their Under-19 side Hugh Cherry has died . Cherry was manager of their Under-19 team for over 40 years and worked with the likes of captain and 2013 beneficiary Jim Troughton , Ian Westwood and Dominic Ostler . <p> Derbyshire have continued the policy of signing the key members of their LV= County Championship Division Two winning squad on new three-year contracts , with skipper Wayne Madsen the latest of those to do so . <p> Madsen , who was born in South Africa but made his Derbyshire debut in 2009 , will qualify as an England player next season after completing the requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the remainder of his professional cricket career at Derbyshire . <p> " That was one of the things my wife , Kyla , and I thought about before signing this new contract because I will be 31 by the end of it and it would be very hard to move clubs at that kind of age , " he said . " We discussed it but really I have no desire to move clubs . We love it here . Derbyshire is our home and this is where I want to play my cricket . We have such a good thing going at Derbyshire . It has been exciting to be involved in that and I want to play a part in taking it to the next level . " <p> Derbyshire have also confirmed that David Houghton will remain in his role as batting coach for the duration of the 2013 season . The former Zimbabwe captain is widely renowned as one of the best batting coaches on the county circuit , something which Derbyshire Head Coach Karl Krikken was only to aware of . <p> Krikken said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting coach who quite rightly commands a great deal of respect within the game . For our talented young batsmen to once again be able to tap into his experience , knowledge and expertise will be of great benefit to both the individual players and the club as a whole as we embark upon the challenge of Division One cricket . " <p> Former Kent cricketer Tony Pawson has died at the age of 91 . As well as playing 43 first-class matches for the county , Pawson was a member of Great Britain 's 1948 Olympic football squad ; a world champion at fly fishing ; and an amateur footballer with Charlton Athletic . <p> Away from competitive sport , he reached the rank of major during his time in the military where he served in Italy and Tunisia and was also a football and cricket writer for The Observer and chairman of The Cricket Writers ' Club in 1980 and 1981 .

##3439650 <p> New Zealand players may have had a gastro problem or three , but surely they and West Indies have received the best of Sri Lankan hospitality ? For , on Monday , they 'll hope like hell that the hosts beat England . <p> New Zealand have no points so far , and their only entry point is if they beat West Indies and England lose too , to force a three-way tie at two points . If that happens , New Zealand will stand a good chance of making it to the semi-finals : their net run-rate of -0.268 is already better than West Indies ' -0.621 , and not too worse than England 's -0.115 . If it all goes to plan for New Zealand , their own net run-rate will improve , and England 's will take a beating , bridging that gap . <p> Theoretically West Indies can be a part of a three-way tie even if they lose , but their poor net run-rate after the thrashing from Sri Lanka means it does them no good . In theory , West Indies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an England defeat later will give them a clear passage , while it will be a three-way tie with England and Sri Lanka should England win . Again , though , West Indies ' net run-rate is likely to keep them third-best should the hosts lose . <p> So , for both the sides , the endeavour will be to win without worrying too much about the net run-rate and hope Sri Lanka keep up their good form later in the day . However , if only the second match is rained out , it will be bad news for New Zealand and good for West Indies . Neither of them can afford a whole washed-out day . If only the first game is washed out , New Zealand go out , and West Indies will again hope for a Sri Lanka win . <p> Ross Taylor finds himself under pressure not just for his lack of runs , but also his tinkering of the batting order . Monday will provide him one last chance of not only redeeming himself in this tournament , but to get a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> Darren Sammy has n't exactly endeared himself to the West Indies fans with his selections either . At the heart of West Indies ' problems has been a glut of bits-and-pieces allrounders , and not enough specialist bowlers . That was one of the reasons they lost after making 191 against Australia . It did n't help that even those three specialist bowlers against Sri Lanka did n't include Samuel Badree , who helped set up the win against England with four overs for just 20 runs . Sammy 's captaincy , and his place in the side , are under scrutiny at best of times . Only a qualification to the semi-finals will be able to silence those voices , that too temporarily . <p> Team news <p> New Zealand will be hoping for a return to wellness for Jacob Oram , in whose absence Doug Bracewell played against England , and played little part in the match while the contest was alive . Oram spent whole of Saturday unwell and throwing up throughout the day , and New Zealand are hoping it 's a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at any other changes . <p> On Saturday , Pallekele finally showed signs of assistance to spin , with a drier track . The rain has stayed away so far , and hopefully it will for one more day . <p> Stats and trivia <p> When Chris Gayle fell for 2 against Sri Lanka , he had scored fewer than 50 for the first time in five efforts . That is a record he shares with Brendon McCullum . <p> Kieron Pollard has never won been Man of the Match in his 28 T20Is . <p> Quotes <p> " I 'd rather see Brendon McCullum at the top . I do n't think he is quite assured of how he wants to play the game coming in at No. 3 , because if New Zealand lose a wicket , he has to play a slightly different game .

##3439651 <p> Shane Watson has carried Australia in every match of this tournament and has now all but muscled them into the semi-finals with another outstanding all-round performance against South Africa . Watson picked up two wickets to help restrict South Africa and then crunched 70 from 47 balls to set up their successful chase of 147 , as the Australians cruised to victory with 14 balls to spare . <p> The South Africans were lacklustre with the bat and sloppy in the field , and while the result has not yet knocked them out of the tournament , they will need other results to fall their way if they are to progress to the semi-finals . For that to happen , Pakistan would need to lose to both India and Australia , and South Africa would need to beat India and then hope their net run-rate was good enough to sneak them ahead of Pakistan and India . <p> By the same token , the win has not technically confirmed Australia 's place in the semi-finals , but their very strong net run-rate meant that for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Pakistan and South Africa but Australia would also need a disaster in their last match against Pakistan . The way Watson is playing , such an outcome seems about as likely as Simon Taufel being drafted in to Australia 's XI . <p> For the fourth time from Australia 's four games in this World T20 , Watson was Man of the Match . He ended the game on top of the tournament run tally and wicket list . It did n't all go the way of the Australians early in their innings this time around . David Warner was kept quiet and then on 5 had his middle stump knocked back by Morne Morkel when he backed away and tried to release the pressure . Australia were 10 for 1 in the fourth over , and South Africa had a sniff . <p> But Watson batted precisely as he had to . He picked up the first boundary of the innings in the fifth over when he cut viciously for four off Jacques Kallis ' first ball , and then plundered three boundaries off the next over from Morkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before he was really heaving , lifting Robin Peterson over midwicket for six and pulling Wayne Parnell for six to bring up his half-century . <p> By that stage , South Africa could not afford a single mistake , and they made one when Watson , on 52 , skied Peterson and was put down by Parnell running in from long-off . Eventually Watson fell - caught by Parnell at long-off from the bowling of Peterson , oddly enough - but by then he had added another 18 runs and put Australia within sight of victory . <p> Michael Hussey kept the runs coming - a lofted six over wide long-on from the bowling of Parnell was especially impressive - and South Africa could n't find a way to pick up the wickets they needed to slow Australia 's run-rate . They could have had one when Hussey advanced to Peterson and the ball skidded through , but AB de Villiers fumbled what should have been a straightforward stumping . <h> Smart stats <p> Shane Watson has won the most match awards in Twenty20 internationals ( 8 ) . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Watson has done so in 34 matches . <p> The 99-run stand between Watson and Michael Hussey is the highest partnership for Australia against South Africa . It is only the third 99-run stand in all Twenty20 internationals . <p> Xavier Doherty 's 3 for 20 is his best bowling performance in Twenty20 internationals . It is also the best performance by an Australian spinner in Twenty20 internationals . <p> The win is Australia 's fifth against South Africa in nine matches . This was the first meeting between the two teams in the World Twenty20 . <p> Richard Levi , who was out without scoring , has made six single-digit scores in his last seven innings . Overall , Levi averages 25.66 in 11 innings with one century and fifty . <p> There were no more chances and Cameron White brought up the win with six over midwicket off Johan Botha . It was the fifth six of Australia 's innings ; South Africa had managed only two in their disappointing batting display . That they reached 146 for 5 was only through a late flurry from Peterson ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innings as the batsmen struggled to find the boundary . <p> The first six of the innings came in the third over when Hashim Amla drove Xavier Doherty over cover and the second - and last - six did n't arrive until the 19th over when Farhaan Behardien clubbed Pat Cummins over long on . But it was Behardien 's partner Peterson who gave the Australians a slight scare , finding six boundaries during his 32 not out from 19 balls . <p> He was especially creative against Brad Hogg , reverse-sweeping and reverse-pulling for boundaries , and he even produced a reverse off-drive . In fairness , the way the South Africans had batted up until then reversing everything probably was n't a bad ploy . Peterson also picked up three boundaries in the final over , including a lap over his shoulder and away to fine leg off Mitchell Starc as 28 runs came from the last two overs . <p> Behardien finished on 31 not out but he was surprisingly unwilling to go for big strokes , given South Africa still had five wickets in hand . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . <p> Australia 's decision to include Doherty for his first match of the tournament at the expense of the allrounder Daniel Christian , and then to open the bowling with him , paid off immediately after George Bailey sent South Africa in . Richard Levi was bowled from the third ball of the game when he backed away and tried to force Doherty through the off side and the ball skidded through . <p> Doherty struck again in his second over when he tossed the ball up and found some turn off the pitch and Jacques Kallis ( 6 ) edged behind . Amla departed for 17 when he tried to hook Watson and gloved behind , and at 33 for 3 the South Africans were in trouble . JP Duminy and de Villiers steadied somewhat , though without really taking the bowlers on , as they chipped a few runs here and there . <p> But when Bailey brought Doherty back on for another spell he immediately broke the partnership . From the first ball of Doherty 's third over , Duminy ( 30 ) advanced down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball between his legs to allow an easy stumping from Matthew Wade . That was followed by the wicket of de Villiers , who drove to cover off Watson for 21 , and again South Africa were in a spot of bother . <p> They were in much more trouble when Watson was batting . And South Africa left the field knowing that by the end of the day they could be knocked out of the tournament . For now , their fate of Pakistan and India . <p> Brydon Coverdale is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo . He tweets here <p> @Hammond - I disagree . I think you 'll find that most good batsmen would be more than capable of batting without a lid on . I think lids have only really aided the bowling allrounders and tail enders as they are the ones who normally do n't play the short ball convincingly , yet with protection on , it 's a much safer gamble . You do n't make it anywhere near this level as a batsman if you ca n't get inside the line . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a lot more batsmen would allow the shorter stuff through to the keeper . With the shorter formats of the game now , you ca n't allow short stuff to go by , so a lot of players are quite comfortable hooking and would still do so without helmets if they were banned . <p> Also , I 'm pretty certain it 's not a prerequisite to play for England that your birth certificate was produced within their lands ... <p> @Meety- do n't see the humour ? Since when was a births deaths and marriages document funny ? @ScottStevo- I disagree mate players pre covered picthes and helmets had to learn to play the hook properly or get hit . No-one in my time since maybe Lara plays the proper getting the head inside the line hook shot . The do n't really have to because they wear all the right gear . These blokes probably would n't even attempt the shot without a lid . And That is my entire point . Watson would have no idea without a helmet on . <p> @Hammond , There are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly , and again , Watson seems to be one of those who does keep his eye on the ball . There are certainly still b@llsy players out there as well . Do you recall Flynn having his tooth knocked out by Anderson and walking into the blood soaked crease was Ross Taylor . After seeing that and his surroundings , he still stepped inside Anderson and hooked - and well too ... <p> All players wear helmets so techniques have evolved , some good , some bad . The equipment item that really needs looking into is the acutal bats themselves that these guys are using . In the Aus vs WI match that was washed out , guys were getting leading edges whilst trying to hit full deliveries through mid wicket and they were going for six over mid off ... <p> Posted by Hammond on ( October 02 2012 , 11:18 AM GMT ) <p> @Meety- I never even remotely insinuated that I was up there . But is anyone today as good as a McCabe , a Hammond or a Macartney ? Hardly . Not fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England .

If you were any good - you would of played for England by now ! <p> Posted by Hammond on ( October 02 2012 , 02:22 AM GMT ) <p> @ScottStevo- Are you saying you ca n't tell the difference between a proper back foot hook shot and the modern " prop all the way onto the front foot and then transfer the weight when you slog across the line " version ? You tube Rohan Kanhai or Alvin Kallicharran and watch the real thing and compare .

He does not get out to the short stuff &; is quite lethal against it poor technique or not ! @JG2704 on ( October 01 2012 , 12:33 PM GMT ) - sometimes it really it is n't worth explaining the obvious flaws in someones comments .

##3439652 <p> India-Pakistan matches - never mind the tournament context - often tend to be a contest as much of nerves as of cricketing skills . Keeping in with recent times , where India have tended to come out the mentally stronger side , Pakistan 's batsmen tried too hard and imploded to waste a dream start and post the lowest total of the Super Eights stage of this World Twenty20 . Virat Kohli , who had scored 183 in his previous match against Pakistan , then steered the chase of 129 with his eighth fifty-plus score in his last 11 international innings . <p> This was a game where one of two jinxes would be broken . It was India , needing to win this to stay alive , who posted their first Super Eights win in World Twenty20s since 2007 . Pakistan were still without a win over India in any World Cup match . Pakistan were every bit a team with a bogey attached to them . They tried flamboyance with the bat and failed , and did n't show heart to back up their talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the small things well after a nervous start , and were there to accept every opportunity that Pakistan presented . <p> Anxious more than enthusiastic , Pakistan began with 26 runs and five boundaries in the first two overs , but regressed in the coming overs . Some of their batsmen just froze , including captain Mohammad Hafeez who scored 15 off 28 , and they took 6.5 overs to score the next 26 . Pakistan played 53 dot balls against bowling that was steady at best . Add to that two balls they did n't even make India bowl . <p> It might look like a canter looking at the scorecard , but the match had got off to an edgy start . India even looked a little meek and Pakistan tried to intimidate them . Zaheer Khan brought back memories of his first over in the 2003 World Cup final , bowling three wides in his first over here . One of them , nearly a regulation take for the keeper , found its way to the boundary . The first ball Imran Nazeer faced he smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced from the other end , he inside-edged Irfan Pathan for four , but the bowler came back with a trademark lbw in the same over . <p> In the second over , out came the six-or-nothing Shahid Afridi . It was a pair of Pathans opening for India against one of the more celebrated Pathan cricketers , who was full of intent . The first ball : whacked away to long-on , the fourth : thrashed through covers . Even against Zaheer , Afridi kept swinging at everything . MS Dhoni went to the surprise pick , L Balaji , in the fifth over . Balaji began with a slower bouncer that Afridi did n't pick , and then got him caught in the deep with the regulation bouncer in the same over . <p> If this was a pressure match , it showed the most on Pakistan captain Hafeez , playing his 100th consecutive international for Pakistan . He would have had a perfect day had he gone to a shooting range . Almost every shot he played went straight to a fielder . As the dot balls piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singh , whose fitness has recently been questioned . <p> Yuvraj had set the tone for the day early when he dived full length to save four runs off the first legitimate delivery of the match . Now he teased the Pakistan batsmen with his slow tossed-up non-turners . With pressure mounting thanks to Hafeez , Nasir Jamshed was the first to fall , trying to slog-sweep Yuvraj . Dhoni showed he had recovered from his earlier slip as he caught the underside edge cleanly . Kamran Akmal , too , edged Yuvraj in his next over , Dhoni again pouching the sharp chance . Yuvraj would fill in with a direct-hit run-out from point later . <p> Shoaib Malik continued his love of playing India , and added 47 with Umar Akmal , but that was the last bit of fight Pakistan put up . When the time came to step up , R Ashwin 's three remaining overs came in handy , and he got them both caught at deep midwicket . The pressure of the dot balls earlier was too much . <p> All India 's pre-match moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 37 in their six overs , which justified playing only four bowlers . Balaji returned figures of 3 for 22 . For a moment in the chase , though , it seemed it was n't going to be all easy . Pakistan 's new spinner Raza Hasan removed Gautam Gambhir for a duck , but they ran into a Kohli-sized brick wall . <p> Making his comeback , Virender Sehwag played a useful hand too , adding 74 for the second wicket , but it was his partner at the wicket who was the star of the show . It helped that it was Pakistan who were meek now . Attacking men were conspicuous in their absence , and when Kohli edged Afridi through the vacant slip in the ninth over , with the run rate still about a run a ball , the match had completely slipped out of Pakistan 's hands . <p> Kohli remained calm even after Sehwag 's fall , summing up India 's calmness on the big night . <p> Now , what u guys will say about Pak performance today ? ? ? Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrashed Aussies and u can see Fear in their eyes ... The fair of Shameless defeat against PAK ... M.Hussey is the key player who just take his time to get settled and ensure that Aus will make 112 in order to qualify for the Semi Finals ... Hats off to PAK ...

But that is the trueth .. u know great AUS capt , Allan Border told way back 20 yrs ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket match ... if it not luck , what then Vrat is playing on ? ? how many drop chances ... is it true or false ? ? go and see those matches again , but that does not mean Vrat bad player , he is really good talent , but on top of that he is running on luck . Otherwise see what happnd to the Rohit Sharma .. is he not good player ? ? , but whats happning to him ... all going wrong ... lot indian write him off .. so whers is the appreciation for Rohit 's talent .. before u point out other do ur part right mate first . <p> Posted by CricfanAarshi on ( October 02 2012 , 07:28 AM GMT ) <p> India will win , it just has to use some brains if they r playing against the Aussies .. Australia is so far the best ... So , best of luck 2 the Men in Blue ! ! Jai ho ! Will be in total support of the Indians ! ! Also , keep going , Virat ! <p> Posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMT ) <p> @VivtheGreatest ..... i agree with you partially .... the only world class bowler is ajmal , gul to a certain extent .... but pakistan has a good variation of spinners which i do nt think we have ... afridi/hafeez are more than useful ( compared to say yuvraj/sehwag etc ) .... but yeah , they def do nt hve the pace resources that they used to ... its just ok , ppl go overboard saying they hve a great bowling attack ... goes to show perceptions are hard to remove ... <p> Posted by VivtheGreatest on ( October 02 2012 , 03:25 AM GMT ) <p> I do nt know who has propogated the myth that Pakistan have a good bowling attack . Do they think they still have Wasim and Waqar ? ! ! LOL ! The only good bowler in their side is Ajmal , the rest are all mediocre . The likes of Arafat wouldnt get into most other teams . Then they go around calling the Indian bowling ordinary . The fact is the bowling standard of both teams is the same and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' great ' Pakistani bowling seems to be believed by some Indians also without thinking clearly <p> Posted by indiafan76 on ( October 01 2012 , 23:20 PM GMT ) <p> Here is the scenario for India to Qualify : 1 ) Aus win vs Pak : India can qualify by winning against SA or by loosing to SA by not more than 3 runs or with 1-2 balls to spare . This will keep them above SA in NRR and also above Pak assuming Pak did n't loose by less than 2 runs 2 ) Pak win vs Aus : India has to win against SA and have a better win compared to Pakistan 's win by 1 ball or 2 runs . <p> For Pak to qualify , Pak has to win and hope India do n't have a better win . They have almost no chance if they loose . Either Ind or SA will overtake them on NRR very easily . <p> If both India &; Pakistan win their matches , it is unlikely that Aus will loose out on NRR ( Pak has to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be between Ind and Pak on NRR ( Scenario#2 outlined above ) . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( October 01 2012 , 19:46 PM GMT ) <p> india maintain the 100% record that never loose a game agaainst pakistan on t20 world cup.great all round performance by team india.superb batting by kohli and some great bowling by R.Aswin ang Yuvi.chakde india .... <p> Posted by cjscanada on ( October 01 2012 , 19:05 PM GMT ) <p> @TSJ07 , I beg to differ on Harbhajjan . The spell against England is distorting . He is not the bowler he used to be . I do hope and wish him the best . Think Yuvraj , Raina or Sehwag would be better option with the ball . Hope Bhajji proves me wrong . The Englishmen threw their wickets rather than Bhajji earning it . When you compare a performance you would want to see it over at least a 6 to 10 games before proclaiming how good or bad a player is . I like the aggression of Hassan and Dhannanjay better . It is to early to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good prospect . <p> Posted by cjscanada on ( October 01 2012 , 18:53 PM GMT ) <p> @Mazii aaw , I feel so bad for you . Despite the loss I really appreciate the comments from the Pakistani 's . I sincerely hope they qualify for the semi finals . I want the Asian teams to reign.The Pakistani 's are the most candid and fair commentators on cricinfo at the same time passionate . I like Jayawardene and think he is a cool Captai and also the Sri Lankan team . I think they have a very balanced team but I do not understand the negative vibes between the Sri Lankan and Indian fans . I want one of the Asians to lift the cup , preferably India . I would not mind if Pakistan or Sri Lanka lifts it as long as it is an Asian . Sri Lanka are doing really well , so congratulations to their team and Pakistan is a great side , much better than India skill wise but they need to believe in themselves . At the end of the day may the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor they have in their batting . Please , please do not let the Aussie 's brag about this world cup . Good luck to all . <p> Posted by khankijaan on ( October 01 2012 , 18:37 PM GMT ) <p> Congratz Team-india for such a fine performance .. , this was all expected , , 1ce again PAk were unable to break that jinx against Ind in Worldcups ... but the fact remains there that Pak r a very capable side and renowned for bouncing back very quickly ... it was just that the indians had psychological edge over Pak in WC that led them to the 1 sided victory ... but 1 has to admit that indian bowling is certainly not threatening and against a good batting line-up those bowlers r gon na falter again ( as they did badly against aussies ) ... majority of pak fans have bashed Hafeez and co very hard .. but m sure those same ppl r gon na cheer their victory 2morrow ... so keep patience guys

##3444750 <p> Answer : If one gives up one 's free will and fully surrenders to Sri Gurudeva , and then performs bhajana without duplicity under his guidance , one will attain perfection within a single lifetime . <p> Question 2 By what means can one know Sri Bhagavan ? <p> Answer : One will have to hear with faith the katha of Bhagavan coming from the lotus lips of Sri Gurudeva . There is no way to know Sri Bhagavan other than by whole-heartedly surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva . Only a person who does so can know Sri Bhagavan . <p> Question 3 What is the most severe nama-aparadha , or offence to the holy name ? <p> Answer : To consider Srila Gurudeva to be an ordinary human being is the most deadly offence , the most severe nama-aparadha . By maintaining a conception of him as a mere mortal , one can not attain auspiciousness even in billions of births . A person with such a mundane conception of the guru will encounter various types of obstacles in bhakti and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the lotus feet of Sri Guru , nothing can save us from the clutches of harmful association . The jiva is unable to surrender himself at the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva only because he considers Sri Gurudeva to be an ordinary human being . <p> Question 4 What is the function of the acarya ? <p> Answer : The acarya carries the message of Sri Bhagavan . He comes to us to deliver the message of Vaikuntha . One must accept that message of Vaikuntha emanating from the lotus lips of Sri Guru through ears imbued with a service mood . If there is full surrender , then by the mercy of the acarya one can attain everything . No one besides the residents of Vaikuntha can accurately deliver the message of Vaikuntha . To learn about Calcutta , you must hear from one who has seen Calcutta . Only then can you receive true information about Calcutta . <p> Question 5 What is the real meaning of sannyasa ? <p> Answer : Performing uninterrupted bhajana of Hari is indeed real sannyasa . The sannyasa , or renunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense enjoyment ( bhukti ) and liberation ( mukti ) . The devotees renounce the desire for sense enjoyment and liberation , and take shelter of the lotus feet of Bhakti-devi . <p> Question 6 What is the function of the sadhu ? <p> Answer : The function of the sadhu is to remain in touch with the Absolute Truth twenty-four hours a day . By association with such a living source , or living sadhu , and by hearing hari-katha from him , one will inevitably develop faith in Bhagavan and one 's service attitude will also awaken . Indeed , one has to associate with a sadhu to become a sadhu . If we associate with a sadhu by surrendering to him , then , without a doubt , anything that is a hindrance will be eradicated . Indeed , the function of the sadhu is to remove the fear and anxiety of those who take shelter of him or associate with him , and to bring them happiness . <p> The association of a sadhu is likened to the action of a battery . The function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are averse to Bhagavan , inclined towards Him . This alone is real compassion upon the living entity ( jive-daya ) . One 's eternal auspiciousness is inevitable if one takes sadhu-sanga thoroughly . The sole indication that a person has accepted thorough sadhu-sanga is that he will hear the katha of the sadhu with submission and surrender to him , and pass his life accordingly , immersed in devotional service . The activity of the sadhu is to deliver conditioned souls like us from the clutches of maya . <p> Question 7 What kind of perspective should we accept to assure our auspiciousness ? <p> Answer : If we can see the whole universe as engaged in the service of Sri Bhagavan , then we will never experience any distress . <p> We must hear katha about how to serve Bhagavan from one who can show us Bhagavan and who is engaged in service to Him twenty-four hours a day . This is the only way to attain our eternal , spiritual well-being . With their eyes of devotion , the sadhus who are bhaktas , or devotees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the association and mercy of such sadhus , we also can see Bhagavan in our hearts . <p> We will constantly busy ourselves in service to Bhagavan without wasting even a single moment . We have to serve , remaining exclusively in the association of sadhus . By constantly remaining in such sadhu-sanga , our aptitude for service will continuously be enhanced . <p> Bhagavan fulfils every desire of His surrendered bhaktas without fail , and He never rejects them ? ? krsna sei satya kare , yei mage bhrtya Sri Caitanya-caritamrta , Madhya-lila , 15.166 . Only Sri Bhagavan has the ability to protect us by giving us shelter . Other than He , no one else has such power . With such resolute faith , we can become free from fear and anxiety , and become happy and successful . Krsna is the embodiment of auspiciousness ; and therefore if we have complete faith in His nature to bestow auspiciousness , we will certainly attain such auspiciousness . Words can not express the kind of great auspiciousness that is obtained by surrendering fully at the lotus feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sri-vigraha ) Bhagavan Himself ? <p> Answer : Of course . The deity of Krsna is Krsna Himself : " pratima naha tumi , saksat vrajendra-nandana ? ? You are not a statue ; You are directly the son of Nanda Maharaja " Sri Caitanya-caritamrta , Madhya-lila , 5.96 . The deity is the worshipable incarnation of Bhagavan . The lord ( ista-deva ) of the sadhu 's heart manifests externally as the deity . <p> Question 9 Where does a person find his guru ? <p> Answer : Whoever Sri Krsna , the embodiment of compassion , chooses to send to you as your guru , that person alone will manifest before you externally as the mahanta-guru , the guru in the form of the foremost living sadhu . By the mercy of Bhagavan we will obtain a guru , and by the mercy of the guru we can attain Bhagavan . <p> A person will get a guru according to his particular destiny . People of different types vary in their disposition , and therefore Bhagavan , who is omniscient , sends them each a particular type of guru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of Bhagavan , and who depend entirely on Bhagavan for their eternal welfare . Being pleased with such simple-hearted , sincere persons , Bhagavan Himself manifests before them as the guru , to bestow mercy upon them . But for those who want kapata-krpa , the deceptive mercy of Bhagavan , Bhagavan 's maya , or external potency , will send them a ? ? guru ' according to the particular disposition of their heart . <p> There is no impediment for one who is sincere . He will very quickly meet a bona fide guru . <p> Translated from Srila Prabhupadera Upadesamrta by the Rays of The Harmonist team , and 
##3444751 <p> Yudhishthira Maharaj said , " Oh Madhusudana , Oh killer of the Madhu demon , what is the name of the Ekadasi that occurs during the dark fortnight ( krishna paksha ) of the month of Ashwina ( September-October ) ? Please describe its glories to me . " <p> The Supreme Personality of Godhead , Lord Sri Krishna then replied , " This Holy day is called Indira Ekadasi . If a person fasts on this day , all his sins are eradicated and his forefathers who have fallen into hell are liberated . Oh best of kings , one who simply hears about this sacred Ekadasi achieves the great merit earned by performing a horse sacrifice . <p> " In the Satya-yuga there lived a king named Indrasena , who was so powerful that he destroyed all his enemies . His kingdom was called Mahishmati-puri . The glorious and highly religious King Indrasena took good care of his subjects , and therefore he was rich in gold , grains , sons , and grandsons . He was greatly devoted to Lord Sri Vishnu as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? Govinda ! Govinda ! ' In this way King Indrasena systematically dedicated himself to pure spiritual life and spent much time meditating on the Absolute Truth . <p> " One day , as King Indrasena happily and peacefully presided over his assembly , the perfect orator , Sri Narada Muni , was seen descending . White as a conch , shining like the moon , like a jasmine flower , like a lightening bolt , Narada Muni descending from the sky . He is decorated with matted locks of reddish hair . The king offered Devarishi Narada , the saint among the devas ( demigods ) , great respect by greeting him with joined palms , inviting him into the palace , offering him a comfortable seat , washing his feet , and speaking sweat words of welcome . Then Narada Muni said to Maharaj Indrasena , ? ? Oh king , are the seven limbs of your kingdom prospering ? <p> The seven limbs of a king 's domain being ; the king 's well being himself , his ministers , his treasury , his military forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kingdom , and the needs of the king 's subjects . <p> Is your mind absorbed in thinking of how you can properly perform your occupational duty ? Are you becoming more and more devoted and dedicated to the service of the Supreme Lord , Sri Vishnu ? <p> " The king replied , ? ? By your kind grace , Oh greatest of sages , everything is quite well . Today , just by your presence all the sacrifices in my kingdom are successful ! Please show me mercy and explain the reason for your kind visit here . ' <p> " Sri Narada , the sage among the devas , then said , ? ? Oh lion among kings , listen to my astonishing words . When I descended from Brahmaloka to Yamaloka , Lord Yamaraja praised me very graciously and offered me an excellent seat . As I glorified his truthfulness and wonderful service to the Supreme Lord , I noticed your father in Yamaraja 's assembly . Though he had been very religious , because he broke an Ekadasi fast prematurely , he had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . He said , " In Mahishmati lives a king named Indrasena . Please tell him about my situation here - that because of my past sinful deeds I have somehow been forced to reside in Yamaraja 's kingdom . Please give him this message from me : ? ? Oh son , kindly observe the coming Indira Ekadasi and give much in charity so I can go upward to heaven . ' " <p> Philosophically we can understand that very living entity is an individual , and individually everyone has to practice Krishna consciousness to traverse back to home , back to Godhead . As stated in Garuda Purana , someone who is suffering in hell can not practice Krishna consciousness , because this requires some mental peace , which the reactionary tortures of hell make impossible . If a relative of a sinner suffering in hell gives some charity in the name of the sinner , he can leave hell and enter the heavenly planets . But if the sinner 's relative observes this Ekadasi fast for his suffering kinsman , the kinsman goes directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahma-vaivarta Puranam . <p> " Narada continued , ? ? Just to deliver this message , Oh king , have I come to you . You should help your father by observing the fast of Indira Ekadasi . By the merit you gain , your father will go to heaven . ' <p> " King Indrasena asked , ? ? Oh great Naradji , please be merciful and tell me specifically how to observe a fast on Indira Ekadasi , and also tell me during what month and on what day it occurs . ' <p> " Narada Muni replied , ? ? Oh king , please listen as I describe to you the full process of observing the Indira Ekadasi . This Ekadasi occurs during the dark fortnight of the month of Ashwina . On the Dashami tithi , the day before Ekadasi , rise early in the morning , take bath , and then do some service for God with full faith . At noon , bathe again in running water and then offer oblations to your forefathers with faith and devotion . Be sure not to eat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . <p> " When you awaken on Ekadasi morning , cleanse your mouth and teeth thoroughly and then with deep devotion for the Lord take this sacred vow : ? ? Today I shall fast completely and give up all kinds of sense enjoyment . Oh lotus-eyed Supreme Personality of Godhead , Oh infallible one , please give me shelter at Your lotus feet . " At noon , stand before the sacred form of the Sri Shaligram Shila and worship Him faithfully , following all the rules and regulations ; then offer oblations of ghee into the sacred fire , and tarpana directed to help your forefathers . Next , feed qualified Brahmins ( obviously non-grain prasadams ) and offer them some charity according to your means . Now take the food pandas you offered to your forefathers , smell it , and then offer it to a cow . Next , worship Lord Hrishikesha with incense and flowers , and finally , remain awake all night near the Deity of Lord Sri Keshava . <p> " Early in the morning of the next day , Dvadasi tithi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotees to a sumptuous feast . Then feed you relatives , and finally take your meal in silence . Oh king , if you strictly observe a fast on Indira Ekadasi in this way , with controlled senses , your father will surely be elevated to the abode of lord Vishnu . ' After saying this , Devarishi Narada immediately disappeared from the scene to bless someone else with his presence . <p> " King Indrasena followed the great saint 's instructions perfectly , observing the fast in the association of his relatives and servants . As he broke his fast on the Dvadasi tithi , flowers fell from the sky . The merit that Indrasena maharaj earned by observing this fast released his father from the kingdom of Yamaraja and caused him to attain a completely spiritual body . Indeed , Indrasena saw him rising to the abode of Lord Hari on the back of Garuda Vahan . Indrasena himself was able to rule his kingdom without any obstacles , and in time when he handed over the kingdom to his son he also went to the spiritual realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of the Indira Ekadasi , which occurs during the dark fortnight of the month of Ashwina . Whoever hears or reads this narration certainly enjoys life in this world , is freed of all reactions to his past sins , and at the time of death returns home , back to Godhead , where he lives eternally . " <p> Thus ends the narration of the glories of Ashwina-krishna Ekadasi , or Indira Ekadasi , taken from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana . <p> These stories have been summarised and slightly changed or abbreviated from how they are found in the celebrated book , " Ekadasi : The Day of Lord Hari " 1986 .

##3444752 <p> The position taken by Radhe Shyama das is philosophically based on the premise that Radhanath Swami is one of the topmost Acaryas in our guru-parampara . I have written many articles in the past regarding the exalted position of these personalities -- our Sampradaya Acaryas -- of whom there are only 32 going back to the time of Lord Brahma . The followers of Radhanath are trying to defend his position by presenting examples of how such Acaryas made changes according to the time , place and circumstances present during their lilas . They suggest that the changes Radhanath Swami is making are comparative to these great Acaryas . Of course , the changes that these Acaryas introduced in order to preach according to time , place and circumstance are not completely verifiable , i.e. , in most cases , the detailed circumstances have not been recorded . Therefore it is very difficult , if not impossible , to make such comparisons . <p> Aside from that , our topmost Sampradaya Acaryas are the only ones who are really qualified to make changes to the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this is the issue that the followers of Radhanath Swami are attempting to reconcile . They believe him to be an absolutely pure devotee , and therefore capable of seeing what would please the previous Acaryas , thus ultimately pleasing Krsna . They believe that he is authorized to do what he is doing . <p> Radhanath 's followers refer to him as " His Holiness " , as a Swami and Guru in ISKCON , but at the same time they are presenting him like a successor Sampradaya Acarya -- the next in line . Yet when we study Radhanath 's preaching , we see that he is not following in the footsteps of the previous Acarya . Srila Prabhupada made some slight changes , as noted in Radhe Shyama 's article , in the sense that he engaged the services of Vaisnavas who are in women 's bodies and he allowed them to participate in a capacity that was previously forbidden in Indian culture , or the culture that previous Acaryas found themselves preaching into . But this is practically the only substantive thing one can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prabhupada was extremely conservative in the sense that he did not change . He did n't change the dress even though , as he said , many people were suggesting that he wear ' coat , pant , hat ' . He did n't call his society ' God Consciousness ' but rather a society for ' Krishna Consciousness ' , and he did n't make a lot of other changes that other sadhus from India saw fit to do . Not only did he stick to the traditional programs , but he insisted that his followers do so as well . <p> Ultimately , the most important aspect of Srila Prabhupada 's following in the footsteps of his Sampradaya Acarya Guru was that he had the same preaching mood -- the same preaching mood that is found in the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam . Telling the truth as it is , and not flinching , compromising or deviating -- which is the essence of what Radhanath has done . And that 's the main criticism about Radhanath -- that he has changed the mood set down by the Acaryas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strayed from the actual siddhanta . <p> My question is , why is n't Radhanath Swami just leaving ISKCON , which is the preaching mission of HDG A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada ? Srila Prabhupada , just like Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati and other great Acaryas , started his own movement . Why is n't Radhanath starting his own mission ? If he wants to alter to the degree that he 's doing the preaching , the mood , and ultimately the siddhanta presented by Srila Prabhupada , then he should have the courage and conviction to step outside on his own , and leave ISKCON . <p> If one considers Radhanath from historical memory , they will see that in the past , he followed his siksa guru , Kirtanananda , out of ISKCON . He followed him into the new version of Krsna consciousness that Kirtanananda introduced , which happens to be very similar to the direction that Radhanath is taking his own followers today . <p> Those who have the personal experience of being involved in Srila Prabhupada 's lila and directly afterwards for the next ten years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his New Vrindaban , will be able to draw many parallels to what is happening with Radhanath today . When you read Radhanath 's Journey Home book , you 'll see that he did n't take initiation from Srila Prabhupada when he personally met Prabhupada in India . Instead , Radhanath returned to America , went to Kirtanananda 's New Vrindaban , and was ' adopted ' as a siksa disciple by Kirtanananda . He spent the early part of his devotional career in that relationship with Kirtanananda , although of course , that is not made clear in Journey Home . Nonetheless , this was the most significant influence on Radhanath . He adopted the mood , and even the philosophy of Kirtanananda , and continues to manifest it to this very day . <p> I 've written a number of articles on the theme , ' Princes of the Zonal Acaryas ' . These Zonal Acaryas heavily influenced their siksa disciples , and in some cases , like Radhanath , these siksa disciples are now Zonal Acaryas in their own right . If you study the character , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Radhanath , but many others -- you 'll see how closely similar they are to their siksa gurus , the Zonal Acarya kings . And essentially all these kings have fallen down ; only Jayapataka Swami remains . <p> ISKCON and the GBC saw fit to ostracize , and in fact threw out New Vrindaban in the 1980 's , and Kirtanananda and Radhanath remained outside the movement for many years . Eventually , after some backroom deal making and negotiations , they were permitted to come back into the ISKCON fold . I personally think this was a big mistake on the part of the GBC . They brought back not only Kirtanananda , but all the people surrounding him , like Radhanath , Kuladri and Umapati . Bhakti Tirtha was part of that group , as were Devamrta and Malati . <p> The impact of the inter-weaving of Kirtanananda 's philosophy with Srila Prabhupada 's pure mood and mission has diluted and contaminated ISKCON ever since . What amazes me is that Radhanath 's core supporters -- the people who are coming up with the money to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes Radhanath very powerful ? he is reportedly worth many millions today . But instead of going to support Srila Prabhupada 's preaching mission , this money is going to support Radhanath 's mood and preaching , which follows Kirtanananda 's far more than it follows Srila Prabhupada 's . The fact is that Radhanath is simply not part of our Sampradaya . That 's the way I 'm seeing it , and there are many other devotees seeing it also . Whether or not HH Bhakti Vikasa Swami is seeing it in those terms , I do n't know , although he has certainly identified many of the symptoms of this reality . And it is in response to his no-nonsense preaching on the matter that Radhe Shyama wrote his defense of Radhanath Swami . <p> It amazes me that Radhanath 's followers , many who are of Indian origin , have so casually taken up his cause . Part of their own Indian culture is comprised of the practice , especially among the higher castes , to arrange the marriages between their sons and daughters . Not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very carefully . The families conduct a great deal of research into the family backgrounds of the couples , going back generations . They study carefully the potential compatibility when matching the marriage candidates . If one applies the same rigorous methodology to studying who is a qualified guru in our Sampradaya , and if one follows the history of Radhanath and his close association with Kirtanananda and the whole influence of New Vrindaban , one will see that Radhanath does not qualify at all in the same way that a real Sampradaya Acarya is qualified from birth , born and raised in a very auspicious Vaisnava family . <p> Marriage lasts throughout the couple 's lifetime , but one 's relationship with the diksa guru is eternal . Yet the followers of Radhanath put precious little effort into finding out who this personality is , and what his past is . <p> As I 've said , the early impressions that were implanted in Radhanath as a new devotee were done primarily by Kirtanananda . It 's very interesting when you read his Journey Home book to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior gurus who are not even Vaisnavas . He makes them out to be such important influences in his life ? but completely neglects to mention the fact that the primary influence for many decades was his very close companion and associate , his siksa guru Kirtanananda . <p> So if you take all these known facts and then witness what is taking place today , how is it that you can come to the conclusion that Radhanath Swami is so highly qualified , so spiritually advanced as to be compared to our Sampradaya Acaryas ? And of course , that 's exactly the explanation coming out of Radhanath 's program -- that he 's so advanced , he 's essentially a Sampradaya Acarya . This is the essence of Radhe Shyama 's defense . <p> In fact , ' regular gurus ' are not authorized to do the things Radhanath is doing . They are supposed to very strictly follow in the footsteps of the Sampradaya Acaryas , the topmost Acaryas in the guru-parampara , and particularly the most recent Acarya . But Radhanath is being touted as someone far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is represented by his followers as being essentially on the level of Srila Prabhupada and his predecessor Sampradaya Acaryas . <p> Radhanath is still in Srila Prabhupada 's preaching mission . If he was doing all these things outside the preaching mission of Prabhupada , then there would be no room for criticism . But ISKCON and the GBC have thus far not had the gumption , the conviction to take proper action , and Radhanath continues to promote his own preaching program from within ISKCON . Radhanath 's program is not Srila Prabhupada 's , and it is spawning a whole generation of thousands of followers who will likewise not be following Srila Prabhupada . All this , under the ISKCON banner with the blessings of the GBC . <p> So this is the circumstance the movement finds itself in , and that ultimately individual devotees are facing . You have to make a choice , and the ultimate choice is , do you believe that Radhanath is a pure devotee on the same level as the Sampradaya Acaryas ? Do you think he 's qualified to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think he is spiritually qualified to make these huge changes in the mood and the preaching style , and given his propensity for associating with Mayavadis , ultimately in the siddhanta ? <p> Obviously , I do n't agree that he is on this level . Ultimately , it 's an individual 's choice . Many devotees see the so-called successes that individuals such as Radhanath have made in terms of followers , accumulated money , temples and so on , but that alone is a meaningless measure . There are many Mayavadis who have been tremendously successful in accumulating money and followers . We also have Shankaracarya and Lord Buddha just within the Indian tradition , what to speak of other spiritual traditions . <p> In the past , when Kirtanananda and New Vrindaban were seemingly flourishing , you found the same mood in ISKCON that we have today : no one could criticize Kirtanananda . No matter how obvious the deviations , you could not speak against him . Today , the same mood prevails in ISKCON . Radhanath has taken up the mantle , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who support him , and those who see the deviations . Some thought that Kirtanananda was a pure devotee , and they pointed to all his successes as proof . They pointed to his supposed strictness in sadhana , but look at where that led ... So today , Radhanath 's branch grows from the Kirtanananda tree , and the polarization grows . <p> I continue to be very surprised and disappointed at how many of my Godbrothers , Godsisters and their offspring are following this pied piper . He is leading them into a realm where they 're not connected to the Sampradaya , therefore they 're

##3459052 <h> 0 <p> Because cooking takes so many nutrients and vitamins OUT of food , you automatically start feeding your body what it needs when you stop cooking food and start eating uncooked , nutrient-rich foods . A raw carrot has exponentially more nutrition than a cooked carrot . <p> Cooking also alters the chemistry of foods , often making them harder to digest . Why do we have so many digestive problems in this country ? Because we 're putting foods into our bodies in a form that we were n't designed to absorb . High fiber , high water content fresh produce abolishes constipation of the bowels , cells and circulatory system . Obstructions are cleared and blood flow increases to each and every cell in the body . Enhanced blood flow is significant for two reasons : as mentioned above , blood delivers nutrients and oxygen to living cells , and carries away their toxic metabolites . <p> Obesity is endemic in this country . The diet industry is more profitable than the oil companies . Why ? Because the way we eat and prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us that we overeat because our souls are hungry . But in reality , our bodies are hungry , even though we may feel full . When you start giving your body the nutrients it craves , overeating will cease . <p> Eating raw foods is a boost to your metabolism as well . It takes a little more energy to digest raw foods , but it 's a healthy process . Rather than spending energy to rid itself of toxins produced by cooking food , the body uses its energy to feed every cell , sending vitamins , fluids , enzymes and oxygen to make your body the efficient machine it was intended to be . <p> You 'll naturally stop overeating , because your body and brain will no longer be starving for the nutrients they need .
