##3668052 <p> A fresh cleansing could be a wonderful means to cleanse your intestinal system . By focusing on consuming simply raw foods for a duration of 7-10 days , you may be able to recharge your whole system . <p> Numerous individuals find that they experience an energy boost from consuming an uncooked food diet . Some individuals state feeling " cleaner " or even more alive spiritually . In addition , it commonly aids with digestive system issues . There could be side results . Check out more weekly detox diet plans on BestFatBurnersDiary.com . <p> If you are someone who eats healthy and balanced all of the moment , you should not suffer a lot of cleansing signs . Nonetheless , many of us have not adhered to a healthy and balanced consuming strategy all of our lives and we do have some toxins kept . <p> If you have had a very undesirable eating plan until now , or have been consuming terribly recently , you could have to deal with " cleansing flu " or other signs . In this post we will consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to you start . <p> Why do we suffer from adverse effects on an uncooked cleansing or other cleansing eating plan ? <p> Some specialists say that when we ingest a great deal of toxins along with our food , the body could not refine and excrete them all . For protection , it stores them , commonly in a preventive fat cell . When you start a detoxification eating plan , it 's as if the body thinks , " Way to go ! Presently we could unload all of those kept toxins ! " So it pours them out in to the blood stream for processing by the liver and additional body organs . <p> One of the most typical adverse effects of an uncooked cleansing ( or any cleanse ) is headache . Commonly these are created by high levels of caffeine withdrawal . If you are used to having a great deal of coffee or other high levels of caffeine drinks ( consisting of cola ) then you are most likely to experience frustrations when you quit . Also quitting 3 mugs of coffee a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high levels of caffeine withdrawal could be annoying and you undoubtedly would like to avoid them . But you will not would like to take pain pills during your raw cleansing . So what is the solution ? <p> The most effective point to do is to reduce your high levels of caffeine usage little by little prior to beginning a detoxification , until you hit the point where you are having simply 1-2 mugs a day . Then start your raw cleansing and you should have no caffeine-related frustrations . <p> If you do n't would like to do this since you would like to start your raw cleansing without delay , then you may have to drink some coffee during the time of your detoxification eating plan . This means that it will not be a 100% raw cleansing , but maybe that 's not so essential . You will would like to avoid adding pasteurized milk , sugar and sugar substitutes to your coffee , since these are not raw ingredients . <p> Other typical adverse effects of an uncooked cleansing consist of tiredness , digestive system upsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system or just by the unexpected modification of food . <p> Provided these signs are simply an adverse effect of your raw cleansing , they will not be unsafe . If you are concerned regarding the intensity of your adverse effect signs , you may easily finish them by adding some cooked or prepped foods to your eating plan at one meal each day . This will lower the power of your raw food , and it may make it much more relaxed for you . <p> If you are feeling extremely worn out , ask yourself whether you are consuming sufficient , and think of adding even more higher fat raw foods like banana , nuts and avocado . ( Try a banana and avocado smoothie with raw cacao powder -- it 's delicious ! ) If you are yearning salty foods , go for foods that are naturally higher in sodium , like celery . <p> Of course , if you have any health problems you should be sure to speak to with your physician prior to 
##3668852 <h> Jews and Plantation Slavery in the Caribbean <p> Two Sundays ago , when I visited the Shaare Shalom synagogue for the Kingston on the Edge ( KOTE ) concert , ' Music Is Sacred ' , I got a grand tour of the Museum of Jamaican Jewish history that is located next door . My distinguished guide was Mr Ainsley Henriques , leader of the Jewish community in Jamaica . <p> The exhibits tell a captivating story of triumphant survival in exile . The display of sacred objects and cultural artefacts was supplemented by Ainsley 's informative commentary . He 's a historian and genealogist with a passion for heritage preservation . In fact , he 's the current chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Jamaica National Heritage Trust . <p> Schroeter Watercolour of Richmond Estate , 1800 <p> I was somewhat surprised to see that the museum did n't tell the whole story of Jewish history in Jamaica . The role of Jews in plantation slavery is not documented at all . This silence is troubling especially since so many students visit the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Jamaican , not just Jewish , history . <p> The reconsidering and upfull revisioning that Burning Spear advocates can be applied as well to the many other partial histories we 've inherited . Especially this year , as we celebrate 50 years of Independence , we must acknowledge Burning Spear 's challenge to set the record straight . <p> Songs of lamentation <p> Rembrandt painting of Jeremiah lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem <p> As it turns out , Jewish people played an undeniable role in plantation slavery in Jamaica . Ironically , Jewish exiles in the strange lands of the so-called ' New ' World were complicit in the process of enslaving Africans . Forced to sing King Alpha 's song , Africans in the Diaspora found consolation in the sacred book of the Jews . They created their own dub version of Jewish songs of lamentation . <p> On that score , I got a rather stern response on Facebook to last week 's column , " Rastafari Reclaim Jewish Roots " , from Barbara Blake Hannah : " ? ' Reclaim ' or ' share ' Carolyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Christianity as I &I; proclaim . And where were the Rastafari participating in the ' Nyabinghi ' ? Seems more like a Red Bones concert in the Synagogue with reggae Rasta artists ! You mean to tell me that ' Selassie is God ' was being chanted by those gathered ? If so , sorry I missed the ' binghi ' " . <p> Of course , ' reclaim ' does not imply a singular origin . The roots of Rastafari are rhizomatic , like ginger . And I was using binghi metaphorically . But , as I 've learnt after almost three years of writing this column , some readers are quite suspicious of metaphors , preferring to take everything literally . Barbara insists on a ' correction ' . So , to make her happy , I hereby renounce my use of the metaphor of the binghi . It was , literally , only a concert . And the roots of Rastafari really have nothing in common with ginger . <p> Movement of Jah people <p> How Jewish people came to be engaged in plantation slavery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition , more popularly known as the Spanish Inquisition , launched a holy war against non-Catholics in 1480 . Jews and Muslims were the targets of attack . The tribunal was not abolished until 1834 , the very same year that slavery was outlawed in the British Caribbean . <p> Muslims from North African , who were called Moors , had invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and occupied it for almost 600 years . <p> The Spanish Inquisition was a belated attempt to purify the land of ' foreign ' religions . Many Jews supposedly converted to Christianity but practiced Judaism in secret . The Alhambra decree , issued in January 1492 , put an end to the pretence . It demanded the expulsion of Jews . <p> Human trafficking routes <p> Columbus ' ' discovery ' opened doors of opportunity for Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal . Many Sephardic Jews went to Brazil where they made fortunes in plantation slavery . According to Ralph Bennett in an essay , " History of Jews in Brazil " , " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish farmer from Madeira to Brazil in 1532 . Sugar cane became the foundation of the Caribbean economy for several centuries " . <p> First synagogue in the Americas , Recife ( 1636 ) <p> At the end of the fifteenth century , the Pope had imperiously divided the ' New ' World between the Spanish and the Portuguese . The grasp of the Inquisition reached Jews in Brazil . Many were again forced to convert to Catholicism . But in 1630 , the Dutch West India Company captured the city of Recife in the north of Brazil and the religious freedoms enjoyed in Holland were extended to the colony . Jews could now openly practice their religion . <p> But freedom was short-lived . In 1645 the Portuguese launched war against the Dutch and reclaimed Recife in 1654 , round about the same time that Jamaica became a British colony . Jews expelled from Brazil made their way to the Caribbean , first to Barbados and then Jamaica , taking with them the capital and technology of sugar production . <p> Historian Karl Watson notes that , " Barbados presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite apparent that the English experiment in creating colonies in the West Indies for the export of tropical crops was working exceptionally well in Barbados . These newcomers were well placed to exploit this burgeoning sugar economy as part of their extensive Sephardic trading network extending from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean " . <p> The Jewish exile in the Caribbean enabled the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and the migration of waves of indentured labourers from Europe and Asia .

A good old-fashioned ' stop and ask someone ' worked out for us in the end , but we had gone around in so many circles by then that the suitcases started to feel like they were packed with bricks . <p> If ever our Olympic promo ' Fittest team ' is to be tested , it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses will not be making their calls directly to the media hotels at this Olympic Games . We will be required to walk almost 20 minutes twice a day - to and from a central media transport hub and then journey across the city on a 35-45 minute drive to the Olympic Park . <p> Then we 'll have to go several hundred metres before the first security checkpoint , up some stairs , a few more hundred metres across a bridge , down some other stairs and across the road to the Main Press Centre , or to a shuttle that will take us to the stadium itself , which is an 8-10 minute drive ... CRIKEY ! ! ! <p> I figure I 'll get a proper workout by the time I leave here . I just hope this Makyn fellow can keep up . <p> We had a very interesting day in Birmingham on Wednesday which , of course , was our last day in that city .

##3676950 <h> Become a Procrastination Killer by Being SMART <p> Procrastination exists among all of us . But , how people deal with procrastination and let it affect their day-to-day life -- at home , at the office , with friendships and relationships -- is a completely different thing . One of the best ways to kill procrastination is by setting goals to help you accomplish and manage the things you need to do . But , everyone has goals and there 's something that separates those that have goals and never accomplish them from those that do . <p> So , to help you become a better goal-setter and kill procrastination , you have to be SMART . That means your goals are Specific , Measurable , Attainable , Relevant and Timely . <p> S pecific . Your goals should be specific and the more that you define what you want to achieve , the better you can figure out what it is that you need to do to accomplish your goals . The goal should tell who is involved , why it is important ( Example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My goal is to lose 25lbs to feel better about my body and to help lower my cholesterol . " ) <p> M easurable . Your goal should have a result that is measurable , so that you have a way to determine whether you are reaching your goal and how far you are reaching your goal . ( Example : " My goal is to be lose weight . " versus " My goal is to lose 25lbs . " ) <p> A ttainable . Your goal should be realistic and attainable within the scope of your skills , abilities and resources to achieve such a goal . ( Example : A 40-year old setting a goal to become an NBA basketball player would not be a very realistic or attainable goal , since the chances of the NBA recruiting a player at that age are slim to none . ) <p> R elevant . This aspect of goal-setting has to do with making sure that the goal has relevance and importance to the goal setter to work and reach his or her intended goals . <p> T imely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is a goal you are setting to accomplish by the end of the year or with a specific date in mind . This also helps with holding yourself accountable to your goals and gauging where you are with respect to attaining your goal . <p> There 's a saying that goes , " Goals that are unwritten are just wishes . " So , when creating your new SMART goals for yourself , write down your goal . It is a proven fact that those who write down their goals are more likely to accomplish them and once you 've written down your SMART goal

If so , there are schools all over the island looking for donations and kids all over the island that would love some gifts . With some of the airlines still offering 2 checked bags for international flights and the fact that as a tourist you want your second bag empty so you can bring back gifts , how about packing it with gifts on your way down to Jamaica ? <p> Most of us live around " dollar stores " where they sell all sorts of art supplies for around $1.00 each . In the picture below , all of these art supplies cost $1.00 ...... added up the total for all 60 items was a little over $60 with tax . If each kid gets 2 of these items , that extra suitcase can bring a big smile to 30 kids . If the items are donated directly to a school , the smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids in Jamaica <p> If you want to hand out school or art supplies directly to local kids just head away from the tourist areas and you will find plenty of them .

##3679551 <h> Health Benefits <h> General Information <h> It 's All About the Amino Acids ! <h> Amino Acids are the building blocks in our bodies . <p> Our bodies need twenty different amino acids ( also know as proteins ) that act as building blocks to maintain a health body . Nonessential amino acids are those that the body can synthesize for itself , provided there is enough nitrogen , carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen available . Essential amino acids are those supplied by the diet , since the human body either can not make them at all or can not make them in sufficient quantity to meet its needs . Under normal conditions , eleven of the amino acids are nonessential and nine are essential . <p> Here 's a list of the complete range of naturally occurring Amino Acids found in Moringa and a brief explanation of why our bodies requires them : <p> ISOLEUCINE builds proteins and enzymes and it provides ingredients used to create other essential biochemical components in your body , some of which promote energy and stimulate the brain to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins and enzymes which enhance your body 's energy and alertness . <p> LYSINE insures your body absorbs the right amount of calcium . It also helps form collagen used in your bone cartilage and connective tissues . And lysine aids in the production of antibodies , hormones , and enzymes . Recent studies have shown lysine improves the balance of nutrients that reduce viral growth . <p> METHIONINE primarily supplies sulfur to your body . It is known to prevent hair , skin , and nail problems while lowering cholesterol levels as it increases your liver 's production of lecithin . Methionine reduces liver fat and protects the kidneys , which reduces bladder irritation . <p> THREONINE is an important part of collagen , elastin , and enamel proteins . Not only does it assist metabolism , threonine helps prevent fat build-up in the liver while boosting your body 's digestive and intestinal tracts . <p> TRYPTOPHAN supports your immune system , alleviates insomnia , reduces anxiety , depression , and the symptoms of migraine headaches . It also is beneficial in decreasing the risk of artery and heart spasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VALINE is important in promoting a sharp mind , coordinated muscles , and a calm mood . <p> Other Amino Acids Found In Moringa <p> These non-essential amino acids , which can be manufactured by your body with the help of proper nutrition , are also found abundantly in Moringa : <p> ALANINE is important when it comes to building energy in your muscle tissue , brain , and central nervous system . It strengthens your immune system by producing antibodies . Alanine also helps in the healthy metabolism of sugars and organic acids in your body . <p> ARGININE has been shown in studies to cause the release of the growth hormones considered crucial for optimal muscle growth and tissue repair . It also improves immune responses to bacteria , viruses , and tumor cells while promoting the healing of your body 's wounds . <p> ASPARTIC ACID helps rid your body of ammonia created by cellular waste . When the ammonia enters your circulatory system it can act as a highly toxic substance which can damage your central nervous system . Recent studies have also shown that aspartic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions as an antioxidant and is a powerful aid to the body in protecting against radiation and pollution . It can help slow the aging process , deactivate free radicals , and neutralize toxins . It also aids in protein synthesis and presents cellular change . It is necessary for the formation of new skin cells , which aids in the recovery from burns and surgical operations . <p> Following is a very brief scientific summary I found on the internet to explain how the amino acids work in our bodies . My understanding is that without them our bodies breakdown and look for the necessary proteins ( amino acids ) from our organs , which is probably why it seems to you and I that there are more illness occurring such as diabetes , kidney problems , heart diseases , etc . If we start to watch the quality of foods we eat and make sure we are feeding out bodies the proper amino acids , maybe we can overcome these illness . <p> If you checked out the Pubmed links in the Moringa Research you will see that Moringa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you are like me and live in an area where I ca n't grow my own Moringa tree , it 's good to know we can supplement our diet with Moringa through capsules of dry leaves or have the full potential in a can of Zija . <p> Structure : All amino acids have a similar chemical structure each contains an amino group ( NH 2 ) , an acid group ( COOH ) , a hydrogen atom ( H ) , and a distinctive side group that makes proteins more complex than either carbohydrates or lipids . All amino acids are attached to a central carbon atom ( C ) . <p> The distinctive side group identifies each amino acid and gives it characteristics that attract it to , or repel it from , the surrounding fluids and other amino acids . Some amino acid side groups carry electrical charges that are attracted to water molecules ( hydrophilic ) , while others are neutral and are repelled by water ( hydrophobic ) . Side-group characteristics ( shape , size , composition , electrical charge , and pH ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A diabetic child injects herself with insulin . Composed of 51 amino acids , insulin is a small protein used by the body to regulate glucose levels in the blood . <p> The three-dimensional shape of proteins is derived from the sequence and properties of its amino acids and determines its function and interaction with other molecules . Each amino acid is linked to the next by a peptide bond , the name given to the link or attraction between the acid ( COOH ) end of one amino acid and the amino end ( NH 2 ) of another . Proteins of various lengths are made when amino acids are linked together in this manner . A dipeptide is two amino acids joined by a peptide bond , while a tripeptide is three amino acids joined by peptide bonds . <p> The unique shapes of proteins enable them to perform their various tasks in the body . Heat , acid , or other conditions can disturb proteins , causing them to uncoil or lose their shape and impairing their ability to function . This is referred to as denaturation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hormones , and antibodies . They maintain fluid balance and acid and base balance . They also transport substances such as oxygen , vitamins , and minerals to target cells throughout the body . Structural proteins , such as collagen and keratin , are responsible for the formation of bones , teeth , hair , and the outer layer of skin , and they help maintain the structure of blood vessels and other tissues . In contrast , motor proteins use energy and convert it into some form of mechanical work ( e.g. , dividing cells , contracting muscle ) . <p> Enzymes are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions without being changed in the process . The inactive form of an enzyme is called a proenzyme . Hormones ( chemical messengers ) are proteins that travel to one or more specific target tissues or organs , and many have important regulatory functions . Insulin , for example , plays a key role in regulating the amount of glucose in the blood . The body manufactures antibodies ( giant protein molecules ) , which combat invading antigens . Antigens are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and could potentially be harmful . Immunoproteins , also called immunoglobulins or antibodies , defend the body from possible attack by these invaders by binding to the antigens and inactivating them . <p> Proteins help to maintain the body 's fluid and electrolyte balance . This means that proteins ensure that the proper types and amounts of fluid and minerals are present in each of the body 's three fluid compartments . These fluid compartments are intracellular ( contained within cells ) , extracellular ( existing outside the cell ) , and intravascular ( in the blood ) . Without this balance , the body can not function properly . <p> Proteins also help to maintain balance between acids and bases within body fluids . The lower a fluid 's pH , the more acidic it is . Conversely , the higher the pH , the less acidic the fluid is . The body works hard to keep the pH of the blood near 7.4 ( neutral ) . Proteins also act as carriers , transporting many important substances in the bloodstream for delivery throughout the body . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . <p> Source of Amino Acids : Humans consume many foods that contain proteins or amino acids . One normally need not worry about getting enough protein or amino acids in the typical American diet . Foods from animal sources are typically rich in essential amino acids . These include chicken , fish , eggs , dairy products , beef , and pork . With the increasing emphasis on vegetarian diets , plant sources of protein are gaining in popularity . Such sources include dried beans ( black , kidney , northern , red , and white beans ) , peas , soy , nuts , and seeds . Although plant sources generally lack one or more of the essential amino acids , when combined with whole grains such as rice , or by eating nuts or seeds with legumes , all the amino acids can be obtained . <p> To learn more about amino acids and other important nutritional facts , search the web or consult with your healthcare provider .

I seldom watch the post-game shows ( just like I seldom read comments on blogs -- other than this one , of course ) but today I just happened to linger long enough to see an absolutely inspiring clip on the CBS post-game . <p> The Indianapolis Colts beat the Miami Dolphins today and after the game the Colts ' Coach , Chuck Pagano , came into the locker room to a round of cheers and applause from the players . Pagano is the official Head Coach of the team but is currently on sick leave battling Leukemia . After the cheers died down , he offered words of congratulations and inspiration to a team that most football experts did n't give much of a chance at the start of the season . His words are as relevant to a football team as they are to anyone facing a medical challenge or financial challenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His central message : live your life in a vision of what you want it to be , not based on the circumstances you currently find yourself in . The short but powerful , must watch speech is here : Coach Pagano Locker Room Speech . <p> " Because the only way you can achieve something that big is an absolutely obsessed , monomaniacal , overwhelming intensity and focus that starts today and goes tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day for 365 days and then for 3,650 days -- that 's how you do it . " - Jim Collins <p> " When I was 17 , I read a quote that went something like : " If you live each day as if it was your last , someday you 'll most certainly be right . " It made an impression on me , and since then , for the past 33 years , I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself : " If today were the last day of my life , would I want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the answer has been " No " for too many days in a row , I know I need to change something . " - Steve Jobs <p> Once upon a time , a lifetime ago , I worked for the local subsidiary of a multi-national bank . It was a formative time in my life and career and took me to places I had n't previously imagined . One day I came across a copy of an annual report of the bank and studied the global organizational chart . A couple of things jumped out at me . First , because of the size and reach of the company , the Managing Director of the Bahamas subsidiary was not shown . The Caribbean region was noted , but the person I saw as the boss was not specifically listed . Second , I realized that the odds of making it to the top of that organizational chart were decidedly against me . That was the day I embraced my entrepreneurial future . I could n't see myself ascending to the global head of that bank -- at least not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to build my own . Impetuous and naive for sure . <p> I 've been running regularly for a little over a year and a half now and at the beginning of this year , I set a goal to run a marathon . For the first three months I averaged around 35 miles of running per month . Then I got distracted from the plan for reasons big and small , but largely insignificant . For the months of April , May and June , my average fell to around 17 miles per month -- less than half of the previous quarter 's pace . Backward progress to be sure . <p> This month I decided to re-engage and recommit to the plan but with each run I felt like I continued to drift backwards . The runs were hard , slow and short . Each run felt like I was carrying a 100 lb. sack of sand , as I ran hunched over , head down , eyes on my laces . <p> On The Ropes ( OTR ) has served as a platform for me to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think are useful , and provide Q &As; with people I find interesting . OTR continues to evolve ( incrementally ) as a platform for exploration and I 'm about to expand the platform by embarking on an exciting , and slightly intimidating , new initiative : writing and self-publishing an e-book . <p> " Champions are made from something they have deep inside them . A desire , a dream , a vision . They have to have last minute stamina . They have to be faster . They have to have the skill and the will . But the will must be stronger
