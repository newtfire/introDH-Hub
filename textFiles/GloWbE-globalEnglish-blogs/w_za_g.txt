It 's about wanting to understand who you are and living in sync with your values every moment possible . Since that 's a big statement , let 's digest it bit by bit . <p> Every week , during my coaching sessions , I hear how executives complaining about stress ; apparently It 's a part of many people 's job description . The good thing is that there are several ways to manage stress , and eventually remove it out of your life . I 'll try to divide it into a nine-day course for you and I promise it 's not going to be too taxing on the body , as well as on the mind . <p> Since July 2011 , I had been contemplating on a suitable name for this new exploration and expression of mine i.e. sharing the science of yoga and healing with others . One morning in late August , suddenly " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my morning Sadhana ( practice ) in a deep " unclutched " state . The words appeared clearly in my inner space . <p> When I bought the book " The 4-Hour Work Week " , I read it as " The 4-Day Work Week " since that was what my belief system could accept at that moment . Even as I was halfway through the book , I would have chirped " The 4-Day Work Week " to anyone who asked what I was reading . Funny how my mind limited what was staring in front of me ; and author Timothy Ferriss even had " 4-HOUR " printed in a different color to ensure his readers got the point ! <p> Today I discovered a four-leaf clover growing among our indoor plant . This is the first time I 've ever seen a four-leaf clover and just when I needed a picker upper . In fact , was just saying that if I can find one , I 'll be very happy ! As legend goes , each leaf represents something : the first is for faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , and the fourth is for luck . <p> This evening we just ended session 5 of the Intensive Coach Training that I 'm taking . Learning more each week and enjoying the journey ; plus blessed to be interacting with such a diverse and energy-giving group of people . Anne ends our sessions with quotes and today 's is <p> Life is a narrative that you have a hand in writing . - Henriette Anne Klauser <p> How apt since every decision we make and action we take or not take ; fills in the canvas we call life . The good news is that like paintings , you can shade it further and make changes ... as long as nothing overly drastic was done which can not be modified . Drastic does n't always mean bad , it just depends on the intention and may it always be generosity . <p> Passion comes from within , just like when you pour champagne into a flute , an initial burst of effervescence occurs . Seeing the bubbles rise up remind me that it 's really up to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this burst of motivation - in the case of champagne - I focus on dancing and getting into great conversations with friends new and old . In the case of life , I inch closer to what inspires me , review the high yet realistic expectations , then get to work ; yes , get to work . <p> The party does n't end there , so I 'm careful not to dampen the fizz by over-indulging . Experience has taught me not to end up with that headache and having to hear ' I told you so ' from the naysayers . What I aim for is continuous energy and happiness . <p> On that happy note , here 's a grand Salud to champagne , sparkling wine and sparkling water alike 
##1164350 last module you were on . You need an account to use ' My Favorites ' . <h> Mirrors <h> Mirrors <p> A mirror is a highly reflective surface . The most common mirrors are flat and are known as plane mirrors . Household mirrors are plane mirrors . They are made of a flat piece of glass with a thin layer of silver nitrate or aluminium on the back . However , other mirrors are curved and are either convex mirrors or are concave mirrors . The reflecting properties of all three types of mirrors will be discussed in this section . <h> Image Formation <p> Definition 1 : Image <p> An image is a representation of an object formed by a mirror or lens . Light from the image is seen . <p> Figure 1 : An object formed in a mirror is real and upright . <p> If you place a candle in front of a mirror , you now see two candles . The actual , physical candle is called the object and the picture you see in the mirror is called the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The image is the picture that is formed by the reflected rays . <p> The object could be an actual source that emits light , such as a light bulb or a candle . More commonly , the object reflects light from another source . When you look at your face in the mirror , your face does not emit light . Instead , light from a light bulb or from the sun reflects off your face and then hits the mirror . However , in working with light rays , it is easiest to pretend the light is coming from the object . <p> An image formed by reflection may be real or virtual . A real image occurs when light rays actually intersect at the image . A real image is inverted , or upside down . A virtual image occurs when light rays do not actually meet at the image . Instead , you " see " the image because your eye projects light rays backward . You are fooled into seeing an image ! A virtual image is erect , or right side up ( upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by putting a screen at the location of the image . A real image can be formed on the screen because the light rays actually meet there . A virtual image can not be seen on a screen , since it is not really there . <p> To describe objects and images , we need to know their locations and their sizes . The distance from the mirror to the object is the object distance , d o d o . <p> The distance from the mirror to the image is the image distance , d i d i . <h> Plane Mirrors <h> Investigation : Image formed by a mirror <p> Stand one step away from a large mirror <p> What do you observe in the mirror ? This is called your image . <p> What size is your image ? Bigger , smaller or the same size as you ? <p> How far is your image from you ? How far is your image from the mirror ? <p> If it were a real object , which foot would the image of you right show fit ? <p> Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright , the same size and inverted front to back . <p> When you look into a mirror , you see an image of yourself . <p> The image created in the mirror has the following properties : <p> The image is virtual . <p> The image is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror . <p> The image is inverted front to back . <p> The image is the same size as the object . <p> The image is upright . <p> Virtual images are images formed in places where light does not really reach . Light does not really pass through the mirror to create the image ; it only appears to an observer as though the light were coming from behind the mirror . Whenever a mirror creates an image which is virtual , the image will always be located behind the mirror where light does not really pass . <p> Definition 2 : Virtual Image <p> A virtual image is upright , on the opposite side of the mirror as the object , and light does not actually reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict the image that is formed by a plane mirror . A ray diagram is a geometrical picture that is used for analyzing the images formed by mirrors and lenses . We draw a few characteristic rays from the object to the mirror . We then follow ray-tracing rules to find the path of the rays and locate the image . <h> Tip : <p> A mirror obeys the Law of Reflection . <p> The ray diagram for the image formed by a plane mirror is the simplest possible ray diagram . ( Reference ) shows an object placed in front of a plane mirror . It is convenient to have a central line that runs perpendicular to the mirror . This imaginary line is called the principal axis . <h> Tip : <p> Ray diagrams <p> The following should be remembered when drawing ray diagrams : <p> Objects are represented by arrows . The length of the arrow represents the height of the object . <p> If the arrow points upwards , then the object is described as upright or erect . If the arrow points downwards then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real , then the arrow is drawn with a solid line . If the object is virtual , then the arrow is drawn with a dashed line . <p> Method : Ray Diagrams for Plane Mirrors <p> Ray diagrams are used to find the position and size and whether the image is real or virtual . <p> Draw the plane mirror as a straight line on a principal axis . <p> Figure 3 <p> Draw the object as an arrow in front of the mirror . <p> Figure 4 <p> Draw the image of the object , by using the principle that the image is placed at the same distance behind the mirror that the object is in front of the mirror . The image size is also the same as the object size . <p> Figure 5 <p> Place a dot at the point the eye is located . <p> Pick one point on the image and draw the reflected ray that travels to the eye as it sees this point . Remember to add an arrowhead . <p> Figure 6 <p> Draw the incident ray for light traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such that the law of reflection is obeyed . <p> Figure 7 <p> Continue for other extreme points on the object ( i.e. the tip and base of the arrow ) . <p> Figure 8 <p> Suppose a light ray leaves the top of the object traveling parallel to the principal axis . The ray will hit the mirror at an angle of incidence of 0 degrees . We say that the ray hits the mirror normally . According to the law of reflection , the ray will be reflected at 0 degrees . The ray then bounces back in the same direction . We also project the ray back behind the mirror because this is what your eye does . <p> Another light ray leaves the top of the object and hits the mirror at its centre . This ray will be reflected at the same angle as its angle of incidence , as shown . If we project the ray backward behind the mirror , it will eventually cross the projection of the first ray we drew . We have found the location of the image ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that light can not actually reach ( behind the mirror ) . You can see from the diagram that the image is erect and is the same size as the object . This is exactly as we expected . <p> We use a dashed line to indicate that the image is virtual . <p> Figure 9 <p> Khan academy video on mirrors - 1 <h> Spherical Mirrors <p> The second class of mirrors that we will look at are spherical mirrors . These mirrors are called spherical mirrors because if you take a sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 10 and then polish the inside of one and the outside of the other , you will get a concave mirror and convex mirror as shown . These two mirrors will be studied in detail . <p> The centre of curvature is the point at the centre of the sphere and describes how big the sphere is . <p> Figure 10 : When a sphere is cut and then polished to a reflective surface on the inside a concave mirror is obtained . When the outside is polished to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concave Mirrors <p> The first type of curved mirror we will study are concave mirrors . Concave mirrors have the shape shown in Figure 11 . As with a plane mirror , the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror . <p> Figure 11 : Concave mirror with principal axis . <p> If you think of light reflecting off a concave mirror , you will immediately see that things will look very different compared to a plane mirror . The easiest way to understand what will happen is to draw a ray diagram and work out where the images will form . Once we have done that it is easy to see what properties the image has . <p> First we need to define a very important characteristic of the mirror . We have seen that the centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut . We then define that a distance that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis . This point is known as the focal point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the focal length ( symbol f f ) . Since the focal point is the midpoint of the line segment joining the vertex and the center of curvature , the focal length would be one-half the radius of curvature . This fact can come in very handy , remember if you know one then you know the other ! <p> Definition 3 : Focal Point <p> The focal point of a mirror is the midpoint of a line segment joining the vertex and the centre of curvature . It is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed . <p> Why are we making such a big deal about this point we call the focal point ? It has an important property we will use often . A ray parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be reflected through the focal point . The focal point is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed . <p> Figure 12 : All light rays pass through the focal point . <p> Figure 13 : A concave mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Reflection . The intersection of the reflected rays gives the location of the image . Here the image is real and inverted . <p> From Figure 13 , we see that the image created by a concave mirror is real and inverted , as compared to the virtual and erect image created by a plane mirror . <p> Definition 4 : Real Image <p> A real image can be cast on a screen ; it is inverted , and on the same side of the mirror as the object . <h> Convergence <p> A concave mirror is also known as a converging mirror . Light rays appear to converge to the focal point of a concave mirror . <h> Convex Mirrors <p> The second type of curved mirror we will study are convex mirrors . Convex mirrors have the shape shown in Figure 14 . As with a plane mirror , the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror . <p> We have defined the focal point as that point that is half-way along the principal axis between the centre of curvature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is behind the mirror . A convex mirror has a negative focal length because the focal point is behind the mirror . <p> Figure 14 : Convex mirror with principle axis , focal point ( F ) and centre of curvature ( C ) . The centre of the mirror is the optical centre ( O ) . <p> To determine what the image from a convex mirror looks like and where the image is located , we need to remember that a mirror obeys the laws of reflection and that light appears to come from the image . The image created by a convex mirror is shown in Figure 15 . <p> Figure 15 : A convex mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image . Each incident ray is reflected according to the Law of Reflection . The reflected rays diverge . If the reflected rays are extended behind the mirror , then their intersection gives the location of the image behind the mirror . For a convex mirror , the image is virtual and upright . <p> From Figure 15 , we see that the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compared to the real and inverted image created by a concave mirror . <h> Divergence <p> A convex mirror is also known as a diverging mirror . Light rays appear to diverge from the focal point of a convex mirror . <h> Magnification <p> In Figure 13 and Figure 15 , the height of the object and image arrows were different . In any optical system where images are formed from objects , the ratio of the image height , h i h i , to the object height , h o h o is known as the magnification , m m . <p> m = h i h o m = h i h o <p> ( 1 ) <p> This is true for the mirror examples we showed above and will also be true for lenses , which will be introduced in the next sections . For a plane mirror , the height of the image is the same as the height of the object , so the magnification is simply m = h i h o = 1 m = h i h o = 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is larger than the object and is said to be magnified . If the magnification is less than 1 , the image is smaller than the object so the image is said to be diminished . <h> Exercise 1 : Magnification <p> A concave mirror forms an image that is 4,8 cm high . The height of the object is 1,6 cm . Calculate the magnification of the mirror . <p> An object 1 cm high is placed 4 cm from a concave mirror . If the focal length of the mirror is 2 cm , find the position and size of the image by means of a ray diagram . Is the image real or virtual ? What is the magnification ?

##1166450 <h> Thursday , November 08 , 2012 <h> Vince Musewe says country 's mineral resources are controlled by the Chinese and Zanu-PF ( not the people ) <h> Letter to Julius Malema on Zimbabwe <p> If uncollected rubbish dumps , lack of running clean water and a dilapidating infrastructure inspire you Julius , then I suppose you should relocate to Harare . <p> Greetings to you Julius . I am sure you will note that this is my second letter to you on the same subject matter . <p> I understand that you visited my country Zimbabwe recently , and that you continue to be inspired by how ZANU ( PF ) has decimated our economy and its potential . Well , Julius , I dare say that your standards are obviously not that high and I forgive you for that . You see , this is the case with most black Africans ; all you have to do is look throughout Africa to realise that the black man , left to his own devices , has dismally failed to raise his standard of living despite having all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , is currently suffering from the same disorder and events in the Limpopo province , where you come from , certainly do not inspire me . Should n't you be rather spending your energy there to get things right ? <p> There are historical reasons for that I think , the main one being that coming from poverty backgrounds , black Africans do not really demand or expect much from their leaders . You see Julius ; there is just something about us black people and our standards . They are just so low and your inspiration from the Zimbabwe situation proves that to me . By the way , Julius , I forgot to ask you whether you had electricity at the wedding you attended because on that day , I did n't . <p> If stinking uncollected rubbish dumps , lack of clean running water and a dilapidating infrastructure inspire you Julius , then I suppose you should relocate to Harare . I have a perfect spot for you where you can , once again , get inspired using pit latrines as some of you do now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the case in Limpopo , where some infrastructure is in bad shape even after some black owned companies were paid to do the work to repair it . I am sure you are aware of that . That hardly inspires me Julius . <p> I am an enthusiastic believer in economic transformation and the ownership of our economies by the majority and not by international monopolies and oligopolies who are to me , the new colonialists . On that point I fully agree with you . However , that does mean that I should accept a substandard life style . I do n't know about you Julius , but I note that you aspire to live in Sandton ( the taxman willing ) and not in Thembisa as most of your brothers and sisters do ( not that there is anything wrong with living in Thembisa ) . <p> I do n't know whether you are aware that Zimbabwe does not actually control its mineral wealth ? These have been dished out to the Chinese and to ZANU ( PF ) cronies some of who are reported to be now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where our diamond revenue is going Julius , can you believe that ? I guess that inspires you Julius . <p> You no doubt , will also be inspired by our agricultural revolution ( as you would call it ) , where now we can not even feed ourselves and must import maize from Zambia . Yes Julius we in Zimbabwe now " own " those farms but they are useless and lying idle . <p> Julius , in Zimbabwe , we even own closed factories and shops , we own our own airline which is grounded , we own all our state enterprises that are facing closure because of mismanagement , we own steel mills , power stations , railways , mines ; hell you name it Julius and we own it . But all that we own is either underutilised , in a state of disrepair or being driven to the ground through corruption or mismanagement . That 's inspirational Julius , is n't it ? <p> My advice to you Julius , is to use this " sabbatical " that the ANC has forced upon you wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good arguments on how we must begin to ameliorate the condition of black Africans . You however , need to sharpen your thinking skills . <p> Africa needs future leaders who are educated , principled , who have integrity and are sensitive to the dynamics of the environment that they operate in . If you by any chance aspire to be one of those , good luck , but I can tell you that will not get that from coming to Harare to insult our intelligence . You seem to have a unique gift of persistently doing that . <p> Julius , economic freedom in this lifetime is possible , but only if we insist on high standards of leadership and delivery . Nationalisation will not achieve that economic freedom , nor will violence , greed and corruption . Fighting for higher wages is like a slave , fighting for a daily tea break ; it will not fundamentally change the economic relationships in South Africa . <p> I shall be in touch with you again soon , and we may perhaps sit down and inspire each other on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new economic models . Let us rather spend our energies on that , do n't you agree ? <p> Finally I encourage you to choose your friends wisely Julius , because the tide is turning and true economic freedom is coming soon to Zimbabwe . Real economic freedom Julius , which you might want to be once again inspired by . <p> Sincerely , <p> Vince Musewe <p> Your comrade in the economic struggle to free Africans from dictatorship , incompetence and poverty . <p> Vince Musewe is an independent economist currently in Harare . You may contact him on vtmusewe@gmail.com <p> " Let us not be influenced by other cultures and try to think the lawyers are going to help . We have never changed the facts . They tell you they are dealing with cold facts . They will never tell you that these cold facts have warm bodies , " he said . <p> Zuma 's view could be seen as an endorsement of the controversial Traditional Courts Bill , which has women 's rights groups , the ANC Women 's League and the Ministry for Women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drafters of the bill have argued that it will offer the prospect of access to justice to 18million citizens who live in the rural areas . <p> But women 's rights groups believe the bill will disempower millions of rural women by not allowing them access to the formal justice system when they have been wronged . <p> They believe this and other problematic provisions make the bill unconstitutional . <p> One of Zuma 's ministers , Lulu Xingwana , who presides over the Ministry for Women , Children and People with Disabilities , has been a fierce critic of the bill , demanding it be redrafted altogether . <p> When the bill was discussed in parliament in September , she said : " Let me remind you the constitution has an equality clause that supersedes custom . I plead with the National Council of Provinces not to pass this bill because it is an apartheid-era piece of legislation . <p> " It 's oppressive to women and discriminatory . We do n't think traditional courts should be allowed to impose forced labour . Why are we taking our people back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no consultation " with rural women , Xingwana said . <p> The ANC Women 's League - which has endorsed Zuma for a second term - has also called for the bill to be recalled . <p> Zuma was adamant yesterday that traditional authorities had sufficient capacity to deal with legal matters affecting people under their jurisdiction . <p> " Our view is that the nature and the value system of the traditional courts of promoting social cohesion and reconciliation must be recognised and strengthened in the bill , " he said . But he realised there were genuine concerns that the courts fell outside of a proper legislative framework . <p> According to Zuma , there was no need to involve external law-enforcement agencies in issues that could be solved by a chief . <p> He slammed Africans who had become " most eloquent " in criticising their cultural background . <p> " We are Africans . We can not change to be something else . " <p> Zuma also lashed out at critics of the government who , he said , continued to mislead the poor into believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . <p> He said there was no factual basis to claims that the gap between the rich and the poor was widening . <p> " It is an absolutely wrong statement and has been repeated and we have almost come to believe it is true . It is not scientifically correct . It is a spin to criticise the democratic government . " <p> Before 1994 the population of black people had not been counted and therefore any gaps in wealth could not be measured , Zuma said . <p> " It 's a manipulation of the words to make us who are in a democratic country responsible for the sins of apartheid . <p> " It the gap between rich and poor has not been growing since 1994 , it has been narrowing . <p> " Poverty was worser sic than what it is now . Fifteen million poor people get the social grant , which they did n't get before . If that 's not closing the gap , what is it ? " <p> Zuma urged traditional chiefs to do their part to quell violent wildcat strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Marikana massacre could not be tolerated . <p> But , he said , international commentators who likened such events to the violent apartheid days were unjustified . <p> " No , we will never go back to apartheid . In apartheid times the Marikana situation was a daily occurrence . People were being killed left , right and centre , and there was no one to stop it . It was a culture , the nature of government was different , " he said . <h> Wednesday , October 31 , 2012 <p> A letter from FNB 's Paul Harris to his mate " Jeff " , telling him not to be concerned about those in South Africa , had gone viral . Many have responded to billionaire Harris , the kindest rebuttal being that from his elitist perspective , Harris has no clue about what the ordinary South African is facing or concerned about . We first place Harris ' letter to Jeff and then Jeff 's brilliant response . Lastly there is a rebuttal found without reference , but an equally excellent read . <h> Do n't stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former executive Paul Harris to a concerned friend has gone viral . Here is an edited version : <p> Hi Jeff <p> HOPE all is well with you guys . I will drop you a line later with the family news but I would first like to respond to the e-mail you sent me attaching an article by Clem Sunter , which seemed to concern you about us here in South Africa . <p> You also sent me an article last year by Moeletsi Mbeki warning about the danger of an " Arab Spring " in South Africa . I often get e-mails like this from " concerned friends " worried about us , which is sweet of you guys . Of course we are concerned . Some worrying things have happened but we have been through and survived much worse in much more volatile environments . Including the Boer War , two World Wars , apartheid , the financial crisis without a bank bailout , the Rindapest , Ge Korsten and Die Antwoord ! <p> However , for as long as I can remember there have always been people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the cliff . No change from when I was at school in the sixties . The five years went down to a few months at times in the eighties ! <p> But it seems the people who are the most worried live far from the cliff in places like Toronto , Auckland , London and other wet and cold places . Also from St Ives and Rose Bay in Sydney , Dallas and Europe and other " safe places " that are in the grip of the global financial crisis , which by the way is quite scary . Many of them have survived decades of rolling " five years left " since they left South Africa . So maybe they will be right one day ! <p> My message is , please do n't stress about us in South Africa . We are fine . We are cool . We know we live in the most beautiful country in the world with warm and vibrant people . There are more people here with smiles on their faces than in any country I have ever been to . <p> Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude . Collectively we bumble along and stuff many things up while letting off a hell of a lot of steam ( have you heard of a chap called Julius Malema ? ) . Yet in between South Africans do some amazing things like win a few gold medals , big golf tournaments and cricket and rugby matches . <p> The South Africans I know get off their butts and do things to build our country rather than whinge from a position of comfort . We actively participate in projects that improve the lot of underprivileged communities . I would not trade for anything last Saturday in a hall full of 1500 African teachers singing at the top of their voices and demonstrating their commitment to improving education in their communities . <p> We have our challenges and surprises . The standard deviation of our emotions are set at MAX . You are never just a " little bit happy " or a " little bit sad " . At one moment you can be " off the scale " pissed off or frustrated or sad or worried or fearful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale " exhilarated , or enchanted , or inspired , or humbled by a kind deed , or surprised by something beautiful . It makes life interesting and worth living . <p> We also have passionate debates about the future of SA . Helped of course by red wine which you must taste again because it is getting better every year ! Clem makes a great contribution to the debate as others like Moeletsi Mbeki do . Russell Loubser , the former head of the JSE , made a feisty speech the other day that has whipped up emotions . Up to MAX on the emotions meter of the ANC Youth League whose campaign for nationalisation of the mines was attributed to people who have IQs equal to room temperature . <p> South African politics has always been volatile , we have opinions that could not be further apart and it evokes emotion on a massive scale . Interesting and stimulating for those that want to take it seriously but noise in the system to me . Fortunately we are rid of apartheid that would have definitely pushed us over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unpredictable democracy . So buckle up and enjoy the ride and contribute ! That is the message I convey to South Africans . <p> Sad as it is , it is true that the South African diaspora has a largely negative influence on confidence in South Africa . It would not be a problem if their fretting about how long we will last before we go over the cliff was merely a reflection of their concern for us , their friends and family . <p> The problem is that it does impact foreign investment , which is important for economic growth . A person who is thinking of coming to visit or investing is often put off by listening wide-eyed to the stories of people who have gapped it . <p> As you know I host many foreign visitors and I have never , EVER , met anyone who has visited for the first time without being blown away by the beauty of the country and the warmth of the people . It is not for nothing that South Africa has the highest ratio of repeat visitors of all long-haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you stop stressing out about us ? Maybe best is that you get exposed to some articles and websites that give a more balanced and uplifting perspective of South Africa . So please do n't worry and if you get a chance , put in a good word for us . <h> " Jeff 's " response to Paul Harris <p> David Bullard <p> 31 October 2012 <p> David Bullard gets his hands on a leaked copy of the reply to the viral email ... <p> Last week a letter from FNB 's Paul Harris to his ex pat mate " Jeff " appeared on the Homecoming Revolution website . It then appeared as a filler piece in the Sunday Times Business Times section and the following morning was used to bulk out Business Day . It 's now said to have " gone viral " which is just another way of saying that a lot of people with nothing better to do have e.mailed it to their entire address book . <p> Thanks to the services of a shadowy group of anarchists known as WikiLies we have managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Harris . Read on ... <p> G'day Paul , <p> Jeez mate .... If I 'd known my e.mails to you were going to go public I would never have attached that jpeg of those two obliging dusky maidens who joined us both on my boat on Pittwater . One of the lads down at the yacht club told me that your e.mail to me appeared in some fish-wrap newspaper last Sunday and that I ought to respond because it paints me as a bit of a wowser . <p> I can take a hint and obviously it was stupid of me to send you copies of articles by the likes of Clem Sunter and Mbeki Jnr when it was perfectly obvious that you would have already read them . So I wo n't do it again . But what 's all this stuff about often getting e-mails from " concerned friends " and telling us that it 's sweet of us to care . I hope I have n't grown thin skinned after all these years in Aussie but I did find that a touch patronising old buddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely not the case . <p> I know you 're hooked up to that Homecoming Revolution outfit which tries to persuade South Africans to bring their skills back home after they 've qualified for foreign citizenship . Purely out of interest , what is the ratio of black to white South Africans that you 're tempting back ? It would be interesting to know because some cynical bastard once suggested that Homecoming Revolution 's main job was to bring people back to fix up the mess caused by the new elite . In which case I hope it 's working for you . <p> Now I know you 've survived many things before like Ge Korsten ( a joke ... right ? ) and that your land is beautiful , you are all cool people and even manage to win the odd sporting event once you 've persuaded your politicians that the team should be selected on talent rather than demographics . I also know that you have some top business brains there and that there are many hard working people in SA ( I used to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us who criticise SA 's politics of whingeing from a position of comfort . And I 'm afraid I had to reach for the sick bag when you started beating the drum about all the good works you do for underprivileged communities . So did Jimmy Savile . <p> You ask if I 've heard of a chap called Julius Malema as if I 've been going walkabout in the outback these last few years . We do have telly in Oz you know and broadband that is rather faster than yours so of course I 've heard of this thieving layabout . And he worries me more than he seems to worry you . <p> You 've come a long way since those days at Rand Consolidated Investments in the early eighties Paul . I see in the Sunday Times rich list that you are among the top 20 richest men in SA with a fortune estimated at around R2bln . Wow ..... who would have thought ? I know you live in a very secure complex with 24/7 guards and I am damn sure that your financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tax than you really have to . <p> That 's the privilege of the super rich and I do n't have any problem with that . My problem is that I am not sure you are really qualified to speak for the average Saffer when you tell them to buck up and put on a happy face because they 're all rainbow children . You 're in the very fortunate position of having a lot more choice than the majority of your countrymen and I have no doubt that you have hedge strategies in place should your sunny optimism turn out to be misplaced . <p> Back in 2007 I recall that you spent R20 million on a campaign to get little Thabo to take crime seriously . I searched the internet and found this piece to refresh your memory . You were forced to withdraw that campaign after government threatened to pull accounts from FNB . It was a PR cock-up of note and to make things worse the rest of the business community put the boot in as well . You were accused of setting up in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that your backbone has taken a pummelling and that you are keen to make amends now . But writing complete claptrap and burying your head in the sand is no way to do it . <p> You claim in your e.mail that you have passionate debates in SA but you know that is n't the case . You know that all the leading newspapers depend on government advertising to survive and that they silence voices they find too strident . You also know that the SABC is a shambles and that Primedia are now seen by many in Gauteng as the national broadcaster . Their saccharine recipe for broadcasting ensures that those too critical of government are labelled un-South African or racist and are , from then on , excluded from the right to debate . <p> You ask how you can help me from stressing about South Africa Paul . Let me tell you . We ex-pats may sometimes give the impression that we think your politicians are a bunch of incompetent knuckleheads who could n't pull a greasy stick out of a dead dingo 's arse ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do this because that 's how brand SA comes across after 18 years of freedom . There will be those who demonstrate schadenfreude but many of us still have family there and are genuinely concerned about Clem 's 25% failed nation status probability . <p> What worries me most is that you are a leading business figure and yet you do n't seem to be seeing the big picture . On the contrary you seem decidedly laid back and are simply hoping things will work out . I guess if you 're worth R2bln and in your sixties then that 's a luxury you can afford . What I can not understand though is how pretending things are OK when they are so obviously far from OK is a good business strategy . Remember that ghastly Dealstream episode , not to mention SPJi and the vast losses in equity trading during your watch ? How could you forget ? The analysts suggested after the event that the losses could have been much lower if the problems had been recognised and acted upon earlier . <p> And that 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground by a bunch of commies who do n't even support capitalism . How can you expect them to perform ? And the amount that is disappearing out of the back door ought to worry you as much as it worries the rest of your less , fortunate countrymen . Kids do n't get text books , pregnant women sleep on the floors of ill equipped public hospitals , tenderpreneurs keep the luxury car market buoyant but fail to build the roads they were contracted to ..... it 's a farce mate . And I wo n't even mention the succession of dodgy police chiefs you 've suffered . <p> So please Paul , take off those expensive rose tinted specs of yours , smell the raw sewage and stop pretending you have a functioning government . Then I 'll be only too happy to put in a good word for you when I get the chance . <p> See you later <p> Jeff <h> Another rebuttal found online <p> Billionaire banker says SA is " fine " , psychologists urge public to be gentle with him . <p> Psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Harris , after he wrote a letter announcing that the country was " fine " . " This is what happens when you live in the money-bubble , " said one . " It 's easy to be optimistic about South Africa when you can move to Monaco with the change between your couch pillows . " <p> Harris made headlines on the weekend after a letter he penned to a friend went viral . In the letter , Harris reveals that the country is " fine " , and assures his friend that " there are more people here with smiles on their faces than any other country I 've been to " . <p> This morning the staff at his country seat confirmed that Harris , worth R2-billion , was more than qualified to speak about ordinary South Africans . <p> Indeed , Mr Harris has got his finger on the pulse of the common man , " confirmed his butler , Fotheringham . " The finger is made of platinum , so he does n't actually have to touch the common man , and I disinfect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Housekeeper , Mrs Shortbread , said that Harris often remarked on how all South Africans , regardless of socio-economic status , smiled warmly whenever they saw him . <p> Och aye , people just light up when he walks into a room ! " she gushed . " Some might say it 's because he makes about R10,000 a second and they 're hoping some of that cash will rub off on them , but he prefers to think it 's because South Africans are just intrinsically decent . " <p> Kitchen maid , Elsie Kleintjoppies , said she had never seen Harris , but had seen pictures of him . " He 's a beautiful bearded man in a long white robe , with light shining out from his head and a lamb curled up at his feet , " she said . " He 's just so incredibly compassionate . " <p> Meanwhile , psychologists have asked South Africans to " be gentle " with Harris if they encounter him . <p> Remember , Mr Harris is a superb businessman , with a vast knowledge of finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that money has caused a delusion we call ' Thinking You Know About How Other People Live ' . Unfortunately when you 're super-rich , the scientific term for what you know about ordinary folks is ' fokkol ' .

Having recently returned from the Google Teacher Academy in New York and still basking in the memory of it all , I thought a 30 day series in conjunction with a short free online SchoolNet course on Google products would be very apt . ( Oh New York ! I can hardly believe that thriving metropolis is being ravashed by Hurricane Sandy . ) To get back to Google products , for me there is no better place to start than the Chrome browser . Have you tried Google Chrome ? I have three browsers installed on my computer ( Chrome , Internet Explorer and Firefox ) but Google Chrome has fast become my firm favourite because it is so much more than a browser . Not only is it fast but all these amazing extensions make it a BRILLIANT surfing experience . <p> How can I get started with Chrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teacher Academy , one of whom is Amy Meyer of ' Fried T echnology ' fame . I learned so much from her -- she was actually one of the Lead Learners as they were called in charge of a group of 6 . I really could n't explain Chrome better than her . Just tune in to the screencast video below -- you will be amazed at what this browser can achieve . Amy ( @friEdTechnology ) calls her presentation ' Google Chrome tips and tricks ' .

##1176450 <p> The International Child and Youth Care Network Reading for child and youth care people July 2006 Issue 90 Contents <p> CARE WORKERS <p> Overnight in the empty place <p> Megan Trone <p> The following log was written by Megan as she started to work overnight in a residential school . These overnights were done as part of team preparation , before youth came in to the program . It is a fine reflection of the experience of overnight work in a residence and we offer it here because there is so little information on working overnights in our field . It is out hope that it might stimulate others to offer their experiences of working overnights. -- Eds <p> Night One It 's now 12:42 on my first overnight shift . I 'm starting to feel like I could sleep for about 12 hours . My partner and I did a bunch of stuff around the school and that seemed to make the time go by faster . I think these nights could drag on and on when the kids actually get here because we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been making . I also fell off the bunk bed ( I was trying it out ) ... that kinda hurt and made me grumpy for a bit . Right now we 're taking a bit of a break ; I 'm doing some things on the computer while my partner is reading the staff communication log . <p> Now I feel like time is just standing still ... <p> It 's hard to anticipate what things will be like once we start getting kids in here . I 'm nervous and scared , but I 'm also really excited to see what kind of students we 're going to get here . I 'm also happy that I brought chocolate tonight . I think the sugar will give me a boost for a bit anyway . <p> So an hour has past now and I feel like I just got my second wind . We just put up some clocks , and the time just flew by . I like that feeling . Maybe the next 7 or so hours will go this fast . I hope so anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made all the white things in the laundry pink . I think I need to pay more attention to what I 'm doing . I 'm an idiot . Well we fixed that problem . Note to self : do n't put in red towels with white aprons . <p> I think being on nights alone would be tough -- and I get really nervous that we 're going to have to stay here alone one day . Its 3:30 now and I 'm starting to think I 'm going crazy . I was trying to stomp on a flying mosquito and we could n't stop laughing at that ... we 're still kinda laughing about it . Being with someone else is really helping me stay awake . I think I 'm at the point right now that if I do n't laugh at something then I 'd probably just pass out . <p> This place is creepy at night . I 've stayed here before during training , but I 've always been sleeping . I 've never noticed the strange noises from the kitchen area . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just walking out to my car to get my sweater ... I felt scared that something was going to run out at me . <p> It 's just strange being here so late and awake because I 'm used to so much going on during the day when I 'm working , and now on nights , there 's nothing going on , except us trying to stay awake by laughing and making coffee every 35 minutes . <p> Three and a half hours to go .... I feel like I 've been here for a damn decade . <p> I just realized something . The only times that I 've ever had to stay awake all night is when I 've been studying , or having to write a paper , or having to do research . I think that just sitting at the computer helps me stay awake . I 've done a bit of research tonight just for fun , and I 've also typed out things just to have them typed out instead of writing things out . I do n't know why I bothered writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? If I were home right now I could be sleeping . I keep thinking about everyone else right now who 's sleeping . Damn those people who get to sleep tonight . Urgh . <p> 6:30 am ... an hour and a half left . For some strange reason I feel like I could go for another 12 hours now . I 'm thinking about how tough tonight 's shift 's gon na be . I do n't think it 'll be as easy as this last one felt . I just hope I 'm able to sleep when I get home today .... <p> Well I made it though my very first night shift ever . I feel a bit tired and really delusional . I learned that things that we thought were funny in the middle of our shift really were n't funny at all ... and I should n't tell stories to the day workers because they just do n't get what I 'm talking about . But if laughing at was probably nothing kept me awake , that 's all that matters . <p> Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning was scary ... I was just so tired that I actually thought I was going to have to pull over and sleep for a while . Anyway , I made it home safely and I slept forever . It was nice . <p> It 's now 10 pm on my second night ... it 's been alright so far . I 'm just waiting to feel sleepy and wish that I was near my bed . I 've played guitar for most of the time that I 've been here . It 's been nice . <p> 3 am ... I 'm just about ready to drop . I 'm just sitting here listening to the clock and it 's kinda driving me nuts . I 'm feeling really uncomfortable and scared here again tonight . I just do n't like looking out the window and not being able to see what 's out there . I do n't like the dark . It 's creepy out there . There 's strange noises again like last night and now there 's more that I did n't notice before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area always sounds like someone 's walking around down there . I do n't like it . <p> I do n't think I 'm going to be able to stay up all night . Tonight 's not like last night . Last night I was more alert , and I laughed a lot , tonight I just want to crawl in a hole . <p> I think that depriving myself of sleep really is making me go insane . I 'm paranoid that there 's someone in the yard looking in the windows at us . That 's crazy . I think we need blinds in here or something . Every time I walk past the big window in here I catch a glimpse of a little bit of another staff 's car and it totally freaks me out . <p> Now it 's 3:15 . Could time go by any slower ? I feel like time is crawling now and that time is against me , going slower and slower just to piss me off . I 'm going to make some more coffee . I ca n't stand this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 am ... I think this is my favourite time of the morning . The sky is just becoming lighter again and it makes me feel a sense of accomplishment that I 've actually made it through another night . I know the night 's not over yet , but it just feels like I 'm closer to getting it done . <p> I love when I can start hearing the birds . They make me smile ... <p> It 's 6:40 ! Wow ! The night went by sooooo slow . I struggled quite a bit tonight trying to stay up ... waiting for the sun to start shining so I could know that I finally made it . <p> I think that trying to stay awake at night is a job in itself . I feel like I 've put in a days worth of hard work when I barely did anything . But I stayed awake . That 's what I needed to do , and now I 'm beat . Despite how much I slept during the day yesterday , last night was hard . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this I think ... when my days become my nights and my nights become my days . <p> I actually hallucinated tonight . I really thought that something was crawling up my arm . It was nothing , just my imagination . The first sober hallucination I 've ever had . Strange . <p> I 'm starting to not feel so uncomfortable here now that the sun 's starting to come out . I think it 's because I can now see that there 's no strange man staring in the window at me . It makes me feel safe now . <p> One hour left . Hurry up damnit . <p> Well it 's time to go home . I think I 'm going to stay here a bit longer because I 'm afraid to drive . I 'm sleepy . <p> Third Night I 'm a zombie . I did n't get enough sleep today , and the drive home was terrible despite me staying here an extra half hour this morning . I 'm tired and grumpy . This has turned into a bad week ... which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unfortunate news given to me tonight and now it looks like I have to head home tomorrow on my day off . <p> I do n't really feel as uncomfortable and scared here as I have the nights before . I took a walk earlier in the night just to stay awake and blow off some steam . It helped me realize that there are n't people staring in the window at me and that there really are n't people walking around in the kitchen . So I have a lot less anxiety about being here awake at night . There are still strange noises , but I think I 'm becoming used to them . <p> I was thinking that my next shift , which is Monday night , will probably be really different for me , and I 'll probably have to start writing an entire new log . We could have our first student here , and that will make the night totally different from the last three that I 've experienced . Over the past three nights , if I become tired , I go outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make noises , but Monday will be different . I wo n't be able to go outside for walks , or make noise and laugh about stupid things because I 'll actually have to care for someone . <p> I wonder how long it will take my body to get used to this shift . So far my body hates me and refuses to sleep past 3 pm , even when I know I really need it . Before I started doing these shifts I would think to myself how easy this transition will be . Ya , that 's real easy ! <p> It 's 5 am . Tonight flew by . I have a feeling though that the next 3 hours will drag on and on though because all I can think about is how much I miss my bed . Coffee is a magical thing . <p> The sky is starting to get lighter . I find when the sun actually does come up , my body thinks that it 's day time , time to get going and do things . But my brain is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body wins this fight most days though -- when I wake up I feel just as tired as I did when I went to bed , and I do n't make sense when I talk . If I had a hole to crawl into when I get home every morning , I think it would be different because sunlight would n't be allowed in . It would be a sound-proof hole too , so I could n't hear the neighborhood kids and the stupid ice cream trucks that come twice a day . That would be wonderful . I would defiantly sleep until 5 every night , like I really wish to be doing . <p> One hour left . The last 2 hours have gone by really slow and I 'm really looking forward to sleeping for a bit . I 'm happy that I have one night off . This seemed like a long stretch of days . I do n't think I minded it all that much though . The ride home this morning should n't be as bad as yesterday ... I feel more alert than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one night off did n't really do much . I had a hard time staying awake like usual , and I actually ended up sleeping at around 2:30 am , so that screwed up the rest of my day . So I can just imagine that tonight 's shift will be really hard unless I keep myself really busy . I actually have a bunch of things that I can work on tonight , and I 'm really looking forward to getting them started . Staying by the computer all night will help me stay awake and more alert , so I 'm happy that I feel like I have things to do . <p> It 's only 9:00 pm though , so I 've been here for an hour . This night better start going faster . <p> It 's 4 am and the night is going by really fast . I do n't feel as tired as I thought . I 'm still really on edge though , and the slightest thing scares me , but I am awake and at this point , that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As much as sometimes I hate that I need to be awake , I do actually enjoy the time spent here . I 've gotten to know my co-workers in ways that I would n't have known them if I were n't spending 12 hours each night trying to keep myself up and them at the same time . It 's been a very enjoyable experience and I actually do look forward to coming in each night . <p> Things happen at night that would n't normally happen throughout the day . The night is a strange time . The fact that we are going on next to no sleep kicks in and we 're acting crazy and laughing uncontrollably about everything . I 'm glad that I 've had this chance to get to know these few people on an entirely different level than I would with my own friends . <p> I think this will still change once students start arriving , but for now we can remember how crazy we were in the middle of the night . <p> I feel like calling people who are sleeping right @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##1176451 <p> The International Child and Youth Care Network Reading for child and youth care people August 2006 Issue 91 Contents <p> PRACTICE <p> Stop and think : the application of cognitive-behavioral approaches in work with young people <p> Peter Gabor and Carol Ing <p> Abstract : A general overview of cognitive-behavioral approaches is presented , along with a more detailed description of one approach . Applications with children and adolescents are considered . <p> For there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so . -- Shakespeare <p> Introduction Cognitive-behavioral approaches have become increasingly popular during the last two decades . These interventions are a group of related therapy systems , derived from the tenets of rational-emotive therapy developed by Ellis ( 1979 ) in reaction to the insight- and feeling-oriented approaches that once dominated the helping professions . Cognitive-behavioral approaches focus on cognition as covert behavior and take the view that people 's problems arise from their beliefs , evaluations , and interpretations regarding life events and situations ( Corey , 1986 ) . Irrational or negative thoughts and interpretations may lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavioral interventions is to modify negative cognitions . This process , it is asserted , leads to more positive feelings and performance . <p> This paper begins with a general overview of cognitive-behavioral approaches . A more detailed description of one influential approach , cognitive-behavior therapy ( Meichenbaum , 1977 ) , is then presented . Finally , the applicability and application of cognitive-behavioral approaches in work with children is considered and discussed . <p> OVERVIEW OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES As early as the first century A.D. , the philosopher Epictetus noted that " men are disturbed not by events , but by the views they take of them . " Cognitive-behavioral approaches are based on premises derived from this view ; they assume that " there is an essential interaction between the way individuals feel and behave and the way they construe their world , themselves , and prospects for the future " ( Freeman , 1987 , p. 19 ) . In essence , they hold that cognitive processes affect emotions and behavior . Thus negative thinking ( often called internal dialogue ) is likely to lead to emotional difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school student writing her first article for the student newspaper may worry that her work will not be " good enough " and that she will lose her position on the paper . These thoughts create so much anxiety and stress that her performance is inhibited and , indeed , the quality of the article is not nearly commensurate with her abilities . <p> Negative cognitions result from the uncritical acceptance of irrational standards in the form of " shoulds " or " musts " ( Ellis , 1967 ) . Generally these standards confuse wants with needs , desirable with necessary , and unfortunate with catastrophic . For example , many people believe that they need love and approval from all significant people in their life , even though that is an unrealistic expectation . They may want love and approval from these people , but they do not actually need them in the sense that they are indispensable to a happy life . Alternately , negative thinking may take the form of distortions in evaluating events and situations or in reasoning to conclusions . Such distortions may consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or catastrophizing ( Freeman &; Greenwood , 1987 ) . For example , a preadolescent who does not succeed in completely staying within the lines while coloring a picture may tear up the page in anger , judging it totally worthless . Or a junior-high-school student who is unable to win the approval of one of his teachers may over generalize and magnify the situation , thinking , " My teachers all hate me . " <p> The principal objective of cognitive-behavioral interventions is to change such irrational thinking , thereby reducing or eliminating its negative consequences : interfering or disturbing feelings and self-defeating or unproductive behaviors . Cognitions are regarded as covert behavior and are modified using such behavioral techniques as operant conditioning , modeling , and behavioral rehearsal ( Corey , 1986 ; Meichenbaum , 1977 ) . These approaches do not take a medical-model perspective and are thus not concerned with curing clients ; rather , the goal is to help clients cope more effectively with their life situations . <p> The role of the counsellor in cognitive-behavioral therapy is somewhat different from that inmost other therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Most striking is that the concept of relationship is de-emphasized in cognitive-behavioral therapy ; the counsellors role is primarily that of teacher . Cognitive-behavioral approaches emphasize the teaching of thinking and behavioral skills . Relationship is only important to the degree that it facilitates this objective . Thus , counsellors tend to be very active and didactic in their approach , using a variety of teaching techniques . Most importantly , they do not hesitate to challenge their clients ' thinking , logic , or conclusions . This is very different from many other approaches , in which one objective is to accept and reflect the client 's perspective . Far from providing such validation , cognitive-behavioral counsellors take issue with those attitudes , opinions , and feelings that they see as illogical , and urge their clients to abandon them . <p> Cognitive-behavioral interventions have been applied to a wide variety of child and adult populations in the treatment of a broad range of problems . These approaches , unlike many other approaches currently in use , have been extensively evaluated . Although , given space limitations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive-behavioral approaches have been found to have strong empirical support . <p> COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY As the foregoing description indicates , rational-emotive therapy ( RET ) is concerned with modifying or eliminating irrational beliefs . Although a variety of techniques are used , RET pays particular attention to central beliefs and relies heavily on the cognitive approach of disputation . A number of related therapeutic approaches have developed and modified both the concept of irrational beliefs and the mix of techniques utilized . For example , Beck 's ( 1976 ) cognitive therapy has replaced irrational beliefs with the concept of automatic thoughts that arise and lead to emotional or behavioral problems . The approach described by Beck is primarily cognitive , relying on challenging these thoughts through Socratic questioning . <p> A prominent and increasingly influential approach is cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT ) , an umbrella term for a number of related approaches , such as cognitive restructuring , cognitive behavior modification , and stress inoculation . Based heavily on the work of Meichenbaum ( 1977 , 1985 ) , CBT relies more heavily on behavioral approaches than RET or cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognition in the therapeutic process . However , in CBT the relevant cognitions are conceptualized as self-statements . <p> Meichenbaum 's approach is " grounded on the assumption that what people say to themselves directly influences the things that they do . The role of inner speech is given primary importance " ( Corey , 1986 , p. 230 ) . CBT shares with RET the view that distressing emotions and performance problems are the result of irrational thinking . However , this approach helps clients focus on their inner dialogue while experiencing disturbing feelings or performance problems , and has the goal of changing these self-statements and providing self-help techniques in order to help clients better cope in such situations . <p> Specifically , Meichenbaum uses a three-phase approach , as described below : <p> 1 . Self-observation : Clients are taught skills of self-observation to become more aware of their thoughts , feelings , physiological reactions , and behaviors . <p> 2 . Promotion of change : Clients learn to exchange negative inner dialogue for more constructive self-statements and also learn more adaptive behavioral skills . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidated and generalized and that relapse is avoided . To prevent relapse , attention is paid to teaching clients coping skills that can assist them to manage for themselves in similar troublesome situations in the future ( Corey , 1986 ; Meichenbaum , 1985 ) . <p> The Cognitive-Behavior Therapy Process Six main steps can be identified in the implementation of cognitive-behavior therapy ( Meichenbaum , 1977 , 1985 ) . The approach and the six process steps are illustrated in the following case example , in which the counsellor works with Adam , an 8-year-old boy experiencing peer relationship problems . Specifically , he is easily hurt and quickly angered by minor ( and imagined ) slights and provocation , and often starts fights as a result . Consequently , the other children avoid him or tease him , leading to yet more confrontations and hurt feelings . In the example , a combination of restructuring and coping techniques is used . <p> 1 . Provide the client with a rationale for an overview of the technique . During this step , the counsellor explains the difference between self-enhancing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and behaviors . Of course , it is important to take into account the cognitive developmental level of the client ; in the present case , the explanation was provided through the medium of a skit utilizing a stuffed animal . The plot was simple : A teddy bear who had not been invited to an animal picnic was saying , " No one likes me , " and consequently became even more sad and unhappy . At first the counsellor provided the action and dialogue ; the skit was then repeated with the child controlling and speaking for the animal . The counsellor then showed another bear , but this time the internal dialogue was , " I have been left behind and I do n't like it , but maybe I can find some way that I can have fun too . " Adam agreed that the second bear was less unhappy . Adam was then asked to create a happier ( or " smart " ) dialogue for a bear who had been left behind . His bear said , " I do n't know why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find some new friends who wo n't leave me behind . " <p> 2 . The counsellor helps the child to describe the problem situation and identify his or her thoughts at the time . The counsellor asked Adam to describe the problem situation , asking him to relate what he saw and heard . Depending on the verbal skills of the child , a variety of media , including drawing , puppetry , and role-play , may be used to arrive at a complete description of the events and the child 's thoughts . In this case , Adam related that " Chris called me names . He is not my friend ; he does n't like me ! " Adam was then asked , " You mean Chris told you he does n't like you ? " Adam conceded that he had not heard this but merely assumed it , based on the name calling . The counsellor then asked Adam to describe what he thought when he was called a name . He readily responded , " I did n't like it , " but was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counsellor used a role-play technique to re-enact the situation , and this revealed that Adam had also thought , " All the kids are always bugging me ; I 'll show them ! " The role play also identified that these thoughts led to feelings of hurt and anger . Adam then described what happened next : " I hit him ! He deserved it ! Then I got in trouble for hitting him . " <p> 3 . The client is asked to evaluate his or her thoughts as facilitating or self-defeating . The counsellor then asked Adam to consider the outcome of his thinking that he is always being " bugged " and that he will " show them . " The counsellor asked Adam to consider whether thinking in this way helped him get what he wanted or created a further problem for him . Adam readily saw that thinking that he " will show them " led him to hit Chris , which got him into trouble with his worker as well , making him feel even worse . <p> 4 . At this point the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client develop some " smart " thoughts that are more helpful . The connection between thoughts and feelings and behavior was again explained to Adam , this time with specific reference to his problem . The counsellor explained , " Adam , remember the two bears who were left behind from the picnic . Remember you told me that the bear who had the smart thoughts felt happier . Well , that 's how it works with people , too . When someone does something you do n't like -- calls you a name , maybe -- how you feel depends on what you tell yourself . You said to yourself that everybody always bugs you and you felt even more unhappy , so unhappy that you then hit Chris . You then got into trouble , which made you feel even worse . Now , you could think some smart thoughts instead , like the bear , and you wo n't feel as bad . You may not like being called a name but you wo n't feel as bad . " Adam was then asked if he could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some help from the counsellor , he finally came up with , " I do n't like it when kids call me names but at least they do n't pick on me as badly as they do on Brian . I am not going to let them get me so angry that I get into worse trouble ; I 'll stay in charge of my own feelings and behavior . " <p> 5 . Preparations are made to implement these new coping thoughts . A number of behavioral or cognitive techniques may be involved at this stage , in addition to substituting coping thoughts for self-defeating ones . Adam was provided an opportunity to practice using smart thoughts through role play with the counsellor . A situation in which Adam was the victim of name calling was role played , with the counsellor first taking the role of Adam . The counsellor then modeled the skills for Adam : " Oh oh . Chris has just called me a name again . He should n't be doing that , he always bugs me , I 'm ... But wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into trouble . I better think smart thoughts . OK , start by taking a deep slow breath . Good . I am already less angry . I 'll stay in charge , I 'm not going to let anyone get me into trouble . He called me a name . So what , he has done that before , I do n't like it but I can put up with it . I 'm just going to tell him I do n't like it ... There , I told him . I feel better . I did it ! Good job ! I did n't lose my cool ! " <p> Essential elements of the statement modeled above are ( 1 ) to help Adam recognize when he is making self-defeating statements and to use these as a cue to begin coping thoughts ; ( 2 ) to help Adam dissipate some of the tension and stress through deep breathing ; ( 3 ) to substitute coping thoughts for self-defeating ones ; and ( 4 ) to teach Adam to reinforce himself verbally for using positive internal dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play was repeated with Adam playing himself . The role play was repeated several times , until Adam had mastered the key aspects of the statement . <p> 6 . Implement the skills in an actual situation . Adam was then instructed to use the skills at least once during the week . At the next session , Adam was debriefed about the experience and reinforced for using the coping skills . Depending on the experience , Adam may be given further training in the implementation , the coping statement may be altered , or some other modification may be made . <p> Intervention Strategies The foregoing example illustrates a number of strategies used in CBT . Other strategies , not illustrated , are also frequently utilized . Cognitively oriented strategies are used to help clients test the reality of their cognitions , and behavioral techniques are used to change cognitions and behavior ( Freeman &; Greenwood , 1987 ) . Some of the most commonly used strategies are listed below ( Corey , 1986 ; Cormier &; Cormier , 1985 ; Freeman &; Greenwood , 1987 ) . <p> Clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the example above , Adam assumed , but had no evidence , that Chris did not like him . <p> Clients may be asked to generate and examine a list of options and choices . For example , Adam may have thought that he had no option but to get angry and strike out . <p> Clients may be asked to visualize an event in their mind 's eye . Such cognitive rehearsal can enhance performance . It could , for example , have been used in the example above , just prior to actual implementation of the coping skills . <p> Actual performance can be rehearsed , as was the case in the preparatory role play in the example . <p> Modeling by the counsellor can help clients obtain a concrete idea of the skill being taught and is also an effective method of teaching . <p> Relaxation , meditation , and breathing exercises can help clients gain control over , or at least reduce , stress and anxiety . <p> Positive reinforcement is useful in increasing the probability that newly learned skills will be used again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcement for himself immediately after using the skills , and the counsellor provides reinforcement at the beginning of the next session . <p> Considerations in Using Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches with Children and Adolescents Cognitive behavioral approaches were initially designed for adults , but very early on Ellis adopted his approach for work with children ( Grieger &; Boyd , 1980 ) . Since then , both RET and CBT have been applied to a wide range of child and adolescent problems . Although the basic tenets of these therapies remain unchanged , a number of unique issues do arise and need to be taken into account when implementing these approaches in work with young people . Among these are the nature and quality of the therapeutic relationship , the developmental stage reached by the young person , and the ecological context of the problem . <p> Perhaps the most important factor to bear in mind in working with children and adolescents is that they are seldom self-referred but have usually been referred by an adult ( Prout , 1983 ; Worchel , 1988 ) . As a consequence , they may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even acknowledge that a problem exists . Under such circumstances , the first step is to establish a relationship and to obtain some agreement to examine and work on problems or concerns ( Hughes , 1988 ; Worchel , 1988 ) . This is , of course , important in any helping relationship but is particularly crucial when using cognitive-behavioral approaches . These approaches are essentially collaborative , and their success depends largely on clients ' willingness to examine their beliefs and ideas and the assumptions underlying those beliefs and ideas . Involuntary clients , participating reluctantly or even grudgingly , are unlikely to enter into a meaningful self- examination . <p> Although relationships are considered to be of secondary importance in cognitive-behavioral approaches , it is important to get the relationship off on the right foot by putting the young person at ease , explaining what to expect , and easing his or her apprehensions ( Prout , 1983 ) . It is also important to move gradually into the process by dealing with non-threatening issues and by allowing the young person to initially define concerns ( Hughes , 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship is through the use of empathy statements ( Thompson &; Rudolph , 1988 ) . These responses convey that the counsellor understands the concerns expressed . While such responses are effective in relationship building , they also validate , to a degree , the young person 's perceptions . Hence , these responses are often inconsistent with the challenging and disputing responses called for by cognitive-behavioral interventions . The counsellor is thus caught in a dilemma : She wants to build a relationship with her young client , but she does not want to validate irrational thinking . There is no easy way out of this bind . Ultimately , the counsellor will have to challenge and dispute irrational or negative beliefs and self-statements . However , challenging prematurely may cause the young person to " shut down " or withdraw from participation in the helping process . As challenges are most effective in the context of a strong relationship ( Egan , 1988 ) , counsellors working with young people can not afford to ignore the relationship-building phase of therapy , even if that means postponing challenges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on the thought component of human functioning . Indeed , as has been shown , the modification of thoughts , beliefs , and philosophies is often accomplished through the application of logical analysis . Needless to say , this process requires a high level of cognitive ability on the part of the client . In work with children , however , counsellors are faced with the problem that the cognitive abilities of young people are often limited and depend greatly on the level of cognitive development reached ( Thompson &; Rudolph , 1988 ) . <p> Piaget 's work provides a widely used guide to the cognitive development of children . According to Piaget , children between the ages of 7 and 11 are in the concrete operations stage of cognitive development and have limited abilities with abstract concepts . Most are unable to clearly relate events to each other and have trouble considering hypothetical situations ( Thompson &; Rudolph , 1988 ) . Only around the age of 9 do most children develop the ability to step outside of themselves and reflect on their own thoughts and actions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the formal operations stage of cognitive development ( Worchel , 1988 ) . During this stage , children acquire the ability to think in the abstract , to recognize hypothetical problems , and to engage in logical , scientific experimentation and problem solving . However , they are limited by their experience and will sometimes reach unrealistic conclusions ( Worchel , 1988 ) . Evidently , young people who have reached this developmental level are more likely to be able to understand and follow the logic of cognitive-behavioral approaches and are cognitively more ready to examine and evaluate their own thoughts and behavior . <p> When one is using cognitive approaches , it is essential to be aware of the cognitive developmental level of the young client and to match techniques to that developmental level . Because not all children reach cognitive developmental milestones at the same time , and because many children receiving child welfare services are delayed in their development , it is important to assess the level of development of each client . In the case of children who have not yet reached the formal operations stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive abilities . <p> The most important adaptation is to provide visual aids and , where possible , concrete referents . These aids can include pictures , puppets , and skits . <p> Generally speaking , the verbal skills of pre-formal children may be somewhat limited , so the complexity of questions needs to be reduced , and it is important that the counsellor 's vocabulary be simple and jargon free . Children 's ability to communicate ( especially to describe complex events and ideas ) may also be limited by their small vocabulary , but communication can be facilitated through such media as role play , games , and drawing . <p> A third consideration is the context within which the child 's problems occur . Although cognitive-behavioral approaches are basically problem oriented and child centered , it is important to keep in mind that children react to their environment and have relatively little power or opportunity to eliminate or prevent environmental causes of problems ( Prout , 1983 ) . What is perceived as problematic functioning may , in fact , be a relatively normal reaction to a stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping efforts be exclusively aimed at bringing about changes in the young person ? Should the objective of helping be to change some aspect of the young person 's functioning or even to assist the young person to cope with a stressful situation ? Obviously , there are no easy answers to these questions . For example , in the case of a 10-year-old who disrupts in a classroom that objectively may be described as having an oppressive environment , there may , nevertheless , be some merit in working toward making the child 's behavior less disruptive or in helping the child to cope more effectively with the situation . However , it is arguable that the real target of intervention in such a case should be the classroom environment , a helping situation that is beyond the scope of individual therapy . In short , we should not assume that the child should always be the sole target of interventions . Counsellors employing cognitive-behavioral approaches need to differentiate between problems of the young person and problems of the environment . They must then ensure that the proper target has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONCLUDING COMMENTS Cognitive-behavioral approaches have been used with good results to help young people with a wide range of problems . These approaches make use of concrete , relatively specific interventions and , because of the way target problems are identified , appear to have very good evaluability . Their principal techniques are logical and straightforward , making it feasible to teach the skills both inservice and preservice . These features ensure that the approaches have considerable applicability in work with children and suggest that they are practical to implement within child and adolescent services . <p> Prout , H.T.

##1176651 <h> Newsroom/Press Releases/ <h> The DA ? s plan to increase the number of quality teachers <p> Annette Lovemore , Shadow Minister of Basic Education 1 November 2012 <p> In the World Economic Forum Financial Development report released yesterday , South Africa placed stone last for the quality of our math and science education . We ranked 62nd out of the 62 countries surveyed . <p> The significant reason for this is because we are not producing enough quality teachers , particularly in maths and science . <p> All South African children must be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to compete in a modern economy . <p> First and foremost , we need to produce enough quality teachers . Every year , we lose between 20 000 and 30 000 teachers ; our education system however only produces 10 000 new teachers a year at present . <p> We therefore face a crippling teacher shortage . The shortfall in teachers is especially severe in key subject areas like maths and science , impeding the education system 's ability to produce young people with the skills we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the Department of Basic Education 's ( DBE ) primary teacher-attraction tool , the Funza Lushaka Bursary Programme , is failing . Funza Lushaka is meant to attract young people to the teaching profession by offering bursary-for-work agreements . <p> Every year approximately 10 000 Funza Lushaka bursaries are awarded . Recipients of the bursaries are then required to teach at a public school for the same number of years for which they receive the bursary . <p> Poor planning has seen this resource fundamentally under-utilised . Very few of the bursars graduate timeously and even fewer actually become teachers . <p> In 2012 , only 26.5% of the graduated bursars were actually placed as teachers at public schools . This year the DBE expects only 2 837 students to qualify , approximately 31% of the intake four years previously . The placement rate , as history suggests , will be far lower . <p> It is unacceptable to have unemployed teaching graduates while our education system has large numbers of teacher vacancies . It not only means that Funza Lushaka is wastefully inefficient , but it also undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo can no longer be tolerated . <p> The DA therefore today proposes a set of reforms for the DBE 's Funza Lushaka Bursary Programme . This programme can be utilised to produce at least 10 000 new teachers every year on its own . It would mean introducing approximately 10 000 new teachers into the system every year instead of the current approximately 2 000 per year . <p> Funza Lushaka can not address our teacher shortfall single-handedly . If managed efficiently and effectively , however , it can go a long away towards alleviating the teacher shortage crisis and producing the quality teachers our learners and this country needs . <p> The DA 's proposals are as follows : <p> Strategic assessment of demand through accurate data : We propose a networked data capturing system in every province that all schools can access through the internet . Those schools that do not have the e-technology must be assisted by district offices to upload information . The system must capture learner and teacher information per school and geographical area and be updated at the start , middle and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate and useful enough data to track Funza Lushaka effectively . <p> Strategic recruitment and selection of students from high-demand areas : The post-graduation placement rate is very low with a key challenge being that graduates cite personal difficulties in relocating to the rural areas where they are often most needed . Aggressively recruiting students from high-demand and rural areas where they will subsequently be placed can alleviate this issue . <p> Comprehensive screening of applicants : The DBE must create an in-house selection and monitoring team to screen applications vigorously . Currently the composition of the selection team is ad hoc and dependent on institutions . A DBE team must take primary responsibility in assessing candidates and utilise industry tools such as psychometric testing to assist in selections . <p> Improve access to quality institutions : The DBE must assess and accredit quality tertiary institutions to train Funza Lushaka bursars . Bursars must be sent exclusively to these institutions that have been accredited . <p> Monitoring academic progress : The in-house selection and monitoring team must track the academic results of all Funza Lushaka bursars to determine and facilitate academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The current model is failing to place all Funza Lushaka graduates , even as the vacancy rate continues to climb . This is attributable to the administrative difficulties associated with placing thousands of graduates in the short space of time between their graduation and the commencement of the new school year . The DBE must cooperate with provincial education departments to fill teacher vacancies as part of the post provisioning process that occurs at the end of every year , which will allow for placement in advance . <p> Better post-placement retention strategies : Many teachers are leaving the teaching profession due to frustration and dissatisfaction . The Western Cape has provided an excellent model to improve its teacher retention rate . This model must be expanded to the rest of the country . <p> The DBE must seriously consider these proposed reforms . I will call for a meeting with the Minister of Basic Education , Angie Motshekga , to discuss these proposals . I will request that the Minister convene a special task team to extensively assess the Funza Lushaka programme and consider our proposals to fix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic legacy of apartheid . But we can not offer decent education without enough teachers . <p> We will therefore submit these proposals with the utmost urgency in order to fix Funza Lushaka and to

Nkandlagate ? <p> Reports today reveal that skeletons continue to tumble out of President Zuma 's Nkandla closet .

Misleading parliament and the very serious nature of this scandal would fully justify the Speaker taking such drastic action . <p> It can not be acceptable that President Zuma told Parliament on 15 November 2012 in response to my question that he was personally covering the costs , and that government departments were responsible only for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that : <p> President Zuma was indeed aware of the upgrades and the details of the upgrade , and specifically , that some of the projects were clearly not for security .

##1186850 <p> When he was born is unknown . 1875 is one of the dates previously mentioned , but this is clearly incorrect particularly if one considers the obituary written by D. E. Mbane that appeared in Imvo Zabantsundu following Sontonga 's death on 18 April 1905 . Mbane mentions that Sontonga was thirty-three years old when he died , which means that he must have been born in 1872 . " He was not sick , except for a stomach ache . He was always saying he was going to die . " On that account , he asked his wife one Sunday to take a photograph of him , but she had a toothache . As a result , he went to a professional photographer to have his portrait taken . His obituary mentions that he was a preacher and photographer . He was survived by his wife and a child . <p> Sontonga was born in Uitenhage and not at Lovedale Institution in Alice , as was previously believed . He was a member of the Mpinga clan ( isiduko ) , which makes him Mpondomise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after being trained as a teacher at Lovedale , he was sent by the elders of the Methodist Church by ox wagon to Johannesburg , where he became an assistant teacher and choirmaster at the newly founded Methodist Church in Nancefield . According to his obituary , at the time of his death he was the choirmaster at the Rev. P. J. Mzimba Church in Johannesburg <p> Sontonga had a gift for song . He composed pieces , words and music for the use of his pupils at public entertainments . He wrote his compositions down in Tonic Sol-fa on odd sheets of paper , including Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika , and eventually collected them into an exercise book with a view to publishing them . However , he died before he could achieve his ambition . He only wrote the first verse of Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika . The Xhosa poet laureate , S. E. K. Mqhayi ( 1875-1945 ) , wrote the additional seven verses of the hymn . Composed in 1897 , Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika was publicly sung in 1899 at the ordination of the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also commonly sung in Native Day Schools . The Ohlange Zulu Choir , which was founded by Rev. J. L. Dube , presented the hymn at concerts in Johannesburg and further popularised it . <p> Sontonga 's portrait has an interesting history . In the early 1930 's Professor D. D. T. Jabavu ( 1885-1959 ) , of Fort Hare University , was approached by the editor of Lovedale Press , Mr Shepherd , for a portrait of E. M. Sontonga to be used in a forthcoming publication of sheet music devoted to Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika and its history . In a letter dated 17 March 1934 Professor Jabavu informed Mr Shepherd that he had found a negative of a photograph of Sontonga taken by a Johannesburg photographer , S. Govo , who was a former Lovedale student , and he was forwarding a copy to Lovedale Press .

##1189150 <h> Umgungundlovu District Municipality vs . The Times <p> This ruling is based on the written submissions of Mr T. Khuzwayo , municipal manager of the Umgungundlovu District Municipality ( UDM ) , and The Times newspaper . <p> Complaint <p> The UDM complains about a story in The Times on 15 June 2012 and headlined No cash for basic services , R11m for car hire . <p> The municipality complains that the : <p> allegation that staff members had to bring their own toilet paper to work was reported out of context ; <p> journalist failed to indicate direct quotations from a speech or written reply , resulting in " no distinction between facts , opinion and rumours " ; <p> journalist failed to verify any of the information with the municipality ; <p> story disregarded the dignity and reputation of the municipality , the mayor and the municipal manager ; <p> story suppressed and distorted relevant facts ; <p> story linked three unrelated issues , thereby creating the wrong impression about financial spending ; and <p> headline and caption were sensationalistic and did not reasonably reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , written by Thando Mgaga , was about the UDM spending more than R11 million of ratepayers ' money on the hiring of cars over a period of approximately five years , while it allegedly failed to provide proper service delivery to the public . It was based on a question-and-answer session in Parliament . <p> Bringing own toilet paper to work <p> The sentence in dispute reads : " At the time municipal staff complained that there was no money to buy stationery ... and that they were forced to bring their own toilet paper to work because the municipality could not afford to provide it . " <p> The UDM complains that this statement was out of context as the journalist omitted to mention that this had happened under the previous administration . <p> The Times denies that the sentence was out of context and argues that the words : <p> " at the time " pointed to the previous administration ; and <p> " was once " in the caption referred to the same period . <p> The caption states : " A KwaZulu-Natal municipality that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own toilet paper to work has spent more than R11-million on luxury car hire over the past five years . " ( emphasis added ) <p> The UDM replies that the fact that it was at some point cash-strapped or that its employees had to bring their own toilet paper was not mentioned in Parliament -- as such the latter reference was out of context and was brought in to intentionally sensationalise the story . <p> These are my considerations : <p> The journalist could have reported on the toilet paper issue , even though it was not mentioned in the Parliamentary debate -- reporters often bring in facts to put matters into perspective ; <p> The fact that members of staff somewhere in the past had to bring their own toilet paper to work is not in dispute -- which makes the reportage accurate ; and <p> The sentence in dispute was preceded by a reference to " since 2008 " -- clearly , this sentence refers back to that year . <p> Let 's read the sentence in dispute carefully . The newspaper is correct -- the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 " , when the mayor started to hire Mercedes E-class vehicles . <p> Even though the story did not mention that the UDM had been under a different administration at the time of the toilet paper issue ( and it would have been better if it did ) , the fact that it linked it to a period of four years ago should have been enough for the ordinary reader to have understood the situation correctly . <p> Failing to indicate direct quotations <p> The story quoted DA caucus leader Sizwe Mchunu regarding some expenditures ; and it made some statements that were not directly attributed to sources . <p> The UDM complains that the journalist failed to indicate direct quotations from a speech or written reply of Mchunu . It states : " As a result , there is no distinction between facts , opinion and rumours " in the story . It also complains that it is not clear to whom certain statements were attributed . <p> The newspaper argues that a proper reading of the story does not allow for such an interpretation . It says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second sentence referred Dube 's written reply , and states that Mchunu 's comments clearly were quotations from the former 's written reply . " In the circumstances , we deny that there is no distinction between facts , opinion and rumours as alleged . " <p> The UDM responds that the sentences in dispute were incorrectly punctuated as the quotations were not closed at the end of sentences . It also says that one can assume that the words in inverted commas came from Mchunu , but also that these could have been the views of a random spectator or even of the journalist herself . <p> Firstly , it is normal journalistic practice not to use inverted commas at the end of paragraphs when the following sentence comes from the same source , and to close the quote only at the very end of the quotation . <p> One also needs to look at what preceded the sentences in inverted commas , as well as how they were ended off . It started by saying that Mchunu quoted an MEC 's written reply . Then the quotation read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same person was speaking ( Mchunu ) . At the end of the quotation , the words " Mchunu said " appeared . <p> There is only one person to whom the words in inverted commas can be ascribed to , and that is Mchunu . <p> As for the unattributed sentences : The UDM merely complains that it is unclear where the information comes from , and not about the accuracy of these statements . I therefore accept that they were accurate , in which case the story did not have to attribute them to a source . <p> Failing to verify <p> The UDM complains that the journalist failed to verify any of the information with the municipality , despite the fact that he knew what the municipal manager 's contact details were , and despite some " serious publicity " and the ethical and legal ramifications of the report . <p> The Times says that the story was based on a Parliamentary reply to a question from the DA , and argues that it had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The newspaper adds : " ... and we obtained the government 's views on the subject matter in the reply " . <p> This is normal journalistic practice . When doing Parliamentary reporting , like court reporting , the press normally does not ask people for comment -- unless , of course , a statement is highly controversial and newsworthy . I am therefore not going to blame the newspaper for not getting the UDM 's comments . <p> Disregarding dignity , reputation <p> The UDM says that the journalist disregarded the dignity and the reputation of the : <p> municipality by failing to obtain its views -- a reputation that it " worked so hard to rebuild " ; <p> mayor by stating that he used luxury vehicles while members of staff allegedly had no toilet paper or equipment ; and <p> municipal manager by portraying the municipality as one that was not only historically mismanaged , but also as one that continued to be mismanaged . <p> The Times denies these allegations and states that the story was truthful , accurate , based on facts and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have formed an adverse opinion of the institution and that its dignity , as well as that of the mayor , was ( unnecessarily ) harmed as a direct result of how the story was written . <p> On each of the three bullets referred to above : <p> I have already ruled that The Times was under no obligation to ask the UDM for comment -- which leads me to the conclusion that this part of the complaint has no legs to stand on ; <p> I have also decided that the reference to toilet paper can reasonably be interpreted as dating back to some four years ago , and that this issue actually happened ; and <p> The story did not state it as fact that the UDM continued to be mismanaged , but attributed it to a source . <p> Relevant facts suppressed , distorted <p> The UDM complains that relevant facts that were in the public domain were suppressed and distorted , such as budget allocations and the municipality 's service delivery track record . The municipality says that this was due to subjective reportage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the municipality says that the journalist neglected to report positive facts and deliberately put it in a negative light . For example : <p> The UDM has since 2007 achieved four consecutive unqualified audit reports ; <p> 91% of its citizens have access to water and 80% to sanitation ; <p> The UDM has attracted a R138 million grant from the Dutch Government ; <p> It enjoys a Blue Drop Status as a water services provider ; and <p> It is financially stable and even has reserves in investment accounts . <p> This information indeed sounds good and perhaps needs to be reported . However , the purpose of the story was not to highlight the improvement that apparently took place under the present UDM 's administration -- if it was , it would have been necessary to make some comparisons and to focus the improvements . However , the story was written to highlight the issue of luxury car hire expenditure against the background of some financial problems , even if those problems occurred some time ago . The newspaper was therefore under no obligation to report all these positives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complains that the journalist linked three unrelated issues ( cash for basic services , staff complaints and the hire of vehicles ) , creating the impression that the municipality used money allocated for basic services to hire vehicles . It says : " The manner in which this was done amounts to an indirect expression of the journalist 's own opinions and a criticism of the Municipality . " <p> The Times says that Art . 8.1 of the Press Code allows for comment and criticism , and states that it complied with this section . <p> The newspaper 's argument is irrelevant , as Art . 8.1 is about comment ( such as in an editorial or a column ) , while the story in dispute is hard news . <p> However , the complaint is without substance . The three " unrelated " issues are not really unrelated , as they all form part of the UDM 's administration . There is nothing wrong in mentioning all three matters . <p> Headline , caption <p> The headline reads : No cash for basic services , R11m for car hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once so cash-strapped that its employees had to bring their own toilet paper to work has spent more than R11-million on luxury car hire over the past five years . " <p> The UDM complains that these were sensationalistic and did not reasonably reflect the content of the story . It also notes that , while the story is about a Parliamentary debate , the caption is about something else and therefore it does not reflect the content of the story . <p> The Times denies this and argues : " The article is cantered around how much money was used by the complainant and his opinion on how the money should have been utilized . " <p> Firstly , the headline : The " R11m for care hire " is not in dispute and it merely reflected what the story says ( as required by the Press Code ) . <p> However , it inaccurately and unfairly presented the " no cash for basic services " as fact , not as an opinion ( which can be ascribed to Mchunu ) . <p> There was nothing wrong with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story said . The fact that the improved situation at the UDM was not contained in the caption surely is not the writer of the caption 's fault . <p> Finding <p> The first part of the headline is in breach of Art . 1.1 of the Press Code that states : " The press shall be obliged to report news ... accurately and fairly . " <p> The rest of the complaint is dismissed . <p> Sanction <p> The Times is cautioned for inaccurately and unfairly stating in its headline an opinion as fact . <p> The newspaper is directed to publish a summary of this finding ( not the full ruling ) and the sanction . After setting the context , the story should start with what the newspaper got wrong . After that , it is free to elaborate on the parts of the complaint that were dismissed . <p> The newspaper should furnish our office with the text prior to publication .

' ( 17MR350 ) <p> In order to appreciate this statement in its true light , we need to realise that the laws of health constitute an integral part of God 's Ten Commandment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is just as much a sin to violate the laws of our being as to break one of the Ten Commandments , for we can not do either without breaking God 's law . ' ( 2T70 , 71 ) <p> It is clear , therefore , that if we do not enthusiastically embrace God 's health message , and if we do not start educating the world in regard to the principles of life that have been entrusted to us , many are going to be afflicted with the final plagues - and we who have been given this precious light , and who are taking it so much for granted , are surely going to be held responsible for their suffering . <p> In this regard , we need to be reminded that . . . <p> The time of Noah prefigures the present age . ' ( ST04-01-86 ) <p> This is why , . . . <p> If we look at the picture of the days that were before the flood , and then turn our attention to the habits and practices of society to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the plagues of the last days . ' ( CS135 ) <p> Just as it was in the case of Noah , so it is with God 's church today , we have been commissioned to give warning to the world regarding the coming flood - except this time it is going to be a flood of disease . Like Noah , our task is to invite all who would hear to enter " the last-day ark . " This " ark " is an immune system that has been boosted by right living - for this alone will carry us through the deluge of disease that will soon flood our planet . The only way that we can build this ark is through strict compliance with the laws of life - which laws form the basis of our health message . <p> As it was in the days of Noah , so it will be in the days before the final flood - there will be scoffers who will ridicule our every move , they will brand the " immune system ark-builders " as fanatics , and even scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's laws of health . But when the storm finally comes , all too many will be floundering outside the door of the ark - but it will be too late . <p> " Solemn events before us are yet to transpire . Trumpet after trumpet is to be sounded ; vial after vial poured out one after another upon the inhabitants of the earth . " ( 3SM426 ) <p> " The world is soon to be left by the angel of mercy and the seven last plagues are to be poured out . . . . The bolts of God 's wrath are soon to fall , and when He shall begin to punish the transgressors there will be no period of respite until the end . " ( TM182 ) <p> Comment By A. T. Jones <p> We are living in view of another fearful fact , that is , if that message which we are now to give , is not received , it has attached to it the fearful consequences that the wine of the wrath of God will be received . . . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform that it has not yet had ? When the health reform was given to the people of God , it was defined as that which is to fit a people for translation . . . But we have to go through the seven last plagues before we are translated ; and if a man 's blood is impure and full of gross material will he be able to pass through that time , when the air is sick with pestilence ? Indeed he can not . ' ( A. T. Jones ) <p> Food For Meditation <p> We shall soon reach a time when we must understand the meaning of a simple diet .

We need to study the art of preparing in a simple manner the fruits , grains , and vegetables . We do not need these complex combinations that are provided .

##1197151 <h> Men at the Side of the Road <p> The phrase " I 'm going out quickly to pick up some guys " will be familiar to many South Africans whose parents manage their own minor building or major gardening projects . <p> The next step works like this : Dad departs with an empty bakkie and returns an hour later with an assortment of men riding in the back . <p> These men are most probably the men at the side of the road . They gather at well known pick-up points on the side of the road from Monday to Saturday , and wait in the hope of getting casual labour work from builders or the public . The men 's labour is cheap and casual -- a problem for them . For the employers , the hitch was that the men they hired were often unreliable or unskilled . Some those who claimed to be bricklayers or gardeners and so on were only saying they had the skills required in a desperate attempt to get a day 's work . <p> In 2005 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men standing at the side of the road waiting for work has only grown . Hard figures are hard to come by , but it 's estimated that , on a daily basis , about 200 000 men gather in groups on curbs across South Africa in the hope of temporary relief from joblessness . They freelance with only their labour to sell . <p> But things are changing for the better for some of these men through the work of a fairly new but fast growing organisation called , literally , Men at the Side of the Road ( MSR for short ) . <h> How MSR was set up <p> The idea of providing training , tools and backup for men at the side of the roadway sounds like an obvious project idea for one of South Africa 's non-governmental organisations , but MSR was only set up about three-and-a-half years back , when Charles Maisel hit on the idea . <p> Charles studied Economics at university . He credits his strong mentors with nudging him in the direction of the organisational development field . Though the MSR project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johannesburg than anywhere else ) the man who started Men at the Side of the Road is a born and bred Capetonian who is still based in South Africa 's mother city , where he lives with his family . <p> Since graduating 12 years ago , and before MSR existed , Charles gravitated towards the developmental business rather than profit-taking . His work focused on developing models for social upliftment enterprises , or as he puts it : " ... looking at big problems and trying to develop bigger solutions . " <p> Some previous projects included developing housing schemes , addressing the crucial issue of domestic violence , setting up big grassroots savings schemes and introducing alternative retail models in the townships . He has assisted in launching The Great Ideas Company , which looks at youth creativity and innovation in youth entrepreneurship . And he 's done a lot of research into unemployment and related issues . <p> Charles started MSR when he noticed a trend while working on other projects over the years . " Every year there are just more men standing on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate grew , the number of people beside the road grew and this was countrywide -- in small towns as well as in big urban areas . " <p> Extreme weather conditions , exploitative working conditions , bad pay or non-payment of wages , harassment by police and low skills and educational levels are just some of the net of problems that threaten to trap casually employed labourers , who range in age from 16 to 55 years . Charles began a project to investigate ways to improve their lot . <p> " We spent a year talking to the guys on the side of the road , and then we got a bit of funding and we slowly built the model to what it is today . " <p> Initial European-based financial supporters included a Catholic-based funder called Catholic Welfare and Development ( CWD ) , where Charles had an existing connection , and local corporate funders , among them the Pick ' n Pay-linked Ackerman Foundation . <p> " Even though we were dealing with unemployment , a big problem was that our target group was 99 percent male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The trick was to get funders to realise how the high level of male unemployment negatively affects the lives of all those linked to them . In South Africa 's often patriarchal society where men 's pride is often ( rightly or wrongly ) tied to the idea of them being the head of the household and the chief breadwinners there is great shame in being unemployed . <p> " A lot of men do n't actually cope with the whole issue of not being able to work . I think it 's just one of those very masculine things . And that 's why they go and stand on the side of the road every day . Because going to the side of the road is like having a job when you do n't have a job , " Charles explains . <p> Gradually , funders came round to the holistic benefits of the project . And yes , the extremely rising unemployment rate has certainly helped MSR argue their case for making casual workers ' lives easier . Successes and failures and compromises <p> So what level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in improving peoples ' lives ? <p> " Our initial objective was to make the people on the side of the road visible , instead of seeing millions of cars just driving past . And I think we 've achieved that in a big way , " says Charles . " We get national government support now as far as funding goes , and the public where we operate do know about us . " <p> The workers themselves are also getting to know about the organisation , though there is a long way to go . About 20% of the 200 000 men -- about 40 000 men -- who stand at the side of the road every day at 500 sites ( 170 in Johannesburg ) have been reached by MSR , in just over two years ' work . UNISA is currently completing a project that provides more reliable figures which will assist MSR further . <p> The Tools Project collects used tools from nurseries and from the public . In a year , Men at the Side of the Road collected 50 000 tools around South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , and no longer waited empty-handed . The project also raised much- needed public awareness . <p> The organisation has managed to deal with the police harassment problems and negotiate a truce so that the men waiting for work are no longer treated like vagrants . <p> Various small projects rather than one grand scheme seek to exploit gaps in the employment markets , or to semi-formalise the fulfillment of existing needs . <p> For example , Uncle Bob 's will clean you out -- with your consent of course . If you 're moving house , or just need your garage cleared , Uncle Bob 's will send a team of men to remove the unwanted and unused stuff stored in your garage . Everything there will be sold for funding or added to the tools library . And when did you ever do anything with it , apart from trip over it on the way to your car door in the morning ? <p> Training programmes have made a huge impact and are linked to a placement programme . Fees charged for placements provide additional income for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public 's fears of hiring strangers and to increase the men 's chances of getting work , members can join a casual workers ' federation called the " Masiphumelele Unemployed Federation " which is about 800-odd members strong and growing . Members carry ID cards and are subject to some security checks . In addition , MSR puts together qualified teams -- a building team for example -- who come with their own supervisors . <p> Men at the Side of the Road -- despite initial ethical issues that sponsors may have had about sponsoring only men -- have won numerous international awards for their work . Just to list a few : The AAG fund ( United Nations ) award for the best pioneering project in the worlds , as well as other smaller awards . They are currently shortlisted for the Shell Global Challenge for the Top Global Project Award , as well as for the Global Development Network 's top project award . <p> Of course , not every idea is a good idea , no matter how much sense it makes on paper . MSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where men waited for work . Neither residents nor council were amenable . Charles is quick to acknowledge the mistake of trying to set up permanent waiting places without the support of council . <p> Figuring out where to fit in with the labour markets has also been difficult . Although the MSR 's Masiphumelele Unemployed Federation help negotiate temporary wage and employment conditions , they are not aligned to COSATU or other labour unions . As Charles puts it , " We could never be allies . Our guys want their guys ' jobs ! " But MSR 's people do meet with COSATU , and mutually support each other where possible without officially being affiliates . <h> Client experiences <p> Judy Lovemore , a freelance landscaper or " garden stylist " hired guys from Men at the Side of the Road 's gardening team to help her with the revamp of a neglected garden in Rondebosch , Cape Town . She was hugely impressed with the teams of four people provided each day . As she supervised the men herself , she noticed that each day , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that she did n't have to explain the job from scratch . She also commented that MSR sent a mix language team with at least one English speaker , to make her life easier as well as to help the men learn language skills on the job . She also felt safe working with the men . <p> " For me to be alone in a garden with a bunch of men that I do n't know can be quite threatening . " She explains . " To literally stop on the side of the road ... I would never do it . Men at the Side of the Road give me a facility that otherwise I would n't have . " <p> Not everyone interviewed was as positive as Judy was . Susan Pardew , managing director of Greenways Hotel , hired MSR 's gardening team recently . The team accidentally weeded out grass that had carefully been planted and nurtured between paving stones near the swimming pool . " It 's a mess " , Susan says . <p> However , because MSR did good follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan says she would n't rule out hiring them again . She admits she did n't deal with the team herself , and that they may not have been properly briefed by her staff . She says she would make sure the men were supervised by someone from the hotel in future . Organisational growth -- the way forward <p> Men at The Side of the Road have no plans to launch Women at the Side of the Road -- though women may join MSR 's worker training schemes if they wish to . <p> Men at the Side of the Road currently employs 20 people permanently . About a third of these people were originally Men on the Side of the Road . Charles sees the ultimate goal of the organisation as becoming sufficient within itself , so that he can let go and move on to new projects . <p> New leadership development has already begun . <p> Vuyisile Dyolatana is one staff member who 's gone from unemployment to a steady job running MSR 's gardener training course . He met up with field worker Ian Veary while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for a landscaping company , so I have a lot of experience , " he says . He also helps get men standing on the side of the road involved in training . <p> " Many are interested , " Vuyisile says . " We change their lives . My life also changed . Two years ago I had no job . Now I am permanent . I am working full time , and helping other people

##1859152 <p> The ECOWAS Commission has called on Member States to support the implementation of regional Policy and Plan of Action for Child Protection and Child Trafficking as entry points for addressing the challenges related to the protection of the rights of women and children in the region . <p> In an address to the opening of a three-day training workshop in Abuja on Monday 26th November 2012 , for Member States on the Implementation of the Policy and Action Plan , the ECOWAS Commissioner for Human Development and Gender , Dr. Adrienne Diop , said the Commission has adopted an approach that recognizes the linkages between child protection , trafficking in persons and child labour . <p> In the address delivered on her behalf by the Director of Humanitarian Affairs , Dr. Daniel Eklu , the Commissioner noted that the three elements were each anchored by the Child Policy and Action Plan , ( now the Child Protection Monitoring and Evaluation Framework , which was validated a month ago ) , Trafficking in Persons Plan of Action and Policy on Protection and Assistance to victims of human trafficking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , she said , " constitute a tripod upon which the effort for the protection of children and other vulnerable groups rest . " <p> The Commissioner said the meeting was to serve a dual purpose of " examining the Synthesis Report emanating from implementation of the ECOWAS Counter Trafficking Plan of Action in the past year , and developing the capacities of participants for both the implementation of the Trafficking in Persons Plan of Action and comparable measures to ensure the protection of children in the region . <p> This will enable Member States to effectively address the causative factors of child trafficking , she said , adding that there is the possibility that the " very infrastructure established to combat trafficking , may in appropriate cases be targeted at a number of these causes as well , and the same may be said for employing mechanisms " established to deal with the issues related to human trafficking . <p> The Commissioner said the training will also afford the opportunity for familiarization with the frameworks within ECOWAS for counter-trafficking and child protection , and throw up strategies required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A representative of the International Labour Organization , Mr. Krishnamoortht Kukkikatte highlighted factors hindering the welfare and development of children in West Africa , such as exploitation , including trafficking and various forms of child labour . <p> He called for support for ECOWAS ' initiatives and the implementation of the regional Policy and Action Plan by Member States . <p> Speaking in the same vein , Mr. Martin Ocaga of the International Organization for Migration , said the UN agency fully supported ECOWAS ' efforts " to achieve a Child Protection Framework System for Member States that will ensure an environment where girls and boys are free from violence , exploitation , and abuse , and where laws , services , behaviours and practices minimize children 's vulnerability , address known risk factors and strengthen children 's own resilience .

##1860452 <p> That is a decision you and I and the six members of the Bowls South Africa executive are going to have to make if you vote for the swipe card system in August at the annual general meeting . Did you notice I said " If you vote " <p> Let me answer that question first for I have noticed some disturbing things happening in the corridors of power in districts in the past few weeks . <p> A large number of suggestions for consideration at the annual general meeting in August have reached the doors of Bowls South Africa in Rosebank . Some of them are quite radical , some of them are downright ridiculous , and some of them have some merit . <p> You will be hearing more about them in the next few weeks as I analyse them . But right now I have to ask you if you know anything at all about them ? Probably not , because you have not been consulted . <p> Let me ask you another question : As a registered bowler in your club and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to run in this country ? Of course you must do so or you could not ( technically speaking ) play bowls on any of the registered greens in the country . <p> So really you are a shareholder in Bowls South Africa ? So you should know what the people you have chosen to run your district are doing and what they are proposing to do in the future ? Right ? <p> So do you know ? Probably not . Have you been consulted about some serious changes that , if accepted , are going to make a huge difference to you and how you pay and play for this game ? Probably not . <p> Do you think you have a right to know and vote on these matters ? Of course you do . After all , it is you who is paying . <p> So what are you going to do about it ? Just sit back again and let things take the course these people have charted ? Or will you do something about it by asking questions and saying that you too want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and then consider what you would do with the R5 million Bowls South Africa will receive from the sponsors of the swipe card system we first told you about last week . <p> Yes , in addition to the R1,5 million promised for development , the national body , which embraces all of us registered bowlers , will receive bridging finance of R5 million . That is a lot of lolly . But that is the faith the financial institution involved has in the future of bowls . <p> But first we as bowlers have to make the commitment to accept the swipe card system . This week I asked the executive of Bowls South Africa what they intend to do with the R5 million . This is what they told me . <p> Their first priority , without any question , is the repayment of the World Bowls loan . Now I know many of us have not actually paid that money . Our districts in their wisdom decided to pay and perhaps recover it from us in some other way . I am one of them , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my district used their reserves to pay it . <p> So that will take care of R1 million straight off . Next on their long list of needs is an increase in the payment of tournament expenses and prize monies . That will take care of R750 000 . <p> The next big outlay will be for the provision of a monthly bowls programme on television . That also has a R750 000 budget . <p> Now I know you have all got your pocket calculators out so I can tell you that adds up to R4 560 000 . <p> In a note to the table given to me the executive says any surplus will be carried forward to the next year , together with an amount from the second year subscriptions , toward hosting the African States and Atlantic Rim tournaments . The Atlantic Rim is considered important for the womens national side because of the relative lack of international exposure available to them . That could cost R400 000 . <p> The main benefit of the executive proposal is that additional funds will enable them to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed card system will also have the advantage of discovering many unregistered and " ghost " bowlers who will be obliged to carry their cards , register , and also pay subscriptions . <p> Also remember , the amount of R1,5 million earmarked for development is not part of this amount . That is a separate entity , and in addition to paying the expenses and projects of the national development committee , an amount roughly equivalent to R30 per registered bowler will be made available to districts for use on specific planned and budgeted district development projects . <p> In his letter to bowlers last week John McArdle stressed that communication was one of the most important aspects of the new look and I am very excited to learn the sponsoring company is to involve itself in providing an electronic media facility for Bowls South Africa . <p> It is my belief that much of the discontent in bowls today stems from a lack of communication . John McArdle has started an improvement with his letter to bowlers . The establishment of Internet pages about South African bowls will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowlers just have to log on to the Internet and view what they want to know is going on at the Bowls South Africa offices , the districts and perhaps even their own club . <p> If I were to play a part in this project I would like to be sure that bowlers would be able to open up these web pages at any time and know just what is happening in bowls ; what is happening to their friends and fellow club members who are competing perhaps in another town ; to be able to settle those endless arguments about who won what and where and when ; and also to be able to send an e-mail to the president of Bowls South Africa and get a prompt reply . Now that is what I could call communication . <p> For too long we have suffered from a lack of news about this game we all purport to love . The electronic media is there , it is cheap and we must be using it . <p> But all this is not going to happen if we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know where your vote is going by ensuring your involvement now . <p> Over the next few weeks I know that I am probably not going to be flavour of the week with the mother-grundies , the cheapskates and others who think the system is all wrong , but I sit in a unique position as it can make little difference to me . <p> I can never play bowls for South Africa ( I probably would have difficulty catching the eyes of the selectors for inclusion in a chicken morning side ) but I have devoted many years to writing about this game and believe the people who have put this plan together are on the right track and it deserves the support of you , the bowler . <p> PS . Do me a favour though . Make sure the people who are going to vote for or against this proposal in August know how you feel about it and do
