Alison Redford , candidate for the leadership of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party , is one who apparently gets it . Carol Haley , former Conservative MLA for Airdrie-Chestermere and now Premier Ed Stelmach 's deputy chief of staff , clearly does not . <p> Despite the bad example set by past candidates for the Tory leadership and no doubt some pressure to conform to their ways for the time being , Ms. Redford last week did the r ight thing and published a list of the biggest donors to her campaign . <p> The list made the news in a fairly big way , both because of the size of the donations and the names of some of the people who contributed . <p> Now , we ought n't to make too much of this . The party 's current rules say she 's going to have to publish the list sooner or later -- later being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others have promised to do the same thing , eventually . <p> But from Ms. Redford 's point of view , there was clearly a certain amount of risk involved in her decision to release this information now . First of all , because it shows that while the former justice minister and MLA for Calgary-Elbow may not be the candidate favoured by the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party establishment , she is backed by plenty of members of the plain old Calgary Establishment . Establishmentarians prominent in Big Oil , Big Hockey , Big Landlords , Big Utilities , and Big Health Bureaucracies all found their ways onto her donor list . <p> So that means some Albertans looking for someone a little different from the Old Boys Club that has dominated this province since a barefoot Ernest Manning rode his dinosaur to school , and who were thinking about casting a party ballot for Ms. Redford , or who might eventually think about casting a real provincial ballot for Premier Redford later on , may think again . <p> It also gives some of her opponents who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-heeled potential donors who may wish to hedge their bets . <p> Ms. Haley , meanwhile , told the media the day before Ms. Redford 's announcement that she just could n't see anything wrong with taking a cheque for $3,000 as a farewell gift from her riding association when she told them she was n't going to run again in 2008 . <p> Asked about the optics of this by a journalist , Ms. Haley was unable to see a problem . She did n't exactly say , " What ? Whaaaaat ? " but that surely sounded like what she had in mind . Her actual quote , as recorded by Darcy Henton of the Calgary Herald : " It was n't anything that I believed was inappropriate . " ( So , she presumably thought , shut up already ! ) <p> Uh , Ms. Haley , folks give donations to political parties to support the campaign efforts of those parties ... not to send retired MLAs on sunshine-filled vacations . That 's why their donations are tax-deductible . It is said here that political parties that misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim such contributions against their taxes , just as churches that use their pews for political organizing should lose their tax-free status . Do n't count on either of these things happening in Alberta , of course . <p> OK , it 's not a big sum . But that 's not the point , is it ? Indeed , surely Ms. Haley -- who has enjoyed a number of very influential posts in the Conservative Party over the years -- could afford to pay for her own holiday . <p> That she did n't , that she does n't see anything wrong with that , that her constituency association thought this was appropriate ( though we are told they balked at the idea of donating money from the same source to a deserving student ) and that no one at her current place of employment thought to tell her to smarten up , speaks ill of the Alberta PC Party . <p> Indeed , this goes right to the heart of the problem with this bunch . They 've been in power so long that they just do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Redford , it 's probably not a good thing for her prospects that she showed some gumption and did the right thing , this time as in the recent past . <p> When she called for a public inquiry into health care and when she called out Mr. Stelmach on his ridiculous attempt to blame teachers for education budget cuts , these were dismissed by the commentariat as desperation measures . Heaven only knows what they 'll make of her attempt to be transparent in her campaign financing . If she 's willing to upset the apple cart on these things , who knows what else she might do ! <p> Alison Redford or Carol Haley ? Which one do you think represents the true spirit of the Alberta Conservative Party ? <h> One Comment on " A Tale of Two Tories : which one do you think is typical ? " <p> Actually , I think they 're both typical , but represent different aspects of what is wrong with the Alberta PC party . Certainly Ms Haley 's behaviour exposes the sense of entitlement and arrogance that pervades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's donor list shows how much in the pockets of big business she would be were she to become Premier at the end of this contest . <p> Of course , the same will probably be said of many of her competitors when their donors are identified , as well as the Wildrosers for that matter ; the entire Alberta political system is bought &; paid for by the corporate sector . Oh ,

Now I am going to tackle the next part in my mini feature and discuss the second item which was : <p> Professional Development should be self directed <p> Now I am not saying that your managers or employers ca n't have a say in the courses or training that you may undertake . Obviously there are some compliance and mandatory teachings that enable us to do our job better or safer or in some instances , to be able to do our job at all ... but PD should be about more than just that . <p> In order for it to be truly beneficial it should fulfill your own desire to improve yourself and provide you with growth opportunities and only you know what you need to do to meet those requirements . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as if it something you really want to learn . <p> Here 's a simple thing to do . Ask yourself " Where am I now ? " ( If you answered in my office next to the bathroom ; please look at the bigger picture ) and then ask " Where do I want to be ? " The difference between the two is what you need to do to get you there . It is your own self-directed professional development and growth plan . Some of it may fall in line with required materials and some of it wo n't . Most of all -- you decide what you need to learn . <p> Many organizations place a strong emphasis on professional development and will even go so far as to reimburse you for anything you may take ( within reason ) . Even CoreSolutions has a budget line item for staff development ( Thanks Barney &; Cathy ! ) but many organizations are n't as lucky as us and when times are hard the first thing to go is PD . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because your " organized " staff development has been put on hold does not mean that your own personal growth and development needs to be put on hold . <p> There are many things you can do to continue your own learning and the internet is just one VAST repository .

##3342651 <h> Church in The Neighbourhood <p> T hanks for this Len , I love your links , thoughts , and excerpts on all things parish . <p> Eric Jacobsen writes , <p> " A second way that a church might directly impact a neighborhood has to do with the redemption of space . Wendell Berry develops this wonderful notion of local culture through observing an old rusted out bucket nailed to a tree . This bucket collects leaves and what not over the years and then over time the fibers break down and these things , in the bucket turn into soil that can return to the earth and allow things to grow . Berry sees in this bucket an analogy for how human community is supposed to develop : <p> A human community , too , must collect leaves and stories , and turn them to account . It must build soil , and build that memory of itself -- in lore and story and song -- that will be its culture . These two kinds of accumulation , of local soil and local culture , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this kind of work , a community must exert a kind of centripetal force on its residents . It must draw residents toward the center of community life , and it must encourage the next generation to return and make their contribution to the local culture . <p> " The schools have failed , according to Berry , to inculcate love for and knowledge of the local culture and instead are focusing training children toward the future -- toward the development of a career . This oversight is not only ( literally ) unsettling for our children ; it is also a kind of irresponsible stewardship of the local environment . <p> " I think that the church in the neighborhood could exert this kind of centripetal force on a neighborhood if it was cognizant of the value of this role . In order to do this , a church would have to have a pretty strong sense of its physical connection to its neighborhood . This perspective would have been taken for granted when there was a stronger sense of church parish in the community . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Neighbourhood " <p> I think Jacobsen 's " Sidewalks in the Kingdom " is an excellent book taking Agrarian and New Urbanist principles back for the church .

##3343350 <h> 0 PARAGON by WOUDENBERG at Nyood Lounge <p> It takes that extra level of creativity to create something truly unique in the world of jewelry design , where almost everything has " already been done " . The trick is to find something beautiful no one would have thought to look at , an idea Emily Woudenberg is no stranger to . The young designer brings out the beauty of architecture with her S/S line of elaborate statement jewelry ... By Elayne Millar <p> Leave it to designer Emily Woudenberg of WOUDENBERG to bring out the beauty of architecture once again with Paragon , a S/S 2013 collection of Art Deco-inspired statement jewelry . <p> The Toronto-based designer held an intimate launch party at Nyood Restaurant 's upstairs lounge in West Queen West on October 15 to present her newest creations to select members of the media and fashion industry . <p> The 12-piece collection follows the brand 's signature androgynous style while flirting with luxury through ghostly reflective materials . With the use of leather , studs , rope , rose gold , clay , copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her previous concrete collection for F/W 2012 but continues to use industrial materials to illustrate a specific theme . This season , Woudenberg is about contrasting the opulence of the Art Deco movement and the somber reality of the late 1930s . <p> " The collection is supposed to convey this sort of awkward luxury , where we get all these extra frivolous and expensive pieces but we 're surrounded by the ghostly idea that we are not supposed to be consuming this much , " says Woudenberg , of a theme she believes is true not only to the 1930s but today 's society as well . <p> The staple element of the Paragon collection is opalite stone , which features in almost every piece in a different form , such as pendulum pendents , beads , and even a miniature 3-dimensional skull . <p> The milky-coloured stone changes with the light . This gives the accessories a brightness that when paired with industrial materials -- like copper and rope -- creates a crude yet graceful statement piece . <p> In Woudenberg 's opinion , the Chrysler Choker , inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deco Necklace are two pieces that truly embody the Art Deco theme of the collection . Both incorporate large opalite pendents and copper accents made of industrial piping -- a juxtaposition of frivolity and labour . <p> For those who may not want bright accessories this summer , the designer created darker variations of the opalite jewelry in black onyx . <p> In contrast to Woudenberg 's previous rugged collection , SLAB , this season she added an aspect of eye-catching luxury . " My last collection was sort of more black . You could wear it out and look fashionable , but this new collection is about being able to put a piece on and have it be the real statement , " she says . " The materials , being what they are , do command attention . " <p> The Paragon collection , in all its grungy opulent glory , will be 
##3346350 <h> Why I Vote <p> October 19 , 2012 <p> I 'm not voting in the upcoming presidential election . There 's a simple reason for that : I ca n't . I 'm Canadian . I 'm what is sometimes referred to as a ' foreign national . ' I live in the United States , and I work in the United States , and I 'm raising my kids in the United States , but I am not a citizen of the United States . So I ca n't vote in its elections . <p> This is fine , of course . I would very much like to be able to vote , but I recognize and appreciate that it is not my right . Voting is a right of citizenship , and I 'm a citizen of Canada , so I vote in Canadian elections . I 'm also happy to vote in social situations , when everyone 's trying to decide where to go for dinner ; I 've been known to override my children 's votes on those same kinds of questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my family is not a democracy , it 's a benevolent dictatorship , and any voting that goes on goes on only with my indulgence . <p> Anyway . Notwithstanding my ineligibility to vote , and my husband 's ineligibility to vote , we still talk a lot about politics and voting and citizenship and civic engagement in our house . In part because I 'm a former political scientist and that kind of thing is hard to shake off , and in part because Emilia has aspirations to rule . <p> What you ca n't see here is her slogan , which required another whole poster , because she needed to include happy face iconography : " A vote for Emilia is a vote for smiles . " Why is n't Obama using that ? EVERYONE LOVES SMILES . <p> She wants to be Class Secretary because she says , she wants to help . I 'm sure that being in charge of the activity area and getting to help take attendance play no small part here , but end of the day I think that she 's summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gets to help . She gets to contribute . She gets to make a difference in her class . That 's no small thing . And it applies as much to voting as it does to running for office : voting is how we , as citizens , contribute to the work of public decision-making . It 's how we help democratic government run the way that it 's supposed to . It 's how we make democracy robust . It 's how we make a difference . There are many other things that we can do to make a difference , but when it comes to democracy -- when it comes to affirming and celebrating and making actual democracy -- voting is it . It 's the core . It 's our right -- but it 's also our responsibility . It 's how we keep democracy alive . <p> So . Vote . Vote in the US presidential election , if you 're American . Vote in the elections in your own country , if you 're not American . Vote for Emilia for Class Secretary if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PS 9 . Just , VOTE . <p> ( And talk about it . *PIN about it . Let 's remind each other of why voting matters . Let 's set aside all of the inevitable grumbling about politicians and politics and partisanship and just talk about democracy . We 're privileged to have it . Let 's not forget that . ) <p> So many people died to give us a free country where we would enjoy the right to vote . The gratitude I feel for the freedom we take for granted in our country demands that I honor their sacrifices by voting in every election . Even the tiny ones , and even though I live in a state where my vote does n't make much of a difference . It 's the act that counts . Also , I always take my kids with me when I vote even though it 's difficult 
##3348752 <p> As the Twitter folk have suggested , one would anticipate that the Predators would match ... <p> Until you think about how front-loaded this might be . Are the Flyers offering the kind of cap-max , $14.06 million salary over the first couple of years , and then are they tossing off lockout-proof signing bonuses on top of that so that it 's $40 or $50 million up front ? If that 's the case , the Predators might not be able to match ... <p> And if they do , as several people who are smarter than me haven noted , Nashville ca n't trade him for a year . <p> If you 're interested , the Flyers have to re-sign Jakub Voracek , have $7.8 million in cap space and 4 defensemen with some sort of no-move clause , Chris Pronger excluded . <p> This is risky and it 's due to the timing of the action , not the action . Had this happened last summer , it would have been a brilliant move ( I 'm aware that Weber was not offer sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next CBA are being negotiated right this second , which is what makes this risky . <p> If I 'm Nashville ownership , I match , then get together with the Islanders/Panthers etc. and push for revenue sharing in the CBA negotiations . My attitude would be if Philadelphia is intent on making Shea Weber wealthy , instead of rich , they can still do so without me losing him . Before 1 AM this morning , I 'd have been a passenger on the Bettman train because nobody had given me any reason not to be . <p> Posted by larry from pitt on 07/19/12 at 03:19 AM ET <p> Wonder if this is a sign of disharmony between Bettman and the Board of Governors . Snyder is pretty clearly comfortable with the cap not rolling back , and is actually anticipating that it wo n't because if it did his team would be totally screwed . Snyder has always been one of Bettman 's closest allies and they 're not even a little bit on the same page . <p> Wonder if this is a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty clearly comfortable with the cap not rolling back , and is actually anticipating that it wo n't because if it did his team would be totally screwed .

Every worst case scenario for the Wings off-season has come true . This is the worst off-season for the Red Wings that I can recall . The Wings appear to be frozen out of this years free agency period for 2 reasons : unwilling trade partners and / or impossible financial demands . I mean , what the hell is going on ? <p> Posted by beelza on 07/19/12 at 03:30 AM ET <p> Snider does nt run the day to day operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meetings and does what he is told to say . <p> The Wings appear to be frozen out of this years free agency period for 2 reasons : unwilling trade partners and / or impossible financial demands . I mean , what the hell is going on ? <p> You seem to be leaving out a big possibility : players do n't want to play in Detroit anymore . With their cap space why would they have been more willing to trade NHL players than sign Weber to an offer sheet ? The only plausible explanation is that they offered Weber a contract and he would n't take it . <p> If Wings did n't know they 'd have to offer ludicrous longterm contracts to lure free agents then the league may have passed Ken Holland by . He 's put all his eggs in this basket , knowing for years he 'd have to replace Lidstrom AND find a way to improve the team , and he 's come away with nothing . Was he unprepared for what the market would be like or are players just not interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Snyder is pretty clearly comfortable with the cap not rolling back , and is actually anticipating that it wo n't because if it did his team would be totally screwed . <p> I think the assumption is that any cap rollback would have a salary rollback as well . And while I 'm sure that Weber 's signing bonus money will be very substantial , I think over the length of the term of the contract , it will still even out to not drive up the overall cap hit by that much . The result is , Weber 's contract would be a higher share of the Flyer 's cap space than under the current CBA , but not by enough to ruin the team . <p> Let 's take a guess and say he signs him to $115million over 14 years ( which would be an $8.2 million cap hit and would be underneath the $8.41 million limit which would require him to give Nashville 4 first round picks ) . <p> After the salary rollback , let 's say that reduces it to $100million over 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million cap hit . If the overall team cap goes from $70 million to $55-60 million , Weber 's still a big cap hit , but he 's not going to ruin the team and their chances . Especially not given how large of a role he 'll play . <p> Before anyone attacks me for my numbers , they are very quick guesses . I did n't actually break out guesses of the signing bonus to salary ratios for Weber , I did n't calculate based on a proposed reduction in share of HHR . We 'll see when the numbers come out . I also did n't take into account the new rule with cap hit being calculated based on the years before the player turns 40 or 41 or whatever the change was after the Kovalchuk fiasco . Anyways , just quick guesses to show why Snyder and Holmgren are n't likely to be screwed outright by this deal and a new CBA . <p> I think the assumption is that any cap rollback would have a salary rollback as well . <p> I ca n't imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don Fehr will resign before he agrees to give back 20% of the money his constituency has already earned and his opponents have already agreed to pay . <p> You seem to be leaving out a big possibility : players do n't want to play in Detroit anymore . With their cap space why would they have been more willing to trade NHL players than sign Weber to an offer sheet ? The only plausible explanation is that they offered Weber a contract and he would n't take it . <p> Another possibility is that Holland did n't wield the offer sheet . A lot of GMs refuse to use it as it would be " dishonorable . " He 's probably been asking Poile about trading for Weber , but most of the news I 've seen indicate that Holland would n't be interested in using an offer sheet . <p> Maybe he did and Weber did n't sign . Or maybe he would have and Holmgren beat him to it . <p> Either way , I agree that the Wings are having a very disappointing free agency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Wings losing out so much this year . <p> That said , I think Nashville will match on Weber unless it would literally bankrupt them to match the signing bonuses that Holmgren baked into this deal . They wanted Weber for life , and this is their chance to have him . It 'll cost them more up front than they wanted , but I doubt Holmgren signed him to a cap hit that completely ruins the ability for the team to compete . <p> Another possibility is that Holland did n't wield the offer sheet . A lot of GMs refuse to use it as it would be " dishonorable . " He 's probably been asking Poile about trading for Weber , but most of the news I 've seen indicate that Holland would n't be interested in using an offer sheet . <p> If Holland refused to use the offer sheet , given everything that 's happened to his team in the last month , would n't that just be more proof that maybe the league has passed him by ? <p> Nashville does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not just sign a deal in the first place ? And if that 's option , why shop him on trade market ? <p> On the other hand , if he 's so dead set against Nashville why would he sign an offer sheet that includes the very real possibility of him being in Nashville for the next 14 years ? <p> If Holland refused to use the offer sheet , given everything that 's happened to his team in the last month , would n't that just be more proof that maybe the league has passed him by ? <p> How does that track ? It 's not like the offer sheet is a common occurrence in today 's NHL . And " given everything that 's happened to his team " ? Like what ? They missed out on one big free agent that they coveted , and he went to a team on a deal that was orchestrated by his friend , for more money . <p> And if Detroit was indeed a " big player " in a trade scenario , why would they send an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that Philly was n't going to be a serious partner in trade talks , so they went the offer sheet route . <p> Very smart if they get him , but if not then they 've taken Weber off the market for anyone and allowed Nashville to keep him with a reasonable cap hit . <p> Was Snyder afraid that Nashville might pull the trade trigger to another team ? That would be another reason for the offer sheet , since it locks down trade for a year on him . Not sure that 's the best theory . It could be , as someone said , that Philly just got tired of waiting for Poile . <p> Suggesting that players do n't want to play in Detroit anymore is asinine . We swung and missed on a pair of players in Suter/Parise that were wildly overplayed and decided to take their talents to Minnesota ( and spurning offers from " sexier " teams like Pittsburgh to boot ) . And how is Weber signing an offer sheet with Philly an indictment of Detroit ? Noone else in free agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Detroit is no longer a free agent destination because approximately 3 good players did not come here ? Quit talking out of your ass . <p> Posted by Huss on 07/19/12 at 09:12 AM ET <p> Was Snyder afraid that Nashville might pull the trade trigger to another team ? <p> tbassett - Nashville , I 'll concede your point . But , when Sammy Salo tells your team thanks , but no thanks , that 's rock bottom for me. 24 million , 2 months , wide open roster positions and - Nothing . I blame no one and make no judgments . The Detroit Red Wings organization is among the best pro sports clubs in the world . I am shocked and seek answers as to why many FA 's will not , have not signed with Detroit this year . <p> Posted by beelza on 07/19/12 at 09:31 AM ET <p> I am shocked and seek answers as to why many FA 's will not , have not signed with Detroit this year . <p> They went hard after Suter and by all accounts it was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfunctory offer to Parise but clearly he was n't nearly as big a target for them as Suter was . <p> They made an offer to Salo but Tampa Bay overpaid for him . <p> Let 's not pretend this is some crazy thing where Detroit has tried again and again and failed again and again to find anyone willing to " slum it " and become a Red Wing . <p> Three guys . Two if you 've read what their offer to Parise was and realize they were never really seriously even courting him . <p> First thing -- if we assume Nashville does n't match , the Preds are not screwed so long as they can keep their management team together with those 4 first-round picks . They have been very good with their drafts and player development . Obviously , this will hurt them for the next few years , but in the mid-term , they are still a very good organization from a hockey operations standpoint . The big question is , will they be good enough to keep butts in the seats while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Second thing -- the logic that the Wings are n't a UFA destination or that Holland is n't a good GM , let alone the BEST GM in the game , does n't follow . Teams have been massively overpaying , for almost everyone . Sami Salo and his obligatory 20 games missed due to injury is not worth that contract , especially not when guys like Kubina and Roszival are still out there . Suter , good as he is , and as much as I wanted him , is being paid like he 's one of the best two or three D in the game . If I were a betting man , I 'd wager the likes of Weber , Chara , Doughty , and Keith will keep him out of the Norris running his entire career . Parise is great leader with a good skill level . But he 's being paid like he 's one of the most talented forwards in the game . Which he is not , he 's a rung below the likes of Crosby , Malkin , Datsyuk , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Semin and see two players with nearly identical skill levels . Semin wants $10 million over two years . Is a reputation for being a primadonna really all it takes to determine the difference between a $100 million player and a $10 million one ? The rates being paid are INSANE . The Wings made one serious run at Suter , and by all accounts , were one of the final two on his list . It happens . <p> Third thing -- are we forgetting that the labor negotiations exist , or further , that they 're off to a terrible start ? The realistic possibilities I see are : <p> - The NHL comes to its senses and considers modifications to revenue sharing , possibly with a SLIGHT decrease in the players ' share , and the cap stays about where it is and everything is good . <p> - The NHL keeps its hard line and wins a sizable takeback from the players ' share . This means the cap shrinks , which means the owners will then start infighting about a solution for them to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate shit storm . The big market teams wo n't want to have to just dump talent , so they 'll argue for some combination of amnesty buyouts to shed bad contracts and a grandfather rule to where they can keep their Suters/Parises via some mechanism like a temporary luxury tax . The small market teams will want to see their actual player costs shrink immediately , and they 'll want a salary rollback . The players will not want to accept a salary rollback yet again . Now we are in lockout city . <p> Point of this is , is that a climate where you want to be throwing the type of money Tampa did at Sami freakin ' Salo , or throwing out an offer sheet for Weber that will cost you four critical picks that your team will NEED to rebuild if the new CBA does force to shed salary ? Also consider that those four first-rounders will be worth soooooo much more than they are today if rookie contract structures are changed to allow more years of team control . <p> For my thinking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wings did . Go hard after the best player at the position you need the most ( Suter on D ) . Take a legitimate but somewhat half-hearted shot at the next best player on the market ( Parise ) . Then , given the lack of other top-end talent in the market , bide your time and do n't over pay for the Sami Salos of the world . <p> It sucks we did n't get Suter , but by all accounts , it sounds like the Wings ( and others ) may have actually offered a little more money than the Wild , but once he knew Parise 's intentions , it changed the decision making process . Being in Minny does put him a little closer to home and it does put him in a more quiet market , both things it was clear he wanted . Not much of a surprise that it was down to Minny and Detroit , and at that point when you 're both offering $100 million , it 's hard to do much more . <p> Do n't want to speculate too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet to prevent a trade to another team . I ca n't help but think that team would have to be Pittsburgh , who have plenty of assets . " If we ca n't trade for him , he 's not going to Pittsburgh " <p> Posted by jayskate from Newfoundland , Canada on 07/19/12 at 10:59 AM ET <p> Do we know for sure if it is a 4 first rounder deal or 2 first rounder deal ? What is the actual annual cap hit ? 4 first rounders especially at the higher cost , you consider not matching . Two first rounders ( probably very late in the first ) , you may have to match . <p> I 'm a bit foggy on the rules here . Does the offer sheet prevent a trade entirely now , or can the Preds still trade his rights in this 7-day period before they have to make a decision ? And if they can trade , is the new team under the same 
##3350152 <h> planning focus points and readability tests <p> This will be pretty dry and technical but some of my former students found this useful and perhaps someone else will as well ! <p> The composite method I use for piecing together large-format prints with a high degree of detail relies heavily on planning out what parts of the ' scene ' will be in focus and where the crucial areas of interest lie . This is also a distinguishing factor and plays into the conceptual creation of the image , and why a single frame ( for instance , from a large format 8x10 film camera ) wo n't achieve the same effect -- fundamental to the ' readability ' of these images themselves is the rather neurotic control of depth of field and focus across the composite frame . This allows for a ' flexible ' depth of field that can be essentially deformed across the image , allowing the simultaneous sharp focus of several elements at once that would n't normally be possible with a single-frame image . <p> The second work I 've planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impact " , and it 's just easier to copy and paste the narrative description from the proposal here to give a sense of the final product : <p> The Impact ( Reunion : Prologue ) <p> On a dark rural road in Ontario , the wine-red Jeep of one Randall Carter is found abandoned , door open , several large stacks of books balanced on the seats . Carefully folded on top of the books was found a military uniform , embroidered with Carter 's name and a series of unidentified insignia . The Jeep was discovered by Carter 's boyfriend , Charles D. Ward , after Carter 's protracted absence prompted Ward to retrace the route to Carter 's residence . Ward claims he found the Jeep by following the sound of music on the radio . The combined weight of the books was found to be 167 lbs , which coincidentally was approximately Carter 's own weight prior to his disappearance . <p> Instrumental to the work will be the ability to " read " a lot of the details of the " stuff " piled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a lot of the signifiers and symbols present in the rest of the ephemera spread throughout . So the first function of this test shoot is to map out the focus points / depth of field across the scene , and make sure that everything that needs to be in focus , is in focus . The second function is to test the viewing angle with respect to the composite -- rudimentary at this point cuz my tripod head sucks -- but because we need to be able to see " inside " the Jeep the angle of the shots , and the Jeep with respect to the camera , is somewhat crucial and does complicate the composite somewhat . <p> Last , the test generally brings to light unanticipated problems with the shooting/composite process , and gives me a sense of " what I have to work with " -- just how much detail I get straight out of the camera under uncontrolled conditions without any post-processing . As such these images have n't been touched and a few look a little dark or desaturated for a few reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fairly large images and such follow , so click below to read the rest . <p> First things first , I generally scribble out a map of where the focus points will be , something like this : <p> This is actually one of the finished composites , marked up to indicate the points of focus . Key areas include the front passenger seat , the passenger-side sun visor and dashboard , the display on the stereo , and the front and back ends of the Jeep itself . The circle on the sidewalk indicates a potential placement for the figure -- I 'm actually undecided on this but I figured it 'd be a good place to make sure the ground is in crisp focus . On a purely technical note -- my new shiny iPad was really handy for this stage , I used the built-in camera , imported the image into GoodNotes and scribbled all over the damn thing . Was great to have when I was working on the test shoot itself . <p> Once I had everything sketched out , I took the top down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the key focus points . They served two purposes -- focus targets that were clearly visible , and as an added bonus , they had fine text from a local dental office on them , and that served well for " readability " evaluation across the image . Then I threw a few books in particular places , some other odds and end , and got shooting . <p> In this case I shot a matrix of 18-20 photos , basically 3 horizontal layers , 6 frames each , with the camera in a vertical orientation . I 'm using a 50mm 1.8 G lens set at f5.6 , and for the first test shoot the camera was roughly 10 ? from the jeep at a slight angle to show the interior dash . ( oh , and it 's my Nikon D800E , 36mp images ... in case that was n't evident ) . <p> Here 's the first one , sans-red circles . There 's a Zoom.it link below the image so you can view the full-resolution version : <p> Zoom.it seems to alter the JPEG slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image looks darker and desaturated than the original . The first attempt showed promise , the detail was all there , and the print-size was about 60x90 @240DPI which is definitely respectable . <p> Satisfied the focus points were functional and stitched together alright , I tried a second test-shoot with the camera closer to the Jeep -- about 5-8 ? -- to up the detail just a touch . Less wiggle room for too much distance to the left and right -- in fact one of my initial composite attempts severely warped the sidewalk -- but some trimming at the sides came up with the right image . It 's a little slant-angled however , that 's in part the tripod , in part the omission of some of the end pieces . Again , click the link below the image for a full-res version in zoom.it to see the detail : <p> I was pleased with the results in both , but the second probably saved me having to buy a new lens -- I was n't sure the detail was up to snuff in the first , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same distance ... and still am considering ... but the closer-up version worked just fine . There 's some issues with the angle and it looks a tad compressed but I think I can solve those problems . <p> Finally , to get a sense of what the individual frames look like , here 's two similar frames from both test shoots . These are full-res so clicking on them should give you the option of seeing them in their full 36 megapixel glory . Again , these are unprocessed , right out of the

##3350852 <h> Warrior Island : An inside look at a new , fan interactive MMA reality series <p> What if there were a reality show set up in the fashion of an old kung fu movie ? Maybe it 's like Enter the Dragon , but you have to get voted onto the island , and in order to get off of it , you have to be the last man standing . All the glory , fame and prestige is yours , not to mention a $500k grand prize . To the victor go the spoils . That concept is actually the brainchild of James Jefferson , CEO of Global Proving Ground . I recently had a chance to speak with James , and got some insight on his innovative reality series , Warrior Island . <p> Warrior Island came from the love that I had from a little movie called Enter the Dragon , and as a martial artist myself , I wanted to do something a little bit different . We brought together the original brain trust that were involved with the UFC . Our director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcers , and is actually a black belt under the Gracie family . Dan Severn is the original UFC champion , and is one of the masters on the island . <p> We wanted to figure out was working for reality TV , and show mixed martial arts in a different way . We wanted to get the fan integration , so took what has already proven successful with American Idol , and let fans vote the fighters from around the world onto the island . We took the social networking , Facebook and Youtube , which is obviously working , and then we wanted to have it on an island , like Survivor , which has been very successful . As I said earlier , I 'm a major junkie for the old martial arts movies , so we have the black dragon with us , Ron Van Clief , who was the original commissioner of the UFC . <p> The outpouring of fighters signing on with us started out very slow , but now we 're getting the likes of Eric Prindle , James McSweeney . We 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping on board . I think people are getting sick and tired of seeing a bunch of people in a house , crying on each other 's shoulders . They want to see something interesting . We 're going to train these fighters old school , on an island , with rudimentary stones and pulleys , like in the movie Kickboxer . The fans can be interactive while all this is going on , and then these guys are going to fight . It 's going to be knock em down , no holds barred rules , back to the days when Dan Severn was with the UFC . <p> We 're going to shoot the pilot this winter , and that pilot will be about two weeks of footage on the island . From there , we plan on doing two seasons per year , and the fighters will be there for about a month each season . They are paid very well while they 're there , because it 's all SAG ( Screen Actor 's Guild ) due to being a Hollywood project . They 'll get room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Even the losers get paid from the fights . The overall winner not only gets an amazing prize , but also gets a contract in the Global Proving Ground Fight League , which is another unique concept in MMA . <p> We 're going to have fights on six continents . We 're not competing with anybody . We 're going to have three main card events on existing promotions . For example , we 're launching in Branson , MO on November 17th on the Midwest Ultimate Cagefighting card . We 'll have lightweight , middleweight and heavyweight bout on that card . Our whole production crew will be coming in to film it . We 're taking a small to mid-level promotion , and bringing in the same powers that be that built the UFC . We 've upgraded it to a full PPV event . That card stays in existence under it 's own ownership and management , but jumps up three or four levels in production . There will be quality fighters , better production , HD cameras ; a crew of 25 people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to compete with anybody . We want to enhance other promotions . It 's all in the spirit of martial arts , with honor and respect . <p> Jefferson says they have private investors backing this project , as well as sponsors . While most promotions do exclusive deals with their sponsors , GPG will do one off deals to keep viable options open . He stressed the fact that smaller companies that have been locked out of the UFC due to the hefty sponsor tax will have a stable home with his company , at no cost . Whatever deals they work out with the fighters is theirs exclusively , with no interference or interaction from the promotion . In a landscape where we 're seeing one organization after another fold up , it will be interesting to see how this one fares . The concept is unique , and their willingness to cooperate with other

It may take another " core " player gong out with him , but the time has come to make it happen . <p> I am in total agreement . It 's time to go . It 's not that he could n't be a great 6th man or that I do n't believe he 's talented . It 's really just about what the team wants to brand itself as : gritty , hard working , hustle . He shows none of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to change who Bargnani is . Time to go **26;7964;TOOLONG <p> He 's been a real dud this year . Even more so than in the past . He did n't play much last year though , and missed playing for Italy too during the summer . I 'd allow him a little bit more time to get himself back into the swing of things , but if he does n't improve as the trade deadline approaches , I 'd be fine shipping him out . <p> Great vid Matt ! I too am one of the few who really wanted AB7 to shine and lead the Raptors but I too believe we need a change . He does n't seem like he 's trying all that hard anymore . He just does n't look " into it " . I 'm just afraid that if/when he gets traded to another team , he 'll torch us for 40 points like every other ex-Raptor ! ( &gt; . Anyway , I 'm with you on this . I 'm just not that twitter-literate ... LOL . I 'll figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't really plan on getting into it ( I just know I 'll get sucked into the whole twitter thing ) , but I support your cause ! <p> However , I 've come to sad realization that there probably is n't any team that wants Bargs right now . At this point he just has no value . He 's struggling to do the only thing he knows how to do , which is score , and he still has 3-years and $10 million/year left on his contract . Why would any GM want a part of that ? Yes he 's shown flashes , yes he probably can be a decent option of the bench for a contender or playoff team , but why invest 3 years at $10 million for any of that ? Especially with the way he 's struggling , he 's just not worth the risk . If he was an expiring contract or was owed 1/2 of that $10 million , sure . A GM might gamble on that .

##3354552 <h> Moronic <p> Amnesty Bargnani ? Are you guys completely losing it ? I think too many Raptor disappointments are making people around here lose their marbles . I 'd like to give you guys the benefit of the doubt and assume you 're kidding , but sadly I do n't think you are . <p> Now before everyone starts going ape-shit in responding to this , let me just say : I agree that he is playing terribly . I agree that he should be given less playing time and possibly removed from the starting lineup if this continues . And for the first time in the last 7 years , I even agree that we should start looking at trading him . But amnestying him , are you serious ? <p> Although his value is arguably at its lowest point right now , the guy still has some definite value , and probably more than most of you think . And his contract is quite reasonable , even given his recent terrible play . To amnesty him would be simply throwing away an asset . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still only 9 games into the season . A lot of great players are having poor starts to the season . Bargs did n't play much last year and did n't play for Italy during the summer . Give it a bit more time before you start losing your shit . I 'm not saying he 'll turn it around , but it 's too early to make a rash decision and trade him away for less than market value , let alone amnesty him . <p> It is not rash decision - this decision ( to trade him I mean ) should have been made 2-3 years ago .. at least . He may have surprised most of the fans with the 13 games last season but how many seasons would we be loosing to understand that he is not the type of player the management of our team thinks he is . Amensty could be seen as little premature but look at it this way ( just an idea , example ) - would you hire someone like Kenyon Martin if you had roster spot and money from AB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money on him ? My point is that while not guaranteed return is available if there really are n't any reasonable trade options perhaps amnesty is not that bad of an idea . And also what we as fans think his value on the market is probably very inaccurate . * Excuse my spelling ( I ' m probably still shaking from last night 's game ) <p> I can think of 50 trades that the Raptors can do to get at least something in return for Bargnani . Especially if the goal is to basically give him away . There are a lot of bottom feeder teams that would take a flyer on Bargnani . I 'm not being a nuisance , it 's a stupid idea to amnesty him . What did optifan call it , moronic . <p> Amnesty Bargnani ? Are you guys completely losing it ? I think too many Raptor disappointments are making people around here lose their marbles . I 'd like to give you guys the benefit of the doubt and assume you 're kidding , but sadly I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target of the fans ' hate the past couple of years and , if he 's traded , DeRozan will the next target . <p> Houston amnestied Scola who is arguably better than Bargnani and was making less . There are a lot of reasons why amnestying a player could be done . Perhaps the Raptors would be interested in a free agent like Millsap and would prefer to free up cap space to chase him rather than try to make a trade offer with Utah . <p> The only issue I have with amnestying Bargnani is that we would have to wait until this season is over .. I can be patient , but that 's a long time to wait . I would prefer a trade just so the insanity can end already . <p> I can think of 50 trades that the Raptors can do to get at least something in return for Bargnani . Especially if the goal is to basically give him away . There are a lot of bottom feeder teams that would take a flyer on Bargnani . I 'm not being a nuisance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did optifan call it , moronic . <p> I wish we knew what the Raptors are being offered in return for Bargnani but we do n't . To clarify I am not rooting to amnesty him just for fun ( actually it may be fun but still ) - I want amnesty IF , and only if the trade value is actually very low . <p> I really do think that before trading or amnestying Il Mago , we should let him come off the bench . Sure it will be a bruise to his ego but it might make him hustle that much hard for his starting spot back . DC needs to toy with this idea . I recently saw how OKC coach pulled Durant early in the 1st and brought him back in with the second unit as an experiment to make the second unit more of a threat , and it worked . Durant actually liked it . To put your 2-time top scorer in the league in a semi-bench role for the betterment of the team is ballsy , and I think DC needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I really do think that before trading or amnestying Il Mago , we should let him come off the bench .

To put your 2-time top scorer in the league in a semi-bench role for the betterment of the team is ballsy , and I think DC needs to consider some drastic changes when it comes to Bargs . <p> Honestly , I would n't even want to take that approach . The issue is effort and intensity . <p> I look at Bargnani like a girlfriend who cheated . I could never trust her again and inevitably the relationship is going to fail because of that lack of trust . <p> Same with Bargnani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do it . Sure he could put up a good stretch - even another 13 and 16/17 out of 31 - but I 'll always be wondering when the true colours shine through . <p> I agree that amnestying Bargnani does n't many sense . If there are suitors for Turkoglu and Arenas , then there are suitors for Bargnani . Even 2nd round picks are better than nothing . <p> The only way amnestying makes sense is if Colangelo has a trade up his sleeve , and needs an extra $10 million in cap space to make the deal work . But in that situation , Calderon would be a better amnesty candidate because of his expiring contract . <p> I agree that amnestying Bargnani does n't many sense .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate because of his expiring contract . <p> Jose ca n't be amnestied anymore . The last chance was this past off season . You can only amnesty in the off season and only one time . Once this season ends , Jose is a free agent . <p> The only amnesty candidates we have left are Bargnani , Amir and Kleiza . <p> I agree that amnestying Bargnani does n't many sense . If there are suitors for Turkoglu and Arenas , then there are suitors for Bargnani . Even 2nd round picks are better than nothing . <p> The only way amnestying makes sense is if Colangelo has a trade up his sleeve , and needs an extra $10 million in cap space to make the deal work . But in that situation , Calderon would be a better amnesty candidate because of his expiring contract . <p> The ability to use the amnesty clause only exists within a certain window . That window has passed for Calderon . <p> The Raptors will not be able to amnesty a player until after this season , and the remaining options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suitors for almost every contract , but its also relative to what you get back . In order to get rid of Arenas , Washington needed to take back Rashard Lewis . It was a worst deal in the NBA for the 2nd worst deal in the NBA type trade . There was a suitor for Hedo ( who also happened to be Hedo 's agent ..... ) but still the return was a past his prime , marginally useful player in Barbossa . Better than Hedo ? Yes . A player even worth his contract ? No . <p> But lets even say Colangelo would willing take something as cheap as a 2nd round pick for Bargnani . The team he is traded to would need to : <p> 1 ) have the cap space to make the deal right now + moving forward <p> 2 ) the roster space to make the deal right now . Even if they waive a player , they are in essence still going to pay Bargnani + the waived player 's contract ( depending on its structure ofcourse ) . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately reduces the number of potential suitors . <p> Realistically Toronto would most likely need to take a contract back + the 2nd round pick to make the deal work . Depending on what that contract is : Amnesty may still be more valuable than a 2nd round pick . <p> While I find it highly unlikely that the Raps amnesty Bargnani , the idea of amnesty should not be off the table . Its not as " moronic " as it sounds depending on the league wide economics ( both ability and willingness to pay bargnani vs Toronto 's return ) . <p> Can I just ask , with all the AB trashing , why are we not at least taking pains to complement DD on his improved play ? Dude tries hard every play , has stopped the whining and practices hard ... oh yeah , and WANTS to be here and bring others ... where 's the love ? ? ? <p> this bothers me. lets say bc puts out a email to 29 other gms saying bargs ' is on the market and only one gm answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second round . does that then become so low of a calue 
##3355950 <p> A MUSLIM from Scarborough told me that an Imam and Khateeb of a Masjid spoke in his khutba ( sermon ) last Jummuah ( Friday ) that the " Bill 13 ( the new Ontario 's Accepting Education Act ) is harmless ; it is neutral and does n't change the curriculum . " Similar messages have been posted by some so-called " Islamic leaders " of GTA in different discussion forums/groups . The question should be asked , " Who told you and how did you know ? How and why are you interpreting the bill differently from the government ? Did you read the " Accepting Education Act " ? Do you know the meaning of code words like " inclusive , " change of " attitude , " and " behaviour , " and " alternative family , " etc ? Do you know who comprises the education committee who made/and are making the curriculum ? Do you know the agency who advised the curriculum and the agency that developed the curriculum ? Do you know what " curriculum " means ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning ? Can you define the meaning of " neutrality " ? <p> If not , then is it not better to at least shut your mouth and not be involved in misguiding and confusing the Muslim community ? " Why are you explaining the Bill or Act with the meaning that is not even explained by Ontario government and liberal media ? <p> Islamic leaders must know that there is nothing " neutral " in this world . Either you are worshiping Almighty God , or worshipping Shaitan . " Neutrals " are hypocrites who are worshippers of Shaitan . They deserve the darkest and deepest part of hell . <p> " To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them ( but ) a grievous penalty " ( Al-Quran 4:138 ) . <p> For Muslims and believers , Allah Almighty says in Quran , " Let there be a community among you who call to the good , and enjoin the right ) , and forbid the evil . They are the ones who have success . " ( 3:104 ) The Almighty says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be produced before mankind . You enjoin the right , forbid the wrong " ( 3:110 ) . <p> However , we are witnessing here instead of enjoining the Maroof ( good ) . Some Muslim leaders and Imams are openly enjoining Munkarat ( evils ) and using the sacred Mimbar of Masjid and Islamic platforms for this purpose . <p> The Liberal party members and " gatekeepers " of Islamic Centers , organizations and groups could play a role by advising Ontario Liberal Caucus not to bring Bill 13 and Bill 33 that is offensive to faith groups , and Muslims will never accept it . The vote-hungry Liberal party might listen to them . But these members did n't do anything except show obedience to their party leaders . Having a " slave mentality , " they know only how to surrender to the " master 's wishes . " They have been given the task to make the poison " sweet " so that it can easily be swallowed through Muslim throats . Ontario Muslim Parents ! Check your " liberal " Imams and Leaders . <p> Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ignores the bullying caused by ethnic and religious ground ( 83% police reported hate crime in Canada-2009 ) . The bill shows concern only to bullying of LGBTTIQ youth ( 13% police reported hate crime in Canada-2009 ) . It is a biased act . Progressive Conservatives presented Bill 14 in Ontario Legislative Assembly that was a real anti-bullying bill . But Liberal-NDP has chosen Bill 13 that brought an education act that is in fact a Culture-shift mandate to embrace the homosexual agenda . <p> This document has 12 sample lessons at each level integrating positive LGBTTIQ messages throughout the K- Gr. 12 curriculum . <h> This document also tells teachers not to inform families of sensitive curriculum ( pages 9 and 10 ) . <p> The document is freely downloadable from the internet and referred-to at teacher training seminars held around the province -- hence as a parent you are not aware of what your teacher is bringing into the classroom because the lessons are not available to you , unless you ask . <p> Some of the ideas include : <p> ? Community units : primary students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students will be provided with LGBT themes to create skits and plays <p> ? Pride week/parades in schools <p> ?

##3358851 <h> Time To Look at the WHL ? <p> It was n't too long ago that the Vancouver Canucks used to draft , like other NHL teams , nearly exclusively from the Canadian junior system . As such , there was a good amount of Western-developed talent taken by the Canucks : Petr Nedved , Garth Butcher , Cam Neely and Trevor Linden . <p> This continued into the mid-1990s as well . While the Canucks did n't have too much success with their picks , they still had a number of first and second round picks from the WHL : Chris McAllister , Josh Holden , Brad Ference , Ryan Bonni , and who could ever forget Zenith Komarniski . <p> Mike Gillis has shut that down : he 's taken just 2 WHLers , or about half as much as the average league rate for selecting Western talent .

The Company has also received data from a 2011 geophysical ( magnetic and VLF ) and soil geochemical survey , and is in the process of analyzing the data . The 2011 survey consisted of a grid extending to the north and east of the Discovery Zone . The Discovery Zone consists of a series of 0.2 to 1.2 metre wide en-echelon quartz veins with grades up to 365 g/t Au . <p> The compilation work has outlined several areas of interest which merit further exploration in the coming field season , including the Cooler Creek Zone , a new target area located 500 metres SE of the Discovery Zone along a structural trend . Historical soil geochemistry and magnetic geophysical surveys in the Cooler Creek Zone have outlined a NW-SE trending zone with highly anomalous gold in soils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Coast Mountain Geological Ltd. is preparing an exploration program to comprehensively examine previously under-explored prospective areas of the property . The program for 2012 will consist of linecutting , extensive soil geochemistry and mag/VLF geophysical surveys , trenching and follow-up drilling over a large area of interest . The Phase 1 budget for exploration on the property is expected to be approximately $2.0 million . <p> Previous work on the property includes 161 metres of underground development in the Discovery Zone where , in 1984 a regional silt sampling program led to the discovery of gold mineralization in quartz float boulders overlying a diorite . Exploration programs on the Discovery Zone since then has resulted in the discovery of 14 en-echelon gold bearing quartz veins with surface trenching and drilling returning gold grades to 115.27gm Au . In 1994 a 3,700 metric ton bulk sample of mineralized vein material from surface trenching with an average grade of 26.5 g/t Au produced 3,160 ounces of gold . In 2009 a 3m X 3m decline was collared on the Raven vein and the underground development program was designed to evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground development was completed . An initial underground bulk sample shipment of 364.61 short tons was processed , assaying 0.475 oz/t Au , yielding 161.95 troy ounces of gold . <p> As The Company 's knowledge base for the Bonaparte Mineral Belt grows , the company continues to be encouraged regarding the porphyry potential of the property .

##3360952 <p> March is here , which means that Spring Break is fast approaching . If you 're still considering what to do with your children , you might want to check out Shakespeare 101 , which Kate Lancaster of Place des Arts tells us about in this article . <h> Up-and-Coming Director Leads Spring Break Workshop <p> According to Colin Thomas , long-time theatre critic for the Georgia Straight , Kevin Bennett is " clearly an artist to watch . " Thomas dubbed him thus in a rave review of the young director 's production of Hamlet , performed at Havana restaurant on Commercial Drive last November . His up-and-coming status is just one of the reasons Place des Arts in Coquitlam is so thrilled to have Kevin back for the second year to direct the centre 's Spring Break Shakespeare 101 workshop for middle schoolers . This year , he will inspire young actors in their discovery of the Scottish play , promising to make Macbeth fun . <p> Just how does Kevin expect to make this macabre story engaging for tweens and teens ? By using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with his enthusiasm , that 's how ! That and getting them on their feet immediately , delving into a physical exploration of the text , character development and , literally , playing the play . At London 's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts Kevin learned how to use a physical approach to directing . This is what resonated most with him , and it 's what he brings to his work with kids during the Spring Break workshop . <h> Deep Affection for Shakespeare <p> During an interview with Kevin , his affection for the bard 's work is palpable . When asked what it is he loves about Shakespeare , the volume of his voice rises and he speaks quickly , barely pausing for a breath . " I love that it 's got everything in it . In every Shakespeare play , there 's a bit of everything : romance , violence , huge political stories and stories about families . Shakespeare delves into everything from magic and fantasy to drama , melodrama , tragedy and comedy . It becomes really fun when you explore it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When directing Shakespeare for younger actors , Kevin 's goal is to make kids realize that it 's not boring or hard , as it often comes across when students are simply reading or studying Shakespeare 's plays in school . He says , " Once you get through a few techniques , Shakespeare is quite simple . This workshop will use an abridged , more modern script that kids can understand . " <h> Why Macbeth ? <p> But again , why Macbeth for Spring Break ? This dark story of witchcraft , deception and murder seems an odd choice for kids from 12 to 14 . Kevin says , " It 's definitely in my top favourites of Shakespeare -- lots of action ; it 's kind of gory ; it 's one of his best stories . " Macbeth was the original mystical fantasy ; long before Harry Potter and Twilight , it was engaging audiences with its eerie tale , something that will definitely speak to today 's young teens . <p> As for the benefits of studying Shakespeare at a young age , Kevin believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's the best thing to do . He compares studying Shakespeare for the actor to studying the classics for the musician . " It 's very complicated , and all the things you need to do to make Shakespeare successful can help you in any kind of acting . Learn the technique of Shakespeare and you can do anything , " says Kevin . <p> Bennett 's Shakespeare 101 : Macbeth Made Fun workshop takes place from March 12-23 at Place des Arts in Coquitlam . The sessions run from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm on weekdays , and there 's a special presentation on Sunday , March 25 . It is open to students in grades six to eight with an interest in acting and/or Shakespeare , an open mind and a willingness to dive right in . No experience is necessary , but it helps for your kids to read the play or watch a movie version in area . When she 's not serving as the 
##3361451 <h> Post navigation <h> Book review : The Rockey Mountain Poet <p> In the 1870 's Icelanders began to emigrate . In Iceland times were difficult . Iceland was the poorest country in Europe and Europe was so poor that massive numbers of Europeans were on the move . They were immigrating to places such as Brazil but the greatest number had as their destination , Amerika . Amerika was not a specific geographic place but a direction , a place of rumour , myths , and letters . <p> In Iceland , society was still medieval . Although the Icelanders like to point out to everyone that they had the first parliament in history , they conveniently leave out that this annual representation of the chieftains where real power was distributed and enforced lasted a short time . Internal conflict led to Iceland being ruled by the Norwegian king and , when Norway was taken over by Denmark , Iceland was , too . For hundreds of years Iceland was a vassal state , its resources and people sold off to commercial interests . <p> Although some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because on Icelandic farms everyone slept in one room , ate in one room , worked in the fields or fished from the same boat , that everyone was equal . Nothing could have been further from the truth . <p> What they did not take into account was who had the key to the food storehouse , who decided what and how much each person got to eat , what work they did , how many hours they worked , whether they would be employed or , if they were a tenant farmer ( share cropper ) , whether their lease would be renewed . Only one percent of Iceland 's land is usable ( not arable , for that assumes that it can be cultivated ) and that was for pasture . Wealth was in sheep and milk cows and , for the larger farmers who had land on the sea shore , boats . <p> Stephan G Stephansson grew up in that society . He was " born in 1853 , the population ... roughly 60,000 ) " . It 's capital city was a village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds on farms in houses made of turf and rock and some wood from Denmark or driftwood . Wood was so precious that some houses used whale bones for rafters . <p> There were no crops except hay for no grain would ripen . <p> Stephan 's family was too poor to send him for a formal academic education . In 1873 , he came to North America with some people for whom he had been working . His life was different from many of the immigrants right from the beginning because they did not go to Nova Scotia or Kinmount , Ont. , or to New Iceland in what was to become Manitoba . He went to Wisconsin and began life as a farmer . He moved a number of times , settling , finally , in Alberta in the Markerville area . <p> His story is no different from many others except for one thing . In spite of his lack of formal education , he became a poet of great renown . He became known as the poet of the Rocky Mountains . His work was published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote in Icelandic and so , even though he took his material from daily life in North America , his audience was restricted to those who could read Icelandic . Today , as the Icelandic North American population continues to intermarry and disperse , there is the danger that Stephan G will be forgotten . <p> Stephan G Stephansson was not just a poet , not just an excellent poet , but a man with a clear vision of what was right and wrong in society . He was the conscience of society . He wrote about social issues , spared no one 's vanity or self-importance . His unwavering beliefs about social justice and religious matters brought him accolades but also enemies . His opposition to WWI resulted in a Manitoba MLA who also was of Icelandic background , trying to have him charged with treason . <p> The book begins with 65 pages of description of life in Iceland . I , personally , would have liked this section to be longer , more detailed , but that is because I 've done a great deal of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part of the book provides a good historical perspective and solid base from which to understand the impetus for Stephan 's beliefs and actions . <p> The journey west which follows is well described . It has enough detail to keep the reader focused on what the trip was like rather than on some romanticized version . <p> The remainder of the book centres on the conflicts in which Stephan found himself embroiled . We are taken into the division of the community between Unitarianism and Lutheranism . Today , the remains of that battle can be seen in the capital of New Iceland , Gimli , Manitoba , with the Lutheran church on Third Avenue and the Unitarian church on Second Avenue and the gap between them like a vast crevasse on an Icelandic glacier . <p> " Over the years , Winnipeg had become the home of an increasing number of Icelanders in North America . They established newspapers , first Leifur , that lasted only a few years , then Heimskringla ( 1886 ) and finally L gberg ( 1888 ) . The latter two papers became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . L gberg was liberal in politics but conservative in religious matters , while Heimskringla was conservative in politics but liberal in religion . " <p> " Stephan examined social issues closely and developed a fascination with Felix Adler 's ethical movement . Adler , a German Jew whose family immigrated to America in 1857 , had studied on both sides of the Atlantic and had read the works of Emerson and Kant . In 1876 he established an ethical movement , the Society for Ethical Culture , among radical intellectuals . " " Stephan with a group of farmers , established a society of liberal Icelanders who could accept neither the doctrines of the church nor the church 's declaration that religion was the fortress of culture and progress . " <p> Translations of Stephan 's poems appear throughout the book . The author does his best to provide the reader with translations of Stephan 's poetry but given the intricate forms that simply wo n't work in English , settles for prosy translations that give the reader the meaning of what is being said . Creating translations of Icelandic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an insurmountable problem . It is a problem that has already and will continue to keep English speaking readers from appreciating the genius that is declared in Iceland for Stephan 's work . <p> The book plays close attention to Stephan 's family life , the tragic death of one of his sons , the struggle to prosper at farming , his relationship with his wife and children . This helps to make him real , not a caricature of the embattled and battling poet . When he is honoured by being asked to visit Iceland and he tours the country to widespread adulation , Vidar describes Stephan as being worn and small , not the physical giant that some expected . The contrast between Stephan 's struggle to succeed as a farmer in difficult times and his success as a poet brings the reader close to the man whose search for truth in a world constrained by religious and secular dogmatism , makes him human . <p> I have found nothing to criticize about Wakeful Nights .

##3363952 <h> 100th Grey Cup Train is a fun CFL history lesson . <p> Those who are diehard fans of the Canadian Football League will likely know a fair bit about the history of the league . For those new to the game , or the casual fan , the Grey Cup 100 Tour Train serves as a travelling history lesson of the game and the league so many of us love . <p> Starting its 40 plus stop journey across the country in Vancouver , the train celebrates the past while also focusing on the current stars of the game , effectively captivating fans of all ages . It is beautifully wrapped with the 100 th Grey Cup logo and stars of the league such as Travis Lulay , Anthony Calvillo and Fred Stamps . The 100 th Grey Cup stamp collection is also prominently featured in the design . <p> There are two sections to the train , one focusing on the Grey Cup itself , while the others celebrate the rich and storied history of the league in a museum type setting . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grey Cup coaches as they prepare their teams for battle . Interactive touch screen displays allow fans to pull up the name plates of every championship team in the history of the trophy , or browse a fan photo montage . The rings of past champions are prominently displayed . The Grey Cup itself awaits visitors at the end of this car . Fans can have their picture taken with the trophy and have it receiver it by e-mail . <p> The history cars take fans from the beginning in 1909 and its eastern roots , to the inclusion of the west and right through to the present day . You can learn about the league during war time , the depression and about classic clashes like the Mud Bowl , the Fog Bowl and the Snow Bowl . ( Why do n't they call them cups ? ) . Did you know the price of a Grey Cup ticket in 1971 was $15.00 ? <p> There is another car ( which I apparently was n't supposed to be in ) that will cater to VIP 's and sponsors along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envision myself travelling to Toronto in November on the train . Oh what a party that would be as we picked up fans on our journey east ! <p> Even as a major CFL fan , there were several stories I was n't aware of before touring the train , so there is definitely something for everyone on board . <p> In addition to the train itself , there is a festival type atmosphere at the event . There was a strong presence by the Lions who had current and former players signing autographs . There were interactive football type activities for the kids and live music as well . <p> One of the coolest ideas to come from this tour is the Fan Cup presented by Telus . Fans can sign up and have their name included on new trophy to be called the Fan Cup that will eventually reside in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in Hamilton . Telus has come up with a penny press that turns your penny into a keepsake , while ensuring a piece of your penny will be used to create the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to stand in line for a bit . <p> The train is a great way to celebrate the 100 th Grey Cup Championship and the history behind it . In addition to the scheduled train stops the Grey Cup will also make several other appearances in communities all over the country , leading up to the big game in November . The cup itself will make a total of 100 appearances by the time the tour is done . <p> Get out and see it when it comes to your community and celebrate the storied 100 year history of the Canadian Football League ! <p> Hi , where and when will the Lion 's den party be at this year 's grey cup ? <p> bclionsden <p> The Lions Den party will be at the Toronto Convention Centre , I believe on Friday and Saturday night . Info should be released soon . <p> mike <p> Idiots black out the game , &; there is no hockey ! ! Seriously ? Morons . Cnd football has a bad enough time , they get a break with the hockey lock-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##3364551 <p> Peter Worthington has an excellent column in today 's Sun and I 'll give NNW a well deserved H/T for it -- Afghan prisoners not Canada 's issue . The whole thing is well worth the read but I 'll highlight some of the more salient points : <p> ... There is no suggestion that Canadian troops in Afghanistan have behaved badly towards captured Taliban insurgents who were trying to kill them . <p> The issue is whether these prisoners were mistreated after they were turned over to Afghan authorities , and whether Canadian authorities knew they would be abused . <p> That an inquiry looms is in great part the fault of Prime Minister Stephen Harper , and possibly Defence Minister Peter MacKay , and even a batch of senior officers . <p> When reports by diplomat Richard Colvin surfaced that the Afghans might be abusing or torturing -- or even releasing -- prisoners , instead of denying knowledge , or maligning the messenger , or equivocating , the PM ( and others ) might have defused criticism by simply pointing out Canada 's main priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat one another . <p> We are not in Afghanistan as colonizers , nor as conquerors . We have neither the interest nor the intention of staying there . We are there to help the existing government . We are not there to run the country , or to dictate how the country should be run . <p> Yes , we hope to have some influence on how democracy works , and to lead by example on how people should be treated -- or not treated . But we Canadians are temporary " guests " in Afghanistan , and are not there to dramatically alter the culture .... <p> ( . . . ) <p> ... If the PM and others had taken this route , and given this sort of explanation instead of deny , deny , deny , it 's difficult seeing any responsible Canadian getting upset . <p> We 've lost 140 Canadians to Taliban violence , and maybe 600 who 've been wounded , some with life-altering injuries . <p> In fact , it might even have been acceptable if the PM , when asked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the occasion to paraphrase Rhett Butler in the classic movie Gone With the Wind : " Frankly , folks , we do n't give a damn . " <p> Nor do Canadians give a damn . <p> Well I might disagree with that last statement . Opposition parties and liberal media that are trying to pin a pseudo-scandal on this Government might care . But Canadians who are worrying about their jobs ? Not very likely . <p> ... Iggy takes off , his own MPs force would could be interpreted as a motion of non confidence in our minority Parliament , and we are to believe that this is a coincidence ? Either Iggy did n't want his fingerprints on the candlestick , or he has no control over his caucus ... <h> 60 Responses to When one of them loses a nose or ear ... <p> Right , Canadians do n't give a damn about the Taliban but the Liberals have a deep concern for how they are treated in captivity . Why ? Are there enough Taliban sympathizers in Canada to garner them a few votes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group or issue to get votes , even if it sells their souls . This Taliban thing is the latter , they 're smearing our troops and our country . <p> We are at war and they 're demanding all documents be made public , how ridiculous and dangerous is that ? When people go to bat for the enemy in any way with their soldiers fighting in the field is that not treasonous ? Flying the human rights banner , taking the word of someone who spent only a very short time outside the wire , just does n't fit in this case . <p> Of course we should care how detainees we hand over to the Afghans are treated , frankly , there just is n't much any ' visiting ' country can do about it . Latest memo leaked showed how the Afghan govt told ' visiting ' countries they did not like all these visits to check up on prisoners , it INFRINGED ON THEIR SOVEREIGNY , and threatened to shut them out . In response , the visiting countries reduced visits to once a month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read Chris Selley 's post in Full Comment at NatPost .. ' Elliot Ness at the mic ' re Iggy ! BTW , if that video clip had been an interview with the furthest back-bench Cons MP , or anyone that worked for the Cons party .. it would be all over every lame-stream media outlet , it would be headline news in every paper for months ! This is the leader of the opposition , a man who fancies himself the next PM .. WHERE is the media coverage ? ? ? <p> The earthquake that devastated Haiti brought unimaginable horrors for its people , but Haitian women are suffering beyond what anyone could have foreseen . Reports from Port-Au-Prince tell of rapes of victims ranging down to two year old babies . <p> The camps where quake refugees are forced to live have turned into dark alleys of living hell that pulse with danger for women who have always been second class citizens in the male dominated dirt poor Haiti . Rape the worst nightmare of every woman has become their daily reality . <p> Sex for Food <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no security so women are forced to hide for their safety especially at night . They must carefully select where to take care of their " personal business " or risk presenting an opportunity for a sexual predator . <p> A Haitian Human Rights worker reports that 47,000 people live in a converted sports stadium designed for far fewer persons and certainly not for full time inhabitance . <p> He said former prison inmates , including hardened felons who ran to freedom during the quake , are hiding in the crowds . They make their way through the huddled masses of innocent people picking and choosing their next victim like tiger sharks . Many of the women and female children have no male family or friends left to protect them . <p> He reports the United Nations has done little or no patrolling in the camps . When food arrives , organized bands of criminals take control of it and " sell " it for sex from the young and healthy girls they spot in line . Those who refuse the trades are often summarily gang raped in the sight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Patrolling " UN Blue Hats look but never " see . " They never get out of cars . They merely drive by . " <p> Article 12 states that prisoners of war are the responsibility of the state not the persons who capture them and that they may not be transferred to a state that is not party to the Convention . " My highlighting . I assume in this instance " the state " refers to Afghanistan , that is , the place where the conflict is taking place . So , IMO , our forces and therefore our government should not be held responsible for what happens to the detainees after they are handed over to Afghan authorities . And Afghanistan is a party to the convention , so our government has been acting in accordance with this Article . <p> " Articles 13 to 16 state that prisoners of war must be treated humanely without any adverse discrimination and that their medical needs must be met . " There have been reports that this has always been the case . So once again , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detainees , if any has taken place . <p> As I commented a few days ago at Chucker 's ... The detainees issue brought up by the opposition denigrates our CFs ' admirable work , perhaps even lowering their morale helps and encourages the enemy , seeing the kind of discord they can create it encourages people I consider lower than kitty litter , people whose only purpose in life seems to be a Ph'D 'd shit-disturber and most of all , it discredits the admirable work Canada has done in the past and continues to do internationally , at great cost in lives and treasure . <p> And for what ? So that gnat-like MPs like Ujjal Dosanjh and Jack Harris can feel relevant ? <p> It 's hard to tell from that obviously and very clumsily edited tape . This is the kind of video editing one might expect from the Liberals or NDP . If Ignatieff DID " hang " himself with his statements , show the whole thing and let us decide what he meant for ourselves . <p> And , I AM NO FAN of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long string of Liberal Leaders the last forty years , and wish to hell he 'd go back to the Hallowed Halls and stay out of Canadian politics . <p> I 'm sorry to be so long-winded ... and for repeating what I said a few days ago at Chucker 's , with minor revisions . <p> I have n't read Ignatieff 's work , apart from excerpts quoted in the media and some of his articles , but I happen to agree with what he argued regarding torture : if it will help to avoid a greater evil , like the explosion of a nuclear bomb , then like him , I 'm for water-boarding the SOBs who have that kind of information . <p> I thus find myself in an uneasy position when my fellow conservatives bring up the topic of Ignatieff being " pro-torture " and deriding him for it . I imagine Ignatieff himself must feel the same kind of unease when he has to launch the kind of accusations he and his opposition pals have been launching . It shows inconsistency on his part and posturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big IF -- the Taliban have been " tortured " for the same reason , i.e. to find out where the IEDs intended to kill our CFs have been planted , then I also support some form of " torture " to extract that kind of information . ? ? I suppose admitting that makes me a horrible person . So be it . I am talking for myself . I am not a spokesperson for the Conservative Party or the Conservative government . <p> But this whole question of Canada , or the current government , or the Conservatives being " complicit " or guilty of " war crimes " is an effing sham designed only for one purpose : to smear the Conservatives . <p> ChuckerCanuck asked this question a few days ago : " So why did Afghan prisoner abuse become an issue only in 2006 ? " As far as I 'm concerned , it became an issue because the Conservatives came to power . <p> We hear that the fact torture was going on was common knowledge . ? If that is the case ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail -- send reporters to investigate detainee conditions in Afghanistan in 2001 , 2002 , 2003 ... ? Why did n't the then-Liberal government put in place a sound detainee transfer agreement ? Why did that government agree to the apparently faulty agreement signed late in December 2005 , perhaps hastily arranged to avoid questions arising during the election ? Why did n't such renowned human rights " champions " as Amir Attaran raise the issue in 2001 , 2002 , 2003 ... when Eileen Olexiuk raised it with the previous Liberal government ? I mean , if he indeed was able to obtain access to some unredacted documents , as claimed in a CBC report http : **61;1786;TOOLONG , when did he get those unredacted documents ? Who leaked them ? Are people who handle those documents allowed to leak them to the media ? <p> Gabby and all -- if this was truly about torture and about unbiased looks at it then I might side with you , BUT , I do n't think for one minute that this is what it is . It 's an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " torturer " moniker as if to suggest that because it happened under his watch it 's because he 's ok with or condones it . It 's neither balanced nor unbiased . <p> Because the LPOC has been really quick to ramp up every faux scandal and manipulate it makes this request seem just another kick at Harper , nothing more nothing less ( as you answered to Chucker 's question ) . <p> To be very honest and even more shocking to your position on some torture ... I do n't care because it 's warfare . <p> We already know that if taken prisoner the enemy have been coached to scream accuse their captors of torture . It 's one thing in war to trust no one , but trusting the LPOC on this and assume their motive initially had anything to do with getting to the truth does n't wash with me . <p> That the LPOC years in power may be included in a review has the LPOC changing their tune slightly because this could all blow up in their face . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another public inquiry on this . Given that we 're just recovering economically , can we afford one now ? <p> Re maz2 ? s post on the useless U.N. , that was my experience after my family and I were in a magnitude 7.4 earthquake in the Caribbean back in the ' 90s . <p> The U.N . reps " patrolled " the area like the cock of the walk and did damn-all , despite the blatant corruption in the delivery of emergency relief services . <p> Their headquarters was a gated mansion surrounded by manicured lawns and flower gardens in the best neighbourhood in the capital city . They could have cared less about the corruption and the suffering of the people at the epicentre of the quake . <p> I suspect that their biggest concern was what to wear to the cocktail party that night once they 'd patrolled the earthquake devastation and were then flown back to the unaffected capital city . <p> I ca n't remember a time in the history of Canada where our official opposition spent 24/7 shilling for the enemy over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Libs smear our troops and at the same time hissing and spitting at anyone who dares opinine they are smearing our troops . I 've always know the Liberal Party was anti-Military because I witness them stripped our forces down naked when hubby served but their behavior these days goes beyond the pale . <p> Gabby here 's another question , why are the libs so sure they have a smoking gun in the detainee documents ? Did someone put something in that file on purpose in hopes of causing the Cons embarrassment ? Something stinks , I hope all documents are being checked for varification , I 'm getting some ugly vibes from the Liberals it 's like they know what they want to expose ? <p> Rose at 11:55 am : " I hope all documents are being checked for varification ... " Which is precisely why it 's a good idea to have an independent opinion on which documents should be made available to the public at large . <p> Former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci has now been demoted by the opposition to the status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hired a lawyer " the opposition sneers . They keep insisting on a public inquiry , I suppose hoping what happened with the Gomery Commission would be duplicated , with the government in place at the time going down to defeat . <p> IMO , not all documents should be made available to the media and the public at large , especially if those documents might help our enemies . That is why Justice Iacobucci 's review of all the documents to determine which ones can be released is a very wise move on the part of the government -- and will probably cost less than a full-blown public inquiry . <p> Good Lord Ruth .. I really wish I had read your warning prior to watching the projectile vomitus coming out of Tom Clark tonite ! If that was n't a Lib.campaign , I do n't know what was .. every Cons that appears on PP , should just sit there and keep repeating John McCallum , John McCallum for every question.Clark is becoming more offensive with every show , and ctv needs to lose viewers over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and Tom is getting worse . Tonight was downright awful and I did write to CTV about it . I suggested that Jane T. get a job somewhere behind the camera , and I told them it was no wonder the networks were losing money . No one can stand watching her performance very long . <p> Clark is a piece of work , a Liberal piece of work , could n't be more obvious , he 's one of their main shills . It 's off my list , no point watching such blatant bias . It 's simply a Liberal love fest . If CTV ca n't see that , they 're willfully blind . <p> I was especially disgusted with Tom Clark " s treatment of Candace Hoeppner tonight . He and Craig Oliver and Jane Taber are working for the Liberal Party and CTV and sponsors obviously approve ! ! ! Evan Soloman 's panel on CBC feel that Blackburn has been unfairly targeted and is not known to ever raise his voice.Go figure ! ! ! Anyway on a brighter note I went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Stephen Harper ! he waved as he walked 10 feet to his car . There was a small respectful crowd and he missed his chance to make an impression and shake our hands . Disappointed ! ! Mostly students and a few ordinary citizens who were appreciative of the Prime Ministers visit . The RCMP were friendly as we waited to see him . Most of us just wanted to see a Canadian Prime Minister once in our life . Only 3 prime Ministers have ever visited Brandon , Manitoba . <p> Is it some kind of weird ritual of penance that keeps you humble lot glued to CTV ..... period ? <p> This " take one for the team " mantra is not my expectation of any one here . <p> Save yourselves the frustration , tune out and tell your friends and family to tune out . <p> Each time you tune in and hate what you see/hear you 're still logging in as a patron CTV and Power Play audience . <p> You folks are better than CTV and Power Play . <p> ( ok -- go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to exposing the lies and negativity because you 'd be right . I choose to follow the example of our PM who is where he is now because he 's working the high road ) . <p> Actually we should go after CTV program management , email them and ask them to review Clark 's PP shows with an open mind and report back to us . Let them try telling us he is n't shilling for the Liberals and favouring them as guests on his show , then we 'll know they 're in on it too . We can also go after sponsors . Let 's do it ! <p> " Power Play is really bad today , be warned ! ! Ms. Taber forgets that other people have made fools of themselves in airports . " <p> Taber is a fine one to talk about making a fool of oneself . <p> Yesterday , in the House of Commons , the opposition were going after Blackburn . You should have heard them ! ! What a disgraceful performance on their part . <p> They have nothing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted with the waste of money having such a pathetic opposition that fails to deal with significant issues that are important to Canadians ! ! <p> Hi Fay in Brandon ! Being a fellow Manitoban ( SE area ) when I heard PMSH was going to be in Brandon , I really wanted to go see him .. that darn thing known as a job interfered tho.You mentioned that 3 other PM 's visited the Wheat City , and I know one of them was Dief the Chief , cuz my Dad was one that got to see him ! Dad was a quiet , very hard-working man , with 5 kids to support , but he took the time off work to see his ' hero ' .. I remember Dad saying he would have crawled over broken glass to get to see the man he just idolized.My Dad absolutely hated Pearson , and his feelings toward Trudeau were even stronger ! re:ctv .. we really need to BOYCOTT ! Write ctv , even your local outlets to complain .. we are going to hurt them.Contact their advertisers as well.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV broadcasters suffer big losses ' Canada 's biggest private television broadcasters made major cuts last yr as they grappled with the recession , but the industry still booked a big financial loss . The CRTC says private-sector conventional TV stations-which include the likes of Global and CTV-reported losses before interest and taxes of $116.4 million in 2009 . That was after a massive 93% drop in profits to $8 mil during 2008 . The CRTC said national ad revenues fell by 10.3% to $1.32 billion , in the year ended Aug.31,2009 , while local ad revenues were also down more than 10% . Broadcasters also slashed their workforces to contend with losses , with CTV closing 2 of it 's affiliate stations , and Global making cuts to it 's staff as it struggles to restructure its operations . <p> Soooo , DON " T watch , call your local ctv outlet to complain .. be loud and be heard ! I have Fox on this am , and boy I feel much better.BTW , I wonder if ctv is trying to get even with PMSH and the Cons Gov't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them out .. were n't they whining about needing money to ' save local TV ? ' Just a thot . <p> Now , please , do n't anybody get offended , but ... I just can not understand people who keep telling other people here to shut off the TV and not watch " unfriendly " programs . <p> How do they expect us all to stay informed about issues ? How do they expect us to know what our adversaries are up to and what we 're against ? Do n't they think we have a role , albeit a small one , in countering the propaganda that 's out there ? Is n't that what we need to do , each and every one of us , to exercise our own critical thinking skills , and be able to determine what 's fact and what 's fiction in the discussion of political affairs during those programs ? <p> It 's not enough to go on about how wonderful our PM is , how successful he has been to date . We have to inform ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebut the arguments put forward by the adversaries of the government . Whenever we feel the urge , we can email someone like Tom Clark and tell him how wrong he was in saying whatever he said , something like " you 're wrong in stating such &; such because of this fact and this other fact . " It 's not enough to just tell him how biased he is and that you 're no longer going to watch . <p> How can we counter what the adversaries of the government are saying if we do n't know WHAT they 're saying ? I 'm sorry , it 's totally beyond my understanding . <p> As I said at the beginning , I do n't mean to offend anyone , but being nagged is not one of my favourite things . <p> Joanne , I wish I had written this before writing my previous comment . I know my previous comment will probably start another argument among conservatives here , which is NOT my intent , so if you decide not to publish my previous comment , I 'm OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either you contribute to the continuing of CTV or you do n't . In my opinion every additional viewer helps them continue . They will not change just because you 've banged off a few choice letters . It helps your nerves and is a release in the short term but in the long term they continue BECAUSE it pushes buttons . That 's why people tune in -- for the tabloid crap . <p> I just give Canadians a whole lot more credit , and do n't feel that they need to be hand-held and led to the truth . Some do through yes . <p> That your concerned about starting an argument among conservatives here need n't have clarification or qualification . <p> I respect your choice for tuning in to CTV and encouraging your perspective , but in doing so ask that you respect mine for doing so too . <p> It makes no sense to me why intelligent people go back to what pisses them off most instead of tuning in to those media types who do n't offend you . <p> Nothing will make them change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps something much larger like a Boycott . However in order to sell a boycott folks have to be true to themselves first and lead by example . <p> By the way see Sandy 's coverage of Duffy 's speech in which he takes a shot at the shoddy education journalism students receive these days . <p> I have no objective but to turn those here who are constantly critical of what they see and hear on CTV to simply make the choice to turn off . By tuning in here to BLY I wanted to make it clear that I place no expectation on anyone to " take one for the team " at all . Beyond the bias is a Prime Minister and government that are doing too good of a job for me to dwell on the negative for too long . Sure it 's fun sometimes but that 's all it is to me . A diversion from where I believe the attention these days should focus which is in the accomplishments of our PM . I happened to read on an earlier thread here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching 1500 in government . Yet there was little to no comment about that . Hmmm . <p> Gabby -- that you think that you 're going to start an argument paints a rather dim view of discussion here . I see it as being able to have differing opinions under one big tent , as Joanne offers . <p> Richco , let me try to explain how I feel about this . We all are on the same side but some of us choose to support the Conservative party in different ways . Gabby chooses to keep a close eye on MSM and call BS where she sees it . I respect that . <p> You choose to ignore the idiots on CTV and I respect that too . But what we really need to try to avoid is telling each other what we ' should ' and ' should not ' do . <p> You may not " ... feel that they need to be hand-held and led to the truth " but you certainly think those who comment negatively on the media here are in need of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negativity . <p> Look , I know you mean well . You want to accentuate the positive ? Go ahead . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're welcome to do so by pointing us to " good news stories " with appropriate links if possible . <p> But it is up to each and every commenter to decide what they wish to applaud and/or vent about . I assume we are all adults here . I do n't think we need to be lectured on what to view or what to avoid AND be told we 're in need of an " intervention " , to boot . <p> As for my painting " a rather dim view of discussion here " that is not at all the case . Accept my word on it or not . But given my previous encounters on this same topic with you Richco , and with C.C. and Sol , I thought it best to warn Joanne , since I am a guest here . It is HER blog , and she uses moderation whenever she deems it necessary . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might perhaps want to avoid a predictable minor squabble . As you can see , the squabble was indeed predictable , minor though it may be . <p> But it is up to each and every commenter to decide what they wish to applaud and/or vent about . I assume we are all adults here . I do n't think we need to be lectured on what to view or what to avoid AND be told we 're in need of an " intervention " , to boot . <p> Have n't heard from tj for quite some time . The last I heard he was headed for an operation ? ? <p> I really get a kick out of his posts . Hopefully , he 's a-ok . Has anyone heard from him ? <p> Joanne , I believe the combined methods of Gabby and Richco are the best medicine in dealing with the opposition and the national media , etc .. <p> It appears to me that everyone here has a unique way of confronting the issues out there . I think that makes for a powerful team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Disagree if you will , but be respectful and fair . <p> Joanne , not stated often enough , your daily posts are exceptional . I blame you for keeping me away from the mountain of work in front of me . <p> I figure , when I get to heaven ( hopefully ) , I 'll be able to do all the things I never got to do on earth . LOL <p> And you Gabby should n't play judge and jury with me . I have fully disclosed to Joanne and why I made the changes I did . I own neither you or anyone else here an explanation . <p> That you felt the need to " warn " Joanne was firstly unnecessary and childish at best . <p> Joanne as moderator and referee needs to listen to all feedback that comes to her privately ... including mine . <p> My points are my own as yours are yours . <p> On the off chance that we 're not preaching to the converted here , do your best to stem the flow of negative liberal media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level that I understand intimately how thick the bias runs . I also get enough feedback myself to suggest that people are cluing in to the bias .. that 's why some media is in trouble -- because folks are tuning them out . <p> P.S. -- in an effort to be more respectful and fair , I change my " childish " descriptor in the previous post . The fact that you identified both CC , Sol and Richco as the same person is very close to outing a fellow blogger . That you have no idea what my reasoning hopefully stayed that way . I 'm hoping beyond hope that Joanne did n't disclose my personal information to you . <p> I 'd like to know that publicly please Joanne . I 'm sure I did n't owe Gabby an explanation . After all I do n't know Gabby at all , if that 's his/her real name or any thing else that requires " warning " . <p> Richco , I invite you to re-read exactly what I wrote at 3:14 pm : " But given my previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with C.C. and Sol , I thought it best to warn Joanne , since I am a guest here . ... " Nowhere did I say in that sentence of mine you were all one and the same person . <p> Now compare what I wrote with what you just wrote : " The fact that you identified both CC , Sol and Richco as the same person is very close to outing a fellow blogger . " If anyone outed a blogger , it was you yourself , not me . I never even mentioned your name in my 10:18 am comment . <p> Furthermore , the " warning " I was giving Joanne was a heads up , so that she could decide to either publish or delete my 10:18 am comment . <p> So , my " warning " had nothing , absolutely nothing to do with your name or identity . What my warning did have to do with , was exactly what has happened now , what I was concerned might happen : a squabble which appears to be escalating unnecessarily . I thought Joanne might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is why I warned her in my 11:37 am comment . <p> I stand by my original points : We are adults , and if we want to complain about the media , pointing out how poorly they 've covered a certain event , we should be able to do so without being scolded . Likewise , if we want to applaud how well the PM or the government is doing , we should also be able to do that . I 'm sure no one will be scolded for doing that . <p> As I said in my original post , my comment was not meant to offend . I see how wrong I was , thinking that my 10:18 am comment would be viewed as just a general comment rather than what you think it was , a personal attack -- which it was n't . <p> ... So , my " warning " had nothing , absolutely nothing to do with your name or identity . What my warning did have to do with , was exactly what has happened now , what I was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily ... <p> The only problem with ' squabbles ' from my POV is that it takes more than the usual time for me to moderate and attempt to diffuse . <p> However , I am in favour of healthy debate and I think we may have achieved a consensus here that as Ed very diplomatically pointed out we can all contribute in different ways and it can still be effective . <p> Against my better judgement , and while I see how I misinterpreted what you were suggesting to Joanne publicly re : the firestorm your post might have ( and did ) create let me ask you this Gabby . <p> Why is it that an observation that I make that when I take all of the posts into consideration and revisit the issue of how it HELPS the very negative news-spinners to simply carry on their their bias and negativity , when folks here have identified it also as a waste of time that coming from me it 's viewed by you as " scolding " ? <p> I do think it strange to linger on something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could one not come to the conclusion by reading the blog offerings here that there might be more of a pleasure taken in piling-on of the negative than the building up of the positive ? <p> Preaching to the converted and the regulars here is one thing , but for folks looking in might be surprised by the amount of time and energy given to the opposition and their tabloid journalists when we have one heck of an opportunity to pump up the winner and help get that majority we all know we can get if only we had an election right now ? <p> Righting the inconsistencies in a factual and objective way is n't really what we want either is it ? <p> We want our guy to get a fair shake and be credited more often for doing a good job . Often that 's not what happens here and sometimes we are just as bad as those tabloids for the name-calling and bias . <p> My choice is to look for opportunities and ideas to help me do just that in my capacity and in my community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when the discussion ( on any Tory blog ) champions what we can most affect at the moment .... our support for the PM , his achievements and perhaps fill the void left by those creepy biased , tabloid types . From his support base he deserves that and much more . <p> I had a great day thanks ! With no Question Period on my agenda today it 's looking brighter this Sunday , despite the cold and odd snow flurry . <p> Richo , not to butt into your exchange with Gabby , BUT , do we not have to talk about the negative stuff the media are putting out to deal with it as well ? We here are all aware of the positives of this Harper Conservative government and support it , we are not going to sway any jealous Liberals or their coalition partners , however , we have to go after the lies and innuendo spewed by the Liberal shills on our political programs and in the printed media on a daily basis . They 've reduced themselves to tabloid journalism , CTV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping on stuff hot off the wires without the complete story , that 's pure gossip . <p> I think we need the whole package , we ca n't just wear the rose colored glasses when we 're dealing with the opposition which sadly includes the mainstream media . <p> Liz -- it 's not as if the discussion was between the two of us . I 'm not that naive . There is no premium on input here . <p> I hear what you 're saying but at the same time see that the MSM you 're trying to change in small battles is losing the biggest war of them all . To who ? The new media and yes , bloggers . <p> BUT , what the old MSM types do well that some bloggers and their participants have yet to learn to do is present new and original content that the old guard does every day . So far here we can seem to only react to what the MSM dishes out . <p> As I said . It 's one thing to call them on the lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to mimic the pile-on just is n't necessary in a new media world where folks are tuning in for something different perhaps than what the old guard of media are offering . That audience seems to be increasing ... not so for the same old MSM . <p> I 'm not suggesting for one minute that just because we 're supporting the PM more is akin to wearing rose-colored glasses . I 'm as aware as anyone here about the machinations of bias , in some ways more than I can talk about here . It 's everywhere . <p> Perhaps that 's why our country now is favouring the message of confidence and hope that the PM is working hard at to the doom , gloom and negativity of the alternative ? <p> When all is said and done , in someways bloggers like Joanne are pioneers because they have , or soon will have if they 're effective a huge contingent of on-lookers and participants who may be looking for that one common thread of idea that will make them choose Harper over the other guy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service of sorts . They 're accountable for everything on their blogs with none of the perks or pressures of the newsroom AND they have the best seat in the house with respect to free labour and great researchers . <p> It was mentioned to me the other day that Conservatives have more blogs than do the Liberals but few seem unable or unwilling to drive the news their way by making it . Making us less dependent on a Fox-like organization to save us from the glut of Liberal bias . <p> All I can do is try . The choice is up to those who spend time here with more regularity than I do . <p> ... BUT , what the old MSM types do well that some bloggers and their participants have yet to learn to do is present new and original content that the old guard does every day . So far here we can seem to only react to what the MSM dishes out ... <p> MSM often regard bloggers as leeches for that reason . I honestly do n't think bloggers will ever entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put out this blog is to hold the media accountable . I ca n't do that if I do n't sample their output and weigh the bias and the truth factor . <p> I also have neither the time nor the resources ( nor the interest ) to go out finding my own stories except on that rare occasion when I am able to attend a political event of some interest . <p> Ultimately I am blogging because I want to get what I perceive to be the truth out there . <p> No , Richo , Joanne has n't put a premium on input here on her blog . We are free to post all the good news and sing the praises of PM Harper and we do , it 's here for all who visit this site to read about . BUT , we also are able to call the opposition and their minions on anything they spout that is n't fair or factual . <p> I just watched the clip from question period with Candice Hoepner and two old white NDP guys Bob Rae and Dewar.I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child and Maternal Health care to save lives around the world . The two old white guys look very foolish pushing abortion on women in desperate countries . How can anyone defend what Bob Rae is proposing ? Craig Oliver , the old dirt bag tried to portray Candace as a prolife , gunslinging backbencher hick from the west . No wonder women do n't want to go into politics . I am sure the MSM will begin to target Candice Hoepner to bring her down a notch or two on Bob Rae 's orders. ( oops I mean power corps orders ) <p> Speaking of abortion , it looks like the U.S. health care bill will pass but some key Democrats had held out until they were assured that there would be no federal funds for abortion . I wonder what Bob Rae would say about that ? <p> You know i have been prochoice all my life but am very frightened by Liberals like Rae and Iggy who want to push abortion on women against their will . To me that is not prochoice ! ! ! ! All @ @ 
##3366652 <h> Pulling Away From the Pack <p> When you get into the first paragraph of the following article , you 're likely to wonder why I 've chosen to post it at this time , rather than on New Year 's Day . Well , as you 're also likely to discover , Justin Johnson 's piece is timeless , in that his suggestions would serve us well at absolutely any time of the year . <p> That said , I think that NOW is a very critical time in a hockey player 's year . As many of us CoachChic.com writers suggested last spring , this is a time for reflection , or for taking an account of how we did this past season . And so is it a time to plan ahead -- so that we might improve upon some of our shortcomings , and to build further upon our strengths . <p> -- Dennis Chighisola <p> * * * <p> Justin Johnson , Performance Coach <p> * * * <p> Pulling Away From the Pack <p> As many athletes return to school from break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down a challenge to all and any youth athletes and non athletes reading this , especially , those contemplating New Year 's resolutions . Whatever your area of activity , be it in school , friends , family , church , or in athletics : Separate Yourself . Be special , dare to be different , lead the pack , go big or go home . However you would like to say it or phrase it , I ask you to be bold enough to do it . <p> Few athletes exemplified this mindset more than baseball 's Babe Ruth ; he swung for the fences whether it was on the field , at the dinner table or in his life off the field . " I swing big , with everything I 've got , " Ruth said . " I hit big or I miss big . I like to live as big as I can . " As a result , for many years Ruth held the record for most home runs and for most strikeouts . He saw strikeouts as part of the deal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next home run . " <p> By this time you may be asking yourself how can I , little average old me , do such a thing ? Here is how you get started . Find one activity you do regularly in your life . School , sports , church and friends are all good venues . Then give more effort , care , time and energy to that activity . Use your time in that activity to do it better and longer than others around you . The result , over time , is that you build a sense of pride and fulfillment within yourself . This feeling will only propel your drive to continue to separate yourself . <p> There is one other way you will know you have begun to separate yourself . Others will question you and urge you to stop ! They may even make fun of you or criticize your increased efforts . This is exactly what you want ! You see , there are far too many of us stuck in the center of it all . Risking little , gaining little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were meant to live . Others will feel threatened by your new found feeling of fulfillment and your new status separate from the center , and they will do what they can to urge you back to the pack . Do n't let them ! Dare to be special , dare to be great and continue your efforts to do so regardless of what others say . <p> If you are looking to make some changes this new year , or even capitalize on some momentum built in ' 09 , then make sure you are willing to be special . Do n't be afraid to separate yourself to go after what you want . I assure you , you deserve it and you wo n't regret it . <p> If you would like help in taking the first step , or when others begin to urge you back to the pack , please call us ... we 'd love to help you with your success 763-439-5246 ! <p> Members might find this interesting ...

However , for about a 5-years , the title of that column was " Dare To Be Different ! " Ya , as Justin might say , I was suggesting to my readers that they should separate themselves from the rest of the pack ! <p> I have no doubts that member hockey players and coaches know right now what is needed for them to jump far beyond all their competition next fall . Following Justin 's advice RIGHT NOW is one sure fire way to get what you want . There 's a long time between now and the start of next season , you know , and all those months offer you plenty of time to make huge changes in your game .

##3374751 <p> As mentioned in my pervious article , I will continue to delve into why so many women are having bad sex and how we can improve our sex lives . So , let 's talk about ( bad ) sex baby ! <p> We have all seen it in the movies or on television . That sex scene where the female is on her back rolling her eyes , checking out her latest mani/pedi while having intercourse . Meanwhile , the male is oblivious and continues thrusting with vigour , asking her to ' say his name ' ! The women then says ' oh yeah ( name ) you are the man ' ! This ultimately pushes him over the edge and he thrusts one final time , reaching climax . Thereafter , he falls off of her exhausted , breathing heavily ... meanwhile she has n't broken a sweat and her thoughts are consumed with what time her yoga class is starting . <p> You all know what I 'm talking about because not only have you witnessed it in movies and on television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean to have bad sex ? We ca n't simply say that if we do n't reach climax that means it 's bad sex . I believe you can climax with someone and it still is bad sex . However it 's not as bad because you were able to climax , but in order to do it , you had to squeeze your eyes closed and imagine you were somewhere else or with someone else . To me , bad sex can be caused by all or one of the contributing factors including but not limited to : little to no chemistry , lack of foreplay , lack of mental stimulation , bad foreplay , hygiene issues , physical limitations , lack in range of motion , rhythmic motion is off , or just plain and simple , the sex just was n't sexy ! <p> So what can we do to eliminate the bad sex from our lives ? I think many of our issues can be solved by doing a few simple things . First off , choose your partner wisely . Too often do I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he grew on her ' or ' she felt sorry for him ' or because ' he is a really nice guy ' . Let me tell you something ladies , if something about him does n't get your juices flowing the first time you saw or spoke to him , chances are , your chemistry is not going to suddenly develop over time . Secondly , communicate with him about sex before you enter the bedroom . People are often focused on getting to know who you are , from what you do for a living , your likes and dislikes , favourite colour , if you are a morning person or a night owl , what foods you like etc . But we often fail to talk about some of the main things that cause a relationship to fail . Money and Sex . For the sake of this article we will talk about sex only ... though understanding someone 's financial position is also very important to discuss . Talking about sex can seem difficult or embarrassing , but is n't it more difficult and embarrassing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , it 's going to happen anyways , so why not talk about it ? <p> I have developed a series of questions that help you to understand your partner better from a sexual standpoint . Here are a few questions you can ask to approach the subject without seeming too ... let 's just say it , slutty . <p> 1 -- What is your favourite part of sex , foreplay or intercourse ? <p> 2 -- What is your biggest turn on/off ? <p> 3 -- What would you rate yourself on a sexual scale from 1-10 ? <p> 4 -- What is something you have n't done sexually that you want to try ? <p> 5 -- What would you absolutely not do sexually ? <p> Start off by playing a game of ' five questions ' . Tell him that he can ask you five sexual questions afterwards . Make him feel comfortable enough with you that you wo n't judge him for his responses so that he will tell you the truth . And please whatever you do , not show any dislike for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run . I guarantee that based on these questions you will have a good idea of your guy sexually good , bad or indifferent . Based on the answers and opening the lines of communication there should be less 
##3377452 <h> All your stories <p> OTTAWA - If you 're trying to hide a few bucks from the taxman , your best bet may be to head to the Far North . <p> And if you 're doing anything remotely dodgy when it comes to taxes , the worst place to be could well be Manitoba . <p> Documents obtained by QMI Agency show neighbours and friends in Canada 's most northern reaches are far more likely to protect you from the prying eyes of auditors with the Canada Revenue Agency than in any other part of the country . <p> While about 25,000 Canadians make a report to the CRA 's National Informant Leads Program every year , in the last five years , not one single lead has come to Revenue Canada from anyone in the Yukon , the Northwest Territories , or Nunavut . <p> In 2010 - the most recent year for which data was made available - there was just one call from a Nova Scotian , compared to more than 700 tips on tax cheats from Nova Scotians phoned in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manitoba . <p> Canada Revenue Agency data , obtained by researcher Ken Rubin on behalf of QMI Agency through federal Access to Information laws , shows Manitobans are more likely - by a long shot - to let the taxman know if they suspect a friend or neighbour is trying to hide some money from Ottawa . <p> In 2009-2010 , about 34 of every 10,000 Manitobans had provided information to the CRA on potential tax cheaters . <p> The actual numbers ? <p> In 2009-2010 , CRA received " leads " from 4,202 Manitobans . Manitoba 's population at that time was about 1.2 million . <p> Next door in Saskatchewan , where Statistics Canada recorded just more than one million citizens in 2010 , CRA received all of 31 leads that year . <p> Manitoba 's propensity for snitching was far and above the highest ratio of any province in Canada . <p> Statistics Canada estimates Canada 's underground economy is worth $40 billion a year . Revenue Canada 's informant leads program is an important component of its investigative strategy to try to find untaxed income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money the informant program is generating . <p> But the documents obtained by QMI Agency show the agency investigates about half of all tips it gets and when it does contact a suspected tax cheat , the suspect fesses up and sends in a cheque about 80% of the time . <p> Citizens in Ontario and B.C. were the next most likely to snitch to the taxman , but only about eight of every 10,000 residents of those provinces told the CRA of their suspicions . <p> Quebec 's ratio was half that . Just four Quebecers in 10,000 told the CRA about a friend or neighbour who might be cheating on taxes . <p> And while CRA got absolutely bupkis from anyone in north of 60 , it did n't get much , either , from Albertans . Just 91 leads came to the CRA from Albertans , which means fewer than one in 
##3377652 <h> Top Pick 2012 - Pick of the Week #6 <p> In the past 2 weeks , we 've seen a massive variety of work submitted to the Pikto Online Gallery .

Both are completely different avenues of photography , but are still compelling story-telling series . <p> The first , of which one is pictured above , are Ivan Palis ' s collection dream-like portraits .

##3382650 <p> As we gear up for the most wonderful time of the year -- Halloween ! -- Jon and Kiva weigh in on what makes a haunted house tale so horrible ( and by horrible we mean great ) . <p> Patricia makes friendly small talk with her brother in Amityville II : The Possession . <p> Jon 's Take : <p> Lacking the artful subtlety of Kiva 's pick , Amityville II : The Possession may not be one of the greatest haunted house films ever made , but it 's certainly one of the most unfairly overlooked . Designed as a prequel to The Amityville Horror , this is really a stand-alone haunted house film that shares little more than a location with its predecessor . Directed by Italian genre maestro Damiano Damiani ( A Bullet For the General , How to Kill a Judge ) , this recklessly absorbing film abandons the restrained conventionality of Stuart Rosenberg 's original for an anything goes dissection of one deeply troubled family . <p> As we watch the Montellis move into their new home , their dynamic seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an act , a fantasy rooted in denial . In reality , they are all victims of an abusive , sexually frustrated patriarch ( the inescapably skuzzy Burt Young ) , who seems determined to wage unmotivated mental and physical warfare on every member of his loving family -- and anyone who stops by for a visit , including a local priest . Like The Shining , Amityville II : The Possession makes it clear that something is wrong with this father long before he sets foot in his new home . In fact , Anthony Montelli is such an irredeemable deadbeat , it 's hard to believe he fathered these squeaky clean children in the first place . <p> This is where the haunted house comes in . Rather than simply torment the Montelli family , the house seizes on their weaknesses , bringing all their repressed fears and desires to the surface . As Damiani makes visual in a dinner sequence early in the film , this house is simply mirroring the family 's true selves back at them . Anthony clearly wants to abuse his kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misbehaved . Right on cue , he rips off his belt and takes a few lashes at these impossibly innocent children . Anthony 's long-suffering eldest son , Sonny , has been harbouring a grudge against his abusive father for years and the house gives him the courage to finally take a stand . Even the affectionate dynamic between Sonny and his sister Patricia is exposed as something much darker when the house prompts them to transform flirtatious undercurrents into a full-blown sexual relationship . <p> This barrage of wild behaviour culminates in a sequence of shocking brutality that leaves most of the characters dead . As a result , the film 's final 30 minutes lack the dense vitality of the preceding 75 . This has left a bad taste in the mouths of many viewers over the years , causing them to overlook the film 's bold complexities . To do justice to those complexities would require far more space than I have here , but this is easily one of the most daring and provocative films of its kind . Full of inventive visual ideas and transgressive plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion of its era 's most iconic horror films ( The Shining , The Exorcist , The Omen , Halloween ) . Any haunted house film can discourage future homebuyers , but this warped oddity may even stifle your urge to start a family . <p> A room with a view ... to horror ! <p> Kiva 's Take : <p> The Innocents begins in black . A dark screen refuses to light up -- literally not illuminating anything about the story -- when suddenly a girl 's voice begins to sing : " We lay my love and I , beneath the weeping willow . " This dislocated voice sets the tone for The Innocents ( 1961 ) , a Gothic haunting which remains chilling , decades after its release . It 's not merely the eerie lyrics ( a love song turned ghost tale ) , but the very acoustics which are echoing and disembodied . In this way , The Innocents operates like a haunted house : the scares do n't necessarily come from what lies around the corner , but rather are found in the creaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton , The Innocents is a counterpoint to the Hammer Horror films that dominated this period . Gone is the gushing blood and Technicolour , replaced with a stark black and white cinematography and surrealist sequences that reflect the interiority of our heroine , Miss Giddens ( Deborah Kerr ) . Based on the novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James , Miss Giddens is hired as governess by a rich bachelor to care for his orphaned niece and nephew . Her post is at Bly , an isolated mansion in the English countryside , as lavish as it is labyrinthine . Alone but for the children and the housekeeper , Mrs. Grose ( Megs Jenkins ) , Miss Giddens soon starts to hear and see things in the house . And most alarmingly , she believes these apparitions are controlling the children . <p> The lynchpin of The Innocents ' depravity -- a sinister lust simmers constantly throughout the film -- hinges on a quick comment by Miss Giddens . When asked by her young charge , Flora ( Pamela Franklin ) , what it was like growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secrets require a privacy that my house did n't provide . " Here the terror of the haunted manor is crystallized . Each room contains memories of lives lived and the larger the house , the more room for villainous deeds to transpire in dark corners . <p> On top of this -- and crucial to any good haunted house film -- Miss Giddens never gets her bearings at Bly . Filled with mirrors and reflecting windows , the manor is akin to a fun house where you are lost in circularity . Everything seems vaguely familiar , like you 've been there before , but this only reaffirms that you are going nowhere . This reaches its apex as Miss Giddens stumbles through never ending hallways , chased by a semi-demonic laughter of unseen children . Dressed in her white nightgown ( which , like her blonde hair , contrasts with the black shadows ) , she wields her candlelight futility against the all-encompassing darkness of the house . It is the visual equivalent to the opening song , as we too become lost in the house with Miss Giddens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befall her . <p> " Legend of Hell House " from 1973 starring Roddy McDowell has some great spooky moments and a pervasive creepiness . And while not strictly a " haunted house " movie per se , 1964 's " Hush ... Hush Sweet Charlotte " features an old , storied , scandal/murder ridden moss-bound Southern mansion that may or not may not be harboring ghosts ; it 's as evocative a piece of high style Grand Guignol as you can get ; that mansion is genuinely spooky . <p> " The Innocents " is one of my favourite movies ; whenever it 's on TVO , which has played it numerous times over the years , I ca n't pass it up . This movie never fails to give me chills down my spine and it does all of that without one hint of gore , which I also appreciate . The first 70 minutes of " Amityville II : The Possession " sound quite interesting to me , but I 'm afraid I 'd never make it past the last 30 minutes . I will , however , 
##3382651 <p> Is Casablanca 2 something that moviegoers really want to see ? Producer Cass Warner thinks so . Warner , who unearthed a 30-year-old treatment for a sequel from the Woodstock home of Howard Koch ( co-writer to Julius and Philip Epstein on the original Casablanca ) , is in the market for a big-time director whose name she can attach to the project in the hopes that Warner Bros. -- co-founded by her grandfather , Harry Warner -- will fund the film . <p> Set in 1961 , the sequel is said to focus on Ilsa and Rick 's son ( " conceived the night Ilsa came to Rick 's place to plead for the Letters of Transit , " says Koch 's treatment ) and his journey back to Casablanca from the United States in search of his father . Both Ilsa and Laszlo -- who raised Rick 's son as his own -- have died and 20-year-old Richard is left with " a deep desire to find his real father , or at least more about him , since Rick 's heroic actions in Casablanca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rick and Ilsa 's last love scene in the original film as a way of introducing a love interest for Richard to the plot : she is an Arab woman named Joan ( not a traditional Arab name , but an ode , presumes Koch 's son Peter , to folksinger Joan Baez ) and she 's leading a guerrilla movement to find and capture " Nazi-led outlaws . " My guess is that these two characters find their individual quests becoming tightly intertwined : the path to the outlaws and the path to Rick are likely to be parallel , if not eventually one and the same . <p> The sequelization of this immortal Hollywood classic is bound to be greeted as a dubious undertaking -- and not unjustifiably . Still , with the right creative team , and if the filmmakers can somehow avoid leaning too heavily on the 1942 original , there is a potentially interesting movie here , at least for an audience that does n't hold the original in too sacred a regard . ( Maybe Quentin Tarantino could give the script a tongue-in-cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , and while we 're at it , here 's another ( free ! ) suggestion for Cass Warner and the team behind this resurrection : Return 2 Casablanca , Casablanca : Rebooted , and I Know What You Did in Casablanca are really terrible titles -- so please do n't even think about using them . <p> : 2:31 PM <p> 12 Comments <p> For those disparaging Hollywood by calling it lame things like " Hollyweird " and " Gollywood " , do n't forget that the original Casablanca is a Hollywood product . It 's funny that some guy on here makes a jokey reference to a Ben-Hur sequel - considering that that particular film was a re-make ! A remake that won a record 11 Oscars , so maybe recycling old ideas is n't always a bad thing . <p> Hey I hear they want to do a sequel to " Ben Hur " called " The Day After The Chariot Race : The search For The Sports Car " .

##3743250 <p> We continued on with the kitchen demolition to complete bin #10 . This was a slightly different exercise in the kitchen due to the original ( ! ) wainscoting that we had to remove in areas where cabinetry is planned , or was situated on an outside wall where spray foam is planned . We managed to save one small interior area of the wainscoting where cabinets are n't being placed , so that will be an architectural " feature " / " selling point " of the kitchen going forward , which we 're happy with . <p> The large cupboard that had been built in along the back wall ( from 2 ? x4 ? s ) was rather unforgiving in its design . To get it out , it was essentially a " reciprocating saw and prybar " job , where the shelves had to be cut out from the inside before any leverage could be applied to the sides of the shelves . <p> It eventually came out though : <p> At this point , we finally had a vantage point into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strapping " design as the upstairs bedrooms , over the lath and plaster but had n't had a chance to inspect the plaster underneath the drywall .

##3743552 <h> THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE IN ISLAM <p> 29 October 2012 No Comment <p> THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE IN ISLAM <p> By Imam Dr. Ziyad Delic <p> The festival of sacrifice in Islam held in the season of Hajj ( pilgrimage ) is celebrated in memory of Prophet Abraham ( Ibrahim ) and his son Prophet Ishmael ( Ismail ) . They wholeheartedly submitted to the command of the Creator and Muhammad ( S ) explains sacrifice in Islam to his followers when he says , " This is commemorative Sunnah ( tradition ) of your father Abraham . " <p> When we hear the word ' sacrifice , ' usually we think of an animal sacrificed in the name of Almighty God but sacrifice in its true sense means , ' giving away something of immense value and importance . ' <p> Something of immense value and importance can be measurable like wealth , time or it could be immeasurable like feelings , opinions , likes and dislikes , pleasures and comforts , family ties or merely our own ego . Therefore , a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cherish wholeheartedly . <p> There is a ritual known in Islam as sacrifice ( Qurbani or Udhiyah ) and its body , or form , is the act of slaughtering the animal ; while its soul , or the truth about it , generates the supreme feeling of self-sacrifice in one 's heart . <p> In Islam every act of ' Ibadah ( worship ) has a body and a soul . Prayer , charity , fasting , pilgrimage , sacrifice , each has its soul and each is distinct from the other . It is imperative to adopt the very form that God has ordained ; thus , allowing one can to reach its soul . <p> In Islam , sacrifice nourishes and elevates the soul . It develops the personality of a person and refines his/her Nafs ( inner-self ) . Hajj and sacrifice have meaning but believers can not be lost in the external form of the rituals . They can not neglect the meaning attributed to the form . You must feel the spirit of the rituals so if you only bring back gifts from Makkah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you yourself will be empty ! <p> The act of sacrifice is done for God Who does not delight in flesh or blood as He says in the Qur'an : " It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches God , but it is piety from you that reaches Him ... " Al Hajj 37 <p> Sacrifice in Islam is nothing more , nothing less , than a natural , visible expression of homage and gratitude to the Creator . It is essentially symbolic -- it is an external symbol of an internal dedication and voluntary submission to the Will of God . Our Creator does not need anything from us . All acts of sacrifice and worship are for our own benefits . <p> The supreme lesson is not the outward act of sacrifice but the spirit underlying it and the motive behind it . The flesh or blood of a sacrificed animal does not reach God ; it is righteousness of the heart which is acceptable to Him . God wants us to offer our hearts . However , it is false to think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the motive . The outward act of sacrifice is the shell and the spirit is its kernel .

It was the first snowfall of the Fall .... and the first snow of the year is always a bit of a shock to the system . We probably should have rescheduled ( the wind was ridiculous ! ) But we had a very hard time connecting with their very busy schedules to even book this session . They are a busy , but awesome , couple preparing for their wedding late next Spring . I am very excited to be a part of their wedding day and getting to spend more time with them . Lauren and Mark are just relaxed people who are lovely to be around .

##3747751 <h> Get out of school free or legitimate protest ? <p> Picketing and protesting is n't an unfamiliar scene is Windsor . From union members to school board employees , Windsorites are used to seeing workers waving signs to raise awareness for their cause . <p> On Oct. 3 a new group of protesters took to the streets . Students across the city walked out of their morning classes to protest Bill 115 . School yards quickly filled with students waving signs and chanting " Kill the bill ! " While the purpose of the walk was the same from school to school , each student participated for their own reasons . Some understand and cared about the issues but others just wanted time off school . <p> Sarah Avery Mancini , 17 , is a Grade 12 student at Sandwich Secondary School who is heavily involved in her school 's yearbook team . Mancini said as a photo editor , she has a bird 's eye view of how the bill is effecting her fellow peers . <p> " We 're having a hard time arranging meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clubs are actually still underway , " said Mancini . <p> Like other students , Mancini depends on her after school activities to benefit her in post secondary school education . <p> " I had been depending on several clubs to further benefit my university application , particularly applying for academic scholarships , " said Mancini . " It 's kind of hard to write a personal essay if you have no personal experiences from your senior year . " <p> Over 2,000 students from various high schools pledged their support to the walk out through social networking sites . <p> Alexander Zonjic is a Grade 12 student from Walkerville Collegiate Institute who , unlike several of his peers , chose not to participate in the walk out . Zonjic said his experience was not an enjoyable one . <p> " The walk out started obnoxiously , kids yelling through the halls , disrupting classes , shouting , screaming , swearing , banging on lockers until it made its way outside where it only got worse , " said Zonjic . " Upon exiting the school many students crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . Kids were shouting and swearing , disturbing the neighborhood and the elementary school just down the street . " <p> Several Walkerville students appeared on local news programs expressing their views on the subject . Zonjic said he felt that many of his peers looked at the walk out as a way to get out of class and did n't really care about the teachers they were supporting . <p> " I felt like the violin player on the Titanic . There was nothing to do 
##3747752 <p> " Two of Us was way out of it 's time for Windsor and sold cutting edge men 's and women 's clothing , which is why I gave it that name , " De Luca said . Retail was not De Luca 's first choice for a career . She graduated from the University of Windsor in 1983 with a teaching degree but could n't get find a job . She kept applying to the school board for six years and in the meantime opened Two of Us . She eventually landed a job teaching elementary school in Markham , Ont. , but decided in 2000 to come back to Windsor to be closer to her family . <p> Still unable to find a job with the Windsor school board De Luca sought employment across the border . <p> " I taught in Detroit , right in the hood , " said De Luca . <p> Wanting to chart her own path , De Luca decided to go back into retail and do it all in a downtown city . The new University of Windsors downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Basically I 'm creating my own job . I looked around different areas of the city and knew I needed a people walk-in location . I wanted to go to Walkerville but there is a lot of competition and not as much foot traffic , " said De Luca . <p> Full Circle will stock vintage clothing from the 1920s to the 1960s as well as modern-label used clothing . It will also carry an assortment of Art Deco furniture and knick-knacks . Co-owner of Phog Frank Incitti said Full Circle is exactly what Windsor needs . <p> " I think it 's about time because Windsor has been dying for retail downtown and a lot of people are scared to come down here with retail because they do n't want to be the front-runners and that is basically what they 're going to be , " Incitti said . <p> Incitti also said he hoped the downtown traffic would get used to the new store and shake downtown Windsor 's stigma of the all-business , all-bar routine that has become the basis for why people visit the downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market because the traffic downtown is business during the day , " said Incitti . " During the night it 's clubbing so they 've got to get people to get used to retail downtown . " <p> Scott Rhodes is co-owner of Maxine 's Adult Playground on Oullette Avenue . He and his wife Maxine opened their store two years ago . Rhodes said he is hopeful people will start to invest in downtown retail . <p> " There seems to enough bars and restaurants but a definite dearth of other modern conveniences like delicatessens , grocery , florists , bakeries and clothing stores , " said Rhodes . " Hopefully if things continue to improve more investors like us will take a chance on this beautiful city . " <p> Rhodes however does not foresee people going out of their way for a new downtown shop . <p> " People shop for themselves and that 's the way it is supposed to be .

##3749051 <h> Post navigation <h> Ukrainian Polesia : first dip in Perebrody <p> Dear Lord , what can I say about Northwestern Ukraine ... if vodka does n't kill you , diabetes will . In Polesia , the swampy land that was under Polish control until 1939 , vodka flows freely from dawn to dusk , and tea is so sweet it should really be classified as syrup . <p> Our first trip to this hauntingly beautiful region of foggy mornings and cranberry-filled marshes involved a 5-hour bus ride to Rivne , where our Polesian contact , Oleksiy , shoved a map and some CDs into our hands and placed us on yet another bus . Four hours were nearing our final destination , Perebrody ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) , a smallish village right on the Belarusian border . In pitch-black darkness some kindly local , whom we met on the bus , led us to the tiny house of our hostess , Anastasija Musijivna Chmunevych . <p> 78-year-old Nastja , the energetic little woman known as " the one to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host to folksong seekers like ourselves . " They only sleep at my house , " she proudly tells us . She remembers countless songs and tells stories in that curious Ukrainian manner , which caused my mouth to drop in stupefied disbelief countless times ( check out Maria 's post on that subject ) . After a good sleep , she feeds us buckwheat with onions and eggs baked with salo , and we set out on a tour of the village to collect " the girls . " <p> The girls turn out to be three more women in their 70s . They are well known in folklore circles , have sung all over Ukraine and Poland , and are featured on this DVD . We gather in Nadja 's kitchen and spend the next six hours absorbing their voices and personalities as they sing , gossip and bicker over forgotten song texts in their curious local dialect* . To make sure the vocal chords do n't dry out , we finish off a bottle of vodka in the process . The next day we gather for another six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous heap of traditional food , which Lesya keeps bringing out from the bottomless void of her huge wood-burning oven . Over these two days , my stomach almost burst from overeating . verba ( " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? " ) <p> Nastja quickly interrupts her singing with " Do n't pour so much ! " to which Nadja replies , " Well ... just a little ... so it does n't dry Perebrody -- Oj ty holube ( " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? " ) <p> This song caused the most controversy . The first performance erupted into a heated debate over the text . How could the dove be first shot to death and then engaged ? But why would a bird be engaged in the first place ? ? The girls eventually agreed on something and managed to sing the song all the way through before dispersing for the day . <p> " Oj , when we were young , we would be coming home from the club and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a third a little further away . We sang all the time . Our daughters do n't sing . No one sings anymore . " <p> " Polesia is a modern-day matriarchy , " Oleksij tells me later . These women truly are remarkable . They lived through war , collectivization , the breakup of the Soviet Union and a million family traumas . Now in their 70s they live alone , digging their own potatoes , feeding a host of pigs , chickens and geese , and gathering berries and mushrooms in the marshes . And they still
