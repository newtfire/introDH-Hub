##4151 <p> T his is old news , but you find it interesting to read it anyway . There have been two Grace Awakening novels published electronically ( July 2011 , May 2012 ) , and they were combined and published as a trade paperback that was released April 2012 . The first drafts of these books were originally written in 2008-09 . Between April 2009 and releases there was almost non-stop work with an editor fine-tuning , re-writing , fixing grammar , typos , and improving sections . <p> The story is a young adult fiction novel told in first person narration by Grace , who is fourteen when the story begins . She discovers that she has a strange connection to Ben , a talented musician at her school , who seems to know a lot more about her than he should . While she tries to sort out her feelings for Ben , strange accidents start happening to her . She realises that her family and some others around her know the secret behind the accidents , but to her frustration , they are n't explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial draft stage there were several beta readers who helped with fine-tuning the novel by identifying trouble spots . For example , time errors , incorrect names , confusing ( or boring ! ) spots , and places where more information was needed . This was a HUGE help ! I have a couple bound copies that are editing copies ( they still have mistakes in them ) . To whet your appetite , here 's a draft bit of the first chapter that was part of my initial query letter : http : **34;7422;TOOLONG ... If this part grabs you , then hopefully you 'll enjoy the rest . Ask if there 's a hard copy available or get on the list for the next free copy . <p> Some trivia tidbits for you : <p> *the working title was Charites ( pronounced KAYR-ee-tess ) which is the Greek word for the Three Graces of Greek mythology . ( That 's them dancing in the detail from Botticelli 's painting Primavera ) . Unfortunately , no one could figure out how to pronounce it ! The book needed a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to readers . Charites : Grace Awakening or just Grace Awakening clearly identifies the themes of the book . The ( future ) publisher has some say in the title though , and it could change again . <p> *the story takes place in Calgary and Salmon Arm . You 'll recognise SAS ! <p> *the secret relates to Greek mythology ; many names and incidents are allegorical <p> *the theme explores five Greek words for different kinds of love ; there are 5 characters each representing one kind of love ( The five words are eros , philia , storge , agape &; thelema . A sixth , xenia is also represented ) <p> *the names of many of Mrs. Bird 's favourite teachers , old friends and some students appear in some form or other ; there are also a few tributes to her favourite authors . <p> What 's next ? <p> Now that the book is ' finished , ' while she is revising and improving it , she is looking for an agent or a publisher . She has sent out query letters and samples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000-2000 queries every WEEK , even if they only publish 30-50 titles a year . Odds are against publication . One must expect rejection ! If an agent thinks the novel is promising , s/he will ask to see the whole manuscript . If the agent likes the manuscript and thinks it is marketable s/he will sign a contract to represent it , and start submitting it to publishers . Now we are waiting to hear back from them . Mrs. Bird also has a second manuscript started that she set aside when Grace took over her life . That one is a short YA novel ( to be approx.150 p. ) about a boy from a town like Sicamous . It 's about half done at the moment , so hopefully that one will be finished this year . <p> I have never seriously tried to publish a book before , so I am finding the the whole process fascinating . I am happy to share the experience with you for your edification ! Some of my response will be great , and some will be discouraging . I invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! May 14th the first agent wrote asking to see more of the manuscript ! Cross your fingers ! ( May 14th was 7 months to the day of when the novel was started ) . <p> Latest NEWS ! ( not quite as exciting but hopefully useful ) Jun 1st : the agent wrote back to say that although she is still interested in the concept , she wants more sparkle and punch and some streamlining . I was told that if any professional gives concrete suggestions , a writer must treat these as GOLD and consider them very conscientiously . Since she said that she would be interested to see it again after some revision , I 'm not counting this as a rejection yet . I will go back to re-read , talk with the beta-readers and my teacher-editor-friend Vikki , and see where I can tighten things up without losing all the bits that become important later on in the story . I have been told this pruning process is the most difficult part of writing , because we are attached to all our scenes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final check should be going back to the agent in the next week or so . <p> Interesting news : June 22nd . A " Dear Author " form letter came today from another agency returning my query because they have such a huge backlog of submissions and such a shortage of staff that they could not even LOOK at any queries " for several months . " Wow . It took them TWO MONTHS just to get to my query on their pile in order to send it back ! <p> Sept 28- After several attempts with a mixture of file types , the re-tooled and edited first four chapters went back to the agent who 'd asked to see more if I tightened it up . <p> Oct 23 - While at the Surrey International Writers ' Conference , I met with an editor/publisher who was interested in the pitch , and asked to see the query package . She has it now . <p> Nov- the agent who first asked to see more back in May , wrote to say that she had decided she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . It was a nice encouraging letter . <p> early May 2010 . After 3 or 4 ( I 'm losing count ! ) complete re-edits of the book , looking for parts to cut , and adding some sequences in ' myth-world ' I contacted the publisher from October 23 note and asked if there was anything more she needed . She requested 3 chapters : one each from the beginning , middle and end . After some debate and discussion to pick chapters . They were sent off via email . <p> May 29 2010 Had a 2 hour lakefront dinner with the publisher and she shared with me information about her company , the editing structures , and their distribution strategies . She loved the 3 sample chapters and was eager to read the rest of the book . I had a copy in my purse , which she now has . She asked me to sign it for her . Wow . <p> Mrs. Bird has loved telling stories since she was a little girl . She was in grade three when she first started writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she was eight , she won her first writing prize ( a flower arrangement ) for a poem about her mother . When she was ten she submitted a poem to a children 's poetry anthology , and had it turned down because it was " too mature ; " the magazine recommended that she submit it to an adult or religious anthology instead . This was her first rejection letter ! ( She still has it ) . This poem appears in the novel and reflects a theme of the book . ( Proof that this novel has been in the works for most of her life ) . Throughout high school she considered a career as a writer or journalist , but she had so many awesome teachers at OKM that she decided she would prefer to get an English degree and teach high school students . In college she won a short story prize and used the prize money to buy her husband 's wedding ring . She has published articles for newsletters and magazines ( reviews , genealogy lessons , etc ) , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her first teaching practicum at Blackburn Jr Sec. in Prince George , she wrote a 300 page ( unfinished ) novel because her grade eight and nine practicum classes overwhelmed her with memories of her rather intense adolescent first love . When her first practicum was over , she shelved the story , partially because she was too busy with university , her family , and her teaching career , but mostly because she was still pondering on the thematic components . Parts of this first novel survive , but a lot of it was lost due to degradation of the computer disk it was stored on . She expects that someday she will dust it off again , and attempt to turn it into something worth reading by the general public , possibly as a humorous pre-teen novel . On the other hand , many of Grace 's and her Auntie Bright 's experiences will seem vaguely familiar to some friends from youth . <p> In the past couple of years Mrs. Bird has been encouraged by the BC writers who presented to her classes at Jackson to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to Stephenie Meyer 's publishing experience , she was finally so inspired that she was forced to quit procrastinating and actually get serious about crafting her novel . After reading The Twilight Saga she realised that would be a good idea to use a different framework ( i.e. mythology ) to hang the original story upon . ( This is the " use a germ of truth and then put it somewhere new " method she encourages students to use for classroom writing ) . She started Grace Awakening in mid-October 2008 and ' finished ' it in early April 2009 . She averaged about 25 pages a week for 23 weeks . ( After some re-writes and editing it 's about 150,000 words which is something like 500 pages ) . <p> The novel that she thought she was writing when she started is not the one she ended up with . The new characters had something else to tell her about . She 'd often sit down to type knowing the basics of a scene , and then have the characters take it somewhere that she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've killed him ! Now what do I do ? " ) . The characters took on their own lives and ruled the plot , making it true that " I do n't write stories , I just take dictation for my characters . " Interestingly , as she went along she kept finding more and more connections with Greek Mythology , as if they were working into the story by themselves . ( Like- did you know Mount Ida is the name of a significant mountain -actually 2 mountains- in Greek mythology ? Interesting coincidence that we have one here in Salmon Arm , is n't it ? ) Writing each scene has been like visiting with friends and learning about their experiences 
##4352 <p> How you have felt , O men of Athens , at hearing the speeches of my accusers , I can not tell ; but I know that their persuasive words almost made me forget who I was - such was the effect of them ; and yet they have hardly spoken a word of truth . But many as their falsehoods were , there was one of them which quite amazed me ; - I mean when they told you to be upon your guard , and not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of my eloquence . They ought to have been ashamed of saying this , because they were sure to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency ; they certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this , unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth ; for then I do indeed admit that I am eloquent . But in how different a way from theirs ! Well , as I was saying , they have hardly uttered a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but you shall hear from me the whole truth : not , however , delivered after their manner , in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases . No indeed ! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment ; for I am certain that this is right , and that at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you , O men of Athens , in the character of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of me . And I must beg of you to grant me one favor , which is this - If you hear me using the same words in my defence which I have been in the habit of using , and which most of you may have heard in the agora , and at the tables of the money-changers , or anywhere else , I would ask you not to be surprised at this , and not to interrupt me . For I am more than seventy years of age , and this is the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am quite a stranger to the ways of the place ; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger , whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue , and after the fashion of his country ; - that I think is not an unfair request . Never mind the manner , which may or may not be good ; but think only of the justice of my cause , and give heed to that : let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly . <p> And first , I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers , and then I will go to the later ones . For I have had many accusers , who accused me of old , and their false charges have continued during many years ; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates , who are dangerous , too , in their own way . But far more dangerous are these , who began when you were children , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Socrates , a wise man , who speculated about the heaven above , and searched into the earth beneath , and made the worse appear the better cause . These are the accusers whom I dread ; for they are the circulators of this rumor , and their hearers are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods . And they are many , and their charges against me are of ancient date , and they made them in days when you were impressible - in childhood , or perhaps in youth - and the cause when heard went by default , for there was none to answer . And , hardest of all , their names I do not know and can not tell ; unless in the chance of a comic poet . But the main body of these slanderers who from envy and malice have wrought upon you - and there are some of them who are convinced themselves , and impart their convictions to others - all these , I say , are most difficult to deal with ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine them , and therefore I must simply fight with shadows in my own defence , and examine when there is no one who answers . I will ask you then to assume with me , as I was saying , that my opponents are of two kinds - one recent , the other ancient ; and I hope that you will see the propriety of my answering the latter first , for these accusations you heard long before the others , and much oftener . <p> Well , then , I will make my defence , and I will endeavor in the short time which is allowed to do away with this evil opinion of me which you have held for such a long time ; and I hope I may succeed , if this be well for you and me , and that my words may find favor with you . But I know that to accomplish this is not easy - I quite see the nature of the task . Let the event be as God wills : in obedience to the law I make my defence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the accusation is which has given rise to this slander of me , and which has encouraged Meletus to proceed against me . What do the slanderers say ? They shall be my prosecutors , and I will sum up their words in an affidavit . " Socrates is an evil-doer , and a curious person , who searches into things under the earth and in heaven , and he makes the worse appear the better cause ; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others . " That is the nature of the accusation , and that is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes ; who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates , going about and saying that he can walk in the air , and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or little - not that I mean to say anything disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural philosophy . I should be very sorry if Meletus could lay that to my charge . But the simple truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these studies . Very many of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this , and to them I appeal . Speak then , you who have heard me , and tell your neighbors whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon matters of this sort . ... You hear their answer . And from what they say of this you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest . <p> As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher , and take money ; that is no more true than the other . Although , if a man is able to teach , I honor him for being paid . There is Gorgias of Leontium , and Prodicus of Ceos , and Hippias of Elis , who go the round of the cities , and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens , by whom they might be taught for nothing , and come to them , whom they not only pay , but are thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually a Parian philosopher residing in Athens , of whom I have heard ; and I came to hear of him in this way : - I met a man who has spent a world of money on the Sophists , Callias the son of Hipponicus , and knowing that he had sons , I asked him : " Callias , " I said , " if your two sons were foals or calves , there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put over them ; we should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence ; but as they are human beings , whom are you thinking of placing over them ? Is there anyone who understands human and political virtue ? You must have thought about this as you have sons ; is there anyone ? " " There is , " he said . " Who is he ? " said I , " and of what country ? and what does he charge ? " " Evenus the Parian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his charge is five minae . " Happy is Evenus , I said to myself , if he really has this wisdom , and teaches at such a modest charge . Had I the same , I should have been very proud and conceited ; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind . <p> I dare say , Athenians , that someone among you will reply , " Why is this , Socrates , and what is the origin of these accusations of you : for there must have been something strange which you have been doing ? All this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men : tell us , then , why this is , as we should be sorry to judge hastily of you . " Now I regard this as a fair challenge , and I will endeavor to explain to you the origin of this name of " wise , " and of this evil fame . Please to attend then . And although some of you may think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire truth . Men of Athens , this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess . If you ask me what kind of wisdom , I reply , such wisdom as is attainable by man , for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise ; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom , which I may fail to describe , because I have it not myself ; and he who says that I have , speaks falsely , and is taking away my character . And here , O men of Athens , I must beg you not to interrupt me , even if I seem to say something extravagant . For the word which I will speak is not mine . I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit , and will tell you about my wisdom - whether I have any , and of what sort - and that witness shall be the god of Delphi . You must have known Chaerephon ; he was early a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he shared in the exile of the people , and returned with you . Well , Chaerephon , as you know , was very impetuous in all his doings , and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether - as I was saying , I must beg you not to interrupt - he asked the oracle to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than I was , and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no man wiser . Chaerephon is dead himself , but his brother , who is in court , will confirm the truth of this story . <p> Why do I mention this ? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an evil name . When I heard the answer , I said to myself , What can the god mean ? and what is the interpretation of this riddle ? for I know that I have no wisdom , small or great . What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men ? And yet he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his nature . After a long consideration , I at last thought of a method of trying the question . I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself , then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand . I should say to him , " Here is a man who is wiser than I am ; but you said that I was the wisest . " Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom , and observed to him - his name I need not mention ; he was a politician whom I selected for examination - and the result was as follows : When I began to talk with him , I could not help thinking that he was not really wise , although he was thought wise by many , and wiser still by himself ; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise , but was not really wise ; and the consequence was that he hated me , and his enmity was shared by several who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to myself , as I went away : Well , although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good , I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing , and thinks that he knows . I neither know nor think that I know . In this latter particular , then , I seem to have slightly the advantage of him . Then I went to another , who had still higher philosophical pretensions , and my conclusion was exactly the same . I made another enemy of him , and of many others besides him . <p> After this I went to one man after another , being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked , and I lamented and feared this : but necessity was laid upon me - the word of God , I thought , ought to be considered first . And I said to myself , Go I must to all who appear to know , and find out the meaning of the oracle . And I swear to you , Athenians , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth - the result of my mission was just this : I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish ; and that some inferior men were really wiser and better . I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the " Herculean " labors , as I may call them , which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable . When I left the politicians , I went to the poets ; tragic , dithyrambic , and all sorts . And there , I said to myself , you will be detected ; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are . Accordingly , I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings , and asked what was the meaning of them - thinking that they would teach me something . Will you believe me ? I am almost ashamed to speak of this , but still I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wisdom do poets write poetry , but by a sort of genius and inspiration ; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things , but do not understand the meaning of them . And the poets appeared to me to be much in the same case ; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise . So I departed , conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians . <p> At last I went to the artisans , for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all , as I may say , and I was sure that they knew many fine things ; and in this I was not mistaken , for they did know many things of which I was ignorant , and in this they certainly were wiser than I was . But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets ; because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of high matters , and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom - therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle , whether I would like to be as I was , neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance , or like them in both ; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was . <p> This investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most dangerous kind , and has given occasion also to many calumnies , and I am called wise , for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I find wanting in others : but the truth is , O men of Athens , that God only is wise ; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing ; he is not speaking of Socrates , he is only using my name as an illustration , as if he said , He , O men , is the wisest , who , like Socrates , knows that his wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way , obedient to the god , and make inquisition into the wisdom of anyone , whether citizen or stranger , who appears to be wise ; and if he is not wise , then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise ; and this occupation quite absorbs me , and I have no time to give either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own , but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god . <p> There is another thing : - young men of the richer classes , who have not much to do , come about me of their own accord ; they like to hear the pretenders examined , and they often imitate me , and examine others themselves ; there are plenty of persons , as they soon enough discover , who think that they know something , but really know little or nothing : and then those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me : This confounded Socrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then if somebody asks them , Why , what evil does he practise or teach ? they do not know , and can not tell ; but in order that they may not appear to be at a loss , they repeat the ready-made charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth , and having no gods , and making the worse appear the better cause ; for they do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected - which is the truth : and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic , and are all in battle array and have persuasive tongues , they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies . <p> And this is the reason why my three accusers , Meletus and Anytus and Lycon , have set upon me ; Meletus , who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets ; Anytus , on behalf of the craftsmen ; Lycon , on behalf of the rhetoricians : and as I said at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of calumny all in a moment . And this , O men of Athens , is the truth and the whole truth ; I have concealed nothing , I have dissembled nothing . And yet I know that this plainness of speech makes them hate me , and what is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth ? - this is the occasion and reason of their slander of me , as you will find out either in this or in any future inquiry . <p> 1 . Questions <p> 1.1 . How many types of accusers does Socrates identify ? How does one set of accusers relate to the other ? <p> 1.2 . What do Socrates ? earlier accusers say about him ? <p> 1.3 . How does Socrates explain how this accusation ever arose ? <p> 1.4 . What does Socrates say is the real reason for his accusers ? resentment towards him ? <p> 1.5 . What does Socrates see as the basis of the assertion that he is the wisest of all men ? <p> 1.6 . What does Socrates see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my defence against the first class of my accusers ; I turn to the second class , who are headed by Meletus , that good and patriotic man , as he calls himself . And now I will try to defend myself against them : these new accusers must also have their affidavit read . What do they say ? Something of this sort : - That Socrates is a doer of evil , and corrupter of the youth , and he does not believe in the gods of the state , and has other new divinities of his own . That is the sort of charge ; and now let us examine the particular counts . He says that I am a doer of evil , who corrupt the youth ; but I say , O men of Athens , that Meletus is a doer of evil , and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter , and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove . <p> Come hither , Meletus , and let me ask a question of you . You think a great deal about the improvement of youth ? <p> Yes , I do . <p> Tell the judges , then , who is their improver ; for you must know , as you have taken the pains to discover their corrupter , and are citing and accusing me before them . Speak , then , and tell the judges who their improver is . Observe , Meletus , that you are silent , and have nothing to say . But is not this rather disgraceful , and a very considerable proof of what I was saying , that you have no interest in the matter ? Speak up , friend , and tell us who their improver is . <p> The laws . <p> But that , my good sir , is not my meaning . I want to know who the person is , who , in the first place , knows the laws . <p> The judges , Socrates , who are present in court . <p> What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to instruct and improve youth ? <p> Certainly they are . <p> What , all of them , or some only and not others ? <p> All of them . <p> By the goddess Here , that is good news ! There are plenty of improvers , then . And what do you say of the audience , - do they improve them ? <p> Yes , they do . <p> And the senators ? <p> Yes , the senators improve them . <p> But perhaps the members of the citizen assembly corrupt them ? - or do they too improve them ? <p> They improve them . <p> Then every Athenian improves and elevates them ; all with the exception of myself ; and I alone am their corrupter ? Is that what you affirm ? <p> That is what I stoutly affirm . <p> I am very unfortunate if that is true . But suppose I ask you a question : Would you say that this also holds true in the case of horses ? Does one man do them harm and all the world good ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to do them good , or at least not many ; - the trainer of horses , that is to say , does them good , and others who have to do with them rather injure them ? Is not that true , Meletus , of horses , or any other animals ? Yes , certainly . Whether you and Anytus say yes or no , that is no matter . Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one corrupter only , and all the rest of the world were their improvers . And you , Meletus , have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young : your carelessness is seen in your not caring about matters spoken of in this very indictment . <p> And now , Meletus , I must ask you another question : Which is better , to live among bad citizens , or among good ones ? Answer , friend , I say ; for that is a question which may be easily answered . Do not the good do their neighbors good , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who live with him ? Answer , my good friend ; the law requires you to answer - does anyone like to be injured ? <p> Certainly not . <p> And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth , do you allege that I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally ? <p> Intentionally , I say . <p> But you have just admitted that the good do their neighbors good , and the evil do them evil . Now is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized thus early in life , and am I , at my age , in such darkness and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by me , I am very likely to be harmed by him , and yet I corrupt him , and intentionally , too ; - that is what you are saying , and of that you will never persuade me or any other human being . But either I do not corrupt them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the case you lie . If my offence is unintentional , the law has no cognizance of unintentional offences : you ought to have taken me privately , and warned and admonished me ; for if I had been better advised , I should have left off doing what I only did unintentionally - no doubt I should ; whereas you hated to converse with me or teach me , but you indicted me in this court , which is a place not of instruction , but of punishment . <p> I have shown , Athenians , as I was saying , that Meletus has no care at all , great or small , about the matter . But still I should like to know , Meletus , in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young . I suppose you mean , as I infer from your indictment , that I teach them not to acknowledge the gods which the state acknowledges , but some other new divinities or spiritual agencies in their stead . These are the lessons which corrupt the youth , as you say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the gods , Meletus , of whom we are speaking , tell me and the court , in somewhat plainer terms , what you mean ! for I do not as yet understand whether you affirm that I teach others to acknowledge some gods , and therefore do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist - this you do not lay to my charge ; but only that they are not the same gods which the city recognizes - the charge is that they are different gods . Or , do you mean to say that I am an atheist simply , and a teacher of atheism ? <p> I mean the latter - that you are a complete atheist . <p> That is an extraordinary statement , Meletus . Why do you say that ? Do you mean that I do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon , which is the common creed of all men ? <p> I assure you , judges , that he does not believe in them ; for he says that the sun is stone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are accusing Anaxagoras ; and you have but a bad opinion of the judges , if you fancy them ignorant to such a degree as not to know that those doctrines are found in the books of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian , who is full of them . And these are the doctrines which the youth are said to learn of Socrates , when there are not unfrequently exhibitions of them at the theatre ( price of admission one drachma at the most ) ; and they might cheaply purchase them , and laugh at Socrates if he pretends to father such eccentricities . And so , Meletus , you really think that I do not believe in any god ? <p> I swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all . <p> You are a liar , Meletus , not believed even by yourself . For I can not help thinking , O men of Athens , that Meletus is reckless and impudent , and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere wantonness and youthful bravado . Has he not compounded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself : - I shall see whether this wise Socrates will discover my ingenious contradiction , or whether I shall be able to deceive him and the rest of them . For he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself in the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty of not believing in the gods , and yet of believing in them - but this surely is a piece of fun . <p> I should like you , O men of Athens , to join me in examining what I conceive to be his inconsistency ; and do you , Meletus , answer . And I must remind you that you are not to interrupt me if I speak in my accustomed manner . <p> Did ever man , Meletus , believe in the existence of human things , and not of human beings ? ... I wish , men of Athens , that he would answer , and not be always trying to get up an interruption . Did ever any man believe in horsemanship , and not in horses ? or in flute-playing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will answer to you and to the court , as you refuse to answer for yourself . There is no man who ever did . But now please to answer the next question : Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies , and not in spirits or demigods ? <p> He can not . <p> I am glad that I have extracted that answer , by the assistance of the court ; nevertheless you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine or spiritual agencies ( new or old , no matter for that ) ; at any rate , I believe in spiritual agencies , as you say and swear in the affidavit ; but if I believe in divine beings , I must believe in spirits or demigods ; - is not that true ? Yes , that is true , for I may assume that your silence gives assent to that . Now what are spirits or demigods ? are they not either gods or the sons of gods ? Is that true ? <p> Yes , that is true . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was speaking : the demigods or spirits are gods , and you say first that I do n't believe in gods , and then again that I do believe in gods ; that is , if I believe in demigods . For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods , whether by the Nymphs or by any other mothers , as is thought , that , as all men will allow , necessarily implies the existence of their parents . You might as well affirm the existence of mules , and deny that of horses and asses . Such nonsense , Meletus , could only have been intended by you as a trial of me . You have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to accuse me . But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be convinced by you that the same man can believe in divine and superhuman things , and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes . <p> I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus : any elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I certainly have many enemies , and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed ; of that I am certain ; - not Meletus , nor yet Anytus , but the envy and detraction of the world , which has been the death of many good men , and will probably be the death of many more ; there is no danger of my being the last of them . <p> Someone will say : And are you not ashamed , Socrates , of a course of life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end ? To him I may fairly answer : There you are mistaken : a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying ; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong - acting the part of a good man or of a bad . Whereas , according to your view , the heroes who fell at Troy were not good for much , and the son of Thetis above all , who altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess mother said to him , in his eagerness to slay Hector , that if he avenged his companion Patroclus , and slew Hector , he would die himself - " Fate , " as she said , " waits upon you next after Hector " ; he , hearing this , utterly despised danger and death , and instead of fearing them , feared rather to live in dishonor , and not to avenge his friend . " Let me die next , " he replies , " and be avenged of my enemy , rather than abide here by the beaked ships , a scorn and a burden of the earth . " Had Achilles any thought of death and danger ? For wherever a man 's place is , whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he has been placed by a commander , there he ought to remain in the hour of danger ; he should not think of death or of anything , but of disgrace . And this , O men of Athens , is a true saying . <p> Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens , if I who , when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium , remained where they placed me , like any other man , facing death ; if , I say , now , when , as I conceive and imagine , God orders me to fulfil the philosopher 's mission of searching into myself and other men , I were to desert my post through fear of death , or any other fear ; that would indeed be strange , and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence of the gods , if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of death : then I should be fancying that I was wise when I was not wise . For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom , and not real wisdom , being the appearance of knowing the unknown ; since no one knows whether death , which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil , may not be the greatest good . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of ignorance ? And this is the point in which , as I think , I am superior to men in general , and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men , - that whereas I know but little of the world below , I do not suppose that I know : but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better , whether God or man , is evil and dishonorable , and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil . And therefore if you let me go now , and reject the counsels of Anytus , who said that if I were not put to death I ought not to have been prosecuted , and that if I escape now , your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words - if you say to me , Socrates , this time we will not mind Anytus , and will let you off , but upon one condition , that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more , and that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - if this was the condition on which you let me go , I should reply : Men of Athens , I honor and love you ; but I shall obey God rather than you , and while I have life and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy , exhorting anyone whom I meet after my manner , and convincing him , saying : O my friend , why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens , care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation , and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul , which you never regard or heed at all ? Are you not ashamed of this ? And if the person with whom I am arguing says : Yes , but I do care ; I do not depart or let him go at once ; I interrogate and examine and cross-examine him , and if I think that he has no virtue , but only says that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overvaluing the less . And this I should say to everyone whom I meet , young and old , citizen and alien , but especially to the citizens , inasmuch as they are my brethren . For this is the command of God , as I would have you know ; and I believe that to this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the God . For I do nothing but go about persuading you all , old and young alike , not to take thought for your persons and your properties , but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul . I tell you that virtue is not given by money , but that from virtue come money and every other good of man , public as well as private . This is my teaching , and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth , my influence is ruinous indeed . But if anyone says that this is not my teaching , he is speaking an untruth . Wherefore , O men of Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not as Anytus bids , and either acquit me or not ; but whatever you do , know that I shall never alter my ways , not even if I have to die many times . <p> 2 . Questions <p> 2.1 . How does Socrates defend himself against the charge of intentionally corrupting the youth ? <p> 2.2 . How does Socrates respond to being accused of atheism ? <p> 2.3 . How does Socrates see his role in Athenian society ? <p> Men of Athens , do not interrupt , but hear me ; there was an agreement between us that you should hear me out . And I think that what I am going to say will do you good : for I have something more to say , at which you may be inclined to cry out ; but I beg that you will not do this . I would have you know that , if you kill such a one as I am , you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me . Meletus and Anytus will not injure me : they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that a bad man should injure a better than himself . I do not deny that he may , perhaps , kill him , or drive him into exile , or deprive him of civil rights ; and he may imagine , and others may imagine , that he is doing him a great injury : but in that I do not agree with him ; for the evil of doing as Anytus is doing - of unjustly taking away another man 's life - is greater far . And now , Athenians , I am not going to argue for my own sake , as you may think , but for yours , that you may not sin against the God , or lightly reject his boon by condemning me . For if you kill me you will not easily find another like me , who , if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech , am a sort of gadfly , given to the state by the God ; and the state is like a great and noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into life . I am that gadfly which God has given the state and all day long and in all places am always fastening upon you , arousing and persuading and reproaching you . And as you will not easily find another like me , I would advise you to spare me . I dare say that you may feel irritated at being suddenly awakened when you are caught napping ; and you may think that if you were to strike me dead , as Anytus advises , which you easily might , then you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives , unless God in his care of you gives you another gadfly . And that I am given to you by God is proved by this : - that if I had been like other men , I should not have neglected all my own concerns , or patiently seen the neglect of them during all these years , and have been doing yours , coming to you individually , like a father or elder brother , exhorting you to regard virtue ; this I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained anything , or if my exhortations had been paid , there would have been some sense in that : but now , as you will perceive , not even the impudence of my accusers dares to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of anyone ; they have no witness of that . And I have a witness of the truth of what I say ; my poverty is a sufficient witness . <p> Someone may wonder why I go about in private , giving advice and busying myself with the concerns of others , but do not venture to come forward in public and advise the state . I will tell you the reason of this . You have often heard me speak of an oracle or sign which comes to me , and is the divinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment . This sign I have had ever since I was a child . The sign is a voice which comes to me and always forbids me to do something which I am going to do , but never commands me to do anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a politician . And rightly , as I think . For I am certain , O men of Athens , that if I had engaged in politics , I should have perished long ago and done no good either to you or to myself . And do n't be offended at my telling you the truth : for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any other multitude , honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteousness and wrong in the state , will save his life ; he who will really fight for the right , if he would live even for a little while , must have a private station and not a public one . <p> I can give you as proofs of this , not words only , but deeds , which you value more than words . Let me tell you a passage of my own life , which will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from any fear of death , and that if I had not yielded I should have died at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , and commonplace , but nevertheless true . The only office of state which I ever held , O men of Athens , was that of senator ; the tribe Antiochis , which is my tribe , had the presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of the slain after the battle of Arginusae ; and you proposed to try them all together , which was illegal , as you all thought afterwards ; but at the time I was the only one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the illegality , and I gave my vote against you ; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me , and have me taken away , and you called and shouted , I made up my mind that I would run the risk , having law and justice with me , rather than take part in your injustice because I feared imprisonment and death . This happened in the days of the democracy . But when the oligarchy of the Thirty was in power , they sent for me and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Salaminian from Salamis , as they wanted to execute him . This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they were always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their crimes ; and then I showed , not in words only , but in deed , that , if I may be allowed to use such an expression , I cared not a straw for death , and that my only fear was the fear of doing an unrighteous or unholy thing . For the strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong ; and when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis and fetched Leon , but I went quietly home . For which I might have lost my life , had not the power of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end . And to this many will witness . <p> Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years , if I had led a public life , supposing that like a good man I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought , the first thing ? No , indeed , men of Athens , neither I nor any other . But I have been always the same in all my actions , public as well as private , and never have I yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed my disciples or to any other . For the truth is that I have no regular disciples : but if anyone likes to come and hear me while I am pursuing my mission , whether he be young or old , he may freely come . Nor do I converse with those who pay only , and not with those who do not pay ; but anyone , whether he be rich or poor , may ask and answer me and listen to my words ; and whether he turns out to be a bad man or a good one , that can not be justly laid to my charge , as I never taught him anything . And if anyone says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is speaking an untruth . <p> But I shall be asked , Why do people delight in continually conversing with you ? I have told you already , Athenians , the whole truth about this : they like to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to wisdom ; there is amusement in this . And this is a duty which the God has imposed upon me , as I am assured by oracles , visions , and in every sort of way in which the will of divine power was ever signified to anyone . This is true , O Athenians ; or , if not true , would be soon refuted . For if I am really corrupting the youth , and have corrupted some of them already , those of them who have grown up and have become sensible that I gave them bad advice in the days of their youth should come forward as accusers and take their revenge ; and if they do not like to come themselves , some of their relatives , fathers , brothers , or other kinsmen , should say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time . Many of them I see in the court . There is Crito , who is of the same age and of the same deme with myself ; and there is Critobulus his son , whom I also see . Then again there is Lysanias of Sphettus , who is the father of Aeschines - he is present ; and also there is Antiphon of Cephisus , who is the father of Epignes ; and there are the brothers of several who have associated with me . There is Nicostratus the son of Theosdotides , and the brother of Theodotus ( now Theodotus himself is dead , and therefore he , at any rate , will not seek to stop him ) ; and there is Paralus the son of Demodocus , who had a brother Theages ; and Adeimantus the son of Ariston , whose brother Plato is present ; and Aeantodorus , who is the brother of Apollodorus , whom I also see . I might mention a great many others , any of whom Meletus should have produced as witnesses in the course of his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forgotten - I will make way for him . And let him say , if he has any testimony of the sort which he can produce . Nay , Athenians , the very opposite is the truth . For all these are ready to witness on behalf of the corrupter , of the destroyer of their kindred , as Meletus and Anytus call me ; not the corrupted youth only - there might have been a motive for that - but their uncorrupted elder relatives . Why should they too support me with their testimony ? Why , indeed , except for the sake of truth and justice , and because they know that I am speaking the truth , and that Meletus is lying . <p> Well , Athenians , this and the like of this is nearly all the defence which I have to offer . Yet a word more . Perhaps there may be someone who is offended at me , when he calls to mind how he himself , on a similar or even a less serious occasion , had recourse to prayers and supplications with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , which was a moving spectacle , together with a posse of his relations and friends ; whereas I , who am probably in danger of my life , will do none of these things . Perhaps this may come into his mind , and he may be set against me , and vote in anger because he is displeased at this . Now if there be such a person among you , which I am far from affirming , I may fairly reply to him : My friend , I am a man , and like other men , a creature of flesh and blood , and not of wood or stone , as Homer says ; and I have a family , yes , and sons . O Athenians , three in number , one of whom is growing up , and the two others are still young ; and yet I will not bring any of them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal . And why not ? Not from any self-will or disregard of you . Whether I am or am not afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now speak . But my reason simply is that I feel such conduct to be discreditable to myself , and you , and the whole state . One who has reached my years , and who has a name for wisdom , whether deserved or not , ought not to debase himself . At any rate , the world has decided that Socrates is in some way superior to other men . And if those among you who are said to be superior in wisdom and courage , and any other virtue , demean themselves in this way , how shameful is their conduct ! I have seen men of reputation , when they have been condemned , behaving in the strangest manner : they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they died , and that they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live ; and I think that they were a dishonor to the state , and that any stranger coming in would say of them that the most eminent men of Athens , to whom the Athenians themselves give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I say that these things ought not to be done by those of us who are of reputation ; and if they are done , you ought not to permit them ; you ought rather to show that you are more inclined to condemn , not the man who is quiet , but the man who gets up a doleful scene , and makes the city ridiculous . <p> But , setting aside the question of dishonor , there seems to be something wrong in petitioning a judge , and thus procuring an acquittal instead of informing and convincing him . For his duty is , not to make a present of justice , but to give judgment ; and he has sworn that he will judge according to the laws , and not according to his own good pleasure ; and neither he nor we should get into the habit of perjuring ourselves - there can be no piety in that . Do not then require me to do what I consider dishonorable and impious and wrong , especially now , when I am being tried for impiety on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens , by force of persuasion and entreaty , I could overpower your oaths , then I should be teaching you to believe that there are no gods , and convict myself , in my own defence , of not believing in them . But that is not the case ; for I do believe that there are gods , and in a far higher sense than that in which any of my accusers believe in them . And to you and to God I commit my cause , to be determined by you as is best for you and me . <p> The jury finds Socrates guilty . <p> Socrates ' Proposal for his Sentence <p> There are many reasons why I am not grieved , O men of Athens , at the vote of condemnation . I expected it , and am only surprised that the votes are so nearly equal ; for I had thought that the majority against me would have been far larger ; but now , had thirty votes gone over to the other side , I should have been acquitted . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say more ; for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon , he would not have had a fifth part of the votes , as the law requires , in which case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae , as is evident . <p> And so he proposes death as the penalty . And what shall I propose on my part , O men of Athens ? Clearly that which is my due . And what is that which I ought to pay or to receive ? What shall be done to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life ; but has been careless of what the many care about - wealth , and family interests , and military offices , and speaking in the assembly , and magistracies , and plots , and parties . Reflecting that I was really too honest a man to follow in this way and live , I did not go where I could do no good to you or to myself ; but where I could do the greatest good privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to persuade every man among you that he must look to himself , and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests , and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state ; and that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions . What shall be done to such a one ? Doubtless some good thing , O men of Athens , if he has his reward ; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him . What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor , who desires leisure that he may instruct you ? There can be no more fitting reward than maintenance in the Prytaneum , O men of Athens , a reward which he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race , whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many . For I am in want , and he has enough ; and he only gives you the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I am to estimate the penalty justly , I say that maintenance in the Prytaneum is the just return . <p> Perhaps you may think that I am braving you in saying this , as in what I said before about the tears and prayers . But that is not the case . I speak rather because I am convinced that I never intentionally wronged anyone , although I can not convince you of that - for we have had a short conversation only ; but if there were a law at Athens , such as there is in other cities , that a capital cause should not be decided in one day , then I believe that I should have convinced you ; but now the time is too short . I can not in a moment refute great slanders ; and , as I am convinced that I never wronged another , I will assuredly not wrong myself . I will not say of myself that I deserve any evil , or propose any penalty . Why should I ? Because I am afraid of the penalty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether death is a good or an evil , why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil ? Shall I say imprisonment ? And why should I live in prison , and be the slave of the magistrates of the year - of the Eleven ? Or shall the penalty be a fine , and imprisonment until the fine is paid ? There is the same objection . I should have to lie in prison , for money I have none , and I can not pay . And if I say exile ( and this may possibly be the penalty which you will affix ) , I must indeed be blinded by the love of life if I were to consider that when you , who are my own citizens , can not endure my discourses and words , and have found them so grievous and odious that you would fain have done with them , others are likely to endure me . No , indeed , men of Athens , that is not very likely . And what a life should I lead , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ever-changing exile , and always being driven out ! For I am quite sure that into whatever place I go , as here so also there , the young men will come to me ; and if I drive them away , their elders will drive me out at their desire : and if I let them come , their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes . <p> Someone will say : Yes , Socrates , but can not you hold your tongue , and then you may go into a foreign city , and no one will interfere with you ? Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this . For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command , and therefore that I can not hold my tongue , you will not believe that I am serious ; and if I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse about virtue , and all that concerning which you hear me examining myself and others , and that the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still less likely to believe . And yet what I say is true , although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you . Moreover , I am not accustomed to think that I deserve any punishment . Had I money I might have proposed to give you what I had , and have been none the worse . But you see that I have none , and can only ask you to proportion the fine to my means . However , I think that I could afford a minae , and therefore I propose that penalty ; Plato , Crito , Critobulus , and Apollodorus , my friends here , bid me say thirty minae , and they will be the sureties . Well then , say thirty minae , let that be the penalty ; for that they will be ample security to you . <p> The jury condemns Socrates to death . <p> Socrates ' Comments on his Sentence <p> Not much time will be gained , O Athenians , in return for the evil name which you will get from the detractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , a wise man ; for they will call me wise even although I am not wise when they want to reproach you . If you had waited a little while , your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature . For I am far advanced in years , as you may perceive , and not far from death . I am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death . And I have another thing to say to them : You think that I was convicted through deficiency of words - I mean , that if I had thought fit to leave nothing undone , nothing unsaid , I might have gained an acquittal . Not so ; the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words - certainly not . But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me to address you , weeping and wailing and lamenting , and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to hear from others , and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that I ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour of danger : nor do I now repent of the manner of my defence , and I would rather die having spoken after my manner , than speak in your manner and live . For neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death . For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms , and fall on his knees before his pursuers , he may escape death ; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death , if a man is willing to say and do anything . The difficulty , my friends , is not in avoiding death , but in avoiding unrighteousness ; for that runs faster than death . I am old and move slowly , and the slower runner has overtaken me , and my accusers are keen and quick , and the faster runner , who is unrighteousness , has overtaken them . And now I depart hence condemned by you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong ; and I must abide by my award - let them abide by theirs . I suppose that these things may be regarded as fated , - and I think that they are well . <p> And now , O men who have condemned me , I would fain prophesy to you ; for I am about to die , and that is the hour in which men are gifted with prophetic power . And I prophesy to you who are my murderers , that immediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you . Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser , and not to give an account of your lives . But that will not be as you suppose : far otherwise . For I say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now ; accusers whom hitherto I have restrained : and as they are younger they will be more severe with you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that by killing men you can avoid the accuser censuring your lives , you are mistaken ; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or honorable ; the easiest and noblest way is not to be crushing others , but to be improving yourselves . This is the prophecy which I utter before my departure , to the judges who have condemned me . <p> Friends , who would have acquitted me , I would like also to talk with you about this thing which has happened , while the magistrates are busy , and before I go to the place at which I must die . Stay then awhile , for we may as well talk with one another while there is time . You are my friends , and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me . O my judges - for you I may truly call judges - I should like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance . Hitherto the familiar oracle within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a slip or error about anything ; and now as you see there has come upon me that which may be thought , and is generally believed to be , the last and worst evil . But the oracle made no sign of opposition , either as I was leaving my house and going out in the morning , or when I was going up into this court , or while I was speaking , at anything which I was going to say ; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech ; but now in nothing I either said or did touching this matter has the oracle opposed me . What do I take to be the explanation of this ? I will tell you . I regard this as a proof that what has happened to me is a good , and that those of us who think that death is an evil are in error . This is a great proof to me of what I am saying , for the customary sign would surely have opposed me had I been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect in another way , and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good , for one of two things : - either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness , or , as men say , there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another . Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness , but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams , death will be an unspeakable gain . For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams , and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life , and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one , I think that any man , I will not say a private man , but even the great king , will not find many such days or nights , when compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that to die is gain ; for eternity is then only a single night . But if death is the journey to another place , and there , as men say , all the dead are , what good , O my friends and judges , can be greater than this ? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below , he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world , and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there , Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus , and other sons of God who were righteous in their own life , that pilgrimage will be worth making . What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer ? Nay , if this be true , let me die again and again . I , too , shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse with Palamedes , and Ajax the son of Telamon , and other heroes of old , who have suffered death through an unjust judgment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , in comparing my own sufferings with theirs . Above all , I shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge ; as in this world , so also in that ; I shall find out who is wise , and who pretends to be wise , and is not . What would not a man give , O judges , to be able to examine the leader of the great Trojan expedition ; or Odysseus or Sisyphus , or numberless others , men and women too ! What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions ! For in that world they do not put a man to death for this ; certainly not . For besides being happier in that world than in this , they will be immortal , if what is said is true . <p> Wherefore , O judges , be of good cheer about death , and know this of a truth - that no evil can happen to a good man , either in life or after death . He and his are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end happened by mere chance . But I see clearly that to die and be released was better for me ; and therefore the oracle gave no sign . For which reason also , I am not angry with my accusers , or my condemners ; they have done me no harm , although neither of them meant to do me any good ; and for this I may gently blame them . <p> 3 . Questions <p> 3.1 . Why does Socrates refuse to mind his own business if acquited ? <p> 3.2 . What are Socrates 's views on death ? <p> Still I have a favor to ask of them . When my sons are grown up , I would ask you , O my friends , to punish them ; and I would have you trouble them , as I have troubled you , if they seem to care about riches , or anything , more than about virtue ; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing , - then reprove them , as I have reproved you , for not caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that they are something when they are really nothing . And if you do this , I and my sons will have received justice at your hands . <p> The hour of departure has arrived , and we go our ways - I to die , and 
##13850 <p> It comes in all shapes and sizes . In the beginning it was small and simple in construction . Simply a piece of hide stretched over the end of a hollow log . Sticks or bones were used as beaters . It was found that by having drums of differing sizes , it was possible then to create a wide variety of tonal colours and contrast . <p> The drum was used in warfare , both as a means of giving signals to the soldiers and to create noise and drive fear into the enemy . Later the drum was use in a more musical sense , to create rhythm and dynamics for the Military Band . In peacetime , for the concert or the dance band . In the United Kingdom , with the formation of the Scottish Highland Regiments within the British Army in the mid 1800 's , we were to see the formation of the Battalion pipe bands . Civilian pipe bands would also soon form . Toward the end of the 19th century , there would be competitions to assess which pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the District and National Championship . Eventually there would follow a competition titled , " The Worlds ' Pipe Band Championships " . <p> When we think of pipe bands , we naturally think of Scotland . While the Great Highland Bagpipe has been a National musical instrument of Scotland , for the past 200 or more years Scots have migrated and settled in many countries throughout the world . There they have introduced their musical and traditional culture . This has been firmly established in countries such as , Canada , USA , Australia , New Zealand , Asia , just to name just a few . <p> It is interesting to note that some other European nations also have the bagpipe as part of their musical heritage and culture . Galicia in Spain , Brittany in France and also in a number of smaller European and North African countries have pipe bands . <p> The drum , particularly the snare drum , is termed " an instrument of indefinite pitch " . That is to say , its ' pitch can not be easily or accurately changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the earliest times there was obviously some form of rudiments devised so that many drummers could play in unison . Of course there was then as there is today , only ... " two drum sounds " . They are ... " The TAP and the ROLL " . But there are a great many variations and permutation patterns adding variety to these fundamentals . <p> In the early days drum rudiments and patterns or scores were taught by " Rote " . It seems to be agreed historically that some form of Military snare drum score notation was in use at least in the 17th century . Patterns or regulated beatings would all have to be memorized . The drum was widely used in warfare in England and elsewhere to give signals for the soldiers to , Troop , Advance , March or Retreat etc . There was an English Royal Warrant issued in 1632 , defining the drum sequence for the , " Voluntary before the March " and " The March " . Following is an example of the type of drum score notation used . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by many military drummers of the time . The following is an example of part of " The March " shown in the Royal Warrant of 1632 . <p> Later the drum would accompany the fife and so " Drum and Fife Bands " were born . The Fife is a very old instrument , originally having only five sound holes . Later more holes and also keys were added to extent the range of the instrument . <p> From here drummers in Britain , North America and in many European countries such as France and Switzerland , seemed to adapt the standard " five line " musical staff to show drumming notation . The note head for the Snare Drum score was usually shown on the " C " space of the Treble Clef stave . The Bass Drum part when included was usually shown on the " F " space . It was not unusual to see the fingering for the snare drum beat patterns written below the notation as : RLRR LRLL RRL etc . <p> It would seem likely that in this era , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Double Top , The Paradiddle and Roll , came to be standard elements . Later would come the Embellishments such as ... The Flam and The Drag . <p> Potters of London and Aldershot , the famous English drum makers show these basic rudiments in later editions of their 19th century " Drum , Flute and Bugle Duty Tutor " . ( 1886 ) . However George B. Bruce published ... " The Drummers and Fifers Guide " , in New York , USA , in 1865 . This Tutor defines drumming notation on the five line staff and shows a series of standard rudiments . From the Foreword , it indicates that this system had been established in the United States Military as early as 1812 . It is claimed that Daniel D. Emmett wrote the first Drummers Manual for the United States Army in the 1820 's . George Bruce and Dan Emmett also combined in 1861 to publish in New York , a " Drummers and Fifers Guide " . <p> In 1933 , in Chicago USA , a group of drummers from all over the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all agreed on a set of " the thirteen Rudiments of Drumming " . Later a further thirteen rudiments were added to this list to form the " Twenty six Essential Rudiments of Drumming " . Soon the " National Association of Rudimental Drummers " was founded . In a very short time their world wide membership included a number of the leading pipe band drummers in Scotland . In 1962 , the NARD published a book containing 150 solo score written by their members . <p> In Switzerland , particularly in the city of Basle , where snare drumming had evolved both in the Army and in civilian Drum and Fife bands ( known as Cliques ) , for over four hundred years . Their drum scores were written in a series of " codes " . However in 1928 , Dr Fritz Berger , a noted Basel Drummer , devised a new notation system for the drummer . This used the standard form of musical notation values etc . However only a " single line staff " was used . The Right hand tap or roll was shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand tap or roll , with a note head below the line . He called it ... " The Monolinear System of Notation " . <p> But was happening in Scotland . Well we know that military pipe bands were introduced into the Highland Regiments in the mid 1800 's . Civilian pipe bands no doubt soon followed . Pipe Band competitions were introduced in a small way at local Highland Games . These Gatherings had been firmly established in Scotland since the early 18th century , at which Solo Piping competitions were firmly established . <p> The Cowal Highland Games in Dunoon is credited with being the oldest venue in Scotland where pipe band competitions have been continuously been held since early this century . In 1906 the Cowal Committee introduced competitions for Military pipe bands and in 1909 and with the support of the late ( Sir ) Harry Lauder , competitions , for civilian pipe bands . <p> The late Drum Major John Seton , of the Glasgow Police and the 93rd Highlanders pipe bands , must be credited with introducing and the establishing pipe band drum notation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the standard of pipe band drumming . In 1924 , John Seton combined with Pipe Major Willie Gray to publish the " Collection of Highland Bagpipe Music and Drum Settings " . This book contained many drumming exercises and scores . Prior to this time , drummers in the pipe band would have relied heavily on Drum and Fife Tutor Books , to learn the fundamentals of drumming and musical notation . In the Seton Tutor the Snare Drum score notation is shown in the " C " space of the Treble Clef , with stems turned up wards . The Bass Drum part is shown in the " A " space with the stems turned down . Where only the Snare Drum notation only is shown , the note stems are turned downwards . <p> Following is an example : <p> In the 1920 's it was the great teacher and innovator of pipe band drumming , Drum Major Jimmy Catherwood of the Dalzell Highland Pipe Band , who would lead and inspire pipe band drummers to develop new techniques . Jimmy 's style and technique gave a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy always took a very broad view of pipe band drumming seeking knowledge of other drumming and percussion idioms . He was also great on the " kit drums " and also tuned percussion . The Dalzell drum corps was at the top during the late 1920 's and 30 's . Jimmy introduced to Scottish drummers , the " Berger Monolinear system of Notation " to Scotland in the early 1930 's . After visiting Dr. Berger in Basle , Switzerland , Jimmy was impressed with this system and was convinced that it would be of great assistance to the pipe band drummer . But it was not till the late 1940 's that this system became to be accepted by the pipe bands in Scotland . Today throughout the world , the monolinear system is the norm . <p> Drum Major Jimmy Catherwood 's drum corps won many Worlds ' Championships in this era and many famous names passed through the corps . Gordon Jelly and Alex Duthart , just to name two . <p> Here is an example of part of a snare drum score written by Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim Dalrymple in the SPBA Solo Championships in the following year . <p> In the City of Glasgow during the 1930 's , there was another great drummer both playing in leading pipe bands and teaching many champion drum corps . This was Drum Major Alex D. Hamilton . He was also a professional orchestral drummer . He too had a wide perspective of drumming and percussion . In 1931 , " A.D. " published a book titled , " DRUM SCORES " , A series of Advanced Beatings to Popular Pipe Tunes . The Snare , Tenor and Bass score are three braced staves . An example is shown below . <p> Jack Seton ( the son of John ) was Leading drummer of the Glasgow Police Pipe Band from the 30 's till the late 1940 's . He was followed by Alex McCormick , who was also a great drumming innovator and player . <p> In 1934 with Book 1 . and in 1936 , with Book 2 , we saw two further interesting publications for the pipe band drummer . These were the " ARMY MANUAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Drums . Initially published for the Scottish Highland Regiments within the British Army , these books filled a need for many young student drummers and Massed drum corps performances . <p> Drum Major A.D. Hamilton was later to become one of the founder members of the Scottish Pipe Band Association , " Pipe Band College " . A respected Drumming Adjudicator of the SPBA , Alex was also a member of the SPBA College sub committee , that formulated the Association 's first " Tutor and Text Book " , Volume 1 . Elementary level ) . This was first published in Glasgow in 1962 . <p> After World War 2 , there were three other interesting drumming publications . Firstly in Glasgow in 1951 , was " The Gaelic Collection " . Forty pages of advanced snare drum scores by Willie Paterson of the Clan Macrae Pipe Band and Alex McCormick of the Glasgow Police . Both former Worlds Champions . In 1953 , we saw the " Edcath Collection " . This contained compositions by leading Scottish pipers together with many snare drum scores by some of Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , Drum Major John Seton , now living in New Zealand , published his second tutor and collection of drum scores . This popular book was titled , " Fifty Years behind the Drum " . Many scores included were played by winning drum corps at the Worlds Pipe Band Championships during the 1930 's . Some " modern " rudiments were also included . Since then there have been a number of excellent publications for the pipe band drummer . The Scottish Pipe Band Association in Glasgow published their " Tutor and Text Book " , Volume 1 in 1962 . A revised edition ( Elementary ) was published in 1978 . This was followed by Book 2 ( Intermediate Level ) in 1971 . <p> These tutor books were well received as they also contained the syllabus for the then various levels of SPBA College Examination Certification . They were widely welcomed and benefited drummers in many countries throughout the world . In the early 1980 's , the Music Board of the RSPBA agreed that both the piper and the drummer should extend their musical knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years there had always been in pipe band competitions , a prize for the " best drum corps " at most competitions . Bands were now being encouraged to adopt a more " integrated approach " in their performance . <p> Within the pipe band movement in Northern Ireland , the Piping and Drumming School of the RSPBA ( N.I.Branch ) was of a similar opinion . This saw the publication by P/M Sam Baille in 1982 , of the " Integrated Approach " , together with Graded Lessons . The Music Board of the RSPBA also began compiling the first of three " Structured Learning " manuals . Volume 1 was published in 1987 . This was followed by two further manuals in 1989 and 1990 . The three covered the RSPBA College Examination Syllabus for the Certification requirement for the Elementary , Intermediate and Advanced levels for both pipers and drummers . <p> There have also been a number of other very interesting tutor books , audio tapes and collections published especially for the pipe band drummer in the 1980 's and the 1990 's . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by foremost leading drummers in Scotland and in other parts of the world . So in all , today 's student of the art of pipe band drumming has a great number of reference publications and tutor books at their disposal . The older publications do give an insight into the progress and development of the art . There are many of these older groupings and rudiments which still do have their place in the " modern " pipe band drummer 's repertoire . <p> This I hope , gives a very brief but concise over view of the progression and development of drumming rudiments , notation and many published works of particular interest to the student of pipe band drumming . <p> We can see that the same fundamental rudiments are required to be learnt by today 's student drummer as they were nearly four hundred years ago . <p> But modern technology has helped to " improve the sound " of the instrument allowing for faster , cleaner and more accurate beating . This of course still requires the student to apply great dedication and practise to perfect stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics . For some , with good instruction , the road may be easier , but never the less even the most gifted must travel the same pathway to success . It all must be a rhythmic accompaniment to enhance the melody . The feeling comes much from within , in addition to what is quite obvious to the listener or to the Drumming Adjudicator . Keep on 
##14551 <h> Op-Ed : Biden keeps Ryan on the ropes in Danville Special <p> Danville - From the beginning of the Vice Presidential debate in Danville , KY on Thursday night , Vice President Joe Biden went on the offensive , and he never backed down . <p> " With all due respect , that 's a bunch of malarkey . " Those were the words spoken by Vice President Joe Biden in his first response to Congressman Paul Ryan Thursday night in Danville , KY when they met for the first and only Vice Presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle ; and they set the tone for the rest of the debate . <p> Well known for saying whatever is on his mind -- sometimes with rather amusing results -- Biden went into full attack mode on Friday night . On several occasions throughout the night Biden called Ryan and the Romney campaign as a whole out for failing to provide specifics , flip flopping , and for all of the " bluster " and " loose talk " they have taken part in . Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the 47 percent remarks made by Governor Romney , Biden had no such qualms . <p> Asked about if and when the unemployment rate could be brought under six percent Biden spent some time explaining the current successes and future plans of the Obama administration . Biden contrasted those with Romney 's opposition to the bailout for Detroit as well as the Republican challenger 's assertion that we should allow foreclosures to hit bottom . This alone was more of an attack than we ever saw from Obama during the first presidential debate in Denver ; however , Biden really took his gloves off with statements which followed : <p> But it should n't be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives . My friend ( Ryan ) recently in a speech in Washington said " 30 percent of the American people are takers . " <p> These people are my mom and dad -- the people I grew up with , my neighbors . They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact are living off of Social Security . They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are , quote , " not paying any tax . " <p> I 've had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent -- it 's about time they take some responsibility here . And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class , they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class we 're going to level the playing field ; we 're going to give you a fair shot again ; we are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street , making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy . <p> Biden was also quick to step in -- even stepping over Ryan and the moderator once or twice -- in order to point out inaccuracies in Ryan 's statements : <p> RYAN : Joe and I are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm from Janesville , Wisconsin . You know what the unemployment rate in Scranton is today ? <p> Amongst other things Biden called Ryan out for was the fact that while condemning the stimulus package as ill advised and a failure Ryan had in fact requested funds from the stimulus ; according to Biden even going so far as stating in the letter " The reason we need this stimulus , it will create growth and jobs . " The culmination of this particular line of attack -- that Ryan and Romney were not being straight with the American people -- came to a peak ( though it continued through to the end of the debate ) when Biden said of Ryan , " I wish he would just tell -- be a little more candid , " in talking about supposed cronyism in the stimulus package which Biden pointed out Congress had found no evidence of . <p> More important than the fact that Biden remained on the attack , however , was that while doing so he also seemed consistently sincere and truly concerned with the issues facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as scripted and detached throughout the debate . One person I spoke with after the debate even remarked that it felt like watching an infomercial during Ryan 's closing statement . Throughout the debate Biden made direct appeals to the American people as to why Obama and he were better suited for helping the middle class , including in discussing the Romney plan for Medicare : <p> The idea of changing , and change being in this case to cut the benefits for people without taking other action you could do to make it work is absolutely the wrong way . <p> These -- look , these guys have n't been big on Medicare from the beginning . Their party 's not been big on Medicare from the beginning . And they 've always been about Social Security as little as you can do . <p> Look , folks , use your common sense . Who do you trust on this -- a man who introduced a bill that would raise it 40 -- $6,400 a year ; knowing it and passing it , and Romney saying he 'd sign it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions Biden also pointed back to his working class roots and how they help him to understand the needs of the middle class . Ryan attempted to do this as well but due to his demeanor it did not seem nearly as convincing . In particular , Ryan seemed to be speaking more from a script than from his heart when talking about his mom and grandma who had received social security benefits . Biden on the other hand seemed to be genuinely speaking about something that had made an impact on his life each time he brought up his past . <p> This was also seen in Biden 's closing statement in which he once again took personal offense to the statements made by Romney and Ryan against the 47 and 30 percent respectively . Biden did a good job of articulating much of what seemed to be the middle classes feelings when the tapes were first revealed ; a disgust at the insinuation that so many of our fellow Americans were malcontents who were unwilling to work hard and wanted the government to take care of them . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be a very hard line to sell ; for Biden , however , who has a always enjoyed a great connection with working class Americans and who has a well documented upbringing in the middle class this message resonated well . <p> With a combination of well timed attacks , sincere appeals to the public , and the spunk he is so well known for Biden quickly put Ryan on the defensive on Thursday night and never let up . In what I am sure will be seen as a resounding win , Biden effectively communicated with the middle class base that is likely to be the deciding factor in this election . It is hard to tell the effect this will have on the polls as Vice Presidential debates typically are low impact but Biden set the stage well for a great performance by Obama on the 16th in Hempstead . Most importantly , the Vice-Presidential debate will assuredly improve the 
##37050 <h> An unvarnished account of life on the NHL bubble <p> DAVID SHOALTS <p> The Globe and Mail <p> Last updated Thursday , Nov. 15 2012 , 3:48 PM EST <p> If there is just one hockey book you buy this holiday season - and the way people feel about the locked-out NHL right now , maybe even one is too much - it should be Journeyman by former NHLer Sean Pronger . <p> Mr. Pronger , of course , has nothing to do with the lockout , so please do n't take any anger at the owners and players out on him . Indeed , Pronger himself has plenty of bumps and bruises from his NHL career , both literally and figuratively , as he was the lesser talented of the two brothers who came out of the northern Ontario town of Dryden to play professional hockey . <p> Little brother Chris will be in the Hockey Hall of Fame some day but , as they say , the only way Sean Pronger gets in is to buy a ticket . But that is why Journeyman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is the unvarnished account of Sean Pronger 's life as an itinerant hockey player with stops in the NHL ( 260 games with seven teams from 1995 to 2003 ) , three minor leagues and an unhappy final season in Germany . Most of the hockey talent in the Pronger family may have landed with Chris but Sean is an engaging story-teller who gives the reader an inside look at professional hockey . <p> Pronger 's intermittent life in the NHL was spent wondering a ) whether he would get into the lineup for that night 's game or b ) when the inevitable call would come to head back to the minor leagues . He was never one of those millionaires squabbling with the owners over how to slice a billion-dollar pie . He spent his eight years around the NHL scrambling for a few crumbs from that pie . <p> But the experience never soured him and Pronger 's love for the game shines through the book . He even professes to still like former Columbus Blue Jackets president and general manager Doug MacLean , who sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hockey League seven times one season . <p> " Well , he was one of those bubble guys , " MacLean , who is now a broadcaster for Sportsnet , said on his Fan 590 radio show Hockey Central this week when Pronger made an appearance to plug his book . <p> Fans think of NHL players as an elite few who travel first class on charter planes , stay at the best hotels and toil for just a few hours in front of thousands of adoring fans while raking in millions of dollars . Pronger , with the help of co-author Dan Murphy , readily admits that is the case for some guys but he tells us about the majority of athletic working stiffs who make up the other side of the coin . He dedicated the book " to all journeymen everywhere . Keep fighting the good fight . " <p> There are stories of the constant highs and lows of being in the NHL one day , the minors the next and the resulting toll it takes on a player 's family . And there are lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their misadventures . <p> Such as the time he realized a dream and was put on Wayne Gretzky 's line during a brief stay with the New York Rangers . The only trouble was , Pronger 's frustration at sitting out most nights finally led to a long night on the town that left him sleep-deprived and mightily hung over for his big moment at the next morning 's practice . <p> For a true look at what life is like at every

That 's a fine way to welcome home your grandpa after his release from hospital , is n't it ? Harry feels sh-tty , of course , but he 's still pretty sulky too , as evidenced in the statement his friend Arthur Landon , who was with him in Vegas , has given about the incident . <p> " I obviously think it is really despicable that someone would accept Prince Harry 's hospitality and then take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on everybody who was on that holiday .

##39852 <h> Who killed Mary Steinhauser ? <h> The Province <p> There was no love lost between the prison social workers , of whom she was one , and the guards who shot her during a hostage-taking . Now a former paramedic who was at the scene says she was shot on purpose <p> New Westminster police have launched an investigation into the death of Mary Steinhauser , shot by prison guards in the old B.C.

New Westminster police Staff-Sgt . Casey Dehaas confirmed that the paramedic , George High , had given a videotaped statement . In an exclusive interview with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one guard intended to shoot Steinhauser . " There 's no question in my mind that Mary Steinhauser was purposefully shot , " he said . High had volunteered to relieve paramedics who were on duty at the pen after three inmates -- Andy Bruce , 26 , Dwight Lucas , 20 , and Claire Wilson , 26 -- took the hostages at knifepoint on June 9 . <p> The three men were lifers and had spent considerable time in solitary confinement but had been released back into the general prison population . They demanded drugs , especially the painkiller Demerol , and a helicopter to fly them to freedom . All hostages except Steinhauser were kept in a windowless vault measuring 3 1/2 metres by five metres . The vault faced on to a larger room with Dutch doors that led to a hallway . Steinhauser was kept outside the vault in the larger room by one prisoner armed with a knife . <p> High recalls that he was in a nearby trailer with one other paramedic and a number of tense guards when a man in civilian clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ! Go ! Go ! " High 's partner was on a mobile telephone requesting backup as High and the guards left the trailer for the hostages ' vault . " There is no question in my mind , I heard somebody saying , ' Kill her , kill her . ' It was said very loudly and very distinctly , " High said , adding that the other paramedic could not hear the words because he was on the phone , almost out the door . As High entered the room , " there was a melee going on , people fighting and shouting . " High , lying on his stomach , helped another man drag a wounded woman into the hallway . <p> The injured woman was Mary Steinhauser . She was not breathing . She did not have a pulse . High accompanied her to hospital , where he began emergency treatment until an intern arrived , although " everybody knew it was a lost cause . " Steinhauser was pronounced dead . Bruce survived the shooting and went on to another hostage-taking the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the events , B.C. 's then-chief justice John Farris was named chairman of a three-man commission to investigate the incident . None of the paramedics was called to testify . The commission heard that Bruce seemingly had the run of the pen , making 23 visits in less than a month to the classification offices . The visits lasted between 15 to 20 minutes and sometimes ran to three hours . Mostly , they were to Steinhauser 's office . The commission found the amount of time Bruce spent with Steinhauser was " unreasonable and appropriate action should have been taken . " And it found she had frequently left pass forms on her desk that were easily accessible to the inmates and would allow them to roam freely in the prison . During the hearing , Dragan Cernetic , the B.C. Pen 's director , called Steinhauser a humanitarian . " She implicitly trusted her clients , " he said . " If she had any doubts , she tried to resolve them by discussing them with other inmates . " <p> The commission found that correctional officers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 per cent . Training for classification officers was worse . Correctional officers policed the prison . Classification officers were like social workers . Relations between the groups were terrible . " With some exceptions , there is little or no communication between the two groups . In some cases , there is marked hostility between them , " the commission wrote . During the hearing , the guards , who had not been trained in riot control or hostage-takings , testified in-camera to protect their identity from criminals . <p> All testimony on the exact manner of Steinhauser 's death was also heard behind closed doors . One guard thought he had fired the shots that hit Bruce , but none admitted to shooting Steinhauser . The event came to its head when the hostages attempted a " breakout . " The commission wrote of the " reign of terror in the vault " and said the hostages " had every reason to think that they were , indeed , on ' death row . ' They had had practically no sleep . They had been forced to take drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In the 41st hour , after midnight , the hostages feared at least one of them would be killed by the morning . They waited until their captors were asleep , then attacked Lucas , hitting him over the head . Instead of falling , he yelled , and chaos exploded . Lucas was waving a knife in the air and yelling obscenities . Bruce grabbed Steinhauser and raised his knife over her . The hostages managed to overpower Wilson and pulled him back into the vault . Bruce and Lucas were outside in the larger room with Steinhauser . The guards , who were taking a much needed break , came running . Bruce was standing behind Steinhauser , an arm around her waist and holding a knife over her , shouting " I 'll kill her ! " Steinhauser was slumping , her head bowed , as if she was passed out . " Bruce 's head was exposed and the officer shot , and at the same time , the other officer shot , " the commission wrote . " Bruce was struck in the jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed part of his back . and both officers fired again . " Both then shot at Lucas , 4.5 metres away , but the shots missed . Another officer who had run to a window spotted Bruce on the floor and fired . It 's not clear if that shot hit home . Eight shots were fired , one accidentally . The commission could not determine who shot Steinhauser . <p> The inquiry found that Albert Hollinger , a senior penitentiary supervisor , intentionally mixed up the guns following the raid . The guns , all revolvers , were removed from the room and cleaned , making it impossible to say which guard fired the shots that hit Steinhauser and Bruce . Some of the spent cartridges went missing for a week , the commission heard . An expert testified that the same gun was " likely " used in shooting both victims . <p> High , who admits he spent little time with the guards , said it was widely known that they disliked social workers generally , and Steinhauser specifically . Other paramedics who were in close contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the guards disliked social workers . " The guards felt that the prison classification staff were sympathetic to the inmates , " said 30-year veteran paramedic Bruce Brink , who spent a number of shifts in the trailer . <p> High relieved Ted Raynor that fateful day just before the shooting started at about 1 a.m . " The guards felt that the social workers and Mary Steinhauser were part of the problem and not part of the solution , " Raynor said , adding that he found High 's contention that Steinhauser was intentionally shot " a little surprising , but not that surprising . " <p> Brink , while not certain , believes Steinhauser 's death could have been accidental . " There 's no question that the guard that fired these shots would have been able to make the distinction between Andy Bruce and Mary Steinhauser , " he said . But Brink speculated that Bruce held Steinhauser as a shield , adding it 's possible that bad luck and not bad intention was to blame . " My betting is that she was in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards , remember , they were panicked , they were fearful . " High does not believe that the man who said " Kill her " was the one who fired the fatal shot . But he believes the man 's words reflected the feeling the guards had toward Steinhauser . <p> Andy Reekie , a B.C. spokesman for the new Union of Canadian Correctional Officers , said the Steinhauser case had a heavy impact on many of those involved . " There are people who are suffering through post-traumatic stress disorder " over the hostage taking and subsequent shooting , said Reekie . He said none of the guards involved would likely talk because they were prohibited from doing so and because they worried about being targeted by inmates who might one day be released . " Our evil people come back to haunt us sometimes , " he said . Reekie said there is no conflict between modern-day guards and classification officers , now known as parole officers institutional . The two groups operated under a single union until March 2001 , when the guards broke off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classification officers were not asked to join . <p> Told of High 's charges , prison officials said they would await a police investigation before acting . " We have no plans at this point to reopen any investigation , but if the police decide to look into the matter we will co-operate fully with them , " said Dennis Finlay , a spokesman for the Correctional Service of Canada . <p> So why did High wait so long before revealing his suspicions ? At first , he explained , he expected to be called to the inquiry , but was n't . Then he was reluctant to speak out publicly because , as a government employee , he was effectively gagged . " I 've had to hold my tongue all these years , " he said . High was diagnosed with accumulative post-traumatic distress disorder in 1998 , and he believes Steinhauser 's death contributed to his condition , which left him unable to work . Now that he 's on full pension , he feels he can speak . " I just felt like I had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##52050 <h> Population Size <p> In 1867 , the year of Confederation , Canada 's population was close to 3.5 million .

The growth rate is expected to slow even further over the next several decades ( 0.9% between 2010 and 2060 ) . <p> Note : From 1867 to 1901 , the population count that was used to calculate population growth was that of April 1 . From 1902 to 1970 , the population count was that of June 1 . From 1971 to present , the population count was that of July 1 . The population of Newfoundland and Labrador is excluded before 1949 . <h> Natural Increase <p> Natural increase is the change in population between two points in time , calculated by subtracting the number of deaths from the number of births . <p> Between 2001 and 2011 , there were 3,566,768 births and 2,336,141 deaths in Canada , resulting in a natural increase of 1,230,627. 1 <p> Natural increase largely depends on fertility , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childbearing age . The most frequently used indicator for measuring fertility is the total fertility rate ( TFR ) . 2 Over the past 50 years , the total fertility rate has dropped significantly in Canada . From a high of 3.93 children per woman in 1959 , the TFR underwent a sharp decline in the 1960s and then continued to drop until it reached a historic low of 1.49 children per woman in 2000 . After that , the rate increased to reach 1.7 children per woman in 2009 , nationally . The highest TFR values seen in Canada in 2009 were recorded in Nunavut ( 3.2 ) and the Northwest Territories ( 2.1 ) . In contrast , Nova Scotia and British Columbia , in 2009 , had the lowest values , namely 1.5 children per woman . 3 <p> The replacement fertility rate , or average number of children that the women of one generation would need to have to result - solely through natural increase - in a generation of the same size , is estimated at 2.1 children per woman for developed countries like Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed countries reach this level , as indicated by the fact that in 2009 , no G8 member had a total fertility rate reaching the replacement rate . 4 <p> Note : The 1921-1959 rates exclude Newfoundland and Labrador , Yukon , and the Northwest Territories <p> Warning : This data table may contain very wide content .

Can you hear me , when I 'm calling out to you ? Can you see me , sometimes in the night When you put out the light ? I have n't seen you in a long time Since you put me away I only see you in my dream time , At the break of day I know I never ever listen , My whole life through . If I had heard your words of wisdom , I could be with you . Can you feel me , When he 's making love to you ?

A continuance of suit must be requested . You must contact the clerk of the Small Claims Division , who will help the party making the request to complete the forms concerning the formal notice and the continuance of suit before the Small Claims Division 3 . <p> What is mediation ? <p> Mediation is a service offered by the Small Claims Division through which the parties can settle their suit by reaching an agreement . Mediation costs the parties nothing . The mediation session , which lasts about an hour , takes place in private and without any formalities . The parties are summoned to appear before the mediator , either a lawyer or a notary , at a time that is convenient to them . <p> When a claim is filed , the clerk will suggest that the party instituting the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Small Claims Division .

A full payment will include payment of the amount claimed as well as the plaintiff 's court costs . This option closes the court file . <p> Proposing an out-of-court settlement <p> It is possible to reach an out-of-court settlement with the plaintiff . In the case of a monetary settlement , the clerk if requested to do so will confirm the settlement , which is then equivalent to a judgment . 4 In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done or goods to be provided or exchanged , details must be provided . If this arrangement is not respected , either party may request a court hearing . <p> Contesting the action <p> To contest an action , you must complete the section 3.1 of the Options available to defendant after notification of action form 3 , and list and attach the documents that will serve as evidence before the court . <p> The contestation will not be accepted unless the court fees have been paid . <p> When contesting an action , the defendant may : <p> Ask for the case to be heard in another judicial district , namely : <p> the district of the defendant 's domicile or last known residence ; <p> the district of the domicile of the insured party making a claim against an insurer ; <p> the district in which the incident giving rise to the action occurred ; <p> the district in which the contract was concluded ; <p> the district in which the defendant 's residence or business is located in Qubec , if the defendant is not domiciled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a request , the file is forwarded to the court office for the judicial district in which the case will be heard . The clerk then summons the parties to the hearing . ) <p> Implead ( involve ) another person , a third party , to resolve the dispute . <p> ( If another person , a third party , can share responsibility with the defendant or assume full responsibility for the dispute , the defendant may ask to have that person be a party to the suit . ) <p> Make a counter-claim against the plaintiff . <p> ( A defendant who is of the opinion that the claim is not justified and , in addition , has a claim to make against the plaintiff , may make a request to that effect . This new claim ( called a counter-claim ) must be linked or related to the principal claim and be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Division . ) <p> Use the mediation service . <p> If the defendant does not appear , a judgment may be rendered by default , with or without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , date and time of the hearing , which is sent to both parties , you must prepare yourself thoroughly . <p> If this has not been done already , each party must file the documents , statements or reports in support of the claim or the contestation at the court office , at least fifteen days before the date set for the hearing . Each party may obtain a copy of the documents filed by the other party by submitting a request to that effect to the clerk . <p> If , to prove its case , a party needs one or more individuals to testify in its favour , but is afraid that they will not attend the hearing , it must notify the clerk and provide the names and addresses of the individuals . The clerk will then ensure that they are summoned to appear . <p> Individuals who are called to testify before the Small Claims Division generally do so without receiving any allowance , unless the court decides otherwise . <p> A party may give the clerk a written statement in place of a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . The statement must be submitted at least fifteen days before the date set for the hearing . The statement is equivalent to oral testimony . The opposing party will be informed by the clerk and has access to the statement , but may also ask to have the individual , known as the " deponent " , attend the hearing nonetheless . However , the party that asks to have the deponent summoned must assume the costs of doing so if the judge is of the opinion that the deponent was compelled to attend court unnecessarily . <p> What happens on the day of the hearing ? <p> On the day of the hearing , each party must make sure that its witnesses are present . There are two categories of witnesses : ordinary witnesses and expert witnesses . <p> Ordinary witnesses come to court to testify to what they have seen or heard . Expert witnesses have a high degree of knowledge in a specific field , such as engineers , architects , mechanics or certified appraisers . <p> The court clerk calls the case and notes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief explanation of the rules of evidence and procedure . Each party then presents its case and calls its witnesses . The judge examines the witnesses and provides fair and impartial assistance to both parties , and may also try to bring the parties to an agreement . <p> The judgment and revocation of the judgment <p> The judgment <p> After hearing all the parties , the judge may find wholly or partially in favour of the plaintiff , or may dismiss the action . The judge will also decide on any counter-claim by the defendant against the plaintiff . <p> The judge may render judgment at the hearing , in the presence of all the parties . This oral judgment is known in law as " a judgment delivered from the bench " . The judge may also render judgment at a later date , and this is called " taking the case under advisement " . <p> The parties receive a copy of the judgment rendered by the judge . The judgment settles the matter of costs , which may include the amounts paid to file or contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge . Generally , the losing party pays the costs . <p> The law requires that a judgment be rendered at the latest four months after the last day of the hearing . A judgment rendered in the Small Claims Division is final and can not be appealed . <p> Revocation of a judgment <p> If a judgment is rendered by default , in other words , in the absence of one of the parties , the party that did not attend the hearing may ask to have the judgment revoked if , for a valid reason , that party was prevented from contesting the action within the required period or time , or was prevented from appearing at the hearing . <p> A revocation of a judgment is not an appeal . For this reason , a judgment can not be revoked on the grounds that the judge made an error . <p> The request for revocation must be made in writing using the Application for Revocation of Judgment form and must be supported by a sworn statement . It must be filed in the office of the Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the judgment . If the application for revocation is granted , enforcement proceedings ( seizure ) will be suspended . The parties will be notified by the clerk who will summon them for a new hearing at a later date . <p> Following a judgment rendered in the Small Claims Division , the party that is ordered to pay money ( the debtor ) must pay to the party to whom the money is owed ( the creditor ) the amounts indicated in the notice of judgment within thirty days of the date of the judgment . The time limit is ten days if the defendant did not contest the action . <p> The payment must be sent directly to the creditor . <p> Enforcement <p> If the payment is not made within the required amount of time , the creditor may apply for the following enforcement proceedings : <p> the issue of a writ of summons for cross-examination in order to question the debtor about the debtor 's property and sources of income ; <p> the issue of a writ of seizure of movable property to seize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the issue of a writ of seizure by garnishment to seize property belonging to the debtor that may be in the possession of a third party , such as salary and bank accounts ; <p> the issue of a writ of seizure of immovable property to seize the immovable property of the debtor , other than his or her principal residence . <p> The creditor may take steps to have the judgment enforced or may have a lawyer or bailiff do it . A creditor who is a natural person may also request assistance from the clerk of the Small Claims Division . <p> Opposition to enforcement proceedings <p> The party that wins the case , the judgment creditor , can not seize all of the property belonging to the debtor . The law protects certain types of property from seizure . <p> It is possible to contest an enforcement proceeding ( seizure ) by completing the Opposition to seizure in execution form . When this form is filed , the clerk immediately notifies the parties and the bailiff , if any . The enforcement procedures will be suspended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing on a set date . <p> 1 .

##142852 <h> The Most Important MMA Event of 2008 <h> John Pollock / May 30 , 2008 - 6:50pm <p> Saturday night 's Elite XC debut on CBS is without question the most important MMA event of 2008 thus far . <p> It is not the card on paper that necessarily wields the influence but rather the end result -- that being the number generated on CBS Saturday night . <p> The numbers thrown out for expectations of what a non-UFC MMA card can draw on a mainstream outlet have been across the board with some claiming it will be a gigantic home run and others fretting it will be a sad reality that only a niche audience will tune in . <p> If the rating comes out anywhere at or above the 4-million viewer mark with a healthy share of the 18-34 demographic than rest assured that smiles will be circulating both the CBS and Elite XC offices on Monday morning . They wo n't be the only ones with grins from ear to ear as it should also open the door for rival networks to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tapped into and exploited . <p> Sitting in the on deck circle is NBC with a hot property in the Strike Force promotion that has been delivering consistently strong numbers for the late night timeslot they have been given on NBC affiliates on Saturday nights . A strong number Saturday night would likely push NBC to give Strike Force a green light for a prime time show before we flip over our calendars . <p> It has been made crystal clear that Dana White is not prepared to enter a network television deal where he has to hand over the reigns of the broadcast and make the transition from a ' promotional company ' to a full fledged ' sporting event ' ala HBO Boxing . This could prove to be a blessing or a curse for the UFC in the long run as they could miss the boat on network television and in essence create their own competition by networks going to their Plan B 's and bringing on rival promotions to draw a Mixed Martial Arts audience . <p> There are endless possibilities to the growth of MMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens if this show fails to deliver a sizable audience ? <p> This could be a detrimental setback to not only Elite XC but to the entire industry as a whole that could very well be paint brushed by a less than adequate number . The general feeling from network television executives is a healthy skepticism about this new sport called " Mixed Martial Arts " and a poor rating Saturday night will likely confirm their beliefs that MMA is nothing more than a niche sport with a limited audience that can not be marketed to the mass audience that their networks reach and writing off the sport as an industry better suited for cable television and Pay Per View than network television . <p> The number that is produced Saturday night will likely be interpreted many different ways by many different people -- each with their own agenda to either hinder or advance the sport of Mixed Martial Arts . <p> The success and failure of this show will lay on the shoulders of Kimbo Slice and his ability to convert non fans into CBS viewers on Saturday night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casual fan with a drawing card in Kimbo Slice , who is the perfect personality to headline this show . <p> A huge step in the evolution of MMA is contingent on one question being asked by casual spectators at the office on Monday morning -- " Did you see the fight Saturday night

##155652 <p> Although no form of protection is 100% safe , the proper and consistent use of condoms can significantly reduce the risk of the transmission of HIV and STD 's . <p> IMPORTANT : Do NOT use condoms that are " spermicidally lubricated " . These condoms contain the spermicide Nonoxynol-9 which can easily irritate the lining of the rectal mucosa which can increase the risk of HIV and other STI transmission . These condoms should only be used as a last resort --- you have no other condoms and are not willing to wait for sex . According to the World Health Organizations these condoms may increase the risk of HIV transmission and offer no statistically significant protection from pregnancy compared with regularly water-based lubricated condoms . For more information contact : education@aidsguelph.org . <p> TELL YOUR FRIENDS ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> CONDOM TIPS : <p> For best results ... <h> Buying and Storing <p> Use latex or polyurethane condoms . <p> Check the expiry date on the package . If in doubt , get a fresh supply . <p> Store condoms in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the latex . Polyurethane condoms are not affected by heat and light and may be stored for up to five years . <h> Male Condom Use <p> Do not open the package until you are ready to use the condom ! <p> Open the package carefully to avoid tearing . Rough handling and long fingernails can damage condoms . The condom will only unroll one way . Figure out which way it unrolls . <p> A drop of water-based lubricant inside the tip of the condom will improve sensation <p> Pinch the air from the tip of the condom to leave space for the semen . Air left in the condom will cause it to burst . If the condom does not have a reservoir tip , pinch it to leave a half-inch space at the head of the penis for semen to collect after ejaculation . <p> Place the condom on the head of the erect penis and gently unroll it so it covers the entire penis . If uncircumcised , pull back the foreskin before rolling on the condom . <p> Remove any air remaining at the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penis . <p> Use a water-based lubricant ( on the outside ) to prevent the condom from deteriorating . Avoid Vaseline and oil-based products , as they may cause the condom to break . Avoid the use of Saliva as a lubircant . <p> In the event that the condom breaks , withdraw the penis and put on a new condom before resuming intercourse . <p> After ejaculation , slowly withdraw the penis while it is still erect . Hold the base ( i.e. the rim ) of the condom firmly , so that it does not slip off . <h> Negotiating Condom Use <p> Sometimes talking about using condoms can be awkward , especially if it 's somebody you do n't know . Nonetheless , remember you have a right to protect yourself and your health , and using condoms is a way to take care of your partner too -- so you 're not being selfish at all . <p> A partner might have specific reasons for not wanting to use condoms . Look over this list to get ideas about how to respond if you ever feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sex with condoms does n't feel as good . I ca n't feel anything with one on ... " ... sex may feel different with a condom , but it does n't have to be unpleasant . I know if we use condoms I 'll feel a lot safer and more relaxed , and that will make the sex more enjoyable for both of us . <p> " Do n't you trust me ? " ... we may both believe we 're disease free and trust each other , but people can have an STI and not know it . We may not be able to trust our past partners . I trust that using a condom will protect us both . <p> " My HIV test was negative ... " ... HIV is not the only infection I 'm worried about . There are several STIs that may not have any visible symptoms even if you are infected . A condom will help protect us both from getting an STI . <p> " I love you . If you really loved me , you would n't ask me to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting a sexually transmitted infection is . I think if you loved me you would be more concerned about protecting us both from infections . <p> It has been shown that those of us who stop using condoms at the beginning of a relationship will nearly always continue without them . If you 're starting a relationship and your partner wants to stop using condoms , do n't give in if you really want to continue using condoms . Explain to him that your decision is not a sign that you do n't trust him or that you can not be trusted ; it 's about caring enough about each other to acknowledge that mistakes can happen in any relationship . After all nobody 's perfect . <p> Some may think condom use within a relationship is a sign of failure . Rather , could n't condom

The Toronto Maple Leafs lead the way with $20-million into the communal kitty in 2011-12 alone ( in another non-playoff year ) but Montreal and Vancouver were also among the league 's top four revenue generators and sharers . <h> More Related to this Story <p> There was even a year or two under the last CBA where the Edmonton Oilers ( ! ) paid into revenue sharing . ( The mighty Winnipeg Jets and their 15,000-seat rink were n't even able to receive payments last season because they made too much money . ) <p> Then there 's the other end of the equation , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best example of revenue sharing excess I always like to point to is that , according to the team 's own bankruptcy documents , in 2008-09 the Phoenix Coyotes received more in revenue sharing ( $13.5-million ) than they generated in ticket revenue ( $13.3-million ) . <p> Which is worthy of another ( ! ) . <p> All of this is especially relevant right now because in these in-depth talks between the league and the NHLPA this week in New York , revenue sharing has been a major topic of conversation . <p> Here 's why . <p> Union head Don Fehr is a huge proponent of it . He loves revenue sharing and part of his endgame here is pushing the NHL to have much more of it . <p> Fehr 's demands are why , in baseball , even the richest of the rich teams are putting 31 per cent of their locally generated revenues into revenue sharing . <p> Compare that with the NHL sharing a piddly $150-million of its $3.3-billion ( 4.5 per cent ) revenues last season . <p> That 's not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has huge centrally generated revenues and a much , much bigger overall pie . But you get the idea . <p> The NHLPA is n't asking for a baseball model , exactly , as in their last offer , they had roughly $260-million in sharing on the table , which is more than a 70 per cent increase from where it is currently . The league , meanwhile , has been willing to go as far as $200-million ( a 33 per cent increase ) and wipe out restrictions such as teams in large markets ( Anaheim , the Islanders , Dallas , etc. ) being ineligible . <p> Now that $60-million difference may not sound like much , but it is and there are two reasons for that . <p> No. 1 , the NHLPA essentially wants to give all of that $60-million to six teams in addition to the other sharing those clubs would already be getting . I 'm told that some of the discussions in this area to date have centred directly on the six franchises that have had the lowest revenues in the league ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix , the Islanders , Columbus , Florida , Nashville and Carolina . <p> I 'll get into the rational behind helping those clubs in particular in a minute . <p> No. 2 is all about where the money comes from . <p> If you look at the details of the NHL 's last proposal , it spells out that " at least 50% of the revenue sharing pool will be funded by the Top 10 revenue grossing teams . " <p> What 's interesting is that it then goes onto say that " the remainder of the revenue sharing pool will be funded from league- and playoff-generated revenues , " which is similar to how this part of the agreement functioned in the last CBA . <p> What the players ' side does n't like about this is that you run into a situation where a team like Phoenix , which loses a bundle , has to contribute more and more money to the revenue sharing pool when it does well on the ice . <p> That trip to the conference finals , in other words , does n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It almost creates a weird disincentive to be successful . <p> ( Obviously winning and going deep in the playoffs still helps , but how odd is it for a basket case franchise owned by the league to be paying some of its playoff gates into revenue sharing , which then comes back to it later ? Pretty odd . ) <p> How would this be fixed ? Well what Fehr is arguing in those meetings this week is that all that new money to the owners that 's generated by cutting the players ' share from 57 to 50 per cent should be used on this program . <p> The rough math on how much that is ? Just take 7 per cent of last year 's $3.3-billion ( $230-million ) and you 've got an idea how much more the owners may be putting into their jeans each season in a new agreement . <p> So , the NHL wants to increase revenue sharing by $50-million but take roughly $230-million from the players in doing so ? <p> And that figure rises as league revenues do . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , revenue sharing is obviously a difficult subject for many Canadian fans to wrap their heads around . I 'm sure the main question coming out of all of this is " why on earth do we want to prop up those six teams ( and several others ) to the tune of $260-million ? " <p> The NHLPA 's argument there would be twofold : Either ( a ) these franchises are moved somewhere more profitable to raise overall revenues or ( b ) as in baseball , the weaker ones are helped out enough to become more stable , thereby raising overall revenues . <p> What the players do n't want to see is the current situation , which essentially has at least six teams drowning without a life boat and the league 's richer teams ( and the league itself ) not doing nearly enough to help pull them out of it . <p> ( And even if you could relocate a few teams , there are n't six good new homes for NHL teams . Some of these teams have to be salvaged . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it from the perspective of the Boston Bruins or Philadelphia Flyers , two of the most powerful franchises in the league , why would you want these weaker franchises suddenly being more competitive ? How does a strong team on Long Island ( soon Brooklyn ) help their bottom line ? <p> It probably does n't , which is why allowing a few select owners at the top to drive the bus is n't the best way to improve overall league revenues - the very thing Fehr and the players are pushing for . <p> It 's in the players ' interests here to improve the size of the overall pie ; that 's not always the case for individual owners , who have their own kingdoms to rule before worrying about the health of the league . <p> Now , given the choice between allowing these franchises to continue to wallow at the bottom of the standings and extending a helping hand , I 'm fairly certain I know where most Canadian fans will stand . But it 's worth pointing out that , if a teams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and the dollar tanked again , franchises like the Nordiques and Jets would become the beneficiaries of a system that does n't simply shrug and let the weak ones wilt away and ultimately die . <p> Maybe fans are right and making revenue sharing donations to those six struggling U.S. teams is throwing good money after bad , but from the players ' perspective in these negotiations , they want 30 healthy franchises and , most importantly , fewer labour stoppages . <p> If the league wo n't relocate the Phoenixes into better markets to accomplish that

I think I might love her as Myrtle , just looking at her body language as they film a scene during which the two adulterers ca n't keep their hands off each other . Her costume is a little obvious but the body language , I mean , for sure - that is a girl who is hungry for a higher station and dumb enough to believe his lies . <p> You know , Ben Affleck was supposed to be Tom Buchanan before dropping out due to scheduling conflicts .

##274250 <h> From the back pages of the National Post <p> As the American financial system goes up in flames like a tissue-paper fairyland touched by a stray match , I ca n't help thinking back to the first time I thought to myself , " It 's time to short Uncle Sam . " <p> It was when I first read about Casey Serin -- a name that is not likely to mean much to you now , unless you are a true connoisseur of miscellaneous Internet phenomena . Today , Casey , pictured below , is forgotten , but one day , his curious story will be re-examined with intensity and amazement ; for he was the canary whose plummet from the perch disclosed that the world 's major financial organs were sucking methane . <p> Casey 's remarkable adventure was , by and large , already over when he first became famous in the autumn of 2006 . That was when the young Californian started his blog , IAmFacingForeclosure.com . The site was one of a number of " housing bubble blogs " run by troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Two things made Casey 's site stand out so far from the rest that journalists described him as " on his way to becoming the most hated blogger on the Internet , " and an exemplar of " irritainment " : the depth of the hole he had dug for himself and the complete lack of self-awareness with which he described his predicament . <p> A veteran of get-rich-quick real estate books and seminars -- of the sort that gets nobody rich quick but the authors and presenters --Casey , a newlywed Uzbek immigrant then aged 23 , had quit his job in the fall of 2005 to become a full-time property speculator . Using none of his own capital , he had been able to purchase eight houses across the U. S. southwest in just eight months . Total value : roughly US$2.9-million . How was a former Web developer who had never earned more than $50,000 in a year able to build such an empire ? The question was once an idle conundrum , but today it seems somehow imperative that a full answer be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is mortgage fraud-- though it was fraud of a sort that , as Casey has insisted all along , no American authority has been very interested in prosecuting or preventing . With encouragement from mortgage brokers , Serin lied to lenders about his income and abused subsidized loans intended strictly for owner-occupants . Making multiple purchases before the initial ones could filter through to his credit reports was crucial to the process . Later , when he managed to unload some of his properties , he would use up-front cash from sellers to bankroll other purchases ( as well as his own expensive lifestyle ) , failing to give the required notice to increasingly anxious creditors . <p> Serin was so unaware he 'd done anything wrong -- ethically or legally -- that he openly blogged about all this behaviour , defiantly arguing with Web visitors about his refusal to find a job , his carelessness about reporting to creditors , his reliance on patient friends and relatives and the inane purchases he would make whenever some scrap of cash fell in to his hands . He became legendary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musings about whether he 'd really done anything wrong , dipstick maxims like , " The fastest way to becoming a millionaire is to borrow a million , " scorn for formal education and hard work and praise for virtually every form of snake oil known to mankind , ranging from enemas to wheat grass to " 9/11 truth . " <p> Yet despite being a naive , lazy combination of American Dreamer and con man , it was only the chance discovery of one of his Web pages by a mortgage lender that stopped him from buying a ninth house . <p> At one time , the whole unbelievable crap game might well have worked out for Casey -- but he had picked a hilariously inappropriate time to jump into U. S. real estate , and had made matters worse by buying certain properties sight unseen from wholesalers . In the end , at least five of Serin 's houses were foreclosed on , becoming poorly maintained neighbourhood nuisances in the meantime . His net worth is in the abyss , his beautiful wife left him and took her annihilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves a declaration of bankruptcy almost entirely out of the question . <p> So how many Caseys are out there , living on the edge in the American wilderness ? If home lending practices were really as insane as he has demonstrated , using nothing but a head full of self-help nonsense and the guts of a burglar , how much abuse was perpetrated by bright people who really knew how to game the broken system ? How much bad debt still remains to be purged , and how low can the bottom of the housing market be ? No one can say : All one can do

Radiation treatment has blinded one eye , and doctors tell her she has one to three years left to live . <p> Heather Matheson said if she 'd known her dentist had a lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ( CBC ) <p> A few years ago , Matheson 's cancer seemed to be in remission after what appeared to be successful surgery . But she later detected a bump , which she thought was scar tissue , and wanted it reduced . <p> Matheson , a former CBC producer , went to Wittenberg , who had successfully performed an unrelated jaw operation on her a few years earlier . <p> " I knew him and had no reason not to trust him , " she said . <h> Cancer returned <p> Matheson said Wittenberg reduced the bump , but failed to send a tissue sample for laboratory analysis . <p> Nine months later , Matheson got word from other doctors that her cancer had returned . <p> Dr. Gerald Wittenberg was Matheson 's dentist . ( UBC ) <p> " Nine months -- it could have meant it was still operable . In that case , if it was operable , then it would have increased my chances , I think , for living a few more years , " said Matheson . <p> An investigation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. , found that " Dr. Wittenberg admits an error was made in not sending the sample to pathology . He states he has taken steps to implement a protocol within his office to ensure this can not happen again . " <p> " He has expressed genuine remorse and sympathy , " the College reported to Matheson . <p> The College took no disciplinary action against Wittenberg . <p> Matheson 's lawsuit is one of eight filed by patients of Wittenberg over the past 15 years . Four of them , including Matheson 's , were settled out of court . <p> Two other lawsuits were abandoned , one is still active . <p> Wittenberg denied any wrongdoing in any of those cases , and settlements are not an admission of liability or fault . <p> In the remaining case , Wittenberg was found at fault by the B.C.

" I think accountability is really paramount , so if a person ca n't find out anything about that professional , it 's kind of a shot in the dark . " <p> B.C. 's College of Dental Surgeons told CBC News it deals with professional competence while the courts deal with malpractice . The College publishes disciplinary actions against dentists , but it says posting court findings could compromise its role as an unbiased regulator . <p> The College says it understands that the public might want to know more about dentists ' backgrounds and it 's now looking at just how much more information it can make public within the legal constraints it operates under . <p> Parents of New Westminster Secondary School students say they want the provincial government to review the school district 's finances @ 
##323552 <p> I have a lemon tree growing inside of the house . I water it once a week and in the summer time put it outside of the house . It started from 5 inches tall little brunch and now turned into 5 ' 2 " tree that growing " wild " . What I mean is that all brunches on top are growing widely on the sides , lower leafs are small and turning yellow . The tree does n't look right to me . As for now it does look like I have to take care of these long branches that spreading in all directions , but I do not know how . Should I simply cut it ? Why some leafs on the bottom turned yellow ? I 'd really appreciate an advice how to take a proper care of this tree Sincerely , Ludmila <p> The lower leaves may be turning yellow due to old age--leaves only live about 1 1/2 years-- and when light levels go down in winter , the tree will usually drop old leaves that are not supporting themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but watering on a schedule is not best for citrus . It would be better to water only when the top 2-3 inches are dry . <p> As for pruning , you may have to , but it is better if you can avoid it as much as possible . Was the small branch you started the tree from a mature tree that had already produced fruit ? If so , pruning will not matter as much . But , if the branch was a seedling , it must reach a certain node count ( leaf count ) , before it will flower-- pruning reduces the node count by the number of leaves that are removed . <p> I have no idea where from my " starting " branch came from , it was a gift from a coworker As of now I 'm not using any fertilizers , I 'm not sure which one I need I also do not expect any fruits in a near future ; have been told that it takes a lot of time . All I 'm worry about that the tree looks strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of branches that are growing completely horizontal . Sincerely , Ludmila <p> Citrus trees if left alone almost always grow into a harmonious round shape . Growth and fruit tend to take place towards the external part of the canopy . Inner growth tends to decrease gradually over time . Generally a citrus tree will normally produce a much nicer tree when left alone , than the a pruner normally achieves . It is extremely doubtful whether attempts at what might be called formal pruning of citrus trees are ever satisfactory . Effects have been made to grow them in definite shapes at variance with their normal habit , but while they will stand much abuse in the form of pruning , it is uncertain whether these various practices have ever brought satisfactory results when compared with trees grown in a normal way . If good trees are planted and kept in healthy condition , they need very little attention on the part of the pruner , unless misfortune overcome them . - Millet <p> Ludmila if you ca n't find citrus fertilizer in your area get some miracle grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also get some epsom salt for magnesium 1/2 Tsp per gal every 3 months if you trim you can expect branch outs I take cuttings from time to time for grafting and t-budding but lightly , my trees are fruit bearing another product is S.T.E.M .

##341451 <h> Fredericton addiction detox to close for holidays <h> CUPE says timing could n't be worse <h> Posted : Nov 15 , 2012 10:54 AM AT <h> Last Updated : <p> ( Note:CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links . ) <p> CUPE 's regional director , Gordon Black , says addicts can be emotional and vulnerable during the holidays . ( CBC ) <p> The union representing employees at a Fredericton addiction treatment centre is questioning the decision to close the facility over the Christmas holidays , saying that is when addicts need support the most . <p> Horizon Health Network officials confirmed they plan to close the Fredericton Addiction Services facility on Brunswick Street between Dec. 21 and Jan. 1 . <p> Gordon Black , regional director of the Canadian Union of Public Employees , contends the Christmas season can be an emotional time for addicts , making them particularly vulnerable . <p> " Our members that work there , and most people , understand that that is one of the most troubling times for people that suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at odds with you , " said Black . " That place saves lives . " <p> ' What value will it be to talk to someone in Moncton if you 're in a desperate situation in Fredericton ? ' -- Gordon Black , CUPE <p> Horizon Health officials said in a written statement that the centre closed during the same period last year because of low demand . <p> There was only one person seeking the service during that time , they said , adding that demand increases after Jan. 1 . <p> Other centres in the province will remain open , but Black argues that 's not a realistic option . <p> " What they 've told me is they 'll basically put a sign up that says , If you need help , call Moncton , ' " said Black . " Well , people who are addicts -- give me a break . They do n't have access to a vehicle . They do n't have no money . They have no way to even make a phone call , " he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moncton if you 're in a desperate situation in Fredericton ? " <p> In a second statement , issued late Thursday afternoon , however , Horizon Health said there will not be any sign , as Black suggested . <p> Fredericton 's addiction outpatient services , also located in the Victoria Health Centre , will continue to operate during the holidays , so if anyone shows up for detox services , the receptionist will be able to refer them elsewhere , they said . <p> The cost of transportation to Moncton or Saint John will be covered if the client needs to go to the detox centres in those cities , officials said . <p> In addition , a mobile crisis team

##406352 <p> A year and a half after the killings began , a question hangs in the air : Why have n't we sent our soldiers to save the people of Syria from mass murder by their government ? <p> Twenty-five years ago , that question would have been almost nonsensical . Until the end of the Cold War , the idea of sending the world 's soldiers to stop a country 's internal atrocity would almost never have been considered . Armies were used strictly for purposes of strategic interest . <h> video <h> video <p> And then , as a new world order emerged , we experienced a series of just such interventions , most very controversial , some successful , many facing serious opposition from some countries , and most involving Canada . <p> When Serbian militias were slaughtering Muslims in Bosnia , we sent troops in an attempt to prevent a larger massacre . When Slobodan Milosevic was threatening mass killings in Kosovo , we launched an attack against his forces and his capital to prevent it . When Sierra Leone was descending into butchery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when Moammar Gadhafi was poised to shoot his country 's people , we sent military planes to hold him back . Over that 16-year period , it seemed we were making progress . <p> The 1999 Kosovo intervention had been fiercely opposed by Russia , and was technically " illegal , " but , by 2011 , there were no votes in the United Nations Security Council against the Libya action . <p> The seemingly absolute values of human rights and national sovereignty , whose contradicting agendas allowed atrocities to go unstopped in such places as Cambodia and Rwanda , no longer seemed so incompatible . A consensus seemed to emerge : Maybe national sovereignty is not so much a right as a responsibility , one that carried obligations . <p> Starting in 2001 , a Canadian-led team began formulating a way around that problem . In 2005 , their new set of principles , known as the " responsibility to protect " doctrine , became part of UN policy . R2P meant that , if a country 's government started killing its people , then the world 's armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Security Council was allowed to authorize force to stop the killing . <p> After the debacle of the Iraq war , R2P seemed highly unlikely to succeed . It was a policy championed by Paul Martin , and co-authored by Michael Ignatieff , so it was with some surprise that its first major use came last year , with Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's strong backing , when Canada and other NATO nations went to war in Libya . Suddenly , it seemed this idealistic policy just might work . <p> And then it all fell apart . The Syrian slaughter , which is more deadly and more complicated than the Libyan uprising , has gone unstopped ( except by NATO member Turkey , which is playing an active role in backing the rebels ) . It took more than a year just to get the Security Council members to condemn the violence . <p> It 's easy to say that this is because Russia is an ally of Syria or that Iran 's backing of Bashar al-Assad makes the conflict potentially explosive . But the fact is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old Cold War problem . <p> At its root is our use of the word " we . " The countries proposing intervention , usually on noble human-rights grounds , are mostly former colonizers . The world 's new economic and military powers , increasingly able to call the shots , are mostly former colonies such as India , South Africa and Brazil . <p> Many of these countries were angered by the Libya campaign -- not because it stopped mass murder ( they backed it for that reason ) but because it did n't stop until it had overthrown the regime . <p> In recent months , these former colonial countries have been pushing for a new policy that will make intervention more difficult , on the basis of " sovereign equality " -- that is , making national borders sacred again . <p> " Sovereign equality , for former colonial states , is hugely important , and it became a leading principle for them after the Libyan war , " says Jennifer Welsh , the Canadian Oxford University professor who has played a leading role in creating human-rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative influence of the United States is on the decline , these statements from countries like India and China and Brazil are only going to get stronger .

##418652 <h> Hey , were n't we supposed to be dead by now ? <p> Contrary to popular belief , Robert Conquest did not actually suggest I Told You So , You Fucking Fools as one possible title for an updated edition of his book The Great Terror . But , hey , that means it 's still available if Michael Fumento ever wants to follow up on his universally denounced 1990 book The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS . <p> ( Global warming ? Of course it 's real ! It 's not like we 've ever seen leftists , science popularizers , and gullible journalists band together to blow some global threat way out of proportion and vilify skeptics as borderline murderers , have we ? ) <h> TrackBack <h> Comments ( 29 ) <p> While I totally sympathize with your suspicion of leftists and gullible journalists , and am willing to accept your inclusion of science popularizers for sake of argument , the International Panel on Climate Change is none of those things . The global climate is changing , the balance of evidence suggests that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , soberest science available . <p> The official 2007 consensus for policymakers is : " Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes , particularly temperature increases . " The IPCC report summarizes nearly 30,000 distinct observed data series , and more than 90% of them are consistent with warming at the location observed . " A global assessment of data since 1970 has shown it is likely6 that anthropogenic warming has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems . " Footnote 6 defines " likely " as 66-90% confidence . <p> Please do not read me as leaping from that directly to " oh my god we 're going to die . " We 're not . Probably . Most of us are n't , anyway , at least not for that reason ( though I would n't want to be living in Bangladesh ) . That does n't mean it 's going to be fun . There is a possibility ( of unknown likelihood ) that it will be very not fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be contrarian , but you usually take care to have reason on your side . It 's disappointing to hear you make a throwaway swipe at global warming based only dislike of idiot leftists . Maybe I 'm misreading you . <p> The argument I made is against accepting a supposed " consensus " of Concerned ScientistsT and their camp-followers , filtered through multiple layers of political bargaining and pious exaggeration , as a good reason in itself for believing anything . It should not be taken as an argument against anyone 's independently-formed , appropriately supported opinion on the subject of global warming . <p> This business of " signatories " seems to be an obsession of bamboozlers trying to make this all sound like a political rather than a scientific process . Scientists talk about " authors " , not " signatories " , and the IPCC Fourth Assessment lists more than 500 . I used to work at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research , and I assure you they are not " tangentially related " to climate science . Neither is the Max-Planck-Institut fur Biogeochemie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dept. of Earth , Atmospheric , and Planetary Sciences at MIT . <p> Please , go take a look and tell me which ones you disbelieve and why . I 'll wait . <p> In short , wherever you got this silly talking point from , they 're selling you FUD . <p> That 's all true , but the scientific authors who contribute to the work underpinning the IPCC reports have very little to do with the discussions that lead to the creation of the " consensus for policymakers " , which IS a political process . In fact , it might be better described as a " consensus by policymakers " . If you want people to defer to the prestige of Max-Planck-Institut , you should probably quote a document that actually came out of it . <p> What , Islander claims the IPCC has as much credibility as the Hollywood Foreign Press , I respond that the Fourth Assessment of Working Group I has more than five hundred authors from pretty much every notable climate institution in the world , and *I'm* the one who bears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still , you want it , you got it . It took me about 30 seconds to find this on Google Scholar . <p> Okay , no , it is true that the " consensus for policymakers " is not a scientific document . It is the scientific community 's best possible effort to distill the actual science down to terms that do n't presume you 've had a graduate education in the subject . And it is actually very cautious in specifying what there is genuine consensus about . That 's the point . <p> Yes , we 've all seen political " executive summaries " that do not match the content of the underlying report . This is not one of those cases . Read the report if you do n't believe me . Or find a climate scientist and ask him or her . I 'd suggest realclimate.org , but find your own if you want to . <p> My own understanding is that the showcase documents for IPCC IV were , in fact , prepared with more care than was sometimes evident in prior editions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th hour , which might normally herald slipshod work but in this case could have been a sign of legitimate give-and-take . The quantitative definitions of " likely " and " very likely " , for instance , are the sort of thing that obviously arises when someone asks " Just what the hell are we saying here exactly ? " <p> I think there is a camp of people who believe that evidence of anthropological global warming is solid , but who believe that the effect is slow enough that humans will adapt to it without much trouble and humans will become less and less carbon-emission-prone as time goes on . They call these people " skeptics " which is a bad name since it does n't say what exactly they are skeptical . <p> Anybody who disagrees with any link in the narrative chain is likely to get tagged as a " denier " ( a term chosen for utterly repulsive , inexcusable reasons ) . You can legitimately believe that the warming 's not happening , that it 's happening but is not primarily anthropogenic , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful , that it 's harmful but adaptation makes more sense than mitigation , or that adaptation is a worse strategy than mitigation but technological solutions are possible and almost certainly the best and cheapest of all . You can also believe that we are totally helpless no matter what , and/or that the rectification of our capitalist habits by means of climate-change democide is a good thing . <p> The Heartland Institute is arguing in self-interest which means their activities should be taken with a grain of salt . However , this misses the point entirely . A small group of cognitive elite are trying to convince all governments on Earth to reduce dramatically the amount of cheap , industrial energy available to ordinary people . I think this group of people grossly underestimates the way that energy improves ordinary people 's lives and they do a poor job of explaining the impact of a possible 1 C increase in a 100 years that will justify that sacrifice . If the Heartland Institute does n't take up the cause then someone else will . <p> ( Also , I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should of taken Latin in school . ) <p> It is 1-6 C , actually . Among the effects forecast if the change goes above +4C , just to pick one , is the extinction of more than 40% of species around the globe . <p> On the other hand , there are a lot of things we can do that are either not that expensive , or that have huge cost-benefit returns . Many of them are good ideas even if global warming is *not* actually happening . <p> ... among the total range of socioeconomic emissions scenarios contemplated by the IPCC , though the best estimate even for a world of fast growth and unmitigated fossil-fuel usage is just 4.0C. , and for what I would consider more realistic futures ( or for that matter the $134/bbl present ) , it 's much smaller . Also the IPCC did n't have access to new , radically smaller figures on the size of the Chinese economy , and there 's a theoretical debate over their failure to use purchasing-power parity in the growth models . So , yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets outvoted - that a group or society has to make a decision on something ( to do X , do Y , or do nothing ) , so that the judgment of the largest number is taken as a provisional proxy for the judgment of the whole . Happens all the time . The only alternative - in the realm of making collective decisions - to majority rule , which ( yes ) can be unfair , is minority rule , which is even more unfair . <p> HOWEVER , a problem does arise when the majority attempts to silence the minority . Apart from anything else , this may mean the " majority " may slip below 50% but no one realises because no one wants to mark themselves out as a dissenter ( especially when dissenting is ascribed to pyschological problems , eg " denialism " ) . <p> I think the larger problem with the global warming debate has been that there have been no practical solutions proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . A Kyoto-style approach to restricting emissions simply is not going to work because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no practical alternatives to fossil fuels at this point , and people simply wo n't accept a decrease in living standards for a long term problem . I suspect that a lot of the resistance to climate change theory would dissipate if policy turned to advancing development of new energy sources or dealing with the impact of climate change , rather than trying to force energy asceticism on the world . History suggests such steps would also be more likely to result in a positive outcome . Take Malthus 's predictions on population growth , for example : he advocated limits on population growth to avoid mass starvation . In the end , mass starvation was averted by technological advances that increased agricultural productivity . <p> Among the effects forecast if the change goes above +4C , just to pick one , is the extinction of more than 40% of species around the globe . <p> Wow . That 's a bullshit claim . Have they verified that experimentally ? Put 100 species in a enclosed environment , raised the temperature 2F , and watched almost half the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the large land animals see only a 10% loss rate , that suggests that a domesticated species ought to go extinct . The yak ? llama ? banteng ? None are exactly likely to become extinct from a mere rise in temperature . <p> Come to think of it , has there ever been a single docmented case of an animal or plant going extinct from nothing but a rise in temperature ? <p> I spent fifteen months working for a company that produces and sells an N-dimensional vector solver for quantitative financial analytics . Modeling complex systems is inexact at best , and downright bullshit at worst . That the Goldman GEO fund could lose 30% of its value in a couple of weeks last summer is just one recent example of how badly we model complex systems and assign risks to different factors . There are ALWAYS factors the models do n't account for . Unexpected things ALWAYS happen -- things that completely change the expected outcome . <p> If the climate modelers were really capable of creating an accurate model of global climate ( i.e. one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman or JP Morgan and cut themselves a ( let 's say ) two billion dollar cheque to apply their talents to modeling market and credit risk . There are hundreds of trillions of dollars at stake , so money would literally be no object . <p> Considering that the solutions proposed by many climate change doomsayers are dramatic and expensive , it 's wiser to proceed with great skepticism when the " science " involves such badly flawed modeling . <p> Colin : You bear a name that is old and storied in my family . I am descended from Colin the famous sheep farmer of Cononish , an he hight Colin . He was a practical man and I am sure he would weep pure milk of ewe if he saw your comments . <p> The truth is that predictions about warming were made in the late 80s , based on models . We have not seen the warming predicted then . In fact , we have not seen any rise in temperature over the last 75 years . We have instead seen fluctuations . <p> You fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are skeptics . Your comment seems to claim Richard Lindzen ( a lead author of the IPCC report ) as a supporter of your theory . This is ridiculous , as Lindzen has always been a skeptic . The truth is that many of the authors of the IPCC report disagree with the summary for policymakers . Many do not think that AGW is a threat . There is no consensus in this regard , and your attempt to include many scientists who do not believe in catastrophic AGW in your consensus is remarkably disingenuous . <p> The truth is that all of the empirical evidence says tht nothing unusual is going on . This is a simple fact . The only " evidence " for AGW is in the models . It should be noted that these models fail to model the real world in many respects . <p> I do n't think it is safe to say that catastrophic AGW is not a possibility , but as far as I can tell , based on the primary literature , there is no empirical evidence for catastrophic AGW , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ? Well , the climate is always changing . However , if the past 2+ years are any indication ( I live on the BC west coast ) it is most definitely not warming . June is over 1/2 through and we 've barely had a day over 20 C ; heck , we 've had lots of days where it 's been 5 or more degrees below normal - pretty much unheard of for a temperate maritime climate . <p> Problem is , with GHG levels constantly rising , temperature should be rising too . In fact , worldwide temperatures have been falling for the past 7 years . So maybe there are other factors out there that trump the impact of GHGs . <p> Finally , what Canadian in

That would be a starring spot in the Nick Cassavetes-directed comedy Cali , according to the Daily Mail . ( The paper reports that Stewart , who 's a producer on the upcoming flick , will cede her role to Drive Me to Hell ' s Amber Heard . ) <p> As for the premiere , RadarOnline reports that Stewart pulled out of an August 16 red-carpet appearance , a London screening of On the Road .

##456251 <p> The penny coin , loved by some but an annoyance to many , will be withdrawn from circulation this year because it costs too much to make and is a pecuniary pest . <p> " The penny is a currency without any currency in Canada , " Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Thursday . <p> Ottawa said the penny retained only one twentieth of its original purchasing power . It costs 1.6 Canadian cents to produce each one cent coin and stamping out the penny will save around C$11 million ( $11 million ) a year . <h> Related <p> " Some Canadians consider the penny more of a nuisance than a useful coin . We often store them in jars , throw them away in water fountains or refuse them as change , " the government said in a budget document . <p> " Financial institutions face increasing costs for handling , storing and transporting pennies . Over time , the penny 's burden to the economy has grown relative to its value as a means of payment , " it said . <p> Other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denomination coins include Australia , Brazil , Finland , Israel , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland and Britain . <p> " There are 30 billion pennies in circulation and every year they are minting more . It was just one of those no-brainer slam dunks . It 's a place where we can save money , " said the NDP 's Pat Martin , who has long campaigned for the penny to be abolished . <p> " Of the 30 billion pennies , I think half of them are under my bed in a big jar , " he said . <p> The Royal Canadian Mint will stop distributing penny coins to financial institutions later this year . As the coin slowly disappears , prices for cash transactions will be rounded up or down to the closest five cents . <p> Non-cash payments such as checks , credit and debit cards will continue to be settled to the cent . <p> No more pennies ? Why ? They are worth almost nothing , they are cumbersome and they cost the government at least $130-million per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accept them and bartenders sneer at the sight of them -- yet the Mint is still busy pumping out 25 pennies per Canadian per year -- at a cost of 1.5 cents apiece . " If a coin has such low purchasing power that consumers refuse it , throw it away or horde it without worrying about putting it back into the distribution system , it would seem logical to stop producing it , " reads a 2007 report by Desjardins urging the penny 's demise . The senate joined in with an anti-penny report in 2010 . " It is a piece of currency , quite frankly , that lacks currency , " said Senator Irving Gerstein at the time ( the joke is popular ; during Thursday 's budget announcement Mr. Flaherty said " the penny is a currency without any currency . " ) <p> Was anybody actually using pennies , anyway ? According to Desjardins , the penny does have some friends : the mining industry , armoured trucks and manufacturers of coins rolls and boxes . " Are we ready to bear an additional cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must artificially support these companies ? , " reads the report . <p> What will we do without them ? As per the 2010 senate recommendations , Canadians will simply be asked to round prices up or down to the nearest nickel . Credit card users , however , will still be required to pay to pay to the cent . Does that discrepancy leave Canada vulnerable to small-scale fraud , like the Richard Pryor character in Superman III who scams his employer by filling a dummy account with the fractions of cents left over from financial transactions ? Maybe , but so far nobody else seems to have had a problem with ditching low-denomination coins . Like most currency-related issues , Canada is way behind the times on this one . More than a dozen countries including Israel , Switzerland and Brazil have successfully eliminated single-unit coins . Not to mention the iconic British half-penny , which was phased out under Margaret Thatcher . <p> How long have been carrying around these things ? Thursday 's budget announcement brings an end to 104 years of Canadian pennydom . On January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck the country 's first one-cent coin at what would become the Royal Canadian Mint . Age has not been kind to the tiny coin : Today 's pennies are worth less than one quarter of the value of a penny in 1904 . Although King Edward VII 's portrait was on the coins back then , maple leaves have remained fixed on the coin from the very beginning -- except for 1967 when an Alex Colville image of a rock dove in flight was minted to celebrate Canada 's centennial . <p> What are pennies made of , anyway ? Up until the 1990s , pennies used to be made of copper . In 1997 , to cut costs , the Mint changed the formula to a zinc core with only a thin plating of copper . In 2000 , the recipe was changed again to give the coins a steel core . If the Mint had not made the switch , high copper prices and metal thieves may have ended the penny 's reign long before Jim Flaherty had a chance . Three months ago , a Peterborough man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . With people taking those kinds of risks , do you think they would have hesitated to melt down a few rolls of worth of solid copper pennies ? <p> While we 're tossing out coins , why not the nickel ? Soon enough . Nickels are already relatively useless -- and like all coins they 're dropping in value each year . New Zealand phased out its one-cent coin in the 1980s and then its five-cent coin in 2009 . It 's a strategy Desjardins strongly recommends , since eliminating more than one coin at a time could cause unneeded confusion and economic damage . Once the penny is successfully gone , " the federal government should consider , a few years later , the relevance of removing the five-cent coin , " stated Desjardins in 2007 . <p> Will I seem old-fashioned if I say " penny for your thoughts , " " penny-pincher " or " a penny saved is a penny earned " ?

##472552 <h> Mattie and the Mysterious Candle <p> The Rev. Dr. Worcester , an American clergyman and adventurer , made many hunting and travel trips to Newfoundland at the turn of the century . The following is excerpted from the book ; Life 's Adventure : The Story of a Varied Career . published in 1932 in New York , by Charles Scribner 's Sons , pp. 205-211 . <p> Since Mattie 's son Larry was 14 at the , it occurred in 1904 . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I hardly like to relate this last incident because , strange as it was , no explanation of it was forthcoming . I had long heard of the Hare Bay rivers , which I am convinced are among the most prolific Atlantic salmon-rivers in the world . Hare Bay lies on the east coast of Newfoundland high up in the northern peninsula . To reach it from the west in a vessel , we were obliged to circumnavigate the northern tip of the island , a region containing many icebergs and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when off Cape Bauld we were so blinded by fog that we did not dare attempt to enter a harbor , but stood on and off the coast within sound of that cape 's great siren , which blew at brief intervals for seventy-two hours . What rendered our position precarious was the presence of many invisible icebergs and the fact that we were on the edge of the course of ocean liners which pass to the north of Newfoundland through the Isle on the way to Quebec . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? On the third day the fog was dissipated , but a heavy rain fell and a strong wind blew . We sailed up Hare Bay nearly to the end where we found a small island , behind which we ran for shelter and cast anchor . On the following day , it poured so heavily that I hardly went on deck . Thus the weather continued until six o'clock the next morning when the rain ceased , the sun shone , and not a breath blew . With a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off immediately after breakfast to explore the best of these rivers . That day I had the greatest single day of salmon fishing I have ever enjoyed in my life . I hooked and played thirty-five fish , saving twenty and losing fifteen , and , as I was using small flies , I considered this a Long did about as well . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The salmon of Hare Bay are not large , averaging from ten to twelve pounds , but neither are the salmon of most Newfoundland rivers . The size of salmon depends almost entirely on the geographical formation of the rivers the fish frequent , their depth , swiftness of current , the nature of their rapids and waterfalls . Most of the rivers of Newfoundland are rough and rapid , and some of them almost tumble off the mountains . Hence their fish are comparatively small . As Doctor Jordan puts it , " Salmon are ' geared ' to the rivers they inhabit . " This means that , by the law of survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mount its most difficult falls and rapids and to deposit their eggs in quiet places far up the river where they will hatch . The slower , deeper rivers of Newfoundland , such as the Humber , the Codroy and the Little Codroy , the Castor , and a few others , contain larger salmon , as do a good many rivers of northern Labrador . In Labrador I made a singular discovery . On some of the rivers the salmon will take the fly freely . On others , only a few miles distant , they will not take a fly at all . I should hesitate to make this statement from my own limited experience , but Sir Charles Dashwood , who had fished these rivers for years , once told me the same thing , namely , that on some of the quite indifferent to the fly . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? We returned from our wonderful fishing , laden with the salmon we had kept . I was cold , tired , hungry , and wet from wading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin to change my clothes and get ready for supper . Captain Hilliard joined me looking grave and troubled . He said , " A very curious thing has happened since you went away which you ought to look into and we must be careful what , we say about it , or we shall lose our crew and Mattie too . They are greatly excited over it . " to tell me the following story . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Soon after he and the crew had eaten their midday meal , Michael Gillis , the cook , had proposed to him that they take one of the schooner 's dories and explore the little island behind which the vessel was anchored . The atmosphere was perfectly still , the bay like a mirror . The sun was shining , and after their long confinement on the schooner they felt a desire to stretch their legs and to walk in the woods . They had with them one of the sailors to row the dory . The island was , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both ends , and perhaps a quarter of a mile wide at the broadest part . It lay less than half a mile off shore , at the head of the bay , and our vessel lay between it and the mainland . Its interior was shaggy with trees and bushes , and its surface was rough , containing many large well as a hiding place . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I must revert to the conditions of the weather preceding the event I am narrating , otherwise the incident would have little significance . We had come up the bay two days before in a furious rain-storm , which had continued until about six o'clock that morning when the sailors were on deck . In such a place not the smallest event could happen without attracting attention . If a seal lifted his head above the water he would be noticed by some one . In other words , it would have been strictly impossible for a man to paddle a canoe or row in a boat to the island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet a man was on the island and he had performed an act that he could not the wind and rain had ceased . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? As the Captain and Michael were walking along the shore on the edge of the woods , something shining among the trees caught their eyes . They hastened to it and there , securely set on a big horizontal branch of a fir tree , a large church candle was burning . To persons who have never left their homes this may seem a trifling occurrence . But men who have dwelt in the wilderness will understand the overwhelming amazement and fear with which they regarded this strange spectacle . The candle was about an inch and a half in diameter , and , when they first saw it , it was about eighteen inches tall . They tasted it , and it was made of wax . The branch on which it stood had been carefully squared with a sharp knife . The candle , as they could judge from its drippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , hundreds of miles from any church , on an island , in a section of country at that time totally devoid of inhabitants ? Above all , what did it signify ? What was the meaning of a lighted candle in this desolate spot ? Why was it burning in the daytime , and where was the man who had lighted it ? In all probability , he was still hiding on the island quite near them . So the captain and Michael began to halloo and to call on this man , whoever he was , to come out and show himself , promising to do him no harm . But , and no strange form appeared . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? By this time both men were nonplussed and not a little frightened , while the sailor who accompanied them was absolutely terrified . He insisted on returning to the schooner , which they did . After talking the matter over , Captain Hilliard took one of my rifles and returned with Michael and found the candle still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called and entreated the hiding man but there was no reply . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? This was the story the captain told me in my cabin . I called Doctor Long and Mattie and we stepped into our canoe , which was still trailing , and with Captain Hilliard we paddled over . The candle was still burning , though it was now not more than an inch long . I wished to take it with me as a souvenir , but the captain told me that if I took it on board not a man would remain on the schooner , that they would desert me as soon as an opportunity offered . The most curious psychical reaction to this event was the effect it produced on the mind of the Indian , who regarded the scene with silent horror . It was too dark to make a search of the island that night . In such an attempt Mattie 's faculties were infinitely better than ours ) and I said to him , " We ca n't do anything tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me at daylight and we 'll go ashore and ransack that island from one end to the other till we find that man -unless he gets away tonight . " As we had seen no this did not seem probable . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The Indian looked at me darkly and said : " I never put foot on dat island again . I know dis country , I travel through it since I was a boy . Never see nutten like dat afore . Dat candle was n't put dere by human hands . It 's a sign , a sign dat all you fellows is goin ' to be drowned . I wo n't go on dat schooner again . I go home . " Nor could any argument dissuade him . Mattie lived on the west coast at Bonne Bay and though the northern end of Newfoundland is not wide , yet with its lakes and forests and rivers , it would prove very difficult for an ordinary man to traverse without a canoe , and , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurence , a lad of fourteen . I pointed out these difficulties to the Indian , but he merely said : " You give me four spikes . I cross anything in Newfoundland ' on four spikes . " I saw that he referred to a raft of logs which together by two stringers spiked down . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? With difficulty I persuaded Mattie to return to the schooner for the night by the promise of provisions for his journey . Early the next morning he and Laurence departed with an axe , a rifle , and all the food they wished to carry . When I saw them a fortnight later , they still bore traces of the hardships of their long walk . Their shoes were worn out , and their clothing was tattered . Mattle , however , was in much better spirits . On the way he had killed a beaver and a caribou , and had pearls which he presented to me . <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolled by two small British war vessels , one on either coast . My curiosity in regard to the candle was so great that I did not wish to leave the mystery unsolved . Finding that I could get no help from my men , who were anxious to be gone , I sailed about fifty miles farther south and found the war-ship in harbor . The captain received Doctor Long and me courteously and he was so much interested in our story that he summoned his officers and engaged us in conversation for more than two hours . He knew Mattie well , and as the Indian had guided him on several hunting and fishing excursions , he respected him highly . He ascribed his desertion to superstition . I asked the English captain if any of his men had deserted , but he denied this . I begged him to return with me to the bay and to help me to make a thorough search for the hidden man . He told me he could not leave his present station for another ten days . " After that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that I shall ransack the whole country . Such a problem as this must be solved . " I asked him if he could form any conjecture as to who the man was , what he was doing , how he got onto the island , and how he had escaped . The captain replied : " This whole matter is beyond my comprehension and outside my experience of the people on this island . The man may be a criminal who is hiding from justice . All these people are Catholics . He must have come from a distance , and he may have stolen the candle from a church and have lighted it with the thought of atoning for his crime . He must have been on the island when you arrived , or you would have seen him cross . He probably had a canoe which he concealed in the bushes . It puzzles me to understand why he should have lighted the candle while you were about . Perhaps he thought that your men would not go ashore on this island . Perhaps he wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing . If you will give me your address , I will inform you if I learn anything further and you can depend on me to bring the whole matter to light if I can do so . I do n't like to have such things happen on my beat , especially as I fish the Hare Bay rivers Good afternoon , gentlemen . " <p> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I never heard from this captain , and the whole matter remained a mystery . The next winter when Doctor Grenfell came to Emmanuel Church to preach , the first question he asked me was , " Did you ever learn who lighted the candle ? " I replied , " No , how do you know about it ? " He said , " That story has gone all over the North , and I have heard it told in a dozen places . " I asked him if any clue to the mystery had ever been discovered . " None whatever and I guess that the problem will never be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he might have found the man who must have been hiding on the island at the time , but when 
##475350 <p> Last week the CBC got its hands on an amateur video produced by some of our soldiers for a comedy night at a military base in Nova Scotia back in 2010 . <p> It was a short , four-minute spoof making fun of Osama Bin Laden 's older brother , " Eugene . " <p> The CBC says it got this video last month . But it sat on it for weeks , in order to release it as a big , breathless exclusive right before Remembrance Day . <p> It 's obvious why . It was the CBC 's way of showing what it thinks of our Canadian Forces : That they 're a bunch of racist pigs . <p> The CBC said the video was an exclusive . But it actually was n't .

It was a soldier pretending to be bin Laden 's brother , hiding out in Vancouver . <p> Maybe the jokes were n't particularly funny . But that 's not what the CBC was outraged by . It thinks it 's horrendous that our soldiers , who put themselves in harm 's way fighting against Muslim fundamentalists in Afghanistan , might actually make fun of bin Laden and some of the things al-Qaida and the Taliban do , like use car bombs . <p> The most common word in the CBC 's report was " offensive . " But that 's not reporting . Reporting is telling the facts . Saying , again and again , that a video was offensive , is offeringits opinion . <p> What exactly was the problem ?

Is n't that what you do when you 're pretending to be bin Laden ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a German accent when they were doing anti-Hitler skits in the 1940s , too . But does n't the CBC sometimes do skits , similar to this , making fun of people ? Even Osama bin Laden ? <p> Why , yes , it does . With fake beards and accents , too . It 's rare for the CBC to mock a Muslim - too politically incorrect . <p> Much more common are its unfunny attacks on Catholicism , turned into skits by adding a laugh track . But once in a while they do a token satire of terrorists . <p> So how did the CBC square the fact that it has comedians speaking in accents and beards mocking bin Laden , with its scandalous " exclusive " that our Canadian Forces did it , but they were " offensive ? " The CBC has more than a dozen comedians and comedy writers on staff , but it asked its one visible minority , Shaun Majumder - the same guy who usually plays bin Laden on the CBC - to explain why he can do it but soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can do it because he 's a professional and the soldiers were n't . He said he 's culturally sensitive and the soldiers were n't . <p> And he said that in the anti-Muslim " backlash " in the West , it 's never OK to mock Islam . Except when he does it . <p> Majumder should stick to comedy - not being a snitch on The National , ratting out other comedians as hate criminals . <p> And the CBC should stop its smear campaign against our Canadian Forces . <p> Barack Obama has been the worst president for the U.S. economy since Jimmy Carter . But Americans chose another four years of that . <p> What should Canada do to protect ourselves from America 's continuing economic decline ? Here are eight things : <p> 1 . Pay down Canada 's government debt . The U.S. is $16 trillion in debt , and is racking up another trillion a year . Its credit rating has been downgraded , and surely will be again . That means interest rates will rise and borrowing will be more expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of that whirlpool ourselves . Our deficit is on track to be eliminated by next year . We 've got to keep running a surplus , and retire our debt . <p> 3 . Low taxes could also start a northward " brain drain . " Let 's recruit the best and brightest from America to immigrate to Canada . Immigration Minister Jason Kenney recently returned from a similar trip to Ireland . Why not add on new recruiting trips to Silicon Valley , the Boston-area universities , New York and other pools of talent who might prefer our stronger economy and quality of life ? <p> 4 . As a country of just 34 million people , we need more human capital . But we need more financial capital , too . Just to develop our oilsands could require $100 billion -- more than Canadians could invest . What a perfect time to steer foreign investors away from riskier <p> U.S. assets and into Canada . We need to immediately modernize our foreign investment review rules , to avoid the confusion and uncertainty arising from our delays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . We need trade agreements with those parts of the world that are actually growing -- especially Asia . The Conservatives are currently negotiating more trade treaties than ever before . Some , like with Panama , are small . Some , like with China , are rudimentary . But a few billion here and there starts to add up -- and we need it all to offset our dependence on the U.S. <p> 6 . One of our biggest exports to the U.S. is oil -- about 2.2 million barrels a day . But there are two problems with that : Because all of our oil is sold to the U.S. , our oil sells for $25 per barrel less than if we could sell it to other customers at world prices . And there 's another risk : In his election night speech , Obama talked about " global warming " again -- signaling that he may permanently block the Keystone XL pipeline to the U.S. , or add a new carbon tax , or both . <p> That means it 's more important than ever to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Gateway Pipeline , but the doubling of the existing Transmountain pipeline that already goes to Vancouver . <p> That 's six ways to inoculate our economy against Obamanomics . But we need to do two things to fix our democracy to guard our prosperity in Canada . <p> 7 . End forced union dues . Obama 's win was partly financed by big unions in the U.S. , thanking him for his largess with taxpayers ' money . That 's a risk to our democracy , too . It is illegal for employers to force employees to donate to a political campaign supporting Stephen Harper . So why do we allow unions to extract dues from their members to finance ad campaigns that support left-wing candidates ? <p> 8 . Voter fraud in the U.S. is rampant . But Obama did n't win a single state with mandatory ID laws . Forget about the fake Canadian scandal of " robocalls " that did n't actually make a single person switch their vote . We need to require proof of citizenship to vote -- and to end the bizarre Elections Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burka . <p> How could Barack Obama win reelection , with U.S. unemployment still at 8% , and real unemployment much higher ? With 43 million Americans on food stamps ? With a $16 trillion debt , credit ratings tumbling and economic growth sluggish ? <p> How could Obama be reelected with foreign affairs in a shambles -- with Al Qaida overrunning U.S. consulates and murdering U.S. ambassadors , with Iraq and Afghanistan slipping back to chaos , with terrorists dominating the misnamed Arab Spring , with Russia and China pressing their interests with no American resistance , and with Iran building nuclear weapons unhindered ? <p> Does the blame go to the Republican standard-bearers , Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ? There is something to that ; Ryan did n't carry his home state of Wisconsin , which would have brought the Republicans within striking distance of an electoral college victory . And Romney carried neither Massachusetts , the state he once governed , nor Michigan , the state his father governed . <p> But that can not be the whole answer ; Romney did very well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obama was n't a particularly dazzling candidate , and Vice President Joe Biden was universally an embarrassment . <p> So , then what ? <p> A massive , four-year get-out-the-vote campaign by the Democrats , painstakingly identifying millions of partisans and getting them to advance ballots , takes some credit . But surely Republicans know those dark arts as well as their rivals . <p> The unhappy answer -- to a conservative , and to someone who loves America for its exceptional dedication to freedom -- is that perhaps the United States has changed , and that the miraculous country envisioned by its Founding Fathers and described so beautifully by Alexis de Tocqueville has simply changed . <p> It is no longer a nation of rugged individualists , of fiercely independent men and women . It is now a nation that would not be out of place in Europe -- a welfare state , a state with the firm hand of government directing its peoples lives . Not great anymore , but good , or good enough . <p> How could New Hampshire -- motto : Live Free or Die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought in government-run health care ? But it did -- or at least that 's how it was looking at 10 p.m . ET . <p> Has America reached a tipping point , where there are simply more takers than there are makers -- and the party that casts itself so clearly with those on welfare and food stamps and hand-outs can count on the support of its clients to continue to tax and regulate the industrious class ? <p> Not since the Great Depression has an American election been so coloured with the rhetoric of class warfare and outright envy -- Obama himself declaring to an audience that voting was the best " vengeance " . Vengeance against those who arrogantly choose work rather than welfare , perhaps -- Obama never properly explained . <p> Economic malaise , even two terms of it , can be healed . Ronald Reagan proved that , as did Margaret Thatcher . Even foreign affairs debacles can be undone , again as proved by Reagan and Thatcher , though putting the Iranian nuclear genie back in the bottle is something that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity will change irrevocably -- that it will simply not want to come back from Obama 's big government mentality , that it will prefer the soft mediocrity of regulation and taxation to the bracing risks of freedom . <p> Live Free has been replaced by Free Stuff . <p> All empires come to an end . Which is a shame , because the American empire -- an empire of freedom , not coercion -- was the most noble and generous the world had seen . If the rest of the night continues on course , a re-elected President Obama will continue to preside over the 
##475852 <h> Related Links <h> Mtis <p> The term Mtis refers to a collective of cultures and ethnic identities that resulted from unions between Aboriginal and European people in what is now Canada . Mtis stems from the Latin verb misc ? re , ? to mix. ? The word initially referred to the children of these relationships , but over generations it came to refer to the distinct cultural identities these communities developed . In recent years , partially due to the Mtis rights case R. v. Powley , the word Mtis has shifted from referring to a single cultural identity produced by European-Aboriginal intermarriage across different communities , to applying to multiple identities that have arisen from diverse historical instances of Aboriginal-European heritage . <p> Mtis peoples have developed a rich material culture , which includes the recognizable Mtis sashes , intricate beadwork , moose hair tufting , Red River carts , and so on . While this section does not go into detail on the Mtis material culture and traditions , the following links are valuable resources for learning more about these ways in which Mtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that they are part of a distinctive cultural group . However , Mtis identity is frequently misinterpreted by non-Mtis to refer simply to Aboriginal-European ancestry . Mtis genesis is a vexing aspect of the discourse concerning Mtis peoples . Some researchers , such as Olive Dickason , trace Mtis origins to the policies employed by the French , whose traders were encouraged to seek marriage liaisons with Aboriginal peoples . Samuel de Champlain famously said in 1634 , ? our young men will marry your daughters , and we will be one people . " 1 This reflected the French policy of recognizing and making use of established Aboriginal trading practices , including establishing family connections through marriage , which enabled settlers to better adapt to life in a foreign land . <p> Other researchers suggest that the genesis of Mtis peoples took place in different ways at different times and places . As evidence , they point to the many and various locations that witnessed the development of Mtis communities , including communities that were not only an amalgamation of European-Aboriginal unions , but also of unions between different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal definition of ? Mtis ? as people who have continued ties to a historical Mtis community , and are accepted as such by that community . Yet Mtis identity is also adopted by some non-status Aboriginal peoples and others who have mixed Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal ancestry yet are not connected to a contemporary Mtis society . Others use Mtis as a blanket term to identify anyone with A boriginal and non-Aboriginal ancestry , regardless of how that person may self-identify . Some groups who may be identified as Mtis prefer to be called Half-Breeds ( in recognition of their English/Scottish rather than French heritage ) . Others prefer the term Otipemisiwak which is a Cree term meaning ? the people who rule themselves. ? <p> Many Mtis groups have adopted terms of identity that separate their community from other Mtis communities . An abundance of independent small-scale Mtis societies are , perhaps problematically , represented by provincial and national organizations that seek to expand and develop further recognition of Mtis rights in a collective sense . This relationship is not always mutually agreed upon or even desired by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension of academic discourse on Mtis peoples . As exemplified in the Powley case , the term Mtis has come to hold legal and political significance . In fact , Mtis rights discourse has been at the cutting edge of Aboriginal rights discourse in Canada ever since the Powley decision . The issue of Mtis identity will continue to be the topic of much debate and discussion , since Mtis rights depend on identifying the people who are entitled to such rights , and then specifying what those rights are . The navigation of legal rights and terms of identity for recognized or unrecognized Mtis peoples has been and will continue to be a major area of academic , legal , and political inquiry in Canada . And as scholars and other recognized experts revisit the role that historic Mtis communities have played in the development of Canada , there will be many contributions made towards defining and establishing Mtis rights , and celebrating the place of Mtis peoples in the Canadian landscape . <h> The Red River Mtis <p> One the best-known Mtis populations began in the Red River region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased Rupert ? s Land from the Hudson ? s Bay Company , without consulting the inhabitants of the area . The Mtis of Red River , fearing that their title and rights were being ignored , set up a National Committee of Mtis to stop the land transfer until their rights and title had been recognized . This action and the ensuing events would become known as the Red River Rebellion . Under the leadership of Louis Riel , the Mtis set up a provisional government at Red River with the goal of negotiating terms for entering into Confederation with Canada . They drafted a Mtis Bill of Rights , which was then sent to Ottawa . The Bill demanded the following rights , among others : to elect their own legislature at Red River , to elect federal Members of Parliament , to have both French and English recognized as official languages , and to maintain Mtis culture and customs . When a Canadian surveyor in Red River was tried and executed for treason by Riel ? s government , Prime Minister John A. Macdonald sent troops to assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not support Riel saw his acts as treasonable and wanted him executed . Riel fled to the United States . <p> Despite these setbacks , the Mtis provisional government won federal approval of the Manitoba Act , which took effect in 1870 and led to the creation of the province of Manitoba . The Manitoba Act recognized Mtis title to the land within the province , and Section 31 set out 1.4 million acres to be allotted to Mtis children . However , acceptance of this land explicitly extinguished their title . <p> Louis Riel returned to Red River in 1884 , and the Mtis sent a petition to Ottawa requesting title to lands already occupied by Mtis families , provincial status for Saskatchewan , Alberta , and Red River ( also known as Assiniboia ) , and better treatment of all Aboriginal peoples . The lack of satisfactory response from Canada led to the Northwest Rebellion which ended after two months . Riel was tried for treason and executed in Regina on November 16 , 1885 . The government , however , did agree to issue scrip coupons ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manitoba to the displaced Mtis . Scrip Commissions were set up and continued to issue scrip until the first decade of the twentieth century . <p> Many people think of Red River as the centre of Mtis genesis . Some scholars and experts , such as historian Arthur J. Ray , have termed this ? Red River myopia , ? as it stems from an unbalanced academic focus on Mtis communities in the Red River region . This emphasis has rendered invisible the histories of Mtis communities elsewhere in Canada . Partially due to the R. v. Powley case , which focused on Mtis of Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario , recent academic and legal research has turned to other historic Mtis communities and begun to correct the imbalance . Powley has shown that Mtis rights are defined by the local histories of Mtis communities , not by the history of Red River . Nonetheless , the Red River history is an important component of Mtis and Canadian histories . <h> Scrip <p> ? The history of scrip speculation and devaluation is a sorry chapter in our nation ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Blais 2003 2 <p> Scrip is a certificate that can be exchanged for land ( land scrip ) or for money to buy land ( money scrip ) . Scrip was used to transfer land to Mtis peoples in Canada from 1885 until the 1920s . Land scrip allotted either 160 or 240 acres to a Mtis individual . Authorities could allot the land anywhere in the province in which the scrip was issued , which caused many Mtis individuals to relocate away from ancestral territories . Because of this , some chose not receive their land at all . Money scrip certificates were worth either $160 or $240 , based on the often inaccurate assumption that land sold for roughly $1 per acre . <p> In 1872 , the Dominion Lands Act was passed , which encouraged settlement in the west by allotting farmland to settlers . The Mtis heads of household who had been denied land under the Manitoba Act were now given land in the form of scrip . Many people found the scrip system problematic and susceptible to fraud , in part because scrip had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers apart , necessitating several days of travel by each grantee . Some people sent others to redeem scrip on their behalf ; others left their scrip unclaimed . Frank Tough and Erin McGregor ? s examination of Mtis scrip in Northwest Saskatchewan uncovered that , ? of 742 land scrip coupons issued in the Claim Region , 725 were assigned to third parties , and only three coupons were converted by the grantee to a Letter Patent. ? The Mtis felt the policy of scrip infringed upon their rights and title , particularly as they waited for scrip while watching non-Mtis settle on what they viewed as their land . Many Mtis simply left Manitoba for Saskatchewan and Alberta to begin anew . In 2007 the Manitoba Mtis Federation ( MMF ) took Canada to court to claim that the Mtis never did receive the land they were promised in 1870 . They lost their case , but MMF president David Chartrand stated that he believes the judge misunderstood the nature of Aboriginal title and its application to the Mtis . The MMF plans to appeal their case to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only province to recognize Mtis title to the land . In 1938 , the Albertan government passed the Mtis Population Betterment Act . This established reserve land for Mtis communities in central Alberta , known as settlements . Initially ten settlements were established , although at present there are only eight . The largest is Paddle Prairie at 169,909 ha 4 with a 2008 population of approximately 700 people . 5 There has been a gradual transition to Mtis self-government within these settlements , starting with Mtis title recognized for 512,000 ha of land in 1989 , but the transition has also been met with challenges , such as political hurdles stemming from the failed Charlottetown Accord , and disagreements over management . 6 The benefits and drawbacks of Mtis settlements are widely debated , with arguments similar to those surrounding First Nations reserves . <h> Mtis Rights and Contemporary Mtis Issues <p> In the 1980s , with the patriation of the Constitution , Aboriginal groups wanted to ensure that Aboriginal rights would be constitutionally protected . They achieved this goal , with Aboriginal explicitly defined within Section 35 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inuit , and Mtis peoples . <p> The ensuing First Ministers Conferences set out to define these rights . The Mtis were represented within the Native Council of Canada ( NCC ) , but Mtis participants in the conferences felt that the Mtis peoples needed their own voice . In 1983 they separated from the NCC to form their own national body , the Mtis Nation of Canada ( MNC ) . The MNC identifies its role as uniting the Mtis peoples on a national level and working towards securing ? a healthy space for the Mtis Nation ? s ongoing existence within the Canadian federation . " 7 <h> R v. Powley <p> The 1982 Constitution guaranteed Aboriginal rights but did not define them . That was left to the courts . In 1998 , R. v. Powley became a major test case in the arena of Mtis rights , and the 2003 Supreme Court decision in the case remains the legal standard for determining what those rights are and who is entitled to them . Mtis lawyer Jean Teillet worked on the Powley case . She summarizes R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 , Steve and Roddy Powley killed a bull moose just outside Sault Ste. Marie , Ontario . They tagged their catch with a Mtis card and a note that read ? harvesting my meat for winter. ? The Powleys were charged with hunting moose without a license and unlawful possession of moose . In 1998 , the trial judge ruled that the Powleys have a Mtis right to hunt that is protected by s. 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . After a series of appeals by the Crown on September 19 , 2003 , the Supreme Court of Canada , in a unanimous judgment , said that the Powleys , as members of the Sault Ste. Marie Mtis community , can exercise a Mtis right to hunt that is protected by s. 35 of the Constitution . 8 <p> The courts further established the ? Powley test ? to determine what constitutes a Mtis right , much as the Van der Peet test established guidelines to determine First Nations ? constitutional rights . The Powley test has ten components that examine whether the proposed right is a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to is Mtis , what the historical time-frame of this right is , whether the right was extinguished or infringed upon , and so on . For more on the Powley test , please see our section on the Powley case . Once a right is identified , Powley further sets a process to identify who is entitled to such rights . Powley establishes that the individual must 1 ) self-identify as Mtis , 2 ) have an ancestral connection to a Mtis community , and 3 ) be accepted by that community as a member . <p> The Powley test is a continuation of the long-standing debate about who is Mtis and who is not . For example , urban Mtis are left out of the Powley decision , even though some Mtis families have lived in the city for generations . The question of who should be entitled to Mtis rights can create tensions between different Mtis communities . Yet because the Powley case forces us to re-examine these issues , it has brought a resurgence of academic and legal inquiry into Mtis identity and Mtis rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations fishing rights grow into self-governance rights , some

##489751 <p> If Lowe 's Cos . Inc. is serious about buying Rona Inc. outright , it 's going to need more than $1.8-billion . That seems to be the general consensus from analysts today , addressing the $14.50 per share proposal that American-owned Lowe 's offered up to home-grown Rona . <p> Alan Rifkin , an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. , said in a note to clients that he " would not be surprised if Lowe 's increased its bid to accelerate expansion in Canada . " When asked to name a target , he thought " up to $16 to $17 " was plausible . <h> Euro zone <p> An employee works on the assembly line of the Citroen C3 at the PSA Peugeot Citroen plant in Poissy , near Paris , in this January 27 , 2012 file picture . French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen announced 8,000 job cuts and the closure of its Aulnay assembly plant as it struggles with mounting losses at its core automotive division . Peugeot said on Thursday July 12 , 2012 the Aulnay plant near Paris , which employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of a drive to reorganize output across the company 's under-used French factories . REUTERS <h> euro zone <p> Derek Dley , a consumer products analyst at Canaccord Genuity , went a little further , saying that something in the $16 to $18 range would be reasonable . " $14.50 represents about 14 times my 2013 estimate for Rona . When you look at Canadian retail , that transaction multiple seems a little light , " he explained . Lowe 's would likely have to do better than that to generate interest from Rona 's management and shareholders . <p> Despite this , Mr. Dley downgraded the stock to " hold " today based on his assessment that the company 's valuation approached a fair point in the last few weeks and that Canadian home reno spending has been subdued because of the economy . People have less discretionary spending right now , and are generally waiting longer to renovate after they buy homes . <p> One dissenting voice was issued at RBC Capital Markets ( which covers both companies ) . A report assessed that , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to 0.5 times revenues and 8.4 times EBITDA , toward the higher end of the mid-point of the range of precedent transactions . " The valuation , it concluded , was pretty much on par with precedent-setting transactions . <p> But whether or not those higher premiums might be good for Rona , offering such an elevated multiple ( which equates to 15.4 to 17.3 times Mr. Dley 's estimated earning per share for Rona next year ) might not sit well with Lowe 's shareholders , who are holding a company that is trading at less than 12 times its forward earnings . Unless Lowe 's can be clear about why it needs Rona , such an acquisition could be hard for investors to stomach . After all , Rona is a smorgasbord of store types with space ranging from 1,000 square feet to 165,000 square feet , and this does n't seem compatible with Lowe 's strategy . <p> Analysts from RBC Capital Markets also pointed out in a recent research note that taking on such a multifaceted firm like Rona -- which has also been underperforming -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its efforts to improve its U.S. " As such , the report went on to say , the company 's investors probably would n't be pleased about the distraction . In fact , that 's putting it mildly . Shareholders are already yelling " no ! " to the deal through Lowe 's stock price which dropped by $1.49 ( U.S. ) on Tuesday . <p> Either way , Lowe 's likely knows Rona is not just going to sell off all its big boxes or Quebec stores . Lowe 's only option , if it wants to proceed , may be to pony up the cash . <p> As for a supposed bidding war between Lowe 's and the Quebec government , it 's hard to say how that could effect pricing . But analysts say if such a competition does arise , it 's pretty safe to say it will be a two-competitor match .

" button . The choices are orange , green , or white . We initialize all three choices to 1 win out of 1 try . It does n't really matter what we initialize them too , because the algorithm will adapt . So when we start out , the internal test data looks like this . <p> Orange <p> Green <p> White <p> 1/1 = 100% <p> 1/1=100% <p> 1/1=100% <p> Then a web site visitor comes along and we have to show them a button . We choose the first one with the highest expectation of winning . The algorithm thinks they all work 100% of the time , so it chooses the first one : orange . But , alas , the visitor does n't click on the button . <p> Orange <p> Green <p> White <p> 1/2 = 50% <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely wo n't show them orange , since we think it only has a 50% chance of working . So we choose Green . They do n't click . The same thing happens for several more visitors , and we end up cycling through the choices . In the process , we refine our estimate of the click through rate for each option downwards . <p> When our intrepid web developer sees this , he scratches his head . What the F* ? The orange button is the worst choice . Its font is tiny ! The green button is obviously the better one . All is lost ! The greedy algorithm will always choose it forever now ! <p> But wait , let 's see what happens if Orange is really the suboptimal choice . Since the algorithm now believes it is the best , it will always be shown . That is , until it stops working well . Then the other choices start to look better . <p> Orange <p> Green <p> White <p> 2/9 = 22% <p> 1/4=25% <p> 1/4=25% <p> After many more visits , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found , and will be shown 90% of the time . Here are some results based on an actual web site that I have been working on . We also have an estimate of the click through rate for each choice . <p> Orange <p> Green <p> White <p> 114/4071 = 2.8% <p> 205/6385=3.2% <p> 59/2264=2.6% <h> Edit : What about the randomization ? <p> I have not discussed the randomization part . The randomization of 10% of trials forces the algorithm to explore the options . It is a trade-off between trying new things in hopes of something better , and sticking with what it knows will work . There are several variations of the epsilon-greedy strategy . In the epsilon-first strategy , you can explore 100% of the time in the beginning and once you have a good sample , switch to pure-greedy . Alternatively , you can have it decrease the amount of exploration as time passes . The epsilon-greedy strategy that I have described is a good balance between simplicity and performance . Learning about the other algorithms , such as UCB , Boltzmann Exploration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but optional if you just want something that works . <h> Wait a minute , why is n't everybody doing this ? <p> Statistics are hard for most people to understand . People distrust things that they do not understand , and they especially distrust machine learning algorithms , even if they are simple . Mainstream tools do n't support this , because then you 'd have to educate people about it , and about statistics , and that is hard . Some common objections might be : <p> Showing the different options at different rates will skew the results . ( No it wo n't . You always have an estimate of the click through rate for each choice ) <p> This wo n't adapt to change . ( Your visitors probably do n't change . But if you really want to , in the reward function , multiply the old reward value by a forgetting factor ) <p> This wo n't handle changing several things at once that depend on each-other . ( Agreed . Neither will A/B testing . ) <p> I wo n't know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward it ? <h> Lawrence <p> 2012-05-29 18:33:48 <p> I 'd also love to see a startup crank this into a functional piece of code , as Leviathan mentioned . It may be 20 lines , but it 's beyond my capability . Nonetheless , I 've bookmarked this for a future project . Sounds like a much better way to A/B test . <h> Ryan <p> 2012-05-29 19:10:08 <p> Made a typo in the last example : B is favorite and has 19,000 views , A is not the favorite and has 1,000 . If B was the favorite all along , then all is good . But if A is the favorite only after reaching 1,000 views , then it takes 20,000 views to make that determination . <h> MicroAngelo <p> Ryan , I think you 've misunderstood how this method works : the percentage figure is the expectation ( probability of success ) a.k.a. click-through-rate , not the percentage of time that entry is shown . <p> In your example where A is initially unpopular , B will then be shown , but *only for as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then its expectation will very rapidly decrease until A starts getting shown again . <p> All other things being equal , this method will show you which option gives you the best CTR , which is all you really care about anyway . <h> Eduardo <p> 2012-05-29 19:48:21 <p> I do n't see the point here . The only difference is that you test only a small part of your audience . You could do that with GWO as well . Notice that GWO also drops options that do n't perform very well if you tell it to , so you do n't lose too many conversions based on the test . <p> An important feature of A/B tools is that a specific user always see the same option , so they avoid the " It was not like this yesterday " effect . <p> You should check Webtrends Optimize , that one is a really innovative tool . It not only selects the best option to your average audience but also selects the best option for different types of users , based on where they come from for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand the point you 're making in that the test that measure 's the CTR percentage and not the number the times it 's shown . The point I was trying to make is that you will see the current favorite more than you will see the non-favorites because the algorithm displays the favorite 90% of the time and a random choice of the non-favorites 10% of the time . As one of the non-favorites become more popular , it will take the place of the favorite . That 's all well and good , but that assumes that you have a reasonably good distribution of data coming in for each page . That 's why the CTR percentage only becomes valid after x number of views . After several thousand page views , you can be reasonably certain that your CTR is stable . My point is that if the data is not very well distributed , it could take a much longer time to reach the number of page views needed to make the determination . <p> This is kinda like quick sort . In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n log ( n ) ) , but in the worst case , mathematically , it 's O(n2) . I think the algorithm described above could really make great improvements over the current standard A/B testing , but anyone that uses it needs to know the pros and cons so that it can be tweaked properly . In some cases , maybe the 90-10 split could be more optimized at 20-80 or 30-70 . It really depends on what kind of data you have and finding a " sweet spot " for it . With careful analysis of the specific application , it could prove to be very powerful ... but you do have know what 's going on and make accurate assumptions about the data . The situation that I thought of where this would not be optimal is if you have a lot of data initially for on of the tests that does n't match the eventual CTR after x number of views . <h> Liviu Taloi <p> 2012-05-30 02:30:39 <p> Hi , nice approach . But there are some things to take into consideration : <p> - assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be consecvent as user pass trough more than 1 producct page , he must see always the same color of that button ; it will be confusing for that specific user to see all the rainbow colors onto the " add to cart " button . <p> - there should be also a normal/control group , an unbiased group that will receive the old version of the button ; you want to see the increase in CTR/conversions/whatever with respect to the control group ; but .. I think that somehow your approach is shorter than the one with A/B variant , where you should do at the end a follow-up test running only the winner in order to validate the result . <p> So .. it seems very nice approach , but , there are some software ( saas ) that are already doing this , not with 20 lines of code of course ( and with a lot of money ) . There are MVT or AB SaaS that instead of leaving the owner to choose from the possible winners he choose automatically the winner during the test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to test different " creatives " **28;6976;TOOLONG on different sections of a product page for example , you should write this 20 lines of code on each zone that has multiple variants to choose . So , it will be quite messy inside the script source that generates that specific web page . <p> The approach using SaaS that uses section-divs where you upload creatives/banners/images it 's easier than writing 20 lines of codes for each zone that we want to test especially if you are not a programmer , or you can not hire one for this task . The reports are also nice .. but , this programming approach you are proposing is quite cost effective I suppose . <p> Anyway it 's worthing to explore this solution . Could be more cost effective for many little A/B tests . <h> Hardi <h> jsquash <p> 2012-05-30 03:22:48 <p> Great idea but here is the one benefit from A/B testing - when testing a page your rankings will not be affected , Google say this . What about with this approach ? You sending traffic ( and thus robots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm your overall SEO strategy . <p> Of course if you not worried about SEO ( such as you have a big brand ) then great but while I do not enjoy the very simple A/B testing , I will still use it as my rankings will not be affected . <h> solecoder <h> Jason Cohen <p> 2012-05-30 10:10:15 <p> Nice post ; I like it ! <p> It 's statistically sound because it does n't manipulate the percentages ; rather it just concentrates on one of the options , in a sense making its percentage " more accurate " in the sense of developing more N. <p> When N is small for all variants , natural fluctuations will cause various options to be " best , " switching a lot , which in fact is just what you want it to do . <p> If you were concerned about being a little more statistically sound in the low-N period , you could just say " If the total number of trials is less than some threshold T , display the buttons round-robin . " That way you can set T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives all the options a " fair start . " <h> Michael Leo <p> 2012-05-30 11:14:38 <p> Steve , <p> This is an interesting approach . Thanks ! <p> When doing this , you or others might also want to consider the statistical significance of the results . Running a chi-squared test of the results on a periodic basis will begin tell you when/if the variances you are seeing are statistically significant . And it 's not stats for stats sake - there 's real benefit there . It mean that you can more quickly and confidently find your winner , stop the test and swap over to the option that performs the best . <p> I 'm not a statistician ( probably the opposite of that ) but at my last job I took an Excel spreadsheet our analytics team was using to verify the validity of test results and brought it online . It took a little digging to find the equation being run by the " chitest() " function in excel but once I did , it turned into about 50 lines of code to prep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time I 'll try to generalize that code to work with N buckets ( we were just testing A &; B ) and post it somewhere . <h> Ryan <p> 2012-05-30 11:51:05 <p> Made a typo in the last example : B is favorite and has 19,000 views , A is not the favorite and has 1,000 . If B was the favorite all along , then all is good . But if A is the favorite only after reaching 1,000 views , then it takes 20,000 views to make that determination . <h> Justin Megawarne <p> 2012-05-30 12:06:21 <p> actually , a lot of medical studies will give one group the existing life-saving drug , and the other group will receive the new life-saving drug , because of ethical concerns . ( think about it : you ca n't give sugar water to patients with a life-threatening disease . ) <h> Kurt <p> 2012-05-30 12:30:35 <p> I think the point that " This wo n't handle changing several things at once that depend on each-other. " is what kills the k-armed bandit for a lot of applications . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimodal , and the best choice is ill-defined ( it may be A for some users and B for others , C for some URLs and D for others , etc . ) . For these applications , you have to use more sophisticated ML techniques anyway . <h> ben <h> Sean Tierney <p> 2012-05-30 13:53:10 <p> Ryan , as others have pointed out GWO offers the ability to intelligently serve the winning variant more frequently . The only downside of this is that it dramatically decelerates the pace with which you can test . If you 're optimizing for immediate yield ( maybe you hit Techcrunch and are just trying to capture max signups ) this is a good strategy but if you 're optimizing for speed of learning it 's like drinking through a straw . <p> I thought Optimizely had this capability too but upon examining their interface I do n't see that feature . Anyways nice post . <h> Chris <p> 2012-05-30 14:03:10 <p> It might be interesting to write a second algorithm that determines the frequency to show sub-optimal options . Either early in the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in the trial . I suppose this could be done manually ( eliminating obvious laggers ) but sometimes bad options need to be marginalized . <h> Ben <p> 2012-05-30 14:53:06 <p> You could also work in some simulated annealing . At times when your website is busiest , you either a ) want the most reliable choice to make the most money , or b ) want the most random ones to collect the most data , quickly . Regardless , you can change the rate of random choices depending on the business of your site . <h> Wyly <p> 2012-05-30 21:28:49 <p> This has a couple of assumptions that are dangerous in a/b testing the primary being that your list or your click through are of similar entities . a/b test is largely a miss nommer in that it is a matrix based with input type being the third axis . As an example the A/B ( winner ) might be different if the input user is an attorney vs a elementary teacher . It also might vary based on day part or country or gender . <h> Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10% comes from ? When a convereged solution is found this artificial value will give an unecessary error on the result , while at the beggning it will constrain other options that are not quite first place ( but close ) . I recommond replacing this 10% value with a scale of the standard deviation . In this situation results with no correlation will all have a random chance . However once a winner begins to emerge this percentage will rapidly decrease and the winner will be selected . <h> Ryan <p> 2012-05-30 22:31:06 <p> MicroAngel , I understand the point you 're making in that the test that measure 's the CTR percentage and not the number the times it 's shown .

So if the user comes back on the same day they see the same site . But when they come back next week things change this value is easily adjusted . Same thing goes for giving them the same " add cart button style " for all pages on the site . The code can be built to be reuseable . I use . net for my sites so I went as far as just adding onto the base button , label , " banner " controls to include the random options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in CSS you do n't have to worry about presenting different pages , just different CSS style for the control at render , this keeps your SEO working perfectly fine . I usually start a new site change option with about 40% randomness and after lets say 500 results aka visists the randomness is pulled down to 20% then 10% with the favorite getting more face time . Just speeds up the curve process a bit . Where you get a few horrible clicks on a horrible option , just cause a regular visitor clicks a horrible option cause its there only means for preforming the function of the button . So a small randomness drags things on . Having a bit higher random that is then tailored downwards helps keep things moving , we don ' have months to wait after all . <p> I 've been working on a few algorthims for cross item comparision , where if click me is blue and banner is X size and the different combinations I want to test , So basically creating test sets over individual items which proves more coherent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style sheet / page design still randomly provided and measured seems to get the most time , clicks , navigation , etc and pull all of those factors in for a scorecard I know seems like a bunch of work but once you have the scripts it works for any page / site you build from then on and having it automated saves so much time down the road , and talk about great stats to provide to your clients . <h> Martin Hammerschmied <h> Frank <p> 2012-05-31 18:25:41 <p> Interesting post . <p> I built an Excel sheet that simulates this algorithm for 6 items of differing ( theoretical ) click-through rates . I also used a genetic optimization algorithm to test whether 10% is the right number for randomization . <p> Over 15k trials , I found something interesting . The average click-through rate declined ( almost linearly ) as the amount of randomization went up . Of course , then I suspected that we were losing click through 's because we could n't get to the " right " answer quickly enough . <p> But I measured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best option had it been presented to them . ( I measured this by pulling a random number for each trial and if it was small enough to clear the highest hurdle , but not small enough to clear the hurdle presented , it was an ' unnecessary loss . ' ) <p> I found that unnecessary losses stayed relatively the same for all randomization trials . That was a surprise . <p> So , try for a low randomization number . That seems to indicate that the randomization is just there in case things change . For a static set of options and static customers , no randomization gets us to the " right " answer fastest with the best average click-through rates . <p> Anyways , happy to share my spreadsheet with anyone who wants to see it . <h> Thomas <h> Wing Tang Wong <p> Very interesting . My take away from this is not that this replaces A/B testing , but rather , covers an idea for making the cyclical process of A/B **28;7006;TOOLONG to be more automatic . <p> Ie , let 's say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , banner , etc. but you only want to have a small pool at a time , ie. given a queue of ideas from your marketing/design team , the site will only make use of the ideas 3-4 at a time . As the process finds a winner over a period of time and stability is achieved(configurable) , the " losers " in the pool are kicked out and replacements are injected into the batch from the queue . <p> In this way , elements can be auto-evaluated , judged , and swapped out . I 'm sure some enterprising coder can also include a report attached to each option and put the losers in the fail bucket and add the winners to the high performer bucket . <p> And yeah , consistent display of the site for a given user . Though letting it mix things up periodically is a good thing as well ... : ) <h> Ross <p> 2012-06-01 11:19:16 <p> I think the point has been made already but you need consistency between page views , this code would n't perform that . <p> Your real point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's 50/50 or 90/10 , you will get statistical significance quicker with closer ratios andfewer variations , 90/10 with 5 different results will take a long time for smaller sites to become significant . <p> Every tool I have used allows for more than A/B ( 2 variations ) so that is n't an argument . <p> Yes people understand an even distribution , why complicate it , people are n't doing enough of this as it is , let alone making the barrier to entry higher still . <p> I work in a digital agency and people use the tools available to them , nobody here is a programmer , so they use tools like Optimizely and visual website optimzer - because they 're easy ! ! ! i cant get this over enough , simple for marketers to use &; understand is key here , the super-clever guys at google and microsoft can do whatever they like , the normal 99% of people , need simple &; easy to understand , storing data in redis or whatever is a million miles beyond their capabilities . <h> @OptimiseOrDie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought about for 2 years now . It is actually possible to build a tool which will do this and so if anyone would like to work with me on it , I 'm into being part of a team for sure . <p> There are some algorithms that will work very well to solve a big problem with A/B testing . Change . <p> Just because it did 12.5% better in 2 weeks in February does not mean it will self optimise with the CHANGE going on . So people delude themselves that they are still getting the 12.5% ( in their mind ) when in reality , they do n't know . <p> Hmmmm . <p> To solve this though , I often test after going live with 5/10% splits to verify the control performance still tracks lower . This helps to convince people who think the split or multivariate test has suddenly driven conversion rates down . <p> Extend this idea further and use an evolutionary genetic algorithm to select , test and then repeat verify against runners up , the original control and random new items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns in an evolutionary way will be far better at automatic tuning of raw assets into optimal recipes . It will also keep performing long after your last a/b test finished , and will adapt better to change sources you have little control over . <p> I want to build this ! I want to build it now ! If anyone else feels the same and can help , I 'd love to do it . <h> Nitin <h> Eric <p> 2012-06-01 15:57:24 <p> Actually I bet this could be adapted to do multiple variables at once by linking two things ( such as font size and color ) and changing them at different rates . I.E. doing the same thing for both Font Size and then color . <p> Then you 'll have a graph of each of these an an independent probability . ( I.E. how often you get blue and how often you get large font ) . Then you could also do some linking between the list to show what the other option was when it was clicked ( I.E. Blue and Large ) and then analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post : ) The system sounds really interesting . <p> Some of the hurdles to adoption that I could see would be performance-related . <p> Firstly , relatively-fresh weightings should be available to the client . That seems like it requires either making the edge-caching of your pages fairly short , or making a server-side call on many requests . <p> Currently , split-testing ( a/b/c/d/e , etc. - not sure why someone would limit to just a/b ) on high-traffic sites can determine treatment-groups using hashes of experiment ids and unique identifiers for the user from the CDN . This is what we do at Wikia . <p> Since we cache most pages for 24 hours in our CDN , we can bake experiment configurations into the page ( the weights in split-testing typically do not change over the course of a day ) . <p> Can you think of a similar way to get relatively-fresh weighting changes to the client ? Perhaps using the 24h stale weights by default and then making async requests for fresher data while the page is idle ? That seems like it should work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event needs to be logged for every active experiment every time that a user is treated ( eg : to say either that they clicked or did n't click ) . With split-testing , you only need to send a treatment-event the first time a user is treated with a new experiment and they stick in this group until the experiment ends or the configuration switches them out of it . Nothing strikes me as a good solution to that problem . Seems like you 'll have to just take that performance-hit . <p> Thanks again for the post ! Would love to hear your ideas on performance for this method : ) <h> Ed <h> IanHutchinson <p> 2012-06-18 16:13:12 <p> We are split testing the first image at the start of videos to compare impressions to click throughs . This article tells me to always set the best tracking video at 90% and the others get an even distribution of the 10% . <p> I will have to give this some more thought . Feel free to take a look at what we do - Vidyard dot com . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In recent years , hundreds of the brightest minds of modern civilization have been hard at work not curing cancer . Instead , they have been refining techniques for getting you and me to click on banner ads . <h> Anonymous Coward <p> 2012-06-30 03:10:50 <p> That 's simply trading away 10% of button displays for getting a valid statement about which one works most of the times . 10% has to be statistically relevant for the process to work ( i. e. 10% has to be a large number ) . It has to be even higher if you want to optimize up to the point where you show the orange button only to above average under 25 income females from Europe , and the green one to lower income between 25 and 50 males from South America . Large ad networks like the one operated by Google have such large numbers , and can also derive the demographic characteristics of the people doing the clicking . Smaller sites or medical trial teams do n't have such big numbers to experiment on . <h> Rick <h> LMF <p> 2012-07-06 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is maximized at an equal split . So I believe its better to run an equal split until a significant difference is determined , then send all traffic to the winner . <h> Horia Margarit <p> 2012-07-11 12:12:24 <p> Some people have pointed out the critical error with this approach . Suppose you have a sample of 20 page visits , and 19 of them landed on ugly Orange , while only 1 landed on pretty Green . Then your distribution over the expectations of clicks is 19/20 , 01/20 , 00/20 . But what if Green turns out to be the optimal choice for the population from which you are sampling ? <p> In the best possible case , you will need the next 19 page views after the 20th to display Green , and for Green to be clicked every time , for the next 19 visits in order to determine that Green is the optimal choice . This best possible case would yield a distribution over the expectations of clicks of 19/39 , 20/39 , 00/39 . How likely is it for this algorithm to display Green these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assume that a visitor will click the Green button from now on if it is present , and further assume that a visitor will no longer click the Orange or White buttons if they are present . With this simplifying assumption , we have made the probability of displaying Green on the 28th trial independent of the probability of displaying Green on the 27th trial , and so on until the 39th trial . But we only explore 10% of the time and we have two exploratory options , so the probability of displaying Green any given time is 0.05 . The probability of displaying Green the next 19 times is thus 0.0519 which equals to 19.0735 x 10-26 <p> That means that you 'd have to run through an additional 100 trillion x 1 trillion trials in order to actually display Green 19 times ! Let 's not forget about the best case assumptions : no user will ever click on White or Orange these 100 trillion x 1 trillion times , they will only click on the Green and they will do so each of the extremely rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds ! <p> Yet the algorithm works pragmatically . It works because users are Randomly in disagreement , but directionally in Agreement . In other words , this algorithm works because it 's behaviour mirrors user behaviour . Your population of users will , with some probability alpha agree on what is the best looking button or copy-edit or whatever . And with probability 1-alpha they will choose something else . But the space of something else is large , and each user will choose a different thing in that space from the others . So the critical error with this approach is actually its greatest strength . <p> It marginalizes random user disagreements to the point where they become totally insignificant . <h> Steve <p> I do n't think your scenario would ever play out . The example has all 3 buttons being initialized with a 100% " click " rate . <p> Orange could not possibly be shown 19 times in a row without it being clicked on because the algorithm displays the best possible ( i.e. highest click-ratio ) button each visit . <p> If Orange is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statistical anomaly , AND also because 19 people in a row clicked on that Orange button . <p> As soon as 1 of those people do n't click on Orange , the success rate for Orange drops below 100% and the script jumps to another colour , i.e. Green . One failure on Green and we 're on to White . One failure on White and we 're back on Orange . <p> What you 're missing is that the selection of what button gets displayed is n't random , it 's based on the success rate of what has already worked before it . <h> Ted Dunning <p> 2012-10-27 17:26:28 <p> Nice article , especially since you correctly define multi-armed bandit and correctly name epsilon-greedy . <p> It would n't hurt to describe the slightly more sophisticated algorithms based on probability matching ( search for " bayesian bandit " to find my first blog entry and check out the October posting where I give references to the original literature . The code really is n't any more complex than epsilon greedy and Bayesian Bandits dominate the performance of epsilon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also handle contextual problems which are impossible to deal with using epsilon greedy . <h> Sylvain Galibert <p> This was certainly an interesting post . That said , I do n't think it would work the way you expect in the real world for the following reasons : <p> 0 . Some form of stability must be ensured for the visitors . You can show A , then B. But you ca n't show A , B , B , A , over and over again . ( That 's the easiest problem to solve on this list ) . <p> As you say , the problem is similar to the multi-armed bandits , BUT it is NOT the same problem . There are important differences that are not taken into account in your model : <p> 1 . The number of slot machines is static , whereas the number of options to try is constantly expanding and contracting as your design evolves <p> You are NOT planning on testing 3 options endlessly . You want to test a number of variations as time goes on . Each new option goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counters every time you introduce a new button color or font , new options will be far more volatile than their established counterparts . This could result in new options dropping below the threshold of existing options long before a statistically significant sample is reached and take a very long time to resurface . I.e. : <p> To measure a large 50% improvement on a new button from an existing 2% conversion rate , you need about 2700 visitors at a 95% confidence level . But by the time you reach 100 visitors , your conversion rate could have fallen below 2% , and from that point on , how long before it receives enough visits to prove its worth . <p> 2 . On a slot machine , one lever pull is equivalent to another . It does not matter who pulls the lever , what time of the day the lever is pulled , what day of the week the lever is pulled , what period of the year it is , what website the machine was visiting before pulling the lever , etc . <p> For your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many people buy translation during the week-end ? Not too many . How many people buy toys 2 weeks before Christmas ? This method does not account for these differences . A button tested on Saturday afternoon on a translation website will be massively penalized compared to a button tested on Tuesday afternoon . Similarly , if your website gets slashdotted , you may have a sudden spike in visitors who might be either totally uninterested about buying your product ( they just want to read a cool thing you wrote ) or completely determined in signing up for your cool new service . And then there are seasonal items . Your Halloween themed " buy " button might perform quite well during Halloween , but how long will it remain to the top after Halloween ? <p> 3 . Fashion and design trends . On the web , the context changes . <p> By context , I mean overall standards and conventions in web design . That glossy button of yours that has accumulated outstanding conversion rating over time is just not " in " any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Facebook . Unless you have a mechanism to decay the value of clicks over time you will end up with " winning " options that endure when they should n't . <p> The problem here is that for this system to work , it needs to run in a controlled , static environment for a significant period of time . And you really do n't have that : <p> Imagine you are in a casino trying to run your algorithm on a wall of one armed bandits. 5 minutes after you start , a bunch of guys come in and start playing on the same machines as you . Then repairmen come and add twice as many machines . Half of those are a new model . Then they update the OS of 4 of the machines . On and on . Does it still feel like your algorithm would work in that environment ? That 's far closer to the environment in which most websites operate <p> Each time a change is introduced , you need a full reset , but this algorithm is useful only when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant result , and that makes it poorly suited for website testing , at least for most websites . It might work for huge websites where the numbers of visitors are so large that statistical significance can be reached before the context changes , with some tweaks taking into account things like the time of day/week/season , running a counter reset on unexpected variations ( if button A suddenly converts 3x as much as before when it had already been tested often enough to reach statistical significance , something is up ) <p> AB testing , on the other end , does not suffer as much from this volatile environment because it does not try to favor results before statistical significance is reached . On Sunday or at night , both A &; B suffer/benefit equally , whereas with your system , a design which might have been ahead on Friday by a large margin may loose its advance over the week-end , get overtaken on Monday , finally recover towards the end of the day only to tank again overnight . Some potentially interesting options might take a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , and possibly the most important issue here , is that it teaches us and helps us understand what is happening . After a few tries , you can work out some general rules like : " bigger buttons are better " , " fewer options are necessary for non qualified visitors , but qualified visitors ( from such and such websites ) will fill out longer forms " , " Pictures can control the attention of visitors " , etc. which can then guide your UI evolution . <p> This can be done to a point with your system , but it 's much less reliable : " A " has a conversion rate of 60% and " B " a conversion rate of 22% , but " B " has been tested 600k times in the low season and " A " has only been tested 900 times in the high season . Is " A " really better than " B " ? You ca n't really compare A and B which prevents you from learning as much as you would in AB testing . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules that work for your website . <p> Also , AB testing is more hands on which forces you to think with the data : Your Halloween button will never live through Christmas because of the fantastic sales from October/November with AB testing ( or your usual " best " button will be shown 90% of the time through Christmas because the new Christmas buttons did n't get a good enough conversion early in December and by the time they recovered from that , the Christmas buying season is over ) <p> There is this old quote - I do n't remember where it 's from or how it goes exactly , but I think it is pretty applicable here : " When trying to write software that learns by itself , you find out that it does n't ... but you do . " <p> I was n't quite planning on posting a thousand words in the comments . If you feel like responding to it , I would be happy to hear 
##516951 <p> It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that in times of yore and in years and ages long gone before , there lived in Damascus a merchant among the merchants , a wealthy man who had a son like the moon on the night of his fulness ; FN#80 and withal sweet of speech , who was named Ghnim bin ' Ayyb , surnamed the Distraught , the Thrall o ' Love . He had also a daughter , own sister to Ghanim , who was called Fitnah , a damsel unique in beauty and loveliness . Their Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her the Thirty-ninth Night , <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that the merchant left his two children abundant wealth and amongst other things an hundred loads ; FN#81 of silks and brocades , musk pods and mother o ' pearl ; and there was written on every bale , " This is of the packages intended for Baghdad , " it having been his purpose to make the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was in the time of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid . After a while his son took the loads and , bidding farewell to his mother and kindred and townsfolk , went forth with a company of merchants , putting his trust in Allah Almighty , who decreed him safety , so that he arrived without let or stay at Baghdad . There he hired for himself a fair dwelling house which he furnished with carpets and cushions , curtains and hangings ; and therein stored his bales and stabled his mules and camels , after which he abode a while resting . Presently the merchants and notables of Baghdad came and saluted him , after which he took a bundle containing ten pieces of costly stuffs , with the prices written on them , and carried it to the merchants ' bazar , where they welcomed and saluted him and showed him all honour ; and , making him dismount from his beast , seated him in the shop of the Syndic of the market , to whom he delivered the package . He opened it and , drawing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit of two diners on every diner of prime cost . At this Ghanim rejoiced and kept selling his silks and stuffs one after another , and ceased not to do on this wise for a full year . On the first day of the following year he went , as was his wont , to the Exchange which was in the bazar , but found the gate shut ; and enquiring the reason was told , " One of the merchants is dead and all the others have gone to follow his bier , ; FN#82 and why shouldst thou not win the meed of good deeds by walking with them ? " ; FN#83 He replied " Yes , " and asked for the quarter where the funeral was taking place , and one directed him thereto . So he purified himself by the Wuzu-ablution FN#84 and repaired with the other merchants to the oratory , where they prayed over the dead , then walked before the bier to the burial place , and Ghanim , who was a bashful man , followed them being ashamed to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through the tombs until they reached the grave where they found that the deceased 's kith and kin had pitched a tent over the tomb and had brought thither lamps and wax candles . So they buried the body and sat down while the readers read out and recited the Koran over the grave ; and Ghanim sat with them , being overcome with bashfulness and saying to himself " I can not well go away till they do . " They tarried listening to the Koranic perfection till nightfall , when the servants set supper and sweetmeats FN#85 before them and they ate till they were satisfied ; then they washed their hands and again took their places . But Ghanim 's mind was preoccupied with his house and goods , being in fear of robbers , and he said to himself , " I am a stranger here and supposed to have money ; if I pass the night abroad the thieves will steal my money bags and my bales to boot . " So when he could no longer control his fear he arose and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent business ; and following the signs of the road he soon came to the city gate . But it was midnight and he found the doors locked and saw none going or coming nor heard aught but the hounds baying and the wolves howling . At this he exclaimed , " There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah ! I was in fear for my property and came back on its account , but now I find the gate shut and I am in mortal fear for my life ! " Then he turned back and , looking out for a place where he could sleep till morning , presently found a Santon 's tomb , a square of four walls with a date-tree in the central court and a granite gateway . The door was wide open ; so he entered and would fain have slept , but sleep came not to him ; and terror and a sense of desolation oppressed him for that he was alone amidst the tombs . So he rose to his feet and , opening the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light afar off in the direction of the city gate ; then walking a little way towards it , he saw that it was on the road whereby he had reached the tomb . This made him fear for his life , so he hastily shut the door and climbed to the top of the date tree where he hid himself in the heart of the fronds . The light came nearer and nearer till it was close to the tomb ; then it stopped and he saw three slaves , two bearing a chest and one with a lanthorn , an adze and a basket containing some mortar . When they reached the tomb , one of those who were carrying the case said , " What aileth thee O Sawb ? " ; and said the other , " What is the matter O Kfr ? " FN#86 Quoth he , " Were we not here at supper tide and did we not leave the door open ? " " Yes , " replied the other , " that is true . ' ' " See , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How weak are your wits ! " cried the third who bore the adze and his name was Bukhayt , FN#87 " know ye not that the owners of the gardens use to come out from Baghdad and tend them and , when evening closes upon them , they enter this place and shut the door , for fear lest the wicked blackmen , like ourselves , should catch them and roast ' em and eat ' em . " FN#88 " Thou sayest sooth , " said the two others , " but by Allah , however that may be , none amongst us is weaker of wits than thou . " " If ye do not believe me , " said Bukhayt , " let us enter the tomb and I will rouse the rat for you ; for I doubt not but that , when he saw the light and us making for the place , he ran up the date tree and hid there for fear of us . " When Ghanim heard this , he said in himself , " O curstest of slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this thy craft and keenness of wit ! There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah , the Glorious , the Great ! How shall I win free of these blackamoors ? " Then said the two who bore the box to him of the adze , " Swarm up the wall and open the gate for us , O Bukhayt , for we are tired of carrying the chest on our necks ; and when thou hast opened the gate thou shalt have one of those we catch inside , a fine fat rat which we will fry for thee after such excellent fashion that not a speck of his fat shall be lost . " But Bukhayt answered , " I am afraid of somewhat which my weak wits have suggested to me : we should do better to throw the chest over the gateway ; for it is our treasure . " " If we throw it ' twill break , " replied they ; and he said , " I fear lest there be robbers within who murder folk and plunder their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and dividing their spoil . " " O thou weak o ' wits , " said both the bearers of the box , " how could they ever get in here ! " FN#89 Then they set down the chest and climbing over the wall dropped inside and opened the gate , whilst the third slave ( he that was called Bukhayt ) stood by them holding the adze , the lanthorn and the hand basket containing the mortar . After this they locked the gate and sat down ; and presently one of them said , " O my brethren , we are wearied with walking and with lifting up and setting down the chest , and with unlocking and locking the gate ; and now ' t is midnight , and we have no breath left to open a tomb and bury the box : so let us rest here two or three hours , then rise and do the job . Meanwhile each of us shall tell how he came to be castrated and all that befel him from first to last , the better to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereupon the first , he of the lanthorn and whose name was Bukhayt , said , " I 'll tell you my tale . " " Say on , " replied they ; so he began as follows the <p> Know , O my brothers , that when I was a little one , some five years old , I was taken home from my native country by a slave driver who sold me to a certain Apparitor . FN#90 My purchaser had a daughter three years old , with whom I was brought up ; and they used to make mock of me , letting me play with her and dance for her FN#91 and sing to her , till I reached the age of twelve and she that of ten ; and even then they did not forbid me seeing her . One day I went in to her and found her sitting in an inner room , and she looked as if she had just come out of the bath which was in the house ; for she was scented with essences and reek of aromatic woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fourteenth night . She began to sport with me , and I with her . Now I had just reached the age of puberty ; so my prickle stood at point , as it were a huge key . Then she threw me on my back and , mounting astraddle on my breast , fell a wriggling and a bucking upon me till she had uncovered my yard . When she saw it standing with head erect , she hent it in hand and began rubbing it upon the lips of her little slit FN#92 outside her petticoat trousers . Thereat hot lust stirred in me and I threw my arms round her , while she wound hers about my neck and hugged me to her with all her might , till , before I knew what I did , my pizzle split up her trousers and entered her slit and did away her maiden head . When I saw this , I ran off and took refuge with one of my comrades . Presently her mother came in to her ; and , seeing her in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisedly and hid it from the girl 's father out of good will to me ; nor did they cease to call to me and coax me , till they took me from where I was . After two months had passed by , her mother married her to a young man , a barber who used to shave her papa , and portioned and fitted her out of her own monies ; whilst the father knew nothing of what had passed . On the night of consummation they cut the throat of a pigeon poult and sprinkled the blood on her shift . FN#93 After a while they seized me unawares and gelded me ; and , when they brought her to her bridegroom , they made me her Agha , FN#94 her eunuch , to walk before her wheresoever she went , whether to the bath or to her father 's house . I abode with her a long time enjoying her beauty and loveliness by way of kissing and clipping and coupling with her , FN#95 till she died , and her husband and mother and father died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being the property of an intestate , and I found my way hither , where I became your comrade . This , then , O my brethren , is the cause of my cullions being cut off ; and peace be with you ! He ceased and his fellow began in these words the <p> Know , O my brothers that , when beginning service as a boy of eight , I used to tell the slave dealers regularly and exactly one lie every year , so that they fell out with one another , till at last my master lost patience with me and , carrying me down to the market , ordered the brokers to cry , " Who will buy this slave , knowing his blemish and making allowance for it ? " He did so and they asked him , " Pray , what may be his blemish ? " and he answered , " He telleth me one single lie every year . " Now a man that was a merchant came up and said to the broker , " How much do they allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred dirhams , " he replied ; and said the other , " Thou shalt have twenty dirhams for thyself . " So he arranged between him and the slave dealer who took the coin from him and the broker carried me to the merchant 's house and departed , after receiving his brokerage . The trader clothed me with suitable dress , and I stayed in his service the rest of my twelvemonth , until the new year began happily . It was a blessed season , plenteous in the produce of the earth , and the merchants used to feast every day at the house of some one among them , till it was my master 's turn to entertain them in a flower garden without the city . So he and the other merchants went to the garden , taking with them all that they required of provaunt and else beside , and sat eating and carousing and drinking till mid day , when my master , having need of some matter from his home , said to me , " O slave , mount the she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy mistress such and such a thing and return quickly . " I obeyed his bidding and started for the house but , as I drew near it , I began to cry out and shed tears , whereupon all the people of the quarter collected , great and small ; and my master 's wife and daughters , hearing the noise I was making , opened the door and asked me what was the matter . Said I , " My master was sitting with his friends beneath an old wall , and it fell on one and all of them ; and when I saw what had happened to them , I mounted the mule and came hither in haste to tell you . " When my master 's daughters and wife heard this , they screamed and rent their raiment and beat their faces , whilst the neighbours came around them . Then the wife over turned the furniture of the house , one thing upon another , and tore down the shelves and broke the windows and the lattices and smeared the walls with mud and indigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Kafur ! come help me to tear down these cupboards and break up these vessels and this china ware , FN#96 and the rest of it . " So I went to her and aided her to smash all the shelves in the house with whatever stood upon them , after which I went round about the terrace roofs and every part of the place , spoiling all I could and leaving no china in the house unbroken till I had laid waste the whole , crying out the while " Well away ! my master ! " Then my mistress fared forth bare faced wearing a head kerchief and naught else , and her daughters and the children sallied out with her , and said to me , " O Kafur , go thou before us and show us the place where thy master lieth dead , that we may take him from under the fallen wall and lay him on a bier and bear him to the house and give him a fine funeral . " So I went forth before them crying out , " Slack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and heads bare and all shrieking , " Alas ! Alas for the man ! " Now there remained none in the quarter , neither man nor woman , nor epicene , nor youth nor maid , nor child nor old trot , but went with us smiting their faces and weeping bitterly , and I led them leisurely through the whole city . The folk asked them what was the matter , whereupon they told them what they had heard from me , and all exclaimed , " There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah ! " Then said one of them , " He was a personage of consequence ; so let us go to the Governor and tell him what hath befallen him . the Governor , -- And Shahrazad perceived the dawn her permitted say . <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that when they told the Governor , he rose and mounted and , taking with him labourers , with spades and baskets , went on my track , with many people behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and casting dust on my head and beating my face , followed by my mistress and her children keening for the dead . But I got ahead of them and entered the garden before them , and when my master saw me in this state , I smiting my face and saying , " Well away ! my mistress ! Alas ! Alas ! Alas ! who is left to take pity on me , now that my mistress is gone ? Would I had been a sacrifice for her ! " , he stood aghast and his colour waxed yellow and he said to me , " What aileth thee O Kafur ! What is the matter ? " " O my lord , " I replied , " when thou sentest me to the house , I found that the saloon wall had given way and had fallen like a layer upon my mistress and her children ! " " And did not thy mistress escape ? " " No , by Allah , O my master ; not one of them was saved ; the first to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And did not my younger daughter escape ? " ; " No , she did not ! " " And what became of the mare mule I use to ride , is she safe ? " " No , by Allah , O my master , the house walls and the stable walls buried every living thing that was within doors , even to the sheep and geese and poultry , so that they all became a heap of flesh and the dogs and cats are eating them and not one of them is left alive . " " And hath not thy master , my elder son , escaped ? " " No , by Allah ! not one of them was saved , and now there is naught left of house or household , nor even a sign of them : and , as for the sheep and geese and hens , the cats and dogs have devoured them . " When my master heard this the light became night before his sight ; his wits were dazed and he so lost command of his senses that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one struck with a sudden palsy and his back was like to break . Then he rent his raiment and plucked out his beard and , casting his turband from off his head , buffeted his face till the blood ran down and he cried aloud , " Alas , my children ! Alas , my wife ! Alas , my calamity ! To whom ever befel that which hath befallen me ? " The merchants , his friends , also cried aloud at his crying and wept for his weeping and tore their clothes , being moved to pity of his case ; and so my master went out of the garden , smiting his face with such violence that from excess of pain he staggered like one drunken with wine . As he and the merchants came forth from the garden gate , behold , they saw a great cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying and lamentation ; so they looked and lo ! it was the Governor with his attendants and the townsfolk , a world of people , who had come out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all screaming and crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping . The first to address my owner were his wife and children ; and when he saw them he was confounded and laughed FN#98 and said to them , " How is it with all of you and what befel you in the house and what hath come to pass to you ? " When they saw him they exclaimed , " Praise be to Allah for thy preservation ! " and threw themselves upon him and his children hung about him crying , " Slack , our father ! Thanks to Allah for thy safety , O our father ! " And his wife said to him , " Art thou indeed well ! Laud to Allah who hath shown us thy face in safety ! " And indeed she was confounded and her reason fled when she saw him , and she asked , " O , my lord , how didst thou escape , thou and thy friends the merchants ? " ; and he answered her , " And how fared it with thee in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , whole and healthy , nor hath aught of evil befallen us in the house , save that thy slave Kafur came to us , bareheaded with torn garments and howling , ' Alas , the master ! Alas the master ! ' So we asked him , ' What tidings , O Kafur ? ' and he answered ' A wall of the garden hath fallen on my master and his friends the merchants , and they are all crushed and dead ! ' ' ' " By Allah , " said my master , " he came to me but now howling , ' Alas , my mistress ! Alas , the children of the mistress ! ' , and said , ' My mistress and her children are all dead , every one of them ! ' " Then he looked round and seeing me with my turband rent in rags round my neck , howling and weeping with exceeding weeping and throwing dust upon my head , he cried out at me . So I came to him and he said , " Woe to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O thou damned breed ! What mischief thou hast wrought ? By Allah ! I will flog thy skin from thy flesh and cut thy flesh from thy bones ! " I rejoined , " By Allah , thou canst do nothing of the kind with me , O my lord , for thou boughtest me with my blemish ; and there are honest men to bear witness against thee that thou didst so accepting the condition , and that thou knewest of my fault which is to tell one lie every year . Now this is only a half lie , but by the end of the year I will tell the other half , then will the lie stand whole and complete . " " O dog , son of a dog ! " , cried my master , " O most accursed of slaves , is this all of it but a half lie ? Verily if it be a half lie ' t is a whole calamity ! Get thee from me , thou art free in the face of Allah ! " " By Allah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not free thee till my year is completed and I have told thee the half lie which is left . When this is done , go down with me to the slave market and sell me as thou boughtest me to whoso will buy me with my blemish ; but thou shalt not manumit me , for I have no handicraft whereby to gain my living ; FN#99 and this my demand is a matter of law which the doctors have laid down in the Chapter of Emancipation . " FN#100 While we were at these words , up came the crowd of people , and the neighbours of the quarter , men , women and children , together with the Governor and his suite offering condolence . So my master and the other merchants went up to him and informed him of the adventure , and how this was but a half lie , at which all wondered , deeming it a whole lie and a big one . And they cursed me and reviled me , while I stood laughing and grinning at them , till at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he bought me with this my blemish ? " Then my master returned home and found his house in ruins , and it was I who had laid waste the greater part of it , FN#101 having broken things which were worth much money , as also had done his wife , who said to him , " ' T was Kafur who broke the vessels and chinaware . " Thereupon his rage redoubled and he struck hand upon hand exclaiming , " By Allah ! in my life never saw I a whoreson like this slave ; and he saith this is but a half lie ! How , then , if he had told me a whole lie ? He would ruin a city , aye or even two . " Then in his fury he went to the Governor , and they gave me a neat thing in the bastinado-line and made me eat stick till I was lost to the world and a fainting fit came on me ; and , whilst I was yet senseless , they brought the barber who docked me and gelded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself a clean eunuch with nothing left , and my master said to me , " Even as thou hast burned my heart for the things I held dearest , so have I burnt thy heart for that of thy members whereby thou settest most store ! " Then he took me and sold me at a profit , for that I was become an eunuch . And I ceased not bringing trouble upon all , wherever I was sold , and was shifted from lord to lord and from notable to notable , being sold and being bought , till I entered the palace of the Commander of the Faithful . But now my spirit is broken and my tricks are gone from me , so alas ! are my ballocks . When the two slaves heard his history , they laughed at him and chaffed him and said , " Truly thou art skite FN#103 and skite-son ! Thou liedest an odious lie . " Then quoth they to the third slave , " Tell us thy tale . " " O sons of my uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is idle : I will tell you the cause of my losing my testicles , and indeed I deserved to lose even more , for I futtered both my mistress and my master 's eldest son and heir : but my story is a long one and this is not the time to tell it ; for the dawn , O my cousins , draweth near and if morning come upon us with this chest still unburied , we shall get into sore disgrace and our lives will pay for it . So up with you and open the door and , when we get back to the palace , I will tell you my story and the cause of my losing my precious stones . " Then he swarmed up and dropped down from the wall inside and opened the door , so they entered and , setting down the lantern , dug between four tombs a hole as long as the chest and of the same breadth . Kafur plied the spade and Sawab removed the earth by baskets full till they reached the depth of the stature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole and threw back the earth over it : then they went forth and shutting the door disappeared from Ghanim 's eyes . When all was quiet and he felt sure that he was left alone in the place , his thought was busied about what the chest contained and he said to himself , " Would that I knew the contents of that box ! " However , he waited till day broke , when morning shone and showed her sheen : whereupon he came down from the date tree and scooped away the earth with his hands , till the box was laid bare and disengaged from the ground . Then he took a large stone and hammered at the lock till he broke it and , opening the lid , behold a young lady , a model of beauty and loveliness , clad in the richest of garments and jewels of gold and such necklaces of precious stones that , were the Sultan 's country evened with them , it would not pay their price . She had been drugged with Bhang , but her bosom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed . When Ghanim saw her , he knew that some one had played her false and hocussed her ; so he pulled her out of the chest and laid her on the ground with her face upwards . As soon as she smelt the breeze and the air entered her nostrils , mouth and lungs , she sneezed and choked and coughed ; when there fell from out her throat a pill of Cretan Bhang , had an elephant smelt it he would have slept from night to night . Then she opened her eyes and glancing around said , in sweet voice and gracious words , " Woe to thee O wind ! there is naught in thee to satisfy the thirsty , nor aught to gratify one whose thirst is satisfied ! Where is Zhar al-Bostan ? " But no one answered her , so she turned her and cried out , " Ho Sabhah ! Shajarat al-Durr ! Nr al-Hud ! Najmat al-Subh ! be ye awake ? Shahwah , Nuzhab , Halw , Zarfah , out on you , speak ! FN#105 ' ' But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Woe 's me ! have they entombed me in the tombs ? O Thou who knowest what man 's thought enwombs and who givest compensation on the Day of Doom , who can have brought me from amid hanging screens and curtains veiling the Harim rooms and set me down between four tombs ? " All this while Ghanim was standing by : then he said to her , " O my lady , here are neither screened rooms nor palace Harims nor yet tombs ; only the slave henceforth devoted to thy love , Ghanim bin Ayyub , sent to thee by the Omniscient One above , that all thy troubles He may remove and win for thee every wish that cloth behove ! " Then he held his peace . She was reassured by his words and cried , " I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God ! " ; then she turned to Ghanim and , placing her hands before her face , said to him in the sweetest speech , " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am now come to myself . " " O my lady , " he replied , " three slave eunuchs came here bearing this chest ; " and related to her the whole of what had befallen him , and how evening having closed upon him had proved the cause of her preservation , otherwise she had died smothered . FN#106 Then he asked her who she was and what was her story , and she answered , " O youth , thanks be to Allah who hath cast me into the hands of the like of thee ! But now rise and put me back into the box ; then fare forth upon the road and hire the first camel driver or muleteer thou findest to carry it to thy house . When I am there , all will be well and I will tell thee my tale and acquaint thee with my adventures , and great shall be thy gain by means of me . " At this he rejoiced and went outside the tomb . The day was now dazzling bright and the firmament shone with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired a man with a mule and , bringing him to the tomb , lifted the chest wherein he had put the damsel and set it on the mule . Her love now engrossed his heart and he fared homeward with her rejoicing , for that she was a girl worth ten thousand gold pieces and her raiment and ornaments would fetch a mint of money . As soon as he arrived at his house he carried Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted the Forty-first night , <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that when Ghanim son of Ayyub arrived with the chest at his house , he opened it and took out the young lady , who looked about her and , seeing that the place was handsome , spread with carpets and dight with cheerful colours and other deckings ; and noting the stuffs up piled and packed bales and other else than that , knew that he was a substantial merchant and a man of much money . There upon she uncovered her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair youth ; so when she saw him she loved him and said , " O my lord , bring us something to eat . " " On my head and mine eyes ! " replied he ; and , going down to the bazar , bought a roasted lamb and a dish of sweetmeats and with these dry fruits and wax candles , besides wine and whatsoever was required of drinking materials , not forgetting perfumes . With all this gear he returned to the house ; and when the damsel saw him she laughed and kissed him and clasped his neck . Then she began caressing him , which made his love wax hotter till it got the mastery of his heart . They ate and drank and each had conceived the fondest affection ; for indeed the two were one in age and one in loveliness ; and when night came on Ghanim bin Ayyub , the Distraught , the Thrall o ' Love , rose and lit the wax candles and lamps till the place blazed with light ; FN#107 after which he produced the wine service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and she , and he kept filling and giving her to drink , and she kept filling and giving him to drink , and they played and toyed and laughed and recited verses ; whilst their joy increased and they dove in closer love each to each ( glory be to the Uniter of Hearts ! ) . They ceased not to carouse after this fashion till near upon dawn when drowsiness overcame them and they slept where they were , apart each from other , till the morning . FN#108 Then Ghanim arose and going to the market , bought all they required of meat and vegetables and wine and what not , and brought them to the house ; whereupon both sat down to eat and ate their sufficiency , when he set on wine . They drank and each played with each , till their cheeks flushed red and their eyes took a darker hue and Ghanim 's soul longed to kiss the girl and to lie with her and he said , " O my lady , grant me one kiss of that dear mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . " " O Ghanim , " replied she , " wait till I am drunk and dead to the world ; then steal a kiss of me , secretly and on such wise that I may not know thou hast kissed me . " Then she rose and taking off her upper dress sat ; in a thin shift of fine linen and a silken head kerchief . FN#109 At this passion inflamed Ghanim and he said to her , " O my lady , wilt thou not vouchsafe me what I asked of thee ? " " By Allah , " she replied , " that may not be thine , for there is written upon my trouser string FN#110 a hard word ! " Thereupon Ghanim 's heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties ; and he improvised these verses , <p> " I asked the author of mine ills * To heal the wound with one sweet kiss : No ! No ! she cried , FN#111 for ever no ! * But I , soft whispering , urged yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * When smiles shall pardon thine amiss : By force , cried I ? Nay , she replied * With love and gladness eke I wis . Now ask me not what next occurred * Seek grace of God and whist of this ! Deem what thou wilt of us , for love * By calumnies the sweeter is Nor after this care I one jot * Whether my foe be known or not . " <p> Then his affection increased and love fires rose hotter in his heart , while she refused herself to him saying , " Thou canst not possess me . " They ceased not to make love and enjoy their wine and wassail , whilst Ghanim was drowned in the sea of love and longing ; but she redoubled in coyness and cruelty till the night brought on the darkness and let fall on them the skirts of sleep . Thereupon Ghanim rose and lit the lamps and wax candles and refreshed the room and removed the table ; then he took her feet and kissed them and , finding them like fresh cream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " O my lady , take pity on one thy love hath ta'en and thine eyes hath slain ; for indeed I were heart whole but for thy bane ! " And he wept somewhat . " O my lord , and light of my eyes , " quoth she , " by Allah , I love thee in very sooth and I trust to thy truth , but I know that I may not be thine . " " And what is the obstacle ? " asked he ; when she answered , " Tonight I will tell thee my tale , that thou mayst accept my excuse . " Then she threw herself upon him and winding her arms like a necklace about his neck , kissed him and caressed him and promised him her favours ; and they ceased not playing and laughing till love get the firmest hold upon both their hearts . And so it continued a whole month , both passing the night on a single carpet bed , but whenever he would enjoy her , she put him off ; whilst mutual love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One night , as he lay by her side , and both were warm with wine Ghanim passed his hand over her breasts and stroked them ; then he slipped it down to her waist as far as her navel . She awoke and , sitting up , put her hand to her trousers and finding them fast tied , once more fell asleep . Presently , he again felt her and sliding his hand down to her trouser string , began pulling at it , whereupon she awoke and sat upright . Ghanim also sat up by her side and she asked him , " What dost thou want ? " " I want to lie with thee , " he answered , " and that we may deal openly and frankly with each other . " Quoth she , " I must now declare to thee my case , that thou mayst know my quality ; then will my secret be disclosed to thee and my excuse become manifest to thee . " Quoth he , " So be it ! " Thereat she opened the skirt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , " O my lord , read what is worked on the flat of this string : " so he took it in hand , and saw these words broidered on it in gold , " I AM THINE , AND THOU ART MINE , O COUSIN OF THE APOSTLE ! ' ' FN#113 When he read this , he withdrew his hand and said to her , " Tell me who thou art ! " " So be it , " answered she ; " know that I am one of the concubines of the Commander of the Faithful , and my name is Kt al-Kulb the Food of Hearts . I was brought up in his palace and , when I grew to woman 's estate , he looked on me and , noting what share of beauty and loveliness the Creator had given me , loved me with exceeding love , and assigned me a separate apartment , and gave me ten slave girls to wait on me and all these ornaments thou seest me wearing . On a certain day he set out for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the slave girls in my service and said to her , ' I have something to require of thee . ' ' What is it , O my lady ? ' asked she and the Caliph 's wife answered , ' When thy mistress Kut al-Kulub is asleep , put this piece of Bhang into her nostrils or drop it into her drink , and thou shalt have of me as much money as will satisfy thee . ' ' With love and gladness ; ' replied the girl and took the Bhang from her , being a glad woman because of the money and because aforetime she had been one of Zubaydah 's slaves . So she put the Bhang in my drink , and when it was night drank , and the drug had no sooner settled in my stomach than I fell to the ground , my head touching my feet , and knew naught of my life but that I was in another world . When her device succeeded , she bade put me in this chest , and secretly brought in the slaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when thou wast perched upon the date tree , she sent the blacks to do with me as thou sawest . So my delivery was at thy hands , and thou broughtest me to this house and hast entreated me honourably and with thy kindest . This is my story , and I wot not what is become of the Caliph during my absence . Know then my condition and divulge not my case . " When Ghanim heard her words and knew that she was a concubine of the Caliph , he drew back , for awe of the Caliphate beset him , and sat apart from her in one of the corners of the place , blaming himself and brooding over his affair and patiencing his heart bewildered for love of one he could not possess . Then he wept for excess of longing , and plained him of Fortune and her injuries , and the world and its enmities ( and praise be to Him who causeth generous hearts to be troubled with love and the beloved , and who endoweth not the minds of the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain-weight ! ) . So he began repeating , <p> " The lover 's heart for his beloved must meet * Sad pain , and from her charms bear sore defeat : What is Love 's taste ? They asked and answered I , * Sweet is the taste but ah ! ' t is bitter sweet . " <p> Thereupon Kut al-Kulub arose and took him to her bosom and kissed him ; for the love of him was firm fixed in her heart , so that she disclosed to him her secret and all the affection she felt ; and , throwing her arms round Ghanim 's neck like a collar of pearls , kissed him again and yet again . But he held off from her in awe of the Caliph . Then they talked together a long while ( and indeed both were drowned in the sea of their mutual love ) ; and , as the day broke , Ghanim rose and donned his clothes and going to the bazar , as was his wont , took what the occasion required and returned home . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked herself and , smiling through her tears , said , " Thou hast desolated me , O beloved of my heart . By Allah , this hour of absence hath been to me like a year ! FN#114 I have explained to thee my condition in the excess of my eager love for thee ; so come now near me , and forget the past and have thy will of me . " But he interrupted her crying , " I seek refuge with Allah ! This thing may never be . How shall the dog sit in the lion 's stead ? What is the lord 's is unlawful to the slave ! " So he with-drew from her , and sat down on a corner of the mat . Her passion for him increased with his forbearance ; so she seated herself by his side and caroused and played with him , till the two were flushed with wine , and she was mad for her own dishonour . Then she sang these verses , <p> " The lover 's heart is like to break in twain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O thou who fliest me sans fault of mine , * Gazelles are wont at times prove tame to men : Absence , aversion , distance and disdain , * How shall young lover all these ills sustain ? " <p> Thereupon Ghanim wept and she wept at his weeping , and they ceased not drinking till nightfall , when he rose and spread two beds , each in its place . " For whom is this second bed ? " asked she , and he answered her , " One is for me and the other is for thee : from this night forth we must not sleep save thus , for that which is the lord 's is unlawful to the thrall . " " O my master ! " cried she , " let us have done with this , for all things come to pass by Fate and Fortune . " But he refused , and the fire was lighted in her heart and , as her longing waxed fiercer , she clung to him and cried , " By Allah , we will not sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he replied and prevailed against her and lay apart till the morning , when love and longing redoubled on her and distraction and eager thirst of passion . They abode after this fashion three full told months , which were long and longsome indeed , and every time she made advances to him , he would refuse himself and say , " Whatever belongeth to the master is unlawful to the man . " Now when time waxed tiresome and tedious to her and anguish and distress grew on her , she burst out from her oppressed heart with these verses , <p> " How long , rare beauty ! wilt do wrong to me ? * Who was it bade thee not belong to me ? With outer charms thou weddest inner grace * Comprising every point of piquancy : Passion thou hast infused in every heart , * From eyelids driven sleep by deputy : Erst was ( I wet ) the spray made thin of leaf . * O Cassia spray ! Unlief thy sin I see : FN#115 The hart erst hunted I : how is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hart ! ) by thee ? Wondrouser still I tell thee aye that I * Am trapped while never up to trap thou be ! Ne'er grant my prayer ! For if I grudge thyself * To thee , I grudge my me more jealously And cry so long as life belong to me , * Rare beauty how , how long this wrong to me ? " <p> They abode in this state a long time , and fear kept Ghanim aloof from her . So far concerning these two ; but as regards the Lady Zubaydah , when , in the Caliph 's absence she had done this deed by Kut al-Kulub she became perplexed , saying to herself , " What shall I tell my cousin when he comes back and asks for her ? What possible answer can I make to him ? " Then she called an old woman , who was about her and discovered her secret to her saying , " How shall I act seeing that Kut al-Kulub died by such untimely death ? " " O my lady , " quoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's return is near ; so do thou send for a carpenter and bid him make thee a figure of wood in the form of a corpse . We will dig a grave for it midmost the palace and there bury it : then do thou build an oratory over it and set therein lighted candles and lamps , and order each and every in the palace to be clad in black . FN#116 Furthermore command thy handmaids and eunuchs as soon as they know of the Caliph 's returning from his journey , to spread straw over the vestibule floors and , when the Commander of the Faithful enters and asks what is the matter , let them say : -- Kut al-Kulub is dead , and may Allah abundantly compensate thee for the loss of her ! FN#117 ; and , for the high esteem in which she was held of our mistress , she hath buried her in her own palace . When he hears this he will weep and it shall be grievous to him ; then will he cause perfections of the Koran to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb . Should he say to himself , ' Verily Zubaydah , the daughter of my uncle , hath compassed in her jealousy the death of Kut al-Kulub ' ; or , if love longing overcome him and he bid her be taken out of her tomb , fear thou not ; for when they dig down and come to the image in human shape he will see it shrouded in costly grave clothes ; and , if he wish to take off the winding sheet that he may look upon her , do thou forbid him or let some other forbid him , saying , ' The sight of her nakedness is unlawful . ' The fear of the world to come will restrain him and he will believe that she is dead and will restore the figure to its place and thank thee for thy doings ; and thus thou shalt escape , please Almighty Allah , from this slough of despond . " When the Lady Zubaydah heard her words , she commended the counsel and gave her a dress of honour and a large sum of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the old woman set about the business forthright and bade the carpenter make her the afore said image ; and , as soon as it was finished , she brought it to the Lady Zubaydah , who shrouded it and buried it and built a sepulchre over it , wherein they lighted candles and lamps , and laid down carpets about the tomb . Moreover she put on black and she spread abroad in the Harim that Kut al-Kulub was dead . After a time the Caliph returned from his journey and went up to the palace , thinking only of Kut al-Kulub . He saw all the pages and eunuchs and handmaids habited in black , at which his heart fluttered with extreme fear ; and , when he went in to the Lady Zubaydah , he found her also garbed in black . So he asked the cause of this and they gave him tidings of the death of Kut al-Kulub , whereon he fell a swooning . As soon as he came to himself , he asked for her tomb , and the Lady Zubaydah said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that for especial honour I have buried her in my own palace . " Then he repaired in his travelling garb FN#118 to the tomb that he might wail over her , and found the carpets spread and the candles and lamps lighted . When he saw this , he thanked Zubaydah for her good deed and abode perplexed , halting between belief and unbelief till at last suspicion overcame him and he gave order to open the grave and take out the body . When he saw the shroud and would have removed it to look upon her , the fear of Allah Almighty restrained him , and the old woman ( taking advantage of the delay ) said , " Restore her to her place . " Then he sent at once for Fakirs and Koran readers , and caused perfections to be made over her tomb and sat by the side of the grave , weeping till he fainted ; and he continued to frequent the tomb and And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her the Forty-second Night , <p> She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caliph ceased not to frequent the tomb for the period of a whole month , at the end of which time it so happened one day that he entered the Serraglio , after dismissing the Emirs and Wazirs , and lay down and slept awhile ; and there sat at his head a slave girl fanning him , and at his feet a second rubbing and shampooing them . Presently he awoke and , opening his eyes , shut them again and heard the handmaid at his head saying to her who was at his feet , " A nice business this , O Khayzarn ! " and the other answered her " Well , O Kazb al-Bn ? " FN#119 " Verily " said the first , " our lord knoweth naught of what hath happened and sitteth waking and watching by a tomb wherein is only a log of wood carved by the carpenter 's art . " " And Kut al-Kulub , " quoth the other , " what hath befallen her ? " She replied , " Know that the Lady Zubaydah sent a pellet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drug her ; and when sleep overpowered her she let put her in a chest , and ordered Sawab and Kafur and Bukhayt to throw her amongst the tombs . " " What dost thou say , O Kazib al-Ban ; " asked Khayzaran , " is not the lady Kut al-Kulub dead ? " " Nay , by Allah ! " she answered " and long may her youth be saved from death ! but I have heard the Lady Zubaydah say that she is in the house of a young merchant named Ghanim bin Ayyub of Damascus , highs the Distraught , the Thrall o ' Love ; and she hath been with him these four months , whilst our lord is weeping and watching by night at a tomb wherein is no corpse . " They kept on talking this sort of talk , and the Caliph gave ear to their words ; and , by the time they had ceased speaking , he knew right well that the tomb was a feint and a fraud , and that Kut al-Kulub had been in Ghanim 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger and rising up , he summoned the Emirs of his state ; and his Wazir Ja'afar the Barmaki came also and kissed the ground between his hands . The Caliph said to him in fury , " Go down , O Ja'afar , with a party of armed men and ask for the house of Ghanim son of Ayyub : fall upon it and spoil it and bring him to me with my slave girl , Kut al-Kulub , for there is no help but that I punish him ! " " To hear is to obey , " said Ja'afar ; and setting out with the Governor and the guards and a world of people , repaired to Ghanim 's house . Now about that time the youth happened to have brought back a pot of dressed meat and was about to put forth his hand to eat of it , he and Kut al-Kulub , when the lady , happening to look out saw calamity surrounding the house on every side ; for the Wazir and the Governor , the night guard and the Mamelukes with swords drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black . At this she knew that tidings of her had reached the Caliph , her lord ; and she made sure of ruin , and her colour paled and her fair features changed and her favour faded . Then she turned to Ghanim and said to him , " O my love ! fly for thy life ! " " What shall I do , " asked he , " and whither shall I go , seeing that my money and means of maintenance are all in this house ? " ; and she answered , " Delay not lest thou be slain and lose life as well as wealth . " " O my loved one and light of mine eyes ! " he cried , " how shall I do to get away when they have surrounded the house ? " Quoth she , " Fear not ; " and , stripping off his fine clothes , dressed him in ragged old garments , after which she took the pot and , putting in it bits of broken bread and a saucer of meat , FN#120 placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head said , " Go out in this guise and fear not for me who wotteth right well what thing is in my hand for the Caliph . " FN#121 So he went out amongst them , bearing the basket with its contents , and the Protector vouchsafed him His protection and he escaped the snares and perils that beset him , by the blessing of his good conscience and pure conduct . Meanwhile Ja'afar dismounted and entering the house , saw Kut al-Kulub who had dressed and decked herself in splendid raiments and ornaments and filled a chest with gold and jewellery and precious stones and rarities and what else was light to bear and of value rare . When she saw Ja'afar come in , she rose and , kissing the ground before him , said , " O my lord , the Reed hath written of old the rede which Allah decreed ! ' ' FN#122 " By Allah , O my lady , " answered Ja'afar , " he gave me an order to seize Ghanim son of Ayyub ; " and she rejoined , " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out therewith for Damascus and I know nothing more of him ; but I desire thee take charge of this chest and deliver it to me in the Harim of the Prince of the Faithful . " " Hearing and obedience , " said Ja'afar , and bade his men bear it away to the head quarters of the Caliphate together with Kut al-Kulub , commanding them to entreat her with honour as one in high esteem . They did his bidding after they had wrecked and plundered Ghanim 's house . Then Ja'afar went in to the Caliph and told him all that had happened , and he ordered Kut al-Kulub to be lodged in a dark chamber and appointed an old women to serve her , feeling convinced that Ghanim had debauched her and slept with her . Then he wrote a mandate to the Emir Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni , his viceroy in Damascus , to this effect : " The instant thou shalt receive this our letter , seize upon Ghanim bin Ayyub and send him to us . " When the missive came to the viceroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then he let proclaim in the bazars , " Whoso is desirous to plunder , away with him to the house of Ghanim son of Ayyub . " FN#123 So they flocked thither , when they found that Ghanim 's mother and sister had built him a tomb FN#124 in the midst of the house and sat by it weeping for him ; whereupon they seized the two without telling them the cause and , after spoiling the house , carried them before the viceroy . He questioned them concerning Ghanim and both replied , " For a year or more we have had no news of him . " So they restored them to their place . Thus far concerning them ; but as regards Ghanim , when he saw his wealth spoiled and his ruin utterest he wept over himself till his heart well nigh brake . Then he fared on at random till the last of the day , and hunger grew hard on him and walking wearied him . So coming to a village he entered a mosque FN#125 where he sat down upon a mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sank to the ground in his extremity of famine and fatigue . There he lay till dawn , his heart fluttering for want of food ; and , owing to his sweating , the lice FN#126 coursed over his skin ; his breath waxed fetid and his whole condition was changed . When the villagers came to pray the dawn prayer , they found him prostrate , ailing , hunger lean , yet showing evident signs of former affluence . As soon as prayers were over , they drew near him ; and , understanding that he was starved with hunger and cold , they gave him an old robe with ragged sleeves and said to him , " O stranger , whence art thou and what sickness is upon thee ? " He opened his eyes and wept but returned no answer ; whereupon one of them , who saw that he was starving , brought him a saucer of honey and two barley scones . He ate a little and they sat with him till sun rise , when they went to their work . He abode with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weakliness grew upon him ; and they wept for him and , pitying his condition , took counsel with one another upon his case and agreed to forward him to the hospital in Baghdad . FN#127 Meanwhile behold , two beggar women , who were none other than Ghanim 's mother and sister , FN#128 came into the mosque and , when he saw them , he gave them the bread that was at his head ; and they slept by his side that night but he knew them not . Next day the villagers brought a camel and said to the cameleer , " Set this sick man on thy beast and carry him to Baghdad and put him down at the Spital door ; so haply he may be medicined and be healed and thou shalt have thy hire . " FN#129 " To hear is to comply , " said the man . So they brought Ghanim , who was asleep , out of the mosque and set him , mat and all , on the camel ; and his mother and sister came out among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . However , after looking at him and considering him carefully they said , " Of a truth he favours our Ghanim , poor boy ! ; can this sick man be he ? " Presently , he woke and finding himself bound with ropes on a camel 's back , he began to weep and complain , FN#130 and the village people saw his mother and sister weeping over him , albeit they knew him not . Then they fared forth for Baghdad , but the camel-man forewent them and , setting Ghanim down at the Spital gate , went away with his beast . The sick man lay there till dawn and , when the folk began to go about the streets , they saw him and stood gazing on him , for he had become as thin as a toothpick , till the Syndic of the bazar came up and drove them away from him , saying , " I will gain Paradise through this poor creature ; for if they take him into the Hospital , they will kill him in a single day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house , where they spread him a new bed with a new pillow , FN#132 and he said to his wife , " Tend him carefully ; " and she replied , " Good ! on my head be it ! " Thereupon she tucked up her sleeves and warming some water , washed his hands , feet and body ; after which she clothed him in a robe belonging to one of her slave girls and made him drink a cup of wine and sprinkled rose wafer over him . So he revived and complained , and the thought of his beloved Kut al-Kulub made his grief redouble . Thus far concerning him ; but as regards Kut al-Kulub , when Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her the Forty-third Night , <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that when the Caliph was angered against Kut al-Kulub , he ordered her to a dark chamber where she abode eighty days , at the end of which the Caliph , happening to pass on a certain day the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she ceased reciting her verse , saying , " O my darling , O my Ghanim ! how great is thy goodness and how chaste is thy nature ! thou didst well by one who did ill by thee and thou guardedst his honour who garred thine become dishonour , and his Harim thou didst protect who to enslave thee and shine did elect ! But thou shalt surely stand , thou and the Commander of the Faithful , before the Just Judge , and thou shalt be justified of him on the Day when the Lord ( to whom be honour and glory ! ) shall be Kazi and the Angels of Heaven shall be witnesses ! " When the Caliph heard her com plaint , he knew that she had been wronged and , returning to the palace , sent Masrur the Eunuch for her . She came before him with bowed head and eyes tearful and heart sorrowful ; and he said to her , " O Kut al-Kulub , I find thou accuses me of tyranny and oppression , and thou avouches that I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this who hath guarded my honour while I garred his become dishonour ? Who protected my Harim and whose Harim I wrecked ? " " He is Ghanim son of Ayyub , " replied she , " for he never approached me in wantonness or with lewd intent , I swear by thy munificence , O Commander of the Faithful ! " Then said the Caliph , " There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah ! Ask what thou wilt of me , O Kut al-Kulub . " " O Prince of the Faithful ! " , answered she , " I require of thee only my beloved Ghanim son of Ayyub . " He did as she desired , whereupon she said , " O Lord of the Moslems , if I bring him to thy presence , wilt thou bestow me on him ? " ; and he replied , " If he come into my presence , I will give thee to him as the gift of the generous who revoketh not his largesse . " " O Prince of True Believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seek him ; haply Allah may unite me with him : " and quoth he , " Do even as thou wilt . " So she rejoiced and , taking with her a thousand diners in gold , went out and visited the elders of the various faiths and gave alms in Ghanim 's name . FN#133 Next day she walked to the merchants ' bazar and disclosed her object to the Syndic and gave him money , saying , " Bestow this in charity to the stranger ! " On the following Friday she fared to the bazar ( with other thousand diners ) and , entering the goldsmiths ' and jewellers ' market street , called the Chief and presented to him a thousand diners with these words , " Bestow this in charity to the stranger ! " The Chief looked at her ( and he was the Syndic who had taken in Ghanim ) and said , " O my lady , wilt thou come to my house and look upon a youth , a stranger I have there and see how goodly and graceful he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ayyub , but the Chief had no knowledge of him and thought him to be some wandering pauper , some debtor whose wealth had been taken from him , or some lover parted from his beloved . When she heard his words her heart fluttered FN#134 and her vitals yearned , and she said to him , " Send with me one who shall guide me to thy house . " So he sent a little lad who brought her to the house wherein was the head man 's stranger guest and she thanked him for this . When she reached the house , she went in and saluted the Syndic 's wife , who rose and kissed the ground between her hands , for she knew her . Then quoth Kut al-Kulub , " Where is the sick man who is with thee ? " She wept and replied , " Here is he , O my lady ; by Allah , he is come of good folk and he beareth the signs of gentle breeding : you see him lying on yonder bed . " So she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but he was worn and wasted till he had become lean as a toothpick , so his identity was doubtful to her and she could not be certain that it was he . Yet pity for him possessed her and she wept saying , " Verily the stranger is unhappy , even though he be a prince in his own land ! " ; and his case was grievous to her and her heart ached for him , yet she knew him not to be Ghanim . Then she furnished him with wine and medicines and she sat awhile by his head , after which she mounted and returned to her palace and continued to visit every bazar in quest of her lover . Meanwhile Ghanim 's mother and sister Fitnah arrived at Baghdad and met the Syndic , who carried them to Kut al-Kulub and said to her , " O Princess of beneficent ladies , there came to our city this day a woman and her daughter , who are fair of favour and signs of good breeding and dignity are apparent in them , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet hanging to her neck ; and their eyes are tearful and their hearts are sorrowful . So I have brought them to thee that thou mayst give them refuge , and rescue them from beggary , for they are not of asker folk and , if it please Allah , we shall enter Paradise through them . " " By Allah , O my master , " cried she , " thou makest me long to see them ! Where are they ? " , adding , " Here with them to me ! " So he bade the eunuch bring them in ; and , when she looked on them and saw that they were both of distinguished beauty , she wept for them and said , " By Allah , these are people of condition and show plain signs of former opulence . " " O my lady , " said the Syndic 's wife , " we love the poor and the destitute , more especially as reward in Heaven will recompense our love ; and , as for these persons , haply the oppressor hath dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their houses . " Then Ghanim 's mother and sister wept with sore weeping , remembering their former prosperity and contrasting it with their present poverty and miserable condition ; and their thoughts dwelt upon son and brother , whilst Kut al-Kulub wept for their weeping ; and they said , " We beseech Allah to reunite us with him whom we desire , and he is none other but my son named Ghanim bin Ayyud ! " When Kut al-Kulub heard this , she knew them to be the mother and sister of her lover and wept till a swoon came over her . When she revived she turned to them and said , " Have no fear and sorrow not , for this day is the first of your prosperity and And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her the Forty-fourth Night , <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that when Kut al-Kulub had consoled them she bade the Syndic lead them to his house and let his wife carry them to the Hammam and dress them in handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all honour ; and she gave him a sufficient sum of money . Next day , she mounted and , riding to his house , went in to his wife who rose up and kissed her hands and thanked her for her kindness . There she saw Ghanim 's mother and sister whom the Syndic 's wife had taken to the Hammam and clothed afresh , so that the traces of their former condition became manifest upon them . She sat talking with them awhile , after which she asked the wife about the sick youth who was in her house and she replied , " He is in the same state . " Then said Kut al-Kulub , " Come , let us go and visit him . " So she arose , she and the Chief 's wife and Ghanim 's mother and sister , and went in to the room where he lay and sat down near him . Presently Ghanim bin Ayyub , the Distraught , the Thrall o ' Love , heard them mention the name of Kut al-Kulub ; whereupon life returned to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head from the pillow and cried aloud , " O Kut al-Kulub ! " She looked at him and made certain it was he and shrieked rather than said , " Yes , O my beloved ! " " Draw near to me ; " said he , and she replied , " Surely thou art Ghanim bin Ayyub ? " ; and he rejoined " I am indeed ! " Hereupon a swoon came upon her ; and , as soon as Ghanim 's mother and his sister Fitnah heard these words , both cried out " O our joy ' " and fainted clean away . When they all recovered , Kut al-Kulub exclaimed " Praise be to Allah who hath brought us together again and who hath reunited thee with thy mother and thy sister ! " And she related to him all that had befallen her with the Caliph and said " I have made known the truth to the Commander of the Faithful , who believed my words and was pleased with thee ; and now he desireth to see thee , " adding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoiced with extreme joy , when she said , " Quit not this place till I come back " and , rising forthwith , betook herself to her palace . There she opened the chest which she had brought from Ghanim 's house and , taking out some of the diners , gave them to the Syndic saying , " Buy with this money for each of them four complete suits of the finest stuffs and twenty kerchiefs , and else beside of whatsoever they require ; " after which she carried all three to the baths and had them washed and bathed and made ready for them consomms , and galangale-water and cider against their coming out . When they left the Hammam , they put on the new clothes , and she abode with them three days feeding them with chicken meats and bouillis , and making them drink sherbert of sugar candy . After three days their spirits returned ; and she carried them again to the baths , and when they came out and had changed their raiment , she led them back to the Syndic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace and craved permission to see the Caliph . When he ordered her to come in , she entered and , kissing the ground between his hands , told him the whole story and how her lord , Ghanim bin Ayyub , yclept the Distraught , the Thrall o ' Love , and his mother and sister were now in Baghdad . When the Caliph heard this , he turned to the eunuchs and said , " Here with Ghanim to me . " So Ja'afar went to fetch him ; but Kut al-Kulub forewent him and told Ghanim , " The Caliph hath sent to fetch thee before him , " and charged him to show readiness of tongue and firmness of heart and sweetness of speech . Then she robed him in a sumptuous dress and gave him diners in plenty , saying , " Be lavish of largesse to the Caliph 's household as thou goest in to him . " Presently Ja'afar , mounted on his Nubian mule , came to fetch him ; and Ghanim advanced to welcome the Wazir and , wishing him long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of his good fortune had risen and shone brightly ; and Ja'afar took him ; and they ceased not faring together , he and the Minister , till they went in to the Commander of the Faithful . When he stood in the presence , he looked at the Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains , and Viceroys and Grandees and Captains , and then at the Caliph . Hereupon he sweetened his speech and his eloquence and , bowing his head to the ground , broke out in these extempore couplets , <p> " May that Monarch 's life span a mighty span , * Whose lavish of largesse all Empyrean ! lieges scan : None other but he shall be Kaysar highs , * Lord of lordly hall and of haught Divan : Kings lay their gems on his threshold-dust * As they bow and salam to the mighty man ; And his glances foil them and all recoil , * Bowing beards aground and with faces wan : Yet they gain the profit of royal grace , * The rank and station of high Earth 's plain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kay wan 's FN#135 Empyrean ! May the King of Kings ever hold thee dear ; * Be counsel shine and right steadfast plan Till thy justice spread o'er the wide spread earth * And the near and the far be of equal worth . " <p> When he ended his improvisation the Caliph was pleased by it and marvelled at the eloquence of his tongue Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her the Forty-fifth Night , <p> She said , It hath reached me , O auspicious King , that the Caliph , after marvelling at his eloquence of tongue and sweetness of speech , said to him , " Draw near to me . " So he drew near and quoth the King , " Tell me thy tale and declare to me thy case . " So Ghanim sat down and related to him what had befallen him in Baghdad , of his sleeping in the tomb and of his opening the chest after the three slaves had departed , and informed him , in short , of everything that had happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat for interest fails in twice told tales . The Caliph was convinced that he was a true man ; so he invested him with a dress of honour , and placed him near himself in token of favour , and said to him , " Acquit me of the responsibility I have incurred . ' ' FN#136 And Ghanim so did , saying , " O our lord the Sultan , of a truth thy slave and all things his two hands own are his master 's . " The Caliph was pleased at this and gave orders to set apart a palace for him and assigned to him pay and allowances , rations and donations , which amounted to something immense . So he removed thither with sister and mother ; after which the Caliph , hearing that his sister Fitnah was in beauty a very " fitnah , " FN#137 a mere seduction , demanded her in marriage of Ghanim who replied , " She is thy handmaid as I am thy slave . " The Caliph thanked him and gave him an hundred thousand diners , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same day they wrote out the two contracts of marriage between the Caliph and Fitnah and between Ghanim bin Ayyub and Kut al-Kulub ; and the two marriages were consummated on one and the same night . When it was morning , the Caliph gave orders to record the history of what had befallen Ghanim from first to last and to deposit it in the royal muniment rooms , that those who came after him might read it and marvel at the dealings of Destiny and put their trust in Him who created the night and the day . Yet , O auspicious King , this story to which thou hast deigned 
##529152 <p> Belief is not an activity , but a cognitive state of mind . Some beliefs are mutable , while others endure . It is not an affective state like an emotion or desire , but a disposition to respond or act in certain ways when the appropriate situation arises . 1 Many people are disposed to credulity , a tendency to be easily deceived and to accept propositions too readily or on weak or insufficient evidence . Credulity is a second-order disposition about how we arrive at beliefs and is a disposition that can lead to subjectivity . Credulity is displayed in unqualified assent to propositions or belief in propositions that are not sufficiently grounded to justify belief in them . Credulity may be a function of a natural ignorance or an uncritical insensitivity in assessing evidence . It may result from a readiness to accept the prescriptions of authority or pre-eminence , submissive or acquiescent personality or mental self-manipulation , self-indulgence or intellectual sentimentality . <p> We often try to convince people to believe things ( " Believe in God and you will have everlasting life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you believe in astrology ? " ) , and although believing would hardly make sense if it were not a matter of decision , it can not be construed as an action . It is characteristic of both believing and actions that they can be easy or hard and that we provide reasons for them . But if believing was an activity or exercise , when it ceased to occur we would stop believing . For example it makes sense to say that " I will play tennis , but not right now " but it does not make sense to say " I will believe that Clyde won the match , but not right now " . <p> It is generally accepted that believing is easy , and knowing is hard . It takes something more to know because knowledge requires , besides mere belief , some reliable coordination of internal belief with external reality . If one takes no thought for whether a belief is true or false , reliable or unreliable , then believing itself is simply an arbitrary game with no rules - a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cognitive demands of believing should not be child 's play either . To speak of simply deciding to believe something , independently of any reasons real or imagined , is to stretch the notion of " belief " beyond belief . After all , is not care in managing our beliefs exactly what the study of reasoning and philosophy is supposed to teach us ? Suppose , for example , the richest man in the world will grant you a billion dollars if you believe in the Tooth Fairy and disbelieve in gravitation . Also , suppose that this rich man has special telepathic powers in which he can decipher the contents of your mind and ascertain what you " really " believe . Is it possible for belief to be an act of the will in this way ? I do not think so . To believe in the Tooth Fairy and reject gravitational theory , a person is going to have to make serious modifications to the remainder of his belief system and come to believe a whole range of other propositions that will become epistemically irrational for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely can not be a simple non-epistemic act of the will , although those who speak of a " leap of faith " reject this hypothesis <p> Is it then possible for us to believe something while holding there is no more reason to believe it than its contrary ? Is the notion of a leap of faith psychologically intelligible at all ? These are difficult questions . Moreover , since a leap of faith can be made to any one of an infinite number of metaphysical positions and world-views , what criteria are to be used in the process of selection ? The notion , recurrent in Kierkegaard 's writings on Christianity , for example , that belief is subject to the will is a highly problematic one in philosophy , and is plagued by ambiguities . We can surely decide to act as if we believed a particular proposition to be true , leaving the matter of its actual truth-value , provisionally at least , undetermined . This is clear enough and can often be allowed to occur . Kierkegaard seemed to suggest , as did Pascal , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence that a person will eventually come to believe the proposition in fact and not merely hypothetically . What is less likely is that we can , consciously and directly , set ourselves to believe something tout court , irrespective of any grounds we might have for supposing it to be true and even perhaps in the face of what we see to be overwhelming evidence to the contrary . Moreover , these difficulties are exacerbated if what we are asked to believe is stated to be inherently paradoxical - not only lacking in objective foundation , but intrinsically offensive from a rational standpoint . In what sense can I undertake to believe something that I recognize to be inconsistent , self-contradictory , opaque , contrary to experience or literally unthinkable ? But this , it would seem , is the essence of Kierkegaard 's thesis - the very intelligibility of the claim that one can believe what one at the same time recognizes to be necessarily or demonstrably false . 2 Many beliefs and belief systems can not in fact be epistemically justified since they are culturally inculcated conditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of a doctrinaire upbringing . It is no coincidence that out of all the belief systems and world-views , the overwhelming majority just happen to choose the one that their parents or society adhere to rather than the belief system that is the most coherent and plausible , has the most evidential support , the most equitable moral code , the best miracles , and so on . <p> It could be argued , however , that all beliefs grounded in authority are to some extent a function of " faith , " particularly if there is some element of risk in acting on those beliefs or putting them into practice . For example , it would seem odd to say that one has faith that " 2+3=3+2 " or that " the sun will rise tomorrow " but quite sensible to say " I have faith in Allah and the tenets of the Koran . " Faith is , it would appear ; a species of belief and it makes sense to speak of a credulous or " blind " faith ( e.g. , " The Lord will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a rational faith ( e.g. , " I have faith in my physician 's diagnosis of a peptic ulcer " ) . " Blind faith " can justify anything but " rational faith " , or perhaps " trust " would be a better word , must have some significant degree of evidential support . To use faith as if it were an alternative way to the truth can not bypass the crucial question of whether such results really have any likelihood of being true . 3 <p> 3.2 Belief and Truth <p> Belief is not independent of truth since : ( 1 ) what is believed must either be true or false ( since the formal object of belief is always a proposition ) , and ( 2 ) what is believed , even if it happens to be false , is believed to be true . If we value the truth , then " psychological " assent to a proposition , without a commitment to determining whether or not it is true , comes at a heavy cost to intellectual integrity . Intellectual integrity requires that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to pursue an argument even if it leads to conclusions that are judged to be regrettable . For example , some , despite the strong arguments in its favor , that materialism is false , may desire it . I have also suggested in the previous section that the concept of belief as construed as an act of the will is problematic . If the object of belief is truth , then <p> If I could acquire a belief at will , I could not acquire it not knowing whether it was true or not ; moreover I would know that I could acquire it whether it was true or not . If in full consciousness I could will to acquire a " belief " irrespective of its truth , it is unclear that before the event I could seriously think of it as a belief , i.e. , something purporting to represent reality . 4 <p> It could be said that an increase or decrease in knowledge is an increase or decrease in its extent , whereas sometimes an increase or decrease in a belief is an increase or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief can not be counted on to reflect its supporting evidence any more than its causes can . 5 One obvious test of evidence is this : " would it still be taken to support the belief if we stripped away all motives for wanting the belief to be true ? " 6 As Clifford has stated <p> The fact that believers have found joy and peace in believing gives us the right to say that the doctrine is a comfortable doctrine , and pleasant to the soul ; but it does not give us the right to say that it is true . And the question that our conscience is always asking about that which we are tempted to believe is not , " Is it comfortable and pleasant ? " but , " Is it true ? " 7 <p> Many beliefs are , of course , a function of a process of rationalization , wishful thinking or self-deception and it remains an open question as to whether all those processes are morally wrong . Nevertheless , " to maintain any belief while dismissing , or refusing to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that you are more concerned to maintain that belief than really to know whether it or some other is , after all , true . " 8 As I have pointed out earlier , there is a strong inclination , particularly among adults , to believe what they want to believe , to see what they want to see , conclude what they expect to conclude and to ignore or discount disconfirmatory evidence . A person 's motivations influence his beliefs via the subtle ways he chooses a comforting pattern from the fabric of evidence . A person 's preferences influence not only the kind of evidence he considers , but also the amount he examines . When the initial evidence supports an individual 's preferences , he becomes self-satisfied and terminates the inquiry . Conversely , when the initial evidence is unfavorable , he resumes his search for confirmatory evidence to reveal reasons to believe that the original evidence was faulty . For example , when Jane loses 6-1 , 6-0 to Joan in tennis , rather than accepting the rather clear evidence of her deficiencies as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss by searching for further " evidence " such as problems with the tension of the string , external distractions , her biorhythm and so on . <p> 3.3 Belief , Faith and Pascal 's Wager <p> Religious faith , which H.L. Mencken glibly defined to be " the illogical belief in the highly improbable " and which Nietzsche defined as " not wanting to know what is true , " 9 is relevant to the present discussion . A colleague recently tried to convince me of the belief in the existence of the Christian God by arguing that " you ca n't prove that God does not exist " 10 and explained why this particular belief is a " no lose " situation . I countered by stating that the burden of proof for exceptional claims such as the existence of God rests with the believer and quoted T.H. Huxley 's well known axiom : " extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence " and " the more a fact conflicts with previous experience , the more complete must be the evidence which is to justify one 's belief in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking a claim to be true , that in itself is good reason for thinking the claim to be false and , accordingly , a proof of X 's non-existence usually derives from the fact that there is no good reason for supposing that X does exist . Michael Scriven subscribes to this view when he states that " the proper alternative , when there is no evidence , is not mere suspension of belief : it is disbelief . " 11 In bringing this maxim to bear on theism , Scriven goes on to say that " atheism is obligatory in the absence of evidence of God 's existence . " 12 If epistemically null conditions could obtain for any proposition p and its denial p , then it seems we would be forced to disbelieve p , thereby believing p , and to disbelieve p , thereby believing p . But this is absurd , so epistemically null conditions can not obtain both for a proposition and its denial . The absence of a positive epistemic consideration in favor of p will just be a positive epistemic consideration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated further that , in my opinion , Pascal 's notorious wager 13 and William James " Will to Believe " are strange distortions of the notion of belief , my colleague responded by saying that he was familiar with neither Pascal nor James . I explained Pascal 's wager and argued that , since there is little or no evidence for the existence of God and rational people harbor reasonable doubts about it , surely a just God who values rationality would not punish people for being reasonable . In fact , He might even reward the skeptics for their independent habits of thought and punish believers for their credulity . In other words , there might be a god who looked with more favor on honest doubters and atheists who , in Hume 's words , proportioned their belief to the evidence , than on mercenary manipulators of their own understandings . Indeed , this would follow from the ascription to God of moral goodness in any sense that we can understand . The sort of god required for Pascal is modeled upon a monarch stupid enough and vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , back with the god of the Book of Job , and , whatever we may think of Job himself , there can be no doubt that Jehovah comes out of that story very badly . Moreover , it never seems to be thought that since God has made us flawed in so many ways , He might also have seriously limited our capacity to find out precisely what He wants us to do . 14 <p> A further quite obvious objection to Pascal 's wager is the problem of numerous different versions of theism , many of which promise eternal bliss , all vying for credence . It is even logically possible that there exists a being who promises infinite eternal reward to all and only those who deny the existence of other claimants to worship , including the Christian God , yielding a dilemma equivalent to a practical contradiction : a rational person both ought and ought not to bet on , say , the Christian God . Perhaps the biggest reason why Pascal 's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of cost-benefit analysis . He will spurn the latter - assuming He actually cares at all whether people believe in Him . And finally , it would seem that a fair and just God would judge people on their actions in life and not whether they happen to believe in Him . <p> Pascal 's wager could at most give us only psychological reasons ( motives ) for wishing that we believed or could believe . What we lack are good reasons ( grounds ) for having this kind of faith . The postulation of a Supreme Being has , ever since I was a youngster , seemed to me " throwing in the towel " , a refusal to take complex problems seriously - a facile , groundless and evasive response to deeply disturbing difficulties . It welcomes the self-comforting delusion that we know what we do not know , and have answers that we do not have , thereby denying the true humility of awe , wonder , mysteriousness , and perhaps , inexplicability of what is . By sheer chance I had what I perceive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life when I became aware of the contradictions between my experiences and what I was told at Sunday school . One example of this was the result of my dear mother 's efforts to comfort me following the death of my dog Rusty who died after being struck by an automobile . My mother , in her efforts to console , assured me that I would eventually meet Rusty again in Heaven . But later at Sunday school I was informed that dogs do not have " souls " and consequently will not enjoy an afterlife . I did not find my mother 's explanation comforting nor convincing and I have since been highly suspicious of facile explanations and solutions to difficult questions . The efforts of my mother and my teachers to answer my pressing metaphysical queries were not successful , and I could not understand why so many other students were not interested in these deep existential questions that seemed so important to me , and appeared to have no easy answers . Hence , if beliefs persist and there are no reasons for holding them , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do . Belief in God is irrational - perhaps absurd - but , as Feuerbach , Nietzsche , Santayana and Freud have shown , the psychological need for this construct of the human heart is so great , that in cultures like ours many people must believe in spite of the manifest absurdity of their belief . They can accept and see the absurdity in the religious beliefs of primitive tribes and ancient cultures and sometimes , as with Kierkegaard and Pascal , they can partially see it and accept it in their own culture , but the acceptance is not unequivocal and the full absurdity of their own belief remains hidden from them . <p> The true precept of veracity , which includes both the pursuit of truth and the avoidance of error , is this : " We ought to give every proposition which we consider as nearly possible that degree of credence which is warranted by the probability it acquires from the evidence known to us . The further questions , what propositions to consider , and how much trouble to take to acquire knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the issue . But to go about the world believing everything in the hope that thereby we shall believe as much truth as possible is like practicing polygamy in the hope that among so many we shall find someone who will make us happy . 15 <p> I am inclined to think that Pascal 's advice carries with it a large dose of intellectual dishonesty and self-deception . William James , as we shall soon see , appears to advocate the same thing . Brand Blanshard attacks this Pascalian/Jamesian pragmatic defense of religious claims : <p> ... the only evidence that is relevant to the truth of a belief is evidence that is logically relevant ... James was thus left in the uneasy position of saying that we were justified morally in accepting what we were clearly not justified in accepting logically ; I say uneasy because if we know that we are not logically justified , to say that we are morally justified is to warrant an attempt at self-deception. 16 <p> Hence , what ought not to be allowed , if rational belief is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value judgments or motives of the believer or on the kind of application or consequences the belief is going to have . <p> Beliefs are , in many respects , like possessions . An individual acquires material goods because of the satisfaction they provide and one often feels inclined to purchase and retain beliefs in a like manner . 17 This similarity is captured in our language by people referring to beliefs as being " adopted " , " inherited " , " acquired " , " held " , " maintained " , " lost " , and " abandoned . " However , in the market-place of beliefs one must be an astute and discriminating shopper . There are many things one is enticed to believe , and to do so would often be comforting and agreeable . The will to believe in ESP , for example , 18 is likely motivated by the fact that it entails several other comforting corollaries and opens up many inviting prospects such as the prospect of an " afterlife . " There are many beliefs to be purchased at bargain-basement prices ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays a high price in rationality and intellectual sincerity . There are many things we would like to believe but reality gets in the way . Furthermore , many people tend to be quite protective and tenacious about their beliefs and become overly sensitive and defensive when their beliefs are challenged and exposed to intellectual scrutiny and criticism . Others , aware of this neuroticism , are reluctant to openly question the beliefs of another , particularly those beliefs that lack substantial evidential support such as political and religious creeds . Many people of course try to avoid potential conflict with others and often feign agreement with the claims of others in order to " play ball " or to avoid being branded by the " group " as offensive , negative , unfriendly , or hostile . The hidden assumption in statements such as " I trust you wo n't mind if I 'm perfectly frank " is usually false when it comes to criticism of another 's cherished beliefs . Moreover , with the notion of " political correctness " seemingly dominating and restricting present day rational discourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal sacred cows . For example , many skeptics consider it dangerous politically or socially to apply their critical thinking to scriptural claims . The plight of Salman Rushdie is ample evidence of the paranoia that presently exists , and probably always has existed , in religious communities . <p> Returning to Pascal , it would seem that with his infamous wager he was employing the " Principle of Insufficient Reason " which John Maynard Keynes , in his Treatise on Probability , renamed the " Principle of Indifference " . The principle can be stated as follows : If a person has no good reason for supposing a proposition to be true or false , then he assigns even odds to the probability of both truth and falsity . The principle has had a long notorious history having been applied is such disparate fields as science , 19 statistics , economics , philosophy , ethics and psychic research . Unfortunately , its application often leads to absurdities and paradoxes , if not wholesale logical contradictions . If one assumes that Pascal believed the odds of both the Christian God existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can easily see how it can lead to inconsistencies . <p> To illustrate the problematic nature of the principle , consider the following . All theistic religions make claims about the existence of their God or Gods . Now , there have been a multitude of theistic claims throughout history and it is estimated that there are in the order of 200 theistic religions in the world today . In one of his well-known satirical essays , Memorial Service ( 1922 ) , H.L. Mencken lists approximately 100 Gods that are no longer with us because of the dissolution of the cultures that believed in them . As Mencken proclaims in his closing statement of the essay , " They were all gods of the highest dignity - gods of civilized people - worshipped and believed in by millions . All were omnipotent , omniscient and immortal . And all are dead . " 21 All these theistic religions claimed exclusivity ; that is , their God is the one and only God . Now , if the probability of the Christian God 's existence is .5 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of the Jewish God 's existence is .5 , and so on , one can calculate the following : The probability of the Christian God 's existence is ( .5 ) n , where n represents the number of religions making exclusive claims to a deity , the probability of the Christian God existing is .5 , and the probability of all the other God 's not existing are .5 respectively . But the probability of the Christian God existing or the probability of the Christian God not existing must equal 1 , an obvious contradiction since ( .5 ) n + .5 = 1 if and only if n = 1 . <p> It might be argued , in defense of Pascal , that he was actually following a course recognized as valid in the theory of utility in Decision Theory ( i. -e. , Expected utility = p(outcome) x value ( of outcome ) . The only unresolved issue is the fact that here Pascal uses infinity as a multiplier ( i-.e. , " degree of happiness " = ( infinite happiness in heaven ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n r ) , since , based upon subjective empirical probabilities concerning God 's existence , it would be reasonable to assign a probability near zero to this event . Such relationships are considered acceptable in Decision theory . There is , however , some serious question about the use of probability assignments at all . It seems clear to me that the only interpretation of probability relevant and useable here is the subjective one ; yet how are even subjective probability assignments supposed to arise out of the mere insistence that theism is not demonstrably impossible ? Its mere possibility need not be taken to endow it with any positive probability at all . Even if it could be argued that theism and atheism are in approximate epistemic parity , no decision between them can be made on purely epistemic grounds and some form of agnosticism would seem to be the appropriate doxastic stance if no considerations other than purely epistemic ones could or should enter into such decisions . 22 It should also be pointed out that Decision Theory by itself is an instrumental theory of best action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , belief is based upon evidence and plausibility , not upon the power of the will or cost-benefit analysis . Moreover , is it not irrational to gamble on an infinitesimal probability , even though the stakes are high ? Purchasing a Lotto Canada ticket when the odds of winning anything of significance are in the order of fourteen million to one is a case in point . <p> 1 For Gilbert Ryle , it is a mistake to think of a belief as any kind of private mental state , activity or occurrence . Beliefs are dispositions , whereas knowledge is more akin to an ability . According to Ryle 's account in The Concept of Mind ( 1949 ) , a person has a disposition if he is inclined to speak and behave in a particular way . In light of the limitations of this thesis , I shall sidestep the difficult analysis of the concept of belief and follow the lead of Ryle and H.H. Price . Price ( 1969 ) states that " A believes that P " is to attribute a multiform disposition to A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in actions but in emotional states , feelings of doubt , surprise , confidence , and inferences . Wittgenstein argues that we do not acquire our beliefs by being dragged and screaming , as it were , out of skepticism ( skeptics are made , not born ) . Nor do we carefully weigh the evidence of every proposition recommended to us . Rather , our culture teaches us to organize our experience in certain ways by giving us conceptions , rules of use , names , and so on . We acquire a picture of the world ; that is , a loosely connected network of propositions in which the consequences and premises are mutually supporting . ( Wittgenstein , On Certainty , p. 21 . ) It is against this background that doubt arises , either because what we expect is contradicted by our experiences in the world , or because we find ourselves entertaining propositions that are , or whose consequences are , contradictory . In other words , we begin by believing and we must have grounds for skepticism . Clifford would argue that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to create a barrier for Christianity against the presumptions and incursions of rationalism , has done so at the cost of giving no grounds for preferring Christianity to any other religion or system of belief and even robbing it of all serious pretensions to credibility . Obviously a good deal depends here on how the ideas in question are taken . It is one thing to regard acceptance of the Christian faith as commitment to a self-contained sphere or Wittgensteinian " form of life " , not itself finally justifiable by external criteria or modes of assessment ; it is another to treat its content as being in some sense essentially paradoxical , avowedly " absurd " or contradictory . In so far as Kierkegaard subscribed to the second , and not merely the first , of these positions , his standpoint has been felt - not unnaturally - to present special problems . <p> 3 It is interesting to note that for classical Greek philosophy , as for Plato , faith ( pistis ) is the lowest form of belief , characteristic only of the wholly uneducated , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . The Jewish-inspired Christian emphasis on faith struck educated pagan observers with astonishment ; it represented , in their eyes , the extreme of anti-intellectualism - foolishness . <p> 4 Bernard Williams ( 1973 ) , p. 148 . <p> 5 Evidence for a belief must be distinguished from the motives and causes of belief ; for some causes of belief can be counted as evidence and some can not . When someone is said to have some reason for bel-ieving a certain proposition , we may need to ask whether this reason is a ground for holding that the proposition is actu-ally true or whether it is a motive for persuading himself of it , irrespective of whether it is true or not . In the former case we can speak of a reason ( ground ) , in the latter of a reason ( motive ) . Many beliefs are caused by social factors such as what we have been taught by our elders , or " picked up from our peers by social osmosis . " ( Antony Flew ( 1982 ) , p. 367-69 ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 Of course it is a fundamental point of logic that one can not disprove a universal negative . I can not , for example , prove the non-existence of super intelligent invisible green goblins residing on the planet Neptune . <p> 11 Michael Scriven ( 1966 ) , p. 103 . <p> 12 Scriven ( 1966 ) , p. 103-104 . Scriven would argue that agnosticism is really a confused position . The self-styled agnostic who suspends judgment about the existence of God while asserting without hesitation that , of course , Aphrodite , Zeus and Satan do not exist , and there are no angels or mermaids , is confused : he takes it for granted that Satan and angels have to be conceived anthropomorphically , while God must not be considered that way . However , once we leave the absurdly false but intelligible claims of a very anthropomorphic and religiously and rationally unacceptable theism , we get versions of Christianity and Judaism which make central claims . But for them it can not be ascertained under what conditions they would be false or probably false , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is problematical or anomalous . It therefore seems that the agnostic , unless he is willing to suspend judgment rather than deny extraordinary claims such as the existence of Bigfoot , the Easter Bunny , the Tooth Fairy , the Loch Ness monster , disembodied spirits and a host of other alleged paranormal entities , he should also be willing to deny the existence of God . Scriven points out that at least Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster are not alleged to possess any powers or attributes of an utterly unprecedented sort . But when a claim asserts the existence of something that is greatly at odds with our previous experience and our best scientific knowledge , we rightly regard the claim as very probably false until we are provided with truly strong evidence in its favor . Thus we are not too skeptical when we read in the newspapers that the world record for the 100 metre dash has been exceeded by one-tenth of a second . However , one would be considered credulous to uncritically accept a newspaper report of someone sprinting across Canada in one day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cured of a terminal illness by Gregorian chants or by the words of an evangel-ist faith healer . The relevance of these con-siderations to theistic claims of an omnip-otent , omniscient deity that does not exist in space or time ( but can act in space and time ) is obvious . <p> 13 Pascal 's Wager : " If God does not exist , we can still believe in Him with impunity , but if he does exist , we doubt him at our peril ; therefore it is the counsel of prudence to believe in God . " ( Quine &; Ulliam ( 1978 ) , p. 61 ) It would seem that the argument is aimed at convincing open-minded self-interested skeptics , whose coolness about their prospects for immortality horrifies Pascal , that they should become involved on the side of those Christians committed to immortality - but it seems to me no such person would accept the premises . It seems more likely that the argument is not for the skeptic who is satisfied with this world , but is rather for the person who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent for a self-interested rational skeptic to feel unhappy about man 's lot . But even if he had the appropriate exis-tential human longings , the rational skeptic must find Pascal 's argument invalid . The primary source can be found in Pascal 's Pensees and the Provincial Letters , trans . W. F. Trotter , New York , 1941 , pp. 79 - 85 ( Sections 233 - 241 of the Pensees ) . <p> 19 The French mathematician and astronomer Pierre Laplace once used the principle to calculate the probability of the sun rising at 1,826,214 to 1 . <p> 20 It would seem that Pascal must have considered the probability of the Christian God 's existence to be sufficiently high , otherwise his wager argument would carry little weight . In any event , any such probability would be a priori and highly speculative and if the odds of the Christian God 's existence were extremely low , say 1 in 10 10 , then the wager argument could not take flight . <p> 22 Many would argue that basic religious concepts and propositions are unintelligible or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of belief . Hence , for a reflective and concerned human being possessing a reasonable scientific and philosophical understanding of the world , some form of agnosticism 
##537251 <p> Do you feel stuck ? When most people want to improve , they try doing more , and before long , even the smallest tasks drag on forever . Do you remember when you could just get things done ? I can help you recapture those days . <p> My name is J. B. Rainsberger and I can help you profit sooner from your software projects . <p> I helped a major government contractor see how to reduce billions of dollars in erroneous insurance and health benefit claims . Their complex COBOL-based system allows , for example , men to qualify for maternity benefits . Over dinner we sketched a plan to replace the most expensive parts of the legacy system gradually and safely , and now they can save their client signficant sums of money in weeks instead of months . <p> Could your business benefit from advice like this ? <p> I think that I 've learned more in this training class than I have in my entire professional programming career . <p> C.H. <h> Consulting <p> when you ca n't put your finger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems are , nor how to solve them , then you need consulting , and that 's exactly the kind of consulting I enjoy doing . <p> I focus on understanding problems , issues , and obstacles deeply before choosing solutions . When you contact me , I will probably ask you a long list of questions designed to help me understand the problems you want to solve , the issues you want to explore , or the obstacles you want to overcome . Many past clients have asked me to push the wrong solutions at them , and I do n't want to do that to you . I do n't intend to offer you any solution until I have some confidence that it will help . <p> I specialise in digging deeply to uncover the root cause of your problems . If you allow me , I will work with you to find those causes and design a plan to help you attack them . <h> Coaching <p> when you need to apply new skills <p> If you know what to do , and even how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you 're likely ready for coaching . Sadly , the generic consultants of yesteryear have become the " agile coaches " of today . Everyone who has read a book or two about agile software development has magically become an agile coach . You need to choose very carefully the person you plan to hire to provide this service . <p> My network of coaches consists of people who understand the craft of coaching and learn more about it every day . They form real bonds with the people they coach and this bond contributes much to their success in helping people get out of their own way . They incorporate ideas from a multitude of disciplines to help people realise more of their ability . More than simply show you some tips and tricks , they help you understand how you work , what you can improve , and more importantly how to make lasting changes for the better . <h> Training <p> If you have already established goals you want to achieve , and have identified that you need to increase your organisation 's capacity in some direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike coaching , focuses on increasing your capacity to produce in some way . Production capacity , like your body 's muscles , atrophies without development . Even if you do n't struggle to keep up with your competition , you will struggle with your customers ' increasing demands . You must develop new skills to stop your organisation from shrinking , losing relevance , and shedding customers . <h> Speaking <p> I enjoy speaking at a variety of conferences , user groups , and meetups around the world . I can provide inspirational talks , discuss new ideas , lead impromptu discussions or present some golden oldies . <p> For companies that would like to help people feel more comfortable initiating a change program , such as adopting new ways of working , I can offer talks that discuss these sensitive issues . For skeptical audiences or people generally concerned about the magnitude of change involved in " going agile " , I recommend Yes , Your Agile Transition Can Work . For overworked audiences who want to improve but simply ca n't find the time to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptics who see emergent design as overhead , rather than an investment in increasing the capacity to deliver , I recommend The Economics of Software Design , and if their skepticism reaches more broadly to other aspects of agile software development , consider An Introduction to Agile with the Theory of Constraints . <p> Of course , if you have a specific topic in mind or a tricky audience you 'd like to reach , then tell me about it and I 'll design a session that better fits your needs . <p> I help people deal with fear when I coach people , teams , and organisations . All coaches do this . I often deal with this problem with a relatively simple working session that often takes less than an hour . If you like it , then please try this at work . <p> I had intended to write an InfoQ article looking back at ten years of agile software development , but I never completed one . Instead , I found these notes , and I wanted to at least try to spark some conversation around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and face dissenting view points . Do n't hold back . <p> Time and again I see clients struggling to complete work because they struggle to find enough contiguous time to complete a meaningful piece of work .

##543151 <h> How to Take the Next Step in Your Freelance Career <p> When someone I do n't know emails me out of the blue and hands me a guest post , I 'm usually a little skeptical . ( There 's truth in the experts ' advice of building relationships and trust first . ) But when I took a look at Justin 's post -- and the quality of his writing -- I fired back a reply . " Win . " <p> You see , there 's a whole world out there beyond our screens , and we often forget about it . Justin 's post will remind you of the potential that 's right outside your door . More clients , more exposure , more credibility ... go for it . Here 's how : <p> If you 've been involved with freelance writing , blogging , copywriting or marketing for more than , say , a day and a half , you 've probably heard plenty about how speaking before an audience can boost your reputation , which helps you become a thought leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's true ! Public speaking can do wonders for your expert status in the minds of current and future clients , readers , fellow writers and the public . Combine it with writing a book and you 've got an incredible one-two punch that can propel you into the upper echelon of experts in short order . <p> And as a freelancer , public speaking can easily be the most important thing you can do to bring your career to the next level . <p> If you 're like me , though , you did n't get into freelancing or blogging for the fame . You were n't looking to travel around the country speaking in front of thousands or charging $20,000 for a 30-minute keynote address . <p> Not that you 'd mind that last one , right ? I mean come on ! <p> That does n't change the fact that adding public speaking to your repertoire can mean huge benefits for you and your business . <p> So how do you translate the power of public speaking into value for your freelancing business without going whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it simple . For example ... <p> Schedule Some Local Speaking Engagements <p> Grab the phone or jump online and look up the local Rotary Club , business networking organization , SBA outpost , Boys and Girls ' Clubs , the YMCA and YWCA , community college . All these places probably have ongoing needs for professionals to come in and speak about various topics to their ready-made audiences . <p> Would your business benefit from some local exposure like that ? From the chance to meet local business leaders face-to-face , trade business cards and show off your stuff ? Could you snag some sweet portfolio pieces by working with local non-profits that work with these organizations ? <p> By setting yourself up onstage instead of in the audience , you go to the event for free , you look like the expert for the day , and you get the full benefit of this tailor-made networking opportunity . <p> Of course , there 's not a lot ( or any ) upfront profit from speaking at these kinds of events . What if there was a way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ? <p> There is . <p> Create and Hold a Seminar <p> For a fairly reasonable rate , you can rent a hotel conference room and throw some ads in the local papers or on business websites and bring together an audience of targeted leads to hear you speak for a significant ticket price that more than pays you back for the expense of running the seminar and the time it takes you to speak . <p> Plus , you 're the expert for the day . You 're pressing-the-flesh with professionals who now have a vested interest in paying close attention to what you say , and you have several hours with a captive audience to work your marketing magic . <p> But what if your work is primarily online ? Do you need to miss out on this great concept ? <p> Absolutely not . <p> Organize a Webinar <p> With the technology available today , you can run a webinar from virtually anywhere as long as you have a laptop and an internet connection . If you have a list already built , it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people know the details , then showing up when you said you would . <p> If you do n't have your list built yet , there are several options available , including renting a qualified list of prospects who may be interested in what you have to say , advertising in a complimentary e-zine , arranging a joint venture opportunity with a fellow online freelancer with a list of their own ... <p> The options are virtually endless . <p> But Hold On a Second ... <p> Do n't get too far ahead of yourself just yet . This is exciting stuff , but there 's one vitally important point to consider before you start scheduling your seminar . <p> It 's so vital , I 'm going to ask you to bring your eyes just a bit closer to the screen for this , so you 're sure not to miss anything . <p> Are you ready ? <p> No one cares what you have to say unless YOU do . <p> Does that make sense ? <p> If you 're going to put yourself behind a lectern in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain some sort of benefit from the endeavor , such as a new client , increased sales , a boost for your reputation ... <p> You 'd darn well better be passionate about what you have to say . <p> You need to take the time to turn all those experiences , facts and statistics rolling around your head into a format the audience is going to care about -- and you 're going to need to present it in a way that they 're going to be able to sit through . <p> But if you can do that -- if you can reach down deep inside and pull up the core of what makes you jump out of bed every morning to greet the brand new day of this incredible freelance life and turn it into a speech that knocks an audience 's socks off -- you 've got a goldmine just waiting to be exploited . <p> So what are you waiting for ? Go to it ! <p> Or did I forget something important ? Let me know in the comments , because I 'd love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambert is a freelance writer and a public speaking expert who blogs daily at Words That Begin With You . He 's right . <p> Nervous about being on stage ? Want to hold a seminar but are n't sure you can actually make it through ? <p> Check out In the Spotlight , Janet Esposito 's book on overcoming your fear of public speaking and performing . S'worth it ! <p> Dude , this could NOT have come at a better time . Not only is this a " Win " but it 's something I did briefly then forgot about . I spoke at Barnard about 6 months ago on how to use social media to get a job and it went swimmingly . Problem was , college career counselors do n't like to think they do n't know something and out of the 50 schools I contacted to do a free workshop , only Barnard got back to me . <p> Then I tried Meetup.com . I contacted the owner of every group related to job hunting and none of them responded . Maybe it was the setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meetup as a whole , maybe there just are n't enough relevant groups . Regardless , it did n't work . This was 6 months ago and just the other day I was talking to another social media person over coffee . We both specialize in helping authors use new media and at the end of our two-hour conversation we thought , " Damn . That was some good info ! People should pay us to just sit , have coffee and listen . " <p> So we 're doing it ! I do n't know the first thing about renting a space or advertising this event , but we both know enough people in publishing and are awesome enough at social media that we 'll probably do okay . <p> Phew ! Sorry for the book of a comment , but you are so spot on in this you just kicked my ass into gear . Thanks : -p <p> I 'd say stick with very local businesses , face to face . Contact the business groups in your area , maybe Rotary Club groups or Chamber of Commerce groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't work ... remember your target audience . <p> If you 're trying to talk social media to someone on the web ... no juice . If you 're trying to talk social media to someone who never uses the web ... do n't find them on the web <p> And get back to me next time you want to pitch someone . As mentioned on Twitter , I 'll check out that letter for you <p> Thanks for this post , Justin . I have led a few seminars on using social media , but I was about ready to give that up because it seemed way more time-intensive than profitable . Any ideas on what a " significant ticket price " would be that 's also attractive to a small business owner ? <p> As with any marketing question , I have to start by saying " test it . " But small business owners who understand the value of continuing education have been known to spend up to $1000 a seat at marketing seminars because they know they 're going to walk away with the know-how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you want to charge that much , but do n't be scared to look at your *reasonable* expected audience ( figuring 1%-5% of your invites will decide to buy a ticket ) and your expenses , and set the price where you need it to be . If you have a small venue , light on the equipment rental , and otherwise keep your costs down , $97 a seat may be perfect . But keep testing . If you can do the same thing for $497 a seat and everyone 's still happy , why the heck not ? <p> Justin 's right about business owners understanding value . That 's what it 's all about . The amount anybody is willing to pay is directly related to what value provide , AND how well you articulate that value to the buyer . Thanks again for the post Justin ! <p> Another place to get an easy speaking engagement is at a local university . <p> Call the Department in your area of expertise . Some professors might let you talk to their classes , but a better bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student professional organizations . Most universities have an " Office of Student Affairs . " Ask to speak to the president of the student organization . <p> I suggest you have two or three presentation so they can choose one . This will give you great practice and you 'll be touching the future . <p> Awesome suggestion , Mary . I like the thought of " touching the future " too . Not only do we have the ( perhaps dubious ) opportunity to mold young minds , but if we 're in it for the long haul , these are our clients-to-be also ! <p> You reminded me of a time when I spoke to students that were considering other venues beyond higher education . I came in to tell them the value of learning administrative assistant skills -- it 's a fantastic Plan B , and it stays with you for life . Plus , the opportunities only grow . <p> My daughter-in-law is an administrative assistant whose boss is totally dependent on her . Now worries about job security , that 's for sure . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- presumably instead of a raise , but still . <p> Great piece . Real important for small biz owners to show what they do . Liked your ideas for speaking venues . Will check out your blog . <p> I take my " enthusiasm " on the road , too . You can even make money if you 've got products ready to sell at the back of the room . I NEVER speak for free unless I 've at least got a " life shop " ( what I call them ) coming up . That 's a lost marketing opportunity I see all the time . <p> Raffle off something and you can get names for your newsletter if you 've got one . <p> Marian , I 'd keep trying . You 've got a great on-line stage presence . I 've found that persistence can break the ice and/or you need many attempts to break through the barriers out there . <p> Hey , even pull up a chair in a public garden ! You never know who 's hoofing through on his or her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would like to add as well , is to make sure that you " can it and clone it . " <p> That is to say , whenever you are giving a public talk , of any kind , make sure that you borrow a ninja minion ( maybe James will lend you one of hers ) and have her film it . <p> This is a great way to repurpose you offline content and clone it into something that you can sell online as a whole course of DVDs etc . <p> You can also use the videos to boost your street cred on your home page by showing excerpts from your latest talk , allowing people to see your face , your speaking style , and that you are legit . <p> Never do anything twice in your business that you do n't have to . Film that stuff . Edit it together , and you can sell it , move to Fiji , and lie on the beach while your ninja minions swing from the trees . <p> A killer tip that I wish I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ! I 've kicked myself already for failing to arrange recording on some talks I know I rocked out . Going forward , I 'm making it a priority , and you 're right . Even if you just use snippets on YouTube and your own site and never try to sell it , it 's worth tons in street cred . Selling it , it 's a potential goldmine . Thanks much ! <p> p.s . I ca n't get the picture of ninjas swinging through the Fijian trees outta my head ! Thanks for that too ! <p> To reply to this one in a more serious tone , the note to bring a video camera is extremely valuable . I know several people who do public speaking who rocked it out ... and then wished they 'd filmed it . Oops . <p> Awesome tip ! Some of us get so wrapped up in the " online " world we forget about the " offline " connections that can be made and how much credibility face to face interaction brings . <p> In my " offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection is to do some sort of public speaking . In fact , my team made a presentation just the other day . The client was so intrigued by the image we portrayed , they thought we were a national firm . After the presentation and some question answering we go to do some on the spot consulting , an offer to follow up on another product and an invitation into one of their other offices . <p> Public speaking can give you a lot of reason to follow-up with potential clients as opposed to making cold calls . That 's what our goal was , and it more than paid off . <p> Sweet testimonial for the power of getting out there and showing the client what you 've got . It is an awesome marketing tool to have in your toolbox , even if your online work is doing its job nicely . And your point about following up is critical ! Public speaking can be a lot of work , especially if you 're setting up a seminar like I describe , so it would be really bogus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the leads it generates . <p> Just today I offered my services as a speaker to a local women 's only networking group . I let the yes word jump right out of my mouth before I had a chance to stop it ( lizard brain ) . Now I have to prepare a talk and deliver it , simple ! I am a little nervous even now , you would n't think I used to read the radio news to the UK without a care in the world . Thanks for the confirmation that I really do need to do this . <p> You absolutely DO need to do it . But that does n't mean it 's going to be simple . Still , I 've found in my own case that , as long as you 're well-prepared and you can manage to physically get yourself to the stage , your nerves only stick around another five seconds or so . You 're going to rock it , I 'm sure ! Thanks for the personal comment . <p> And there you go peering into my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in India and that too in an area with low Internet penetration . Most businesses are either starting out with static websites and have perhaps heard of Facebook or Twitter when scandals involving politicians or movie stars break out.We are still in Web 1.0 world out here . <p> Since I am starting out as a copywriter and building up my portfolio I will achieve nothing with local clients if I concentrate my networking efforts online.Fortunately newspapers still rule the roost here and so I am concentrating on writing articles that appear with my byline.It 's a win win for both of us- I gain publicity and expert cred and they get solid content . <p> I am sure the hold of local newspapers in the West are not like what they are in countries like India but if you are a regular contributor on a particular topic you become fairly well known among the readers of the newspaper and that translates into a significant client base . <p> Try a workshop , Bhaskar . Hold a small one day event with local people and show them the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you could teach them a little on how to write , if you 'd like . <p> James beat me to the punch , of course , but I was thinking the same thing : hold some classes teaching local businessmen and women to do the same thing you 're doing writing articles and building their expert status in their fields of choice . No matter how powerful the internet eventually becomes in your area , people will still respect your name in a print byline . It 's hardcoded into our DNA . <p> I like your before and after suggestion . In case they have any analytics solution installed beforehand ( one can always hope ) the positive change in stats after a copy makeover would also buttress my case far strongly than whatever I will say . <p> Highly recommend . The biggest benefit to speaking to a group of people is that invariably you will learn as much ( or more ) than they do . My teaching career predated my artist biz , and back when many of us were cutting our teeth teaching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My students LOVED having a " real life artist " come into the classroom , and it became one of the highlights of the semester . And as a speaker , it forces you to sharpen your message and method of communication . It 's a great experience , no matter what level you are at . <p> thanks for the warm welcome ! : I 'm actually a long-time reader ( okay not THAT long , but I 'll sheepishly admit to " bookmarking " your post by leaving it open in my browser window for 2 weeks straight ) <p> I had a great speaking experience at a business-for-artists panel recently , literally months before my biz went full-time . Most places would n't have let a " wan na be " in front of an audience , but they graciously invited me . I was surprised at how well received it was ( not to mention shocked when people scribbled notes when I talked ) -- I think in some ways I was able to connect with the audience more than the professionals because I was closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they needed a vision and a direction . Sometimes people who have " arrived " forget what the beginning of the journey looked like . <p> So , this is a pep talk for all of you who think you do n't know enough , are n't experienced enough , etc. : when your experience differs from the person you 're speaking to , it has value . And enthusiasm is gold . You do n't have to look down from the end of the road to help others , you can grab their hand and take them with you . <p> Wow . May I humbly recommend a guest post from Chris in the near future ? And when James gets her Copper Map , I 'll take the trip to Hawaii as a finder 's fee for writing the post that generated that awesome comment ! <p> But seriously , thank you Chris because you 're right on the money with these points . Speaking before a crowd can truly be a force for good beyond what it can do for our careers . It improves us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in ahead of time . <p> Hoo boy , you are raising all my fear hackles right now . And I 'm supposed to be a voice coach , lol . But public speaking , in front of actual people ? Have n't done that in 30+ years . However , webinars ? That 's something I can manage , and have actually been thinking about doing . Thanks for the nudge ! <p> Wow , very interesting . To be honest , I 'm a terrible public speaker . When I was still in school , I actually sometimes would opt for a failing test grade rather than stand up in front of the class to describe a project . <p> I know I really have to get rid of my public speaking phobia . Out of the list , I 'd probably do the webinar . It sounds like it might even be exciting , especially if I find someone to work with . All I really need is practice . Once I 'm more experienced , I might even be able to give speeches off-line . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later . I 'd rather opt for sooner . However , I 'm not going to get ahead of myself . I 'll go through the process slowly , as I learn along the way . <p> Christina , I can totally sympathize -- I used to be terrified . I actually put off teaching for years because I was scared to death to stand to stand &; talk in front of students . <p> Try this -- do a round table discussion instead of a speech . You 'd be surprised how different and informal things become when you are seated instead of standing . And if you add in a few points of dialogue -- ask the audience a question or two ( really , even pick out a person or two if no one volunteers ) -- you 'll break the " stage " barrier and shift from public speaking to talking with colleagues &; friends . <p> Right along with Chris ' comment , Christina , I can also tell you that when a group of people shows up on time and is sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they actually WANT TO BE THERE , it 's a huge motivator . Whether or not they 've paid money for the seat , just the fact that they 've carved out time specifically to hear what YOU have to say shows that they value it . And that makes it a heck of a lot easier to actually give them what they 're looking for . <p> btw , thanks for the " captivating and inspiring " tag . I may just have to quote you on that some time in the future ... <p> I 'd say it 's all about passion that spells a huge difference between fail and win . If you 're not passionate about what you do , who will really care about it ? I guess , everyone here wants to be a somebody in his/her chosen field and gain full financial freedom in doing so . This is why we have accidental billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg , founder of Facebook -- and the likes . Passion is a freelancer 's only motivation in breathing life to a dream , especially when he/she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's totally true . Without a passion for the work and the subject matter , a freelancer will quickly become an employee working for himself . And there 's a big difference there . Sometimes , though , passion still gets hindered by fear . We may need to push ourselves into difficult areas to let the passion shine ! <p> I used to be involved in network marketing and had to do presentations once a week for 2 years but I left it behind for internet marketing . Since I have n't been in front of a room in about 2 years ( not counting my Master 's Thesis defense ) I think I 'll join my local Toastmasters after reading this . <p> Thanks very much , Marc ! And you make a really good point about video requiring a lot of the same skills as being up in front of a group . Public speaking skills are sorely lacking on the majority of YouTube right now ! <p> This certainly helped me open up to the idea of having options to marketing . I am merely a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and guidance by meaningful articles such as this puts hope in my soul to push and focus on this dream . I would 've never thought to become a speaker at a seminar to help promote my up and coming business . I thank

##555151 <h> " Take Care ! " <p> 29/08/12 09:06 <p> Take Care ! As I hang up the phone , I hear my friend utter the proverbial " Take care ! " , marking the end of another conversation . I pause for a moment and repeat the words in my head ... " Take care ! " This phrase brings up mixed emotions as I 've been grappling with the essence of its meaning over the last few months . I 've said it myself countless times and have preached the need for self-care at public lectures and in private counsels with friends and family . But do I practice what I preach ? Well that 's a completely different story ... I know what I have to do , what those of us with Parkinson 's must do in order to live well with this disease . Not only do we have to advocate to optimize our care from those health care professionals on our team but we have to recognize that a big part of managing this condition is being an active participant ; doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That includes taking the time to exercise regularly , eating well , managing stress and getting adequate rest . Sounds fairly logical , maybe even simple . But it is something that I struggle with on a daily basis . Despite my knowledge and best intentions , I continuously fall victim to my " to do list " . A life that includes many different projects , three vibrant young daughters , a husband with a busy career and countless social and family obligations , is ripe with excuses ; all of which make complete sense at the time they are made . " Oh I had to get such and such from the store . " Or " That closet was such a mess , it just had to be sorted ! " Or " So and so needed to be taken to such and such a place " The list is endless and instead of being conquered , it has a curiously strange way of growing longer still ! And at what price ? Yes my house is organized , my emails are answered and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffer , my energy poorer and my stress level rises . Many a time I have looked into my husband 's troubled eyes as he pleads with me , telling me that if I want to be there for my family and continue to be a productive part of my community , I have to take care of myself first and foremost . That driving myself into the ground is actually doing myself and those that depend on me , a disservice ( imagine that ! ) . A hard pill to swallow for someone who is n't used to putting themselves first in any situation . But he 's absolutely right . I do want to be there for my family , friends and community , to be by my daughters ' sides as they journey through life , to grow old with my husband ... and to do that will require commitment to my own well being , perseverance as well as strong motivation and yes , a little bit of selfishness . I must say that I am getting better at it -- I now try to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work out with a trainer a couple of times a week and maintain a healthy diet . <p> I try my best to remember to do yoga and meditate to reduce stress , to make time for the social interactions and hobbies that I enjoy . On those days that I manage to accomplish it all , I feel rejuvenated ; my body is more supple and my medication requirements are reduced . The key is to remember how great it feels on those days and to walk past the dirty dishes in the sink and the laundry that needs to be folded . To go out into the chill of a late summer evening , grab my daughter 's hand and enjoy a long , carefree stroll .... knowing that hopefully as long as I " take care " 
##557250 <h> Moose Hunter Diaries -- Day 4 -- Back to the Woods <p> This is the fourth in an 8-part mini-series chronicling my experiences in the 2012 Ontario Moose Hunt . You can find the entire series here ( it will update daily as it 's published ) or check out previous years ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011 ) . The posts appear exactly one-week after they were experienced . <p> We were able to sleep in today since the pressure 's off . Although I 'm relieved that we have an animal down , there 's a nagging noise in the back of my head reminding me of the dangers of cabin fever . <p> What 's cabin fever ? We have 12 men living in close quarters . Some of us are related to others but we 're mostly a ragtag group of guys that form a unit for a week . I can honestly say that I love them almost like family ( and I 've known them as long ) but I do n't see the guys often . We may talk once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't regularly talk to the guys . <p> The close quarters is only part of the equation . Hunting offers a lot of transitions -- you start the day bumping into people as you scramble to get ready and then find yourself in isolation for a few hours . Everyone collides together again for lunch before the afternoon hunt brings more solitude . We generally gather at camp where people explode with stories before some head back out for a pre-dark hunt and more quiet . Arriving back at camp usually offers a few hours of beer and camaraderie and loud shenanigans . The alternating pace between being more alone than you normally are switching with intense living conditions bringing you closer to people than you normally are can leave one a little twitchy . And , like anyone you live with , the things that make them endearing can sometimes become a source of frustration for no reason known to man or womankind . <p> If you can imagine 12 men starting to twitch , you can imagine cabin fever . <p> The biggest help to avoid cabin fever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the week if there 's nothing hanging ) . Knowing that we 're on the hunt for a large animal provides focus . Knowing that we used our only adult tag before 7:30AM on day 1 has got me thinking that the fever might set in . <p> We made our way to Wolf Road this morning . The ' road ' is a 100-year old logging trail that cuts through our property . Camp legend says that the original owner ( who was a family friend ) shot a wolf on this road on his first visit to the land . That story is sometimes debated as others claim that he saw it and did n't shoot it . At any rate , that 's where we started the day this morning . <p> Our first two runs had us stay in the same position . The doggers walked towards us from one direction , circles around the line and then approached from the other . All-in-all this meant sitting relatively motionless in the same spot for about three hours . <p> Some hunters call the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat idea ; the longer you sit undetected , the more undetectable you are . It 's one of the reasons why we hunt two runs in the same position ; it allows us to become invisible . <p> Invisibility is a funny super power to have though -- it comes with a curse . The longer you sit , the more your head tells you that you need to cough or clear your throat or stretch your legs or ... Well , you get the idea . It can be torture at times -- you know that clearing your throat could potentially blow your cover yet you think you need to do it but you do n't do it so you feel like you have to do it even more until you either give in or become temporarily mad . <p> 90 minutes into the first run I could hear a dogger barking frequently . This is generally a sign that the guy is turned around . The barking continued for about 5 minutes until he found his way out to me . We spoke quickly and quietly and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second run was over , we went to camp to share breakfast and stories of the day . <p> Our most veteran ( by age ) hunter saw 5 moose on the first run ! The adult male and female approached him ( we did n't have licenses for them ) and he watched for a few minutes before seeing a quick flash of brown . He got a quick peak at two calves ( which we do have licenses for ) but was n't able to get a shot off . Shortly thereafter another male moose ( this one with 1 antler ) , came out of the woods to see what was going on . <p> We learned a lot at lunch : <p> The 2 guys setting the watches had walked the furthest to get to their watch . They had tracked two of the moose into the woods -- effectively pushing them towards the doggers who then spun them back to the line . <p> One of the doggers picked up on the tracks from the four moose and started pushing them to the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moose we did n't have the tags for . The young ones stayed back and out of harms way . We committed to ensuring we had someone sitting closer to their game trail next time . <p> One of the hunters saw a deer . <p> We went back out by 1:30 . I wore far too many layers and my clothes started to collect sweat on the long walk to our watch . Sweat is the enemy out here -- the moisture will quickly transform your warmth into a chill . <p> I was sitting in a thick forest this time . It was a long , quiet sit that , thankfully , was accompanied with plenty of sun and warmth . <p> Our hunting was over by 3:15 . I decided to sit in a tree stand with a crossbow ( which also allows me to harvest deer ) for a few hours . It was a beautiful night that was especially fantastic when the sun began to drop and the forest became lit with the long shadows of early winter . <p> And that was the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . I feel good that people are seeing animals

##578852 <p> My sister , brother and sister-in-law and I had a wonderful tour of Rome with Paolo . We were leery of the idea of golf cart tour , but scheduled a four hour tour around the city . The golf cart turned out to be ideal . It was so open we felt like we were in the city , like we could reach out and touch it . Visibility from the golf cart was great , and it was easier to get on and off the cart than into and out of a car . The golf cart allowed us to drive into places we could n't get to in a car , and we saw much more of the city than we would have walking ( and it saved our feet ) .

##580051 <p> On November 17 , I read from Born from Silence at two penitentiaries in Gravenhurst , Ontario : Beaver Creek and Fenbrook Institutions during Restorative Justice Week . This year the theme was " Fostering a Restorative World View " . In three of the four readings with inmates and staff ( held separately ) , the reading was done in a circle . I am so grateful to chaplains Harry Nigh , Eusebia da Silva and the chaplains of both institutions : Arn Main ; Miles Schell and Abraham Yonas for inviting me to do this . <p> It was one more layer of healing for me as the men and the staff listened to my story with attentiveness , openness and a willingness to " make room for my story " in the house of other own beings . I came home knowing something deep had been healed and transformed in me . There was no " other " anymore . I , too , was able to take in filaments of story that they were willing to share with me . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal justice system " and after four years this was one more necessary step in healing and restoration . <p> On November 21 , I also read in a circle at a Dismas Fellowship meeting , a support group for men and women released from prison . The experience was similar , but perhaps because I heard two other stories in more detail this time , I came away with their stories in the forefront of my soul . After many years of facilitating dialogue circles , this experience of reading my poetry in circle brought a new depth to my understanding of co-creating " safe containers " for shared story telling . Our world views are carried in stories .

The owners used to be this New Zealand couple , now it 's this very nice asian couple . They 've really expanded their food menu and have made some additions I really appreciate . I ate here all the time as it was right next to my office building , here 's what I liked and do n't like . <p> LIKES : 1 . Tons of vegan options , both savory and sweet . 2 . Gluten free if you 're into that 3 . Almond milk if you 're into that 4 . I LOVED the quinoa bowl . Seriously , they have quinoa ? So awesome ! ! ! I would order it with tofu , cooked broccoli , raw carrots , beets &; sprouts , and peanut lime dressing . Sooo yummy and what a perfect healthy lunch ! ! ! ! <p> DISLIKES : 1 . I was never a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw lots of people order this stuff , but I did n't think the quality was all that great , and it seemed pricey for what you got . <p> ATMOSPHERE : The cafe seating area is quite large for Yaletown and for being a cafe . It 's a nice spot to hang out with friends althought it can get a little chilly in the winter . Also there are no windows besides at the front entrance so the atmosphere is a little dark/cave-like . <h> Review from Richard S. <p> Note : This review is based on an experience from spring of 2011 ( I figured I should finished it ) . I have n't been back since .... Maybe they 've gotten their act together ? <p> ----- <p> The food here is decent , but I think this past lunch trip makes this place a write-off . All of these things happened during a single visit : <p> 1 . I grabbed a can of tonic water from the drink fridge and it had pieces of old rice on it . Rice so old that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full sandwich , they gave me a half one . I had to correct this . <p> 3 . Friend order a half sandwich , they gave him a full . <p> 4 . Friend got his soup and it was cold . He took it back and someone put it in the microwave for him . The microwave finished , someone else took it out of he microwave and left it on the counter waited 5 minutes . Eventually he grabbed someone and said " that 's my soup " . The girl then poured it back in the soup pot and re-dished it to him . He had eaten from it . <p> I 'm sorry Bean Around the World , but the service at this location is slow service and confused . Based on what I saw this day , I 'm would n't want to come back here . <h> Review from Young Pop Sophisticate Y. <p> Sometimes I 'll treat myself to a latte and a slice of loaf , which is how I found myself here after an early-morning dentist appointment . <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I though so and jokingly voiced my $0.02 , promptly cancelling my loaf order ( hey , a gal needs a pick-me-up once in a while ) . <p> Based on the attitude I got from the cashier , she was not amused . Eyes were rolled . Looks were exchanged between the barista and my nemesis . This is the second time I 've visited the location and on both visits I felt like I 'd receive better counter service at McDonalds . <p> The latte is good , but Yaletown can keep their $8 morning pick-me-ups . I work a union job , fer Chrissakes ! <h> Review from Elizabeth L. <p> Like a fool , I went back to this location of Bean Around the World today because I was desperate for beans . <p> The half-pound bag of coffee that was advertised to cost $7.50 on the store 's board , but which I paid $9 for not two weeks ago now cost a whopping $10 . I clearly must have looked like a fool too because the barista told me very matter-of-factly that the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they " did n't have time to change the board " yet . Sure . <p> And , yes : the price of a half-pound bag of coffee now costs 33% more than advertised . To put it politely , something seems completely fishy about this whole operation . <p> On the flip side , I can now say with a degree of certainty that I will not going back to this location . Ever . <h> Review from Linzi M. <p> If I 'm not in my apartment , find me at Bean Around . It gives Starbucks a smack upside the head . With a full food counter , you can order paninis , wraps , pasta and bagels . Then you can move onto desserts and pack some more fat on that ass with gorgeous looking cookies and cakes . They have a full board of coffees to choose from , but sadly no flavoured blends , and you can buy freshly roasted beans too . I asked for tea , server asked ' what kind ' , I said ' what you got ' , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is n't cheap , but you pay a little extra for the funky couches and chairs , relaxed ambience and the jazz music ( no Taylor Swift here ) . I did have to listen to two inane marketing women chatter and I think a guy tried to pick me up by asking ' um do you know what kind of rice this is ' . Me ' du n no , brown rice ? ' . Conversation over . I 'm a tough nut to crack . <h> Review from Trudi C. <p> Biiiiiiiig selection of food ! Lots of choice of cookies , cake slices , plus a wide range of sandwiches , rice bowl dishes , soups , etc . So for whatever reason , I did n't order anything . It got extremely busy in there at lunch , very noisy and crowded.Much bigger inside then I thought , is like a Tardis ! The latte I had was ok , nothing to write home about , and scorching hot ! My tongue was burnt the rest of the day ; ) <h> Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... they looked soooooo good ! but I was hungry .. and did n't feel like coffee . There is a huge food selection .. and I remember my roomate saying how he had n't had a jamaican pattie in so long ... and then i saw it : Jamaican Vegetable Pattie . SOLD . It had beans , chickpeas , potatos , spices etc etc ... I was warned it was spicy and it WAS ! ... once grilled , it looked a lot smaller and a lot less filling .. but I still enjoyed it when I got back to work . Their sandwiches and and paninis look delicious and you can get a half portion as well ... The space looked nice .. it was big too ... the service was a little slow and there were a lot of people working .. but I guess you ca n't control the speed of a grill and a steaming pitcher ... <p> I want a cup of coffee now ... I am sure this 3 - star rating would be better . <h> Review from Roanna Z. <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of missing socks and pens . <p> I 'm not a huge fan of the coffee at Bean Around , but I usually jive on the interiors . This one in particular has always been my fave for the character and age of the place . The old floors and brick walls , the comfy-cool living room type lounge , the large screen for sports ... ( or the odd Royal Wedding ... lol ) What 's not to love about this part of historic Yaletown ? <p> The espresso I find to be burnt beyond flavour , but I do n't mind it too much for Soy Capp 's because they have a tendency to sweeten up a bitter bean . Great stop for pre-made sammies and quick bites with lots of variety , and they even carry goods from my favorite local GF bakery EightFold Eats . http : //tinyurl.com/3oe27 ... <h> Review from Victoria R. <p> This has been my ' go-to ' for breakfast and lunch at work . I still love their food and think it 's a really great place , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hit or miss here . The staff are regulars , and sometimes they greet you with a smile , other days they actually ignore you . You order from them and they make no eye contact , looking straight at the cashier , and do n't use even the most basic of human civilities . <p> In addition , they have a coffee punch card ( 10 coffees , 1 free ) , and they make no effort to promote it to people whenever someone buys a coffee , and actually look at you begrudgingly when you ask them to stamp it . <p> Some of the staff here are always pleasant - but the majority have mood swings that make me wonder if a cafe can be diagnosed with bipolar disorder . <h> Review from Megan S. <p> Love the marble pound cake here . Love the amount of seating here . Love the friendly staff . Love the hot chocolate- very chocolaty ! Love that this is on my way to the bank , and I can easily step in for a snack . <p> Do n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Do n't love the music ( sometimes none ) Do n't love the guy at the next table who kept clearing his throat every 5 seconds ( but he 's not always here ) <p> I 'm not sure that I 'd go out of my way for this place , but it is a nice change when you 're desperate to avoid the StarLenz takeover of Vancouver . <h> Review from Bradley C. <p> Whenever I meet a friend for lunch in Yaletown , I suggest Bean around the World . I love their food selection , and the price is always right ! Nowhere in Yaletown ( that I 've discovered , anyway ) can you get food of this quality that does n't cost an arm and a leg . <p> The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars - because I am a fan - is that the service is not always consistent . Sometimes , I am greeted with friendly , welcoming smiles . At other times , I feel like I am burdening the staff with my business . I know we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out on your loyal customers ! <p> Nevertheless , I will keep going back , and look forward to my next visit . <h> Review from A E. <p> Top 3 things that I do NOT miss from frequent business trips to Vancouver : 3 ) 30% chance of flight delays - damn Air Alaska ! 2 ) Seeing the depressing " Rain / Sleet " weather prediction in the elevator hall of Sheraton Wall Center every January and February morning 1 ) On most days - getting to work at 8 AM , working through lunch til 8PM , grabbing Subway sandwich on the way back to the hotel , AND resuming work again . <p> Top 3 things that I missed from frequent business trips to Vancouver : 3 ) Being able to expense awesome meals and hotel stays that would 've otherwise broken the bank a long time ago . 2 ) Being able to accumulate mileage and credit card points courtesy of the firm 1 ) Morning cafe mocha and giant oatmeal raisin cookies from Bean Around The World . <p> Having spent almost a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Bean Around The World in one direction , and another 10 steps away from Starbucks in another , never once did I ever step foot in the latter . <p> Bean Around The World serves the best cafe mocha in Vancouver . Or maybe , because my options are limited , having no car and no time to spare in between conference calls / working furiously to get things out of the door / much-needed shut-eye / fire drills , I have never had a chance to stumble across other coffee shops . <p> That being said , I do n't mind it .

I was very pleasantly surprised to find a huge variety of vegan and gluten free treats , including a date &; flax loaf , cookies , brownies , energy bars and many others . Seriously it would take several days and many , many extra calories to try just their gluten free stuff , and they of course have a much larger selection of sandwiches , cookies , muffins , etc . On two separate visits I tried the date &; flax loaf and the vegan wheat-free muffin ( not sure if the muffin was technically gluten free but decided to risk it because I could n't figure out which ingredient would contain gluten , if it was wheat free ) , and both were very tasty and satisfying . So definitely a place for us gluten avoiders to come if you 're downtown and craving baked goods or just sugar in general . I find the other places I know with these types of products are located outside the downtown core . <p> I have to say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to sit with your coffee for a couple of hours and read or study .

##592350 <p> A person is " charged " within the meaning of s.11(b) as of ( a ) the service of a summons , the execution of a warrant pursuant to the laying of an information under s. 455.3 of the Criminal Code , or as of the moment a person is informed by the authorities of their existence ; or ( b ) the issuance of an appearance notice under s.451 of the Code or release from custody under ss. 452 or 453 of the Code ; or ( c ) as of the arrest , in the case of all other arrested persons not covered by ( a ) or ( b ) . Accordingly , there will be instances where a person might be considered as " charged " prior to the actual charge for which he is being prosecuted . For example , if the Crown withdraws the charge to charge under a different section but for the same transaction , it might well be appropriate to consider that , for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the time elapsed , the applicant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.C.C. ) , 1986 CanLII 17 ( S.C.C. ) , 1986 1 S.C.R. 863 ; Carter v. R. , 1986 CanLII 18 ( S.C.C. ) , 1986 CanLII 18 ( S.C.C. ) , 1986 CanLII 18 ( S.C.C. ) , 1986 1 S.C.R. 981 . <p> It can not be said that this Court in Carter , supra , adopted the minority view in Mills , supra , on the question of the extension of the meaning of the word " charged " developed by Lamer J. In Carter , Lamer J. , with the agreement of seven judges who heard the case , clearly stated that an accused was charged upon the swearing of the information , and Carter supports the view that the pre-charge delay is not a factor for consideration under s. 11(b) . A person is therefore " charged with an offence " within the meaning of s. 11 when an information is sworn alleging an offence against him , or where a direct indictment is laid against him when no information is sworn . It would follow , then , that the reckoning of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable time will commence with the information or indictment , where no information has been laid , and will continue until the completion of the trial . Pre-information delay will not be a factor . The specific language of s. 11 should not be ignored and the meaning of the word " charged " should not be twisted in an attempt to extend the operation of the section into the pre-charge period . The purpose of s. 11(d) is clear . It is concerned with the period between the laying of the charge and the conclusion of the trial and it provides that a person charged with an offence will be promptly dealt with : R. v. Kalanj , 1989 CanLII 63 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 63 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 63 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 1 S.C.R. 1594 ; R. v. Potvin , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 2 S.C.R. 880 . <p> It seems obvious that the Charter can only apply to the activities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the activities of a foreign government , especially when these take place in the foreign country . The delays referred to in this extradition case are those of the United States prosecutorial authorities in that country in failing to make a timely request for extradition . Section 11(b) has no application in this case : U.S.A. v. Allard and Charette , 1987 CanLII 50 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 CanLII 50 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 CanLII 50 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 1 S.C.R. 564 . <p> In Irwin Toy Ltd. , it was not the absence of penal proceedings per se that precluded the respondent corporation from invoking s. 7 . Rather , the Court focused on the language of the right in combination with the nature of the specific interests embodied therein , and concluded that in that context , s. 7 could not logically apply to corporate entities . That decision does not rule out the possibility of corporations asserting other Charter guarantees . On the contrary , Irwin Toy Ltd. went only so far as to establish an appropriate analytical framework : whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whether it can establish that it has an interest falling within the scope of the guarantee , and one which accords with the purpose of that provision . It should be kept in mind that " person " includes a corporation under the general provisions of the Interpretation Act . We must also remember that corporate criminal liability is essentially vicarious liability based upon the acts and omissions of individuals : a corporation may only act through agents . Extending Charter guarantees to corporations will , in some circumstances , afford a measure of protection to those individuals . In Askov , infra , Cory J. was of the view that there is a " community or societal interest " in s. 11(b) : " All members of the community are thus entitled to see that the justice system works fairly , efficiently and with reasonable dispatch . " The societal interest applies to corporate offenders as it does to individual accused . To hold otherwise would be to suggest that the community is somehow less interested in seeing the former brought to trial . It would also suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be accorded " fair " and " just " treatment . This Court is not prepared to accept either of those propositions . Accordingly , the phrase " Any person charged with an offence " in the context of s. 11(b) of the Charter includes corporations : R. v. CIP Inc. , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 1 S.C.R. 843 . <p> Section 11(b) does not apply to delay in respect of an appeal from conviction by the accused nor an appeal from an acquittal by the Crown . There is no distinction in this regard between an acquittal after trial and a judicial stay . Section 11 of the Charter is to be interpreted in a manner that harmonizes as much as possible all of its subsections . Many of the rights found in s. 11 can not apply to appeals and are restricted to the pre-trial or trial process . If " a person charged " in s. 11(b) necessarily includes the accused as a party to an appeal then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsections of the section . An examination of the various subsections shows s. 11(a) , ( c ) , ( f ) and ( i ) clearly do not apply to appeals . Section 11(e) could not apply to an appellant who has been acquitted and other subsections are primarily concerned with what occurs at trial although exceptionally they might have some application on appeal . As a general rule , " a person charged " under s. 11 does not include an accused person who is party to an appeal . A particular subsection may apply to appeal proceedings as an exception to the general rule if its purpose and language support this conclusion . After considering the purpose and language of s. 11(b) , this Court has concluded that the interpretation that gives effect to both of these elements and best harmonizes the other subsections is that the subsection applies to the pre-trial period and the trial process but not to appellate proceedings : R. v. Potvin , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter comprises a wide range of rights which protect the accused from the moment he or she is first charged with an offence to the final resolution of the matter , including sentencing . All of these rights inhere in a person " charged with an offence " . It follows that " charged with an offence " can not be restricted to a particular phase of the criminal process . Rather , what is required is an interpretation that " harmonizes as much as possible " all of the subsections of s. 11 : R. v. Potvin , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 2 S.C.R. 880 . Textually , the only feasible interpretation of " charged with an offence " is an expansive one which includes both the pre-conviction and post-conviction periods . It may be that , depending on the subsection at issue , " charged with an offence " in s. 11 bears different meanings . " Charged with an offence " may refer to the acts of swearing an information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the protections contained in s. 11 . " Charged with an offence " , in turn , may also describe the status of an individual who , once the information has been sworn or the indictment laid , is the subject of criminal proceedings . The s. 11 rights available to an individual who falls under this meaning of " charged with an offence " will vary with the stage of proceedings . Different rights will attach to the individual as he or she moves through the criminal proceedings . Charged with an offence " , in the context of s. 11(b) is not confined to the period before entry of a guilty plea and may extend to the sentencing process . The next question is whether the phrase " tried within a reasonable time " in s. 11(b) is capable of extending to sentencing . A purposive reading suggests that " s. 11(b) protects against an overlong subjection to a pending criminal case and aims to relieve against the stress and anxiety which continue until the outcome of the case is final " , ( R. v. Rahey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 1 S.C.R. 588 ) Since the " outcome " of a criminal case is not known until the conclusion of sentencing , and since sentencing involves adjudication , it seems reasonable to conclude that " tried " as used in s. 11(b) extends to sentencing : R. v. MacDougall , ( S.C.C. , October 29 , 1998 ) . <p> A person who is the subject of proceedings under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code is not a " person charged with an offence " under s.11 . The sanctions that may be imposed under the Code are compensatory in nature , not penal : Kodellas et al . v. Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission ( 1987 ) , 34 D.L.R. ( 4th ) 130 ( Sask . Q.B. ) ; appeal allowed in part 1989 CanLII 284 ( SK C.A. ) , ( 1989 ) , 60 D.L.R. ( 4th ) 143 ( Sask . C.A. ) . <p> In R. v. Kalanj , supra , this Court dealt with a situation in which the accused were arrested after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused were fingerprinted and released but were advised not to leave town , that they would be charged and that a summons would issue . More than eight months later charges were laid . This Court was invited to hold that , because of the involvement of the interests that underlie s. 11(b) , it should extend to the pre-charge delay . The invasion of the interests protected by s. 11 in the broad sense could certainly be equated to the consequences of a charge . The stigma and anxiety resulting from arrest and fingerprinting would exceed the consequences flowing from laying of a charge followed by a summons . The restraint on liberty was the equivalent to that which occurs when a charge is laid and the accused is released on bail . The delay pre-trial has the same effect on the freshness of the evidence as post-charge delay . Nonetheless , this Court held that the accused were not persons charged until a formal charge was laid and that s. 11(b) did not apply . This judgment was applied in R. v. L. ( W.K. ) , 1991 CanLII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 1991 CanLII 54 ( S.C.C. ) , 1991 1 S.C.R. 1091 , to rule out review of pre-charge delay unless the accused can establish a breach under s. 7 : R. v. Potvin , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 113 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 2 S.C.R. 880 . <p> The language invoked in s.11(b) makes it clearer that the reasonable delay referred to is post-charge delay than the language used in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . However , in determining whether the delay between the time of the charge and trial is reasonable , what has transpired before the laying of the charge is not irrelevant . Further , an examination of what has transpired before the laying of the charge need not be restricted to a consideration of whether government officials have deliberately refrained from laying the charge so as to prejudice intentionally an accused from making full answer and defence . For example , if the laying of the charge had been preceded by a lengthy and exhaustive investigation , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary because of the complexity of the charge and the requirement for further investigation : R. v. Young ( 1984 ) , 13 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 1 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> It is delay after the laying of the charges that is the subject matter of the protection under s.11(b) and not delay before the laying of the charges . But in considering what amount of delay after the laying of the charges is reasonable , and what amount of delay after the laying of the charges is unreasonable , in the circumstances of a particular case , it is proper to consider all the relevant events which go to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of that post-charge delay including what has occurred and what time has passed in the period between the commission of the offence and the laying of the charges : R. v. Devji reflex , ( 1985 ) , 19 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 310 ( B.C.C.A. ) ; R. v. Kalanj reflex , ( 1986 ) , 26 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 136 ( B.C.C.A. ) ; appeal dismissed 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 63 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 1 S.C.R. 1594 . <p> While the preferment of a direct indictment would constitute a new proceeding , it does not follow that the commencement of such new proceedings must necessarily relegate prior proceedings against an accused , based on the same evidence and making the same allegation , to mere " history " -- a factor not to be considered in the context of his right to be tried within a reasonable time . The decision in R. v. Antoine , infra , stands as clear authority against the proposition that the commencement of what are technically new proceedings against an accused must start the clock anew for the purposes of s.11(b) : Garton v. Whelan ( 1984 ) , 14 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 450 ( Ont . S.C. ) . <p> Section 11(b) covers delays during the trial for which the judge is responsible . In assessing the reasonableness of a delay , the court may consider the prejudice to the accused , including prejudice to his ability to make full answer and defence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1987 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1987 1 S.C.R. 588 . <p> While there are points of disagreement in this Court 's previous decisions on s. 11(b) , there appears to be general agreement that the Court must weigh or balance the following factors in coming to a conclusion : ( 1 ) the length of the delay ; ( 2 ) the reason for the delay , including limits on institutional resources and the inherent time requirements of the case ; ( 3 ) waiver of time periods ; and ( 4 ) prejudice to the accused . However , there is disagreement as to the mechanics in balancing these factors and the constituent components of ( 4 ) , prejudice . Here , the length of the delay was abnormal and was not adequately explained . With respect to waiver , agreement by an accused to a future hearing date will in most circumstances give rise to an inference that the accused waives his right to subsequently allege that an unreasonable delay has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a future date for a trial or a preliminary inquiry would generally be characterized as more than silence . But in this case , apart from agreeing to a date , the other actions of the accused 's counsel rebut any possible inference that he waived his rights . In this particular context , the inference of prejudice is so strong that it would be difficult to disagree with the view of Lamer J. in Mills and Rahey that it is virtually irrebuttable . It is a more difficult question in contexts in which greater resort is made to this factor because the case is otherwise closer to the line . In such circumstances , the accused may wish to bolster the presumption that there is prejudice by leading evidence that there has been unusual prejudice by reason of special circumstances . On the other hand , the Crown may wish to assert that a delay which is not excessively beyond the norm should be excused because there has been minimal prejudice . Should the accused or the Crown in such circumstances be precluded from arguing or leading evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that will have to be resolved , but that is not necessary to a decision in this case . To the extent that a finding of prejudice is necessary , the motions judge found on the evidence that there is actual prejudice : R. v. Smith , 1989 CanLII 12 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 12 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 12 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 2 S.C.R. 1120 . <p> Section 11(b) explicitly focusses upon the individual interest of liberty and security of the person . Nonetheless there is , at least by inference , a community or societal interest implicit in s. 11(b) . The failure of the justice system to deal fairly , quickly and efficiently with criminal trials inevitably leads to the community 's frustration with the judicial system and eventually to a feeling of contempt for court procedures . When a trial takes place without unreasonable delay , with all witnesses available and memory is fresh , it is far more certain that the guilty parties who committed the crimes will be convicted and punished and those that did not , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary individual interest and the inferred society interest is accepted as the true aim of s. 11(b) , then the various factors which should be taken into consideration in determining whether there has been an unreasonable delay can be clarified and set forth in a consistent test . Those factors , drawn largely from this Court 's decisions in Conway , supra , and Smith , supra , are : ( i ) length of the delay . Very lengthy delays may be such that they can not be justified for any reason ; ( ii ) explanation for the delay : ( a ) delays attributable to the Crown . Such delays will weigh in favour of the accused . Complex cases which require longer time for preparation , a greater expenditure of resources by Crown officers , and the longer use of institutional facilities will justify delays longer than those acceptable in simple cases ; ( b ) systemic or institutional delays . Delays occasioned by inadequate resources must weigh against the Crown . Institutional delays should be considered in comparative terms , as between similarly situated communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays will always fall upon the Crown ; ( c ) delays attributable to the accused . Certain actions of the accused will justify delays . There may be instances where it can be demonstrated by the Crown that the actions of the accused were undertaken for the purposes of delaying the trial ; ( iii ) waiver . For a waiver to be valid it must be informed , unequivocal and freely given . The burden of showing that a waiver should be inferred falls upon the Crown ; and ( iv ) prejudice to the accused . There is a general , and in the case of very long delays an often virtually irrebuttable presumption of prejudice to the accused resulting from the passage of time . Where the Crown can demonstrate that there was no prejudice to the accused flowing from a delay , then such proof may serve to excuse the delay . It is also open to the accused to call evidence to demonstrate actual prejudice : R. v. Askov , 1990 CanLII 45 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 CanLII 45 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The development of the jurisprudence relating to s. 11(b) is instructive in that it underscores the importance of avoiding rigidity in the interpretation of new constitutional rights early in the life of a constitutional document . Embarking as this Court did on uncharted waters it is not surprising that the course we steered has required , and may require in the future , some alteration in its direction to accord with experience . While the Court has at times indicated otherwise , it is now accepted that the factors to be considerated in analyzing how long is too long may be listed as follows : ( 1 ) the length of the delay ; ( 2 ) waiver of time periods ; ( 3 ) the reasons for the delay , including ( a ) inherent time requirements of the case , ( b ) action of the accused , ( c ) actions of the Crown , ( d ) limits on institutional resources , and ( e ) other reasons for delay ; and ( 4 ) prejudice to the accused . An inquiry into unreasonable delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter . The applicant has the legal burden of establishing a Charter violation . The inquiry , which can be complex , should only be undertaken if the period is of sufficient length to raise an issue as to its reasonableness . If the length of the delay is unexceptional , no inquiry is warranted and no explanation for the delay is called for unless the applicant is able to raise the issue of reasonableness of the period by reference to other factors such as prejudice . If , for example , the applicant is in custody , a shorter period of delay will raise the issue . Institutional delay is the most common source of delay and the most difficult to reconcile with the dictates of s. 11(b) . It was the major source of the delay in Askov . This is the period that starts to run when the parties are ready for trial but the system can not accommodate them . We live in a country with a rapidly growing population in many regions and in which resources are limited . In applying s. 11(b) , account must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken of the fact that the state does not have unlimited funds and other government programs compete for the available resources , this consideration can not be used to render s. 11(b) meaningless . There is a point in time at which the Court will no longer tolerate delay based on the plea of inadequate resources . This period of time may be referred to as an administrative guideline . This guideline is neither a limitation period nor a fixed ceiling on delay . Such a guideline was suggested in Askov and was treated by some courts as a limitation period . The purpose of the suggested period was not that it was to be treated as a limitation period and inflexible . The purpose in expressing a guideline is two-fold . First , it is to recognize that there is a limit to the delay that can be tolerated on account of resource limitations . Second , it is to avoid each application pursuant to s. 11(b) being turned into a trial of the budgetary policy of the government as it relates to the administration of justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely mechanical fashion . It must lend itself and yield to other factors . Rapidly changing conditions may place a sudden and temporary strain on resources . Such changing conditions should not result in an amnesty for persons charged in that region . Rather this fact should be taken into account in applying the guideline . On the other hand , when the case load has been constant over a substantial period of time the delay envisaged by the guideline may be regarded as excessive . The application of a guideline will be influenced by the presence or absence of prejudice . If an accused is in custody or , while not in custody , subject to restrictive bail terms or conditions or otherwise experiences substantial prejudice , the period of acceptable institutional delay may be shortened to reflect the court 's concern . On the other hand , in a case in which there is no prejudice or prejudice is slight , the guideline may be applied to reflect this fact . It is appropriate for this Court to suggest a period of institutional delay of between 8 to 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to institutional delay after committal for trial , this Court would not depart from the range of 6 to 8 months that was suggested in Askov . In such a case this institutional delay would be in addition to the delay prior to committal . This reflects the fact that after committal the system must cope with a different court with its special resource problems . It is therefore essential to take into account the inevitability of this additional institutional delay . These suggested time periods are intended for the guidance of trial courts generally . These periods will no doubt require adjustment by trial courts in the various regions of the country to take into account local conditions and they will need to be adjusted from time to time to reflect changing circumstances . The court of appeal in each province will play a supervisory role in seeking to achieve uniformity subject to the necessity of taking into account the special conditions and problems of different regions in the province . This Court has decided in several judgments that the right protected by s. 11(b) is not restricted to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case by asserting the right to a trial within a reasonable time . Implicit in this finding is that prejudice to the accused can be inferred from prolonged delay . The longer the delay the more likely that such an inference will be drawn . In circumstances in which the prejudice is not inferred and is not otherwise proved , the basis for the enforcement of the individual right is seriously undermined . In taking into account inaction by the accused , the Court must be careful not to subvert the principle that there is no legal obligation on the accused to assert the right . Inaction may , however , be relevant in assessing the degree of prejudice , if any , that an accused has suffered as a result of delay . Apart , however , from inferred prejudice , either party may rely on evidence to either show prejudice or dispel such a finding . The degree of prejudice or absence thereof is also an important factor in determining the length of institutional delay that will be tolerated . The application of any guideline will be influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in bringing the case to trial in the Provincial Court can hardly be described as a model of dispatch . A period in the order of 10 months would not be unreasonable . While this Court has suggested that a guideline of 8 to 10 months be used by courts to assess institutional delay in Provincial Courts , deviations of several months in either direction can be justified by the presence or absence of prejudice . While the accused was not required to do anything to expedite her trial , her inaction can be taken into account in assessing prejudice . It can be concluded that the accused was content with the pace with which things were proceeding and that therefore there was little or no prejudice occasioned by the delay . The delay in this case was not unreasonable : R. v. Morin , 1992 CanLII 89 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 89 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 89 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 1 S.C.R. 771 . <p> The Crown suggested here that because the appellant was charged with a regulatory offence , the allowable time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it would be in other circumstances . This Court is not persuaded by that argument . The right to be tried within a reasonable time is engaged when a person is " charged with an offence " . The Charter does not distinguish between types of offences , and to do so for the purposes of assessing the reasonableness of delay would unduly stretch the principles of contextual analysis . The interest of an accused in the availability and reliability of substantiating evidence will exist irrespective of the nature of the offence with which that person is charged . In Askov , this Court held that there is a " general , and in the case of very long delays an often virtually irrebuttable presumption of prejudice to the accused resulting from the passage of time " . This is the key requisite to a successful s. 11(b) application . A court may infer or presume prejudice , or it may be proven . The corporate appellant relies upon that presumption in this case . The respondent contends that it can not . It submits that the inference of prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused , not the fair trial interest . Because a corporate entity does not have the right to liberty and security of the person within the meaning of the Charter , the argument goes that it therefore can not invoke the presumption referred to in Askov . The respondent submits that in order to succeed on its s. 11(b) claim , the appellant must persuade the court that its ability to make full answer and defence has been impaired . The respondent 's argument on this particular issue is persuasive . The most compelling argument which has been mounted for a presumption of prejudice has been with respect to the effects of delay on security of the person . Once concern about that factor is nullified , as it is when dealing with a corporation , the greatest part of the basis for a presumption of prejudice collapses . A corporate accused must be able to establish that its fair trial interest has been irremediably prejudiced . This Court uses the phrase " irremediably prejudiced " because there are some forms of prejudice that a court can remove , notably by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. v. CIP Inc. , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 95 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 1 S.C.R. 843 . <p> While the societal interest recognized in R. v. Askov , 1990 CanLII 45 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 CanLII 45 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 CanLII 45 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 2 S.C.R. 1199 , and affirmed in R. v. Morin , requires that account be taken of the fact that charges against young offenders be proceeded with promptly , it is merely one of the factors to be balanced with others in the manner set out in R. v. Morin . Applying those factors , we agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that the delay complained of was not unreasonable . The time required for an application for transfer to adult court and appeals relating thereto is part of the inherent time requirements of a case under the Young Offenders Act . The application for transfer must , however , be made within a reasonable time and pursued meritoriously and in good faith . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have reasonably proceeded faster . We see no reason to disturb this finding : R. v. D. ( Stephen ) , 1992 CanLII 58 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 58 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 58 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 2 S.C.R. 161 . <p> The inherent time required to process a particular case must not be confused with the average time required to process a case of that type . All cases have inherent time requirements needed to get a case into the system and to complete that case . While the complexity of a case is often cited as a factor contributing to delay resulting from inherent time requirements , each case will bring its own set of facts which must be evaluated . In orther words , the inherent time requirements of a case are not limited to commonplace delays which occur in every situation , but may include delay due to extraordinary and unforeseeable events . A trial judge falling ill may be such an event . Where this occurs and where it is not reasonable for the Crown to immediately apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge 's illness may be regarded as part of the inherent time required to complete the case . At the point , however , where it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge replaced , the inherent delay due to the judge 's illness changes to Crown delay . The inherent time requirements of sentencing include the time required to prepare pre-sentence material , subpoena necessary witnesses and schedule the sentencing proceeding . They may also include a judge 's illness up to the point when it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge removed and replaced . The reasonableness of the inherent time requirements of sentencing must be assessed on a case by case basis . The inherent time requirements of sentencing do not fall under the time guidelines for the pre-conviction period as set out in Morin , supra , and Askov , supra . Delay due to the illness of a judge may constitute systemic delay where the Crown delays bringing what would be a reasonable motion to replace the judge who has fallen ill because the Crown knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to a case where the Crown applies to remove the judge and an order for replacement is made but an unreasonable delay in replacing the judge results because there is no other judge available . The same reasoning would apply to unreasonable delays in replacing the judge due to a shortage of courtrooms or other necessary institutional resources : R. v. MacDougall , ( S.C.C. , October 29 , 1998 ) . <p> The decision in Askov , supra , has frequently been given a minimalist or reductionist interpretation . When mere lip service is paid to the required balancing of the four factors , the trial within a reasonable time issue is often resolved by the mechanical computation of the systemic time required to bring the charge to trial and the six to eight months referred to in Askov is then given the force of a judicially developed limitation . This isolates and over-emphasizes systemic delay and reduces the concept of reasonableness to a simplistic computation of time . This is not what Askov stands for . The charges in Askov were not stayed because they had become stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a two-year systemic delay subsequent to committal in a case that was not complex and where some of the accused had been subject to lengthy periods of pre-trial custody . In the present case , there is no evidence upon which to adequately analyze whether a systemic delay of eight and a half months in the Provincial Court in the District of Algoma was reasonable . The determination of what constitutes unreasonable systemic delay in the various jurisdictions across Canada can not be avoided by using the six to eight months range that the Supreme Court in Askov said was the outside limit for bringing a case to trial after committal in the District Court in Peel . The methodology put forward in Askov invites a search for comparables and specifically rejects the notion of either a national standard or an upper limit . Here , not only is there no indication that Peel and Algoma are comparable jurisdictions , but also , and much more significantly , delays in the former District Court , from indictment to trial , should not be viewed as being equivalent to delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even to preliminary inquiry . The Provincial Court is an intake court ; the available statistics indicate that the Provincial Court is a court of much greater volume than the former District Court . Under the methods set out in Askov , there can be no useful comparison made between the District Court in Peel and the Provincial Court in Algoma . Moreover , conclusions about systemic delay and its unreasonableness should not rest exclusively on judicial notice . Judges should be particularly wary of relying on nothing more than their own information and perceptions as to the current state of the criminal justice system and , more significantly , of the causes of this state of affairs . Acceptable time limits must not only be set locally , but adjusted periodically to reflect the comparative position of that jurisdiction , at that time , to the best similar one in the country . In view of the current situation in many Ontario jurisdictions , an administrative target of trials within eight months is a reasonable goal and , one has to hope , a realistic one . Whether that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factor to be considered in a s. 11(b) application , along with the total length of the delay , waiver and prejudice to the accused . Eight months may turn out to have been too ambitious , in the short run , for the high volume provincial courts . It may well be that ten or even twelve months from charge to trial date would be an acceptable period of delay in a jurisdiction that would , for instance run a fast track for cases which need to be expedited because of a special prejudice caused by the delay . In the end , judges can not be told , once and for all , at which precise moment society has lost its entitlement to have an allegation of crime heard and tried : R. v. Bennett ( 1991 ) , 64 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 499 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; appeal dismissed 1992 CanLII 61 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 61 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 CanLII 61 ( S.C.C. ) , 1992 2 S.C.R. 168 . <p> The general principles set out in Askov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular need to conclude youth court proceedings without unreasonable delay , consistent with the goals of the Young Offenders Act and the principles upon which it is based . However , young persons are not entitled to a special constitutional guarantee to trial within a reasonable time , which differs in substance from that available to adults . Nonetheless , as a general proposition , youth court proceedings should proceed to a conclusion more quickly than those in the adult criminal justice system . For young persons , the effect of time may be distorted . If treatment is required and is to be made part of the Young Offenders Act disposition process , it is best begun with as little delay as is possible . From a conceptual standpoint , the basis of the need to try young persons with reasonable dispatch is best analyzed and understood if it is viewed as part of the consideration of prejudice , one of the four factors referred to in Askov . These four factors have to be balanced in each case to determine if an accused , young or old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The constitutional right remains constant . It differs in its application to young persons because there is a particular element of prejudice which may result if the trial of a young person is unduly delayed : R. v. M. ( G.C. ) reflex , ( 1991 ) , 65 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 232 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> Where the delay in prosecution and trial is a direct consequence of the accused voluntarily remaining outside the jurisdiction of the court and in circumstances that render him immune from prosecution , the lapse of time does not accrue to his advantage on any subsequent application pleading an infringement of s.11(b) . The intentional absence of the accused from the jurisdiction making prosecution impossible can not garner for him time that will accrue to his benefit : Doyle v. R. et al . reflex , ( 1985 ) , 52 Nfld . &; P.E.I.R. 231 ( Nfld . S.C. ) . <p> Resisting extradition is an example of an action voluntarily taken by an accused that causes delay and that must be considered in deciding whether the overall length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 708 P.2d 227 , the Montana Supreme Court observed that " the right of a defendant to resist formal extradition , however , can not be charged to the State when computing the length of delay for a speedy trial , if the State is acting in good faith " . This observation applies in assessing whether the length of the delay is unreasonable under s. 11(b) : R. v. White and Sennet 1997 CanLII 845 ( ON C.A. ) , 1997 CanLII 845 ( ON C.A. ) , 1997 CanLII 845 ( ON C.A. ) , ( 1997 ) , 99 O.A.C. 1 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> It is right and proper for the accused to utilize all the legal processes that are available to him in making full answer and defence . However , he can not then say that the time consumed in undertaking those processes has been so great that he has been deprived of the right to be tried in a reasonable time . It can not amount to a breach of s. 11(b) for the Crown to exercise fairly and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it by a constitutionally valid statute , the Criminal Code . It should not be forgotten that the commmunity has an interest in seeing that a criminal case is determined on its merits after a fair trial . So long as the delays are not unreasonable , those which are inevitable to the operation of the very system which seeks to provide a fair judicial determination of criminal charges by way of a trial should not in themselves be the basis of granting a stay of proceedings : R. v. Conway reflex , ( 1988 ) , 26 O.A.C. 389 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; appeal dismissed 1989 CanLII 66 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 66 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 CanLII 66 ( S.C.C. ) , 1989 1 S.C.R 1659 . <p> The right of an accused to be tried within a reasonable time does not displace the right of any party to exercise a right of appeal , unless there are exceptional circumstances such as oblique motives or repeated unsuccessful appeals or some other conduct or proceeding amounting to an abuse of which in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the accused under s. 11(b) was not infringed when the Crown pursued an appeal from a judgment granting a new trial , even though the Court of Appeal determined that the Crown 's case was not a strong one and it did not call upon counsel for the accused to respond to it : Lapointe v. R. reflex , ( 1989 ) , 49 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 117 ( B.C.C.A. ) . <p> The defence argued in this case that the Crown should have severed the substantive counts from the conspiracy counts . To what extent , if any , this would have helped in terms of arranging an earlier trial date , no one said . Nor was any evidence led on this point . The Crown offered a reasonable explanation for its manner of proceeding . Neither defence counsel nor the court have the right to dictate to the Crown its strategy for prosecuting a case . This strategy may be challenged as an abuse of process . But that is not the issue here . If the suggestion is that every time a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to sever charges if and when timing problems arise , the implications for prosecuting these kinds of cases could be profound . Although the right to trial within a reasonable time is an individual right , one can not ignore the practicalities of what is involved in the Crown 's prosecution of a conspiracy case . The mere fact that an accused has been charged with conspiracy does not confer upon him some inherent advantage in asserting a claim for a s. 11(b) breach if and when one of his co-defendants causes a delay in the proceedings . To suggest severance as a simple solution ignores the very real cost to the Crown and the public involved in prosecuting separate actions . In the end , this kind of approach will only serve to contribute to further delays in the administration of justice . There may well be cases where severance is in order . But what is significant in the context of this case is that none of the defence counsel applied for severance on behalf of any of these defendants : R. v. Koruz 1992 CanLII 2822 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 3d ) 353 ( Alta . C.A. ) ; appeal dismissed sub nom . R. v. Schiewe , 1993 CanLII 130 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 130 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 CanLII 130 ( S.C.C. ) , 1993 1 S.C.R. 1134 . <p> In deciding whether some aspect of delay is an inherent time requirement of the case , it is necessary to look at the conduct which caused that delay , and to determine whether that conduct was necessary , reasonable , meritorious , and undertaken in good faith . Delay caused by conduct having those characteristics will usually be " inherent " in this context but there may be cases where , notwithstanding the best of intentions , and a valid legal position , the Crown might still have to give way in recognition of the requirements of s. 11(b) . On the other hand , if the conduct in question can properly be described as unnecessary , unreasonable , without merit , or done without good faith , then the resulting delay can not be said to be an inherent requirement of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure process of a prosecution which involved many documents . Specifically , the delay resulted from the Crown 's attempt to invoke public interest immunity as the basis of non-disclosure , and to use the process available under s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act as a means of reviewing the Provincial Court judge 's order for disclosure . The Provincial Court judge found that the Crown acted in " good faith " . However , he also found that the Crown 's conduct was mistaken and confused . Later in his reasons , he said the Crown had " improperly " invoked s. 37 , and that the resulting proceedings were " misguided " . The " merits " of the conduct causing delay are not to be determined solely on the eventual outcome of that conduct . There may be cases where an unsuccessful application or argument could be described as " meritorious " . In this case , it is enough to say that although the Crown 's s. 37 application was undertaken in good faith , it was misconceived and based on a mistaken view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the two year delay , attributable to the s. 37 application and appeal , was an inherent time requirement of the case . It was the result of the Crown 's conduct : R. v. Sander 1995 CanLII 1229 ( BC C.A. ) , 1995 CanLII 1229 ( BC C.A. ) , 1995 CanLII 1229 ( BC C.A. ) , ( 1994 ) , 98 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 564 ( B.C.C.A. ) . <p> Where the commencement of a trial is delayed by reason of motions brought by the defence , the accused can not justly be heard to complain of that delay . However , even if the right has been infringed , it does not necessarily follow that in the case of a serious offence and in the absence of specific prejudice that the quashing of the indictment would be the only " appropriate and just " remedy . A peremptory order expediting the trial might well be more appropriate and just : Balderstone et al . v. The Queen et al . ( 1983 ) , 2 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 37 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 532 ( Man . C.A. ) . <p> There may well be cases where , balancing all the various factors , it will be apparent that the point is being approached , although it has not yet been reached , when any significant continuation of the delay in the trial of an accused will result in an abridgement of his right under s.11(b) . In those circumstances the court , in the exercise of its inherent power to control its own process , may direct that the trial proceed at an early date and dismiss the charge if the Crown fails to proceed . Where , however , on balancing the various factors , the court has decided that the accused 's right has already been contravened , the only appropriate remedy is the dismissal of the charge : The Queen v. Beason ( 1983 ) , 7 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 20 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; The Queen v. Heaslip et al . ( 1983 ) , 9 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 481 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not reach constitutional limits can be taken into consideration as a factor in mitigation of sentence . The trial judge here expressly held that the 17 month delay between the completion of the evidence and sentencing served as a mitigating factor in his determination of the appropriate sentence . The sentence he imposed reflected that mitigation : R. v. Bosley 1992 CanLII 2838 ( ON C.A. ) , ( 1992 ) , 59 O.A.C. 161 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> In this case , it is the Crown 's position that the accused 's failure to provide notice of his Askov application in accordance with the Queen 's Bench Rules was blatant and inexcusable given the fact that the trial dates had been set for months and that counsel had advised of other Charter challenges which he intended to raise at trial . Crown counsel argues that the trial judge made no error in the exercise of her discretion by refusing to consider the Askov application on its merits . In my view , a 33-month delay from the time of arrest to the time of trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been raised by the trial judge even in the absence of an Askov application . Ideally , an Askov application should be made to the trial judge well in advance of the scheduled trial . The early hearing of the application will allow reserve time for the decision , if required , and will also allow valuable trial time to be used efficiently in the event of a decision in the accused 's favour . That is precisely why the Queen 's Bench Rules require notice of pending Charter applications at the first possible opportunity and preferably at the pre-trial conference , prior to trial dates being set . However , the Rules are not rigid and must remain capable of dealing with issues as they arise . The Rules are consistent with the jurisprudence which directs a completely flexible approach to the procedural requirements of an Askov application . Ultimately , procedural requirements must give way to constitutional rights . In this case , an adjournment of the commencement of the trial may not have been the only means available to the trial judge to deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare for the application and to present his submission , she could have decided to proceed with the trial and hear the Askov application at a convenient time during the course of , or at the conclusion of , the trial . If the trial exceeded its allotted time , additional time could have been scheduled for both the completion of the trial and the hearing of the application . If the trial had proceeded as scheduled and the Askov application had been dealt with thereafter , then , if either or both the decisions were appealed , the appeal would have been heard in an orderly manner . The accused 's right to advance a Charter-based argument would not have been sacrificed , and there would have been little or no disruption to the scheduling process in the Court of Queen 's Bench . The unreasonably short notice by the accused of his intent to advance the Askov application was not a sufficient reason for the trial judge to have dismissed it summarily : R. v. Loewen , ( Man . C.A. , December 11 , 1997 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a charge and the right created by s.11(b) . The former relates to the issue of whether the accused is guilty of the offence as charged . The latter has nothing whatsoever to do with the issue of guilt or innocence , but rather relates to the question of whether a determination of same has been sought within a reasonable time . Whether s.11(b) has been infringed is a question of law and as such must be decided solely by the trial judge , not the jury . Any objection to the process must be made before embarking upon the actual determination of guilt or innocence . An infraction of s.11(b) is akin to abuse of process and , in such a situation , objection is taken prior to the trial and , if valid , the proceedings are terminated or stayed : R. v. Robinson reflex , ( 1984 ) , 13 C.R.R. 24 ( Sask . Q.B. ) . <p> While the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated a preference for viva voce evidence , such preference does not , in appropriate situations prevent the use of affidavit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crown says it did so only as a precautionary measure . In the particular circumstances , in the exercise of the court 's inherent jurisdiction to control its procedure and process , and to ensure justice between the parties , it was held that the accused could , subject to those who deposed to affidavits in support of the application being called and sworn as witnesses on the issue , put forward his case by means of both affidavit and viva voce evidence : R. v. Puric reflex , ( 1990 ) , 56 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 373 ( Sask . Q.B. ) . <p> Generally , s. 11(b) applications are matters for the trial court . For it to succeed , there must be an evidentiary foundation for the application . Absent evidence , the alleged violation can not be found . In many cases , the history of the proceedings will best be dealt with by an agreed statement of fact . Notice should be given to the Crown . Rigid rules should not be established by this Court concerning the amount of notice required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , sufficient to give the Crown an opportunity to respond : R. v. M. ( G.C. ) reflex , ( 1991 ) , 65 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 232 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; R. v. Franklin reflex , ( 1991 ) , 3 O.R . ( 3d ) 597 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; R. v. Kaysaywaysemat ( 1992 ) , 12 W.A.C. 66 ( Sask . C.A. ) . <p> The failure to move for a stay of proceedings , either before or at trial , would , in most cases be fatal . The failure to move for a stay of proceedings would normally amount to a waiver of any claim which may arise under s. 11(b) of the Charter . To hold otherwise would amount to imposing a duty on the trial judge to examine , in each case , the entire history of the proceedings , on his or her own motion , in order to ascertain whether or not the trial was ready to proceed within a reasonable time . Had the Charter issue been raised at trial here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a real concern in the case of a stay of proceedings for an alleged violation of s. 11(b) sought for the first time on appeal . A proper weighing of the factors which determine whether there has been unreasonable delay should not be done with the sole assistance of transcripts of adjournments . Affidavit evidence , which was not tendered here , could possibly deal with the issue of prejudice but would rarely qualify as fresh evidence . More importantly , the reasons for the delay must be determined in each case ; systemic delay is a fact and neither this court nor trial courts can simply take judicial notice of its existence , its scope or its causes : R. v. Rabba reflex , ( 1991 ) , 3 O.R . ( 3d ) 238 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; R. v. Jack 1992 CanLII 2764 ( MB C.A. ) , ( 1992 ) , 70 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 67 ( Man . C.A. ) . <p> The Crown argued here that since the appellant did not raise s. 11(b) at trial , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the completion of the evidence and the imposition of sentence , he can not rely on s. 11(b) on appeal . Alternatively , Crown counsel argues that this court has held , apart from any waiver argument , that it will not routinely address s. 11(b) arguments which have not been raised and litigated at trial : R. v. Rabba , supra . The soundness of the principle announced in Rabba is beyond dispute . Rabba was , however , a case ( like most delay cases ) where there was no impediment to the raising of the delay issue at trial . The delay related to the passage of time prior to trial . The delay was for a finite period and the relevant factors could be balanced by the trial judge . In addition , the trial judge was in no way implicated in the delay . In this case , the length of the delay never fully crystallized until the proceedings were completed . The defence had no way of knowing how long the trial judge would reserve judgment or how long it would take him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reasons for judgment would be available in the very near future . It is hardly surprising that counsel would be very reluctant to ask the trial judge to declare that the trial judge 's delay warranted a stay of proceedings . This is not a case where an appellant seeks to take a different position on appeal than was advanced at trial or where he seeks to create an issue where none existed at trial . This is one of those unusual cases where this court should entertain a s. 11(b) argument even though a stay was not sought prior to the completion of the proceedings below . Acquiescence in judge-generated delay does not constitute waiver : R. v. Bosley 1992 CanLII 2838 ( ON C.A. ) , ( 1992 ) , 59 O.A.C. 161 ( Ont . C.A. ) . <p> A more orderly resolution of these delay cases would take place in future if the following prerequisites were observed . Firstly , the Crown is entitled to notice of any application for s. 11(b) judicial stays , unless the delay complained of is so glaring that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be made returnable at least 30 days before the date set for trial . This will make some allowance for the possibility of a reserved judgment on the issue . Thirdly , the history of the case should be presented to the court documented by transcripts ( where such transcripts are available ) , as opposed to counsel 's giving their memories ( often diverging ) of why earlier remands or adjournments were granted . Fourthly , while we hesitate to specify what material would serve to allow assessment of local delays with those existing in comparably-situated Canadian jurisdictions , we do say that it must be in the form of admissible evidence . That is clear from R. v. Bennett , supra . The evidence may take many forms because it may come from many sources . But that comparison could rarely , if ever , be established by the simple repetition of the regional statistics weighed in Cory , J. 's judgment in R. v. Askov . That was what was tendered here : R. v. Holt ( 1991 ) , 117 A.R . 218 ( Alta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown 's decision to split its case against the numerous accused was responsible for unnecessary delay . It had taken the Crown ten months to decide to prefer an indictment , and , upon making that decision , the Crown preferred two separate indictments , one in the Supreme Court and one in the District Court . It elected to proceed on the Supreme Court indictment first and to seek an adjournment of the other until the first trial had been completed . This resulted in a further delay of seventeen months . The Crown conceded that the period of time between arrest and trial invited Charter scrutiny , but submitted , as an explanation for the delay , that the number of accused persons and the complexity of the case warranted splitting the prosecution into two parts . The defence argued that because the explanation could be questioned , the exercise of the Crown 's discretion was justiciable , not because it was exercised mala fides , but because it could have been exercised differently . On that ground , counsel sought to call those whom they assumed were responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their reasons for choosing one course of conduct over another . Absent an attack on the bona fides of the Crown 's decision , however , the court is restricted to examining the merits of the decision , not the motivation behind it . The trial judge was correct in not permitting the calling of evidence . The Court may inquire into the sufficiency of the Crown 's explanation for the delay without hearing further evidence . An evidentiary hearing is not justified by merely pointing out that the discretion of the Crown could have been exercised differently . On a s. 11(b) delay issue , in order for the trial judge to inquire further than the sufficiency of the Crown 's explanation and to allow an evidentiary hearing for that purpose , there must be some basis for suspecting the Crown 's choice of conduct . In order to ask the court to delve into the circumstances surrounding the exercise of the Crown 's discretion , or to inquire into the motivation of the Crown officers responsible for advising the Attorney General , the accused bears the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Crown . Such an allegation must be supportable by the record before the court , or if the record is lacking or insufficient , by an offer of proof . Without such an allegation , the court is entitled to assume what is inherent in the process , that the Crown exercised its discretion properly , and not for improper or arbitrary motives . The defence submitted that since the Supreme Court in R. v. Garofoli , 1990 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 CanLII 52 ( S.C.C. ) , 1990 2 S.C.R. 1421 , had declined to follow Franks v. Delaware , 438 U.S. 154 , there can no longer be a requirement of a threshold showing before addressing this issue . Counsel argued that since it is an issue where the accused bears the burden of adducing evidence , the court can not question counsel 's decision to call whatever witnesses the defence feel could be helpful . In Garofoli , however , Sopinka J. did not suggest that it was inappropriate to eliminate any threshold test before exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collateral issue such as the exercise of prosecutorial discretion . Garofoli does not have anything to do with this issue . We are dealing at this stage of the appeal with the question of prosecutorial discretion , not whether there was reasonable and probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant as in Franks v. Delaware , or whether there was compliance with the statutory requirements for obtaining an authorization to intercept private communications as in Garofoli . With regard to the situation in this case , Garofoli does not say anything more than Franks v. Delaware imposes too stringent an evidentiary burden upon an accused who wishes to cross-examine on an affidavit in order to assist him in his challenge of a specific judicial process : R. v. Durette 1992 CanLII 2779 ( ON C.A. ) , ( 1992 ) , 72 C.C.C . ( 3d ) 421 ( Ont . C.A. ) ; appeal allowed , 1994 CanLII 123 ( S.C.C. ) , 1994 CanLII 123 ( S.C.C. ) , 1994 CanLII

I bet you 'll be able to relate to it . <p> This person said they felt trapped in their basement trying to communicate with their spouse via Morse Code . They said they were banging on the pipes trying desperately to be heard . They would bang on the pipes and wait for a response . Bang and wait ... bang and wait ... bang and wait . But each time they finished banging , there was silence . No matter how hard they banged and no matter how long they waited ; their spouse never heard them . <p> Hi .

More and more I 'm seeing husbands and wives resort to email to communicate with each other . You want to do something tangible TODAY to improve your marriage ? STOP EMAILING YOUR SPOUSE ! Email is for INFORMATION . But in a marriage you 've got to HEAR each other . And I do n't mean hear the sounds of each other 's words . You 've got to be able to hear the silence between the sounds and interpret the unspoken meaning of a pressed lips or teary eyes . You 've got to be able to hear the shapes and sounds in each other 's heart . You can NOT accomplish this via email . <p> And let me be clear about something ; you ca n't do it with communication techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you and your spouse think each other 's thoughts , feel each other joy , and cringe from each other 's pain . My 1-on-1 phone session schedule and the Marriage Fitness Tele Boot Camp are filled with casualties from traditional communication strategies and the usual marriage counseling approach . If you 're like most people with marriage trouble , you 've been down that path and you know that it does NOT work . <p> Today my 4-year-old son came to me with a bruise on his leg . He wa s c rying and I could see that it was black and blue . He said , " Daddy , I need a band-aide . " <p> I responded , " But it 's not bleeding . " <p> He said again , " Daddy , can you put a band-aide on it ? " <p> I realized that my son 's perspective was that when something hurts a band-aide makes it better ... even if it 's a bruise and not a cut . <p> So what does this have to do with communication in a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing each other that communication techniques will solve the problem . But that 's like putting a band-aide on a bruise . It 's the wrong solution . <p> Communication technique s c an help colleagues transmit INFORMATION clearly . Communication techniques belong in seminars that teach negotiation and sales . But you 're not trying to complete a transaction with your spouse ; you 're trying to renew a relationship . I can almost guarantee you that your problem is not clarity ; it ' s c oncern . Ironically , communication techniques sometimes give people clarity that they do n't care what their spouse thinks or feels . They " got it , " but " it " does n't matter to them anymore . <p> How do you get back to the place where you and your spouse care again ? <p> This is one of the things that 's unique about the Marriage Fitness approach to repairing a relationship versus traditional counseling . Most approaches to marriage success preach communication skills . But communicating effectively will NOT create love in your marriage . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paves the way for effective communication . I 'll prove it to you . <p> Think about when you fell in love . How was your communication ? Good , right ? In fact , when you 're in love , you communicate with the wink of an eye and you can finish each other 's sentences . And yet you have n't known each other that long and you have n't learned any communication techniques . <p> Then , years later , after getting to know each other inside and out , employing psychologically tested and proven communication strategies , and taking into account all the differences between Mars and Venus , you ca n't get through to each other . <p> Listen carefully : Communication has very little to do with techniques or knowledge of each other . It has everything to do with the depth of connection between the communicators . <p> The question you should be asking is NOT , " How do I communicate effectively with my spouse . " The question you should be asking is , " How do I connect with my spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting in silence in the basement . You 'll hear the sound of the pipes from above .

##628952 <h> Aim Mayer <p> Two of my men , who had just arrived from somewhere else , they were two young reinforcements . They had just arrived as reinforcements in my section and they were both killed at the same time by a direct antitank shell hit . <h> Web Resources <p> My name is Aim Mayer , I was born on April 25 , 1930 in the great city of Montreal . You know , when we 're young , we 're reckless . And no , there did n't seem to be any fear , there did n't seem to be any concerns , the guys were chatting , everything seemed normal . We were going to take up our position , we were going to do a job , and it ended there . So no , in my opinion , from what I can remember , I did n't see anyone who was fearful . Maybe sometimes we felt butterflies in our stomach , but we internalized it . <p> We arrived per group , per section ( with the 1 st Battalion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section at a time . When we took a position , a section would already be there while we were getting set up . Then we would get a briefing , and they would tell us what was going on , what our line of fire was , etc . Where the enemy was approximately . Blah-blah-blah , what 's going on here and how it 's going to work . Where the toilets are , all those sorts of things , meal times and how the frontline works . How we 're supplied for grub . And then , once all of that is done , we would understand the exact value of a position and the dangerousness of the position . Then , the others would leave and we would assume their position . <p> I did various things in Korea . First , to start , naturally some people died . I did a couple of night patrols . After that , I held the title of sniper and patrol officer . And the sniper and patrol officer group , which we called scout &; sniper or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander , at headquarters where the commander was . We were close to him , and we acted as a sort of bodyguard for him . However , we were also asked to do night patrols and to even act as a guide for other patrols from other sections and other companies . We acted as their guide when they went to the territory called no man 's land at night . <p> Then , all of a sudden , we decided to create a reconnaissance platoon , a big reconnaissance platoon with 20 or so men . They asked me if I wanted to go work in the intelligence section ( to provide information for the battalion ) . Someone must have known that I did a bit of typing or something . So they asked me if I wanted to go work there . I said sure , I would go . So they sent me to the intelligence section . It was still near the headquarters , in the same sector . I took care of typing the War Diary ; the diary that recorded what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge took note of things . And sometimes I went to certain positions to take notes and things like that . And so I typed up the diary and it was sent to the brigade ( the headquarters of the 25 th Canadian Infantry Brigade ) to be sent to Ottawa to record history eventually . So I did that for a certain period of time . <p> After that , I was a section commander in a trench , in a platoon . And finally , in the final days , last of all , they sent me to the brigade and they gave me a Jeep . I drove a Jeep until I came back to Canada . I had two of my ( ... ) when I was a section commander at that time , in September . On September 6 ( 19 ) 52 , two of my men , who had just arrived from somewhere else , they were two young reinforcements . They had just arrived as reinforcements in my section and they were both killed at the same time by a direct antitank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guns ( self-propelled guns ) . SPs were guns that fired very quickly ; we heard a shot and then zoup ! It was there . We had tanks that were dug in , installed on our positions , on two little hills , two little buttons , dug into the ground , down in the earth and so only the turret was available and could be seen from a distance . The enemy knew where these positions were , and where the tanks were , and they were firing at us . However , around these positions , we had trenches as well . We had men there , and two of those men who had arrived as reinforcements got killed . They had just got there and they were killed at the same time , the same evening . I will never forget that . Their names are engraved on a monument at the Place George V in Quebec City , in front of the former armoury ( the former Voltigeurs de Qubec armoury that burned down in 2008 ) . Their names are engraved there along with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember quite well . After that , naturally there were intensive bombings . In August and September ( 1952 ) , there were intensive bombings by the enemy . They were showering us with bombs . Things like that I remember quite well . For example , there was a guy I knew well , his name was Donat Chatigny ( from Roxton Falls , Quebec ) , he was the brother of Hubert Chatigny , who was killed abruptly on September 6 during the same bombings , during the same night , but in another platoon . And I saw others . Because I was responsible for my two men and him , since I was the section commander . They sent me after they had been sent to the medical centre , the RAP ( Regimental Aid Post ) we called it , after they had gone there . <p> They had prepared them and put them on a half-track vehicle , with tracks and wheels . We put them in there in order to take them to the Rear Brigade . It was the Rear Brigade who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pusan ( at the United Nations ' military cemetery in Pusan , South Korea ) . And once I did that , with a guy named Lavoie who was the driver of the half-track , we came back and we were shot at in an area that resembled a horseshoe . The road resembled a horseshoe . We were shot at , they fired at us a lot . We did n't understand why . How did they figure out that we would be going through that area ? They claimed that there was possibly a contact higher up on the hill who indicated our position . That happened in Korea ; people , South Koreans , made contact with North Koreans by all methods of communication . Finally , we stopped the half-track and we laid down flat on the ground , and they bombarded the entire tower and when it was over , we got back into the truck and we hurried to get out of there , to return to the battalion . That was another area that impressed me . <p> Yes , it was a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was positioning , such as rundowns . Companies ( Canadian Infantry ) were invaded by the enemy , like the time with the 2 nd Special Forces Battalion ( the 2 nd Battalion of the Royal 22e Rgiment who served with the Special Canadian Brigade in Korea from 1951-1952 ) by major ( Ral ) Liboiron and his company ( " D " company ) , when the enemy did a rundown . They went through and then they left , injured , dead and all . But afterwards , during our period , with the second , then the first , then the third battalion , things like that did n't happen . There were bombings and we did patrols . There was n't any ( ... ) , there were a few contacts . Not many , but especially 
##632252 <h> Review from Michael U. <p> I thought today was going to be the day . I could feel it happening . Gravity pulling my limbs apart , shock waves blasting through my brain , and the piercing white light above me . I thought today was going to be the day that I die . Thank god for Bean Around the World . They provided me with coffee that had caffeine in it , which apparently was all I needed to alleviate the fear of my untimely death . You see I ran out of coffee at home so I did not have any for the morning . There are only a couple of options for it on Cornwall , the other main one being that large corporation that has terrible coffee , so I feel fortunate to have these guys so close . The muffins are some of the better ones that you 'll find at a coffee joint , and I quite enjoy the vegetarian breakfast sandwich and wrap . Lots of ample seating to enjoy a quiet lunch break , and they usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be surprised how much that affects my enjoyment of a place , but BATW comes through . Oh yeah and they have pretty decent coffee . I need that . <h> Review from Darren N. <p> When I lived in this area 5 years ago , this was the place I went all the time to get some writing done . I used to edit a magazine and write freelance and there was something about this particular location that just fit the bill . Now that I live in the area again , I 'm here all the time . Sometimes reading , sometimes working , always enjoying . <p> What is it that makes this place so great ? I 'll tell you . <p> 1 . Friendly , funny staff . <p> 2 . Dog treats for dogs who make a regular appearance outside . <p> 3 . Really great Nanaimo bars that are like $2.50 . <p> 4 . Great lattes with lots of shots . <p> 5 . Customer loyalty card , buy 9 whatevers , get the next one free . Essentially , lattes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating - if you like the shade when reading on a hot sunny day , which I do . <p> 7 . I appreciate that tipping is an option here , but not required in the passive-aggressive style of most places where a credit card payment immediately gives you the three options of 10% or 15% or Other . You feel like a total ass when presented with this option and you wonder why you should pay 10 or 15% more when the only thing you 're getting is a cup of black coffee to go . Tip if you want , or do n't , or give a big tip only occasionally . That 's how it should be . <h> Review from Sheila W. <p> Friendly staff and strong coffee makes this a nice place to catch up with a friend over a cuppa or spend a quiet morning with the paper . <p> In warmer weather , they have a nice little side-street patio area that is great for al fresco sipping . They have a selection of baking to accompany your roast . <p> All their coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel good about drinking their brew . And they 're based on the North Shore and it 
##634650 <p> We are quickly moving into a very interesting place where physically sitting in front of a terminal is going to look very ridiculous very soon . Some of the best iPhone apps are the ones that enable and empower you to have a terminal , screen , device or whatever you want to call it anywhere and everywhere . The ability to choose a paint color , have it come up on your iPhone and physically hold it against the wall/room/furniture you 're looking to update changes the game for all of us , and forever . <p> Do people still buy computer desktops ? <p> Yes , they do . Without question , the desktop computer packs a much bigger wallop than most of the laptops , ultra-portable laptops and netbooks ( both on price and performance ) . Desktops can also be upgraded versus having to toss or hand-me-down your laptop when something faster with a bigger hard drive comes along . Recently , I was flipping through the local newspaper and caught myself analyzing some of the big-box electronic retailers ' brochures , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would I do with that ? " <p> It 's all about multi-platforms ( or , at least , it will be ) . <p> People are quick to laugh at themselves when they realize that they 've got the TV on , their laptops on their laps , the iPod Touch by their side and a mobile device within reach . It used to be the kind of activity that our teenagers were doing , and we would laugh about it at dinner parties . Now , we 're all doing it . We 're using many media platforms and all of them at the same time . Many people have already expressed concern , outrage and disappointment regarding yesterday 's Blog post , I Like To Watch ... And So Do You , about TV viewership . There ca n't be that many people just sitting there and watching TV for all of those hours ? <p> It 's not just the media landscape that is shifting ... society is shifting too . <p> Disruption does that . There were major concerns when Sony first released the Walkman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves and our own little corner of the world . Some might argue that this has , indeed , taken place . Others might argue that all of the technologies and platforms have created a new breed of knowledge sharing and mass collaboration . Whatever side of the fence you care to defend , one thing is for certain : the idea of having fixed terminals in a fixed location is quickly becoming antiquated ( Internet Cafe owners beware ! ) . Media , content and access to information is available everywhere . It could well be one of the more fundamental challenges that businesses and organizations are going to have to face in terms of human resources , office space design , meeting spaces and productivity . What do we do to develop and grow in a world where the information is not just here , but it 's " here , there and everywhere ? " <p> How do you work ? Are you at a fixed station or completely mobile ? Do you think fixed stations are here to stay ? <p> Completely mobile . Have a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All my clients have my cell # , not my desk phone . And I pretty much camp out with my laptop and cell phone wherever I 'm going to be least interrupted and mos productive - Conference room , coffee shop , back seat of a car , it does n't matter . Just need power outlet . <p> Three primary thoughts for me around this . Reducing overhead and fixed costs associated to having someone in chair all day , every day , is a no-brainer for me . There is at least 50% of my job that I could do anywhere that offers Internet access . <p> Then thereTs the matter of productivitywhich I see a little like the debate that rages around school curriculum , different people learn better using different approaches , I think the same is true here . <p> Last , work ethic , are we mature enough as a whole , to know ourselves if we do/donTt work better with/without structure and choose accordingly ? How many organizations have the necessary processes and infrastructure in the place to police what I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work wherever . <p> I think cloud computing will likely have to be come a real reality before I 'm able to leave the the fixed terminal behind . <p> As we speak I 'm taking a break from a music production project to clear my mind and ears and read you 're blog .. The kind of house power needed , all the hardware controllers , the duel big monitors for productivity , etc .. makes me un-mobile .. <p> But .. if software does become a service , and the cloud can do some of my processing .. and some how there 's no latency .. and you can attach you 're glasses into you 're smart phone and enter some VR interface .. with little controllers covering you 're body to detect " body language gestures " well .. I 'm making the jump ! <p> I mean can you imagine the possibilities ? Where 's the VC cash when you need it ? <p> That 's what really gets me excited .. the notion multi touch immersive 3D interfaces with an augmented reality lair over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with you .. in a location based social networking technology of a future generation .. <p> I 'm one of those desktop holdout users you speak of . In fact , I 'm about to buy a new computer , and yes , I will be purchasing a desktop . Quite simply , I find there 's a mental state associated with a space that is dedicated solely to work . If I try to work someplace else , I get easily distracted . <p> Also , I hate carrying a heavy laptop around with me . As someone who gets around primarily by walking , I try to travel as light as possible . The computer can stay in one place , and if I need to use it , I 'll just go there . <p> And as for an iPhone or a BlackBerry ? No way , not for me . The ability to say no , I 'm not reachable right now is more valuable than the ability to be always on . I think that everyone needs to disconnect sometimes or else we burn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I have several places called " office " , one laptop , bb and several email addresses , social media accounts that I use based on whom I need to get in touch with . I did not like having one office to go to every day , 9 to 5 , 5 times a week , but eliminating it completely and working from home is not for me either . I miss engagement and creative conversation and interaction . A compromised solution with lots of client meetings , one start-up office to go to a few days a week and other incubator style places where I can drop in for other days is best . However not sure that would work if I have to manage staff , as I did before when working for a corporation . The digital nomad type works for certain professions and type of people , would it work for everybody ? no , but it definitely changes the way a " regular " office operates too . <p> Fixed station at The Jb . Fixed station at home ( and working from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counch for looking things up and reading TWitter but it 's far too small to get any real work done . <p> My Mac G5 has three large screens ( two 21 " 1680x1050 , one 24 " 1920x1200 - try putting those on your laptop ) a real keyboard and a trackball . <p> The company I work for supplies most people with laptops but Everyone gets an external keyboard , mouse , and a 24 " monitor . We 're all sent through ergonomics training where we learn that working on a laptop screen and laptop keyboard all day is NOT good for you ! <p> If you 're playing " digital no , mad " aand using a laptop all day , please do some research into proper hand position , angle , monitor height , etc . <p> The choice of desktop/laptop is a question of appropriate tool . Do you work primarily with words or images ? <p> It 's desktops all the way for me . I simply could not do my job or my hobbies on a laptop . <p> Right now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was purchased for photography work , connected to a quad-core Mac . Using Photoshop and Lightroom on a laptop sounds like an exquisite form of torture to me . The processors are slower , the drives are glacial , and the screens are small and difficult to make colour-correct . <p> They desktop is not going away . Even though laptop sales are now more than half of all computer sales , that is simply because until the last few years , the portable option was out of budget for most people . Now a Macbook is $1100 . That changed the game . <p> the power users will never give up their workstations . worker bees , sure - but my efficiency in a dual monitor workstation is insane ... plus i do nt know how you could make good studio monitors portable , which im not giving up . for worker drones , maybe - power users - not for quite awhile , if ever ( we like privacy while we work ) <p> It seems that soon we 'll all going to use some kind of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing micro tasks , like micro blogging , talking to the phone , checking email , reading RSS ... <p> You see what 's the problem with this ? <p> Well , someone has to work too . <p> Oh , I know , you can work with a laptop too . But very often , you end up in your comfortable office , plugging a big monitor into your laptop , a keyboard and a mouse , completely " macroing " and " fixing " you micro mobile terminal . <p> I have an office/studio in the basement of my house where I use a Mac Mini for music production , website development , home video editing , and managing a massive iTunes library . I happy to have that be a " terminal " - its a creative space I 'm happy to be locked away in . Sometimes having a designated workspace is a good thing . <p> But for the rest of the house and beyond , I realized I did n't need anything more than a Linux netbook 
##647151 <h> Three Weeks for the Price of One <p> Here are the last three week blog posts , sorry for the delay I have been extremely busy creating the final presentation . <p> My contribution to East Field ? To begin with my contribution in the team was the pretty much the same as everyone , discussions , blogs . I suppose one of my biggest contributions was to encourage the creation team name ; I have always found it hard to unite a team if you are just a group , by having a name you create a group identity , something greater than yourselves to work for . <p> My role soon evolved I believe to become the technology steward ; I would set up the Google hang out , meeting words for our group . Over the last few weeks my role had become the visualizer I have been in charge of creating the final presentation using the content provided to me by the rest of the team . The biggest learning challenge for me was self-teaching adobe after effects and has been a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have needed to explore after effects . I have gone from a novice to intermediate I hope to continue my progress and hopefully add it to my skill list . The main insight I gained from the course was the rate online communities are evolving and how they are becoming more and more useful for designers , especially the ones who have a great idea but have no way of funding it , I have learn about crowed funding in an extreme depth and would comfortably use it to fund my future projects , however when it comes to asking advice in online communities I am not completely sold , now it 's true to say I would be lost without the hundreds of tutorial videos about Photoshop , After Effects etcetera . I 'm not sure I would trust the online community for real specific advice , I feel far more comfortable discussing a project face to face , however I do use Facebook to informally brainstorm with team mates , and also to hold meetings over Google hangouts with clients who are base far away ; although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . <p> When it comes to learning as a team I believe we could have learned more , if we had been able to focus at an earlier date , I feel like the first half of the course was wasted as we stumbled around clueless , however I am certain the learning we achieved in the second part of the course have made up for the stumbling in the first part . Even if it did cause a few sleepless nights . For the whole class the final presentations were a great way to share what each group learned and in turn teach us as well as their NGO . <p> Would I use an online community to help solve my own design challenge or design competition ? To help solve my design challenge directly no I would n't , however I would use it to solve indirect problems by using things like video tutorials reading threads or reading information on Wikipedia etcetera on the web , but I would be unlikely to seek help directly by posting a question on forms or social sites , the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the online community , I 'm not really that interested in trying to answer other people questions on the internet mainly because I know there will be a lot more people willing and able to answer the question far better than I could . Perhaps when I am older and have degree level knowledge and more life experiences , I will be able to give something back to the online community . But at the moment I do n't feel confident enough to share my knowledge with the world , and hence feel guilty asking for other peoples so I simply leach off other people 's threads and discussions . <p> One part of online communities I would happy use and have already explored not only as part of the course but then even in further depth for a potential option for a personal project was crowd funding . In a time of recession it is hard to get funding from investors and loans from banks , crowd funding provides a solid alternative , although it is hard work to maintain a high level of interest in order to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a certainty . However I remain unsure to the future of crowd funding has it become popular solely as a result of the recession and hence die down again once the economy picks back up , or is it here to stay and will it continue to grow ? The answer to these questions will dictate whether I use crowd funding in the future for my design challenges . <p> Almost any modern day process has the option to get involved in some form of on online networking , whether you use it or not : Personal I feel there should be a limit I do n't need social updates about coffee ! However as a modern day communication tool it is irreplaceable , and begin to replace texting which costs money and a lot of money if you plan to send it aboard compared , chatting on a face book app , Skype app , whatsapp or bbm is almost free as they use a minute amount of internet . This is mainly down to the new smart phones which are becoming more powerful than a standard PC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4G network which boats speeds of 25mb , the general public will very soon be able to access anything from their mobile phone , I believe this will dramatically increase the growth of online communities especially the ones which do n't have current mobiles apps as you wo n't need them as you can just access the real webpage . <p> The reason I believe this to be important is because I believe this change will change how I will use social networks for my work , I will be able to constantly contact other members of my group the second I come up with an idea , I will be able to save a document to my computer at my home containing my idea so I do n't forget it . I will also be able to solve the little questions that pop up and you always forget to research when you get home there and then , making me a far more efficient designer as it will become fully integrated with my life . Which is good as I believe being a designer is a life style , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always finding inspiration , mobile communication though social networks will let us easy act on this inspiration . <p> Apart from using social networks as communication tools on the go and crowd funding . I am not a not hundred percent sure if I will use it to ask for advice in forms . <h> 2 comments on " Three Weeks for the Price of One " <p> Bonne , you 've written a novel ! Great self-reflection ! I love how you learned Adobe After affects . I need a project to really learn a tool , myself ! <p> I 'm wondering what it would take for you , or anyone , to " trust " a community for some of the design phases . We really did not dig deeply into the human factors and they are REALLY important . A few other students have noted the issue of trust ! Personally , I think you have proven that you do have valuable knowledge to share . Do n't undersell yourself ! <p> Thanks , I think the issue of trust arises because of the immaturity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexist rubbish found company on reedit and the " trolling " nature of so many user undermines the entire idea of online communities , now of course it is probably a small proportion of internet users however it only takes a few to ruin it for the many ; a stereotype . Perhaps I would be more willing the share problems and solutions with a closed online communities where the participants have been vetted in some way , or can be held accountable for harmful/destructive comments , however many

We will conduct various formal experiments , choosing how , when and why we might follow or break the rules . We will also have various assigned readings in poetry and poetics that speak to the specific writing issues and challenges that we encounter . As we create a collection of work , we will also be spending class time creating our own " books . " These may be virtual or material .

Students can not register online and must receive permission to register from the instructor . <p> WRITE 399 Projects in Genre Instructor : C. Stewart The word for utopia comes from the Greek : ? ? ( " not " ) and ? ? ? ? ? ( " place " ) and means " no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Greek ? ? ( " good " or " well " ) and ? ? ? ? ? ( " place " ) , means " good place " . In this class we will consider how might we write a possible good place . Since the world of experimental creative writing and research is concerned with social change , challenging the status quo , and giving expression to ways of life and thinking that have been overlooked or even suppressed by normative forms of expression , perhaps poetic expression has the capacity , as Russian Formalist Victor Shklovsky argues , to make the reader more attentive to the world in creative non-habituated ways . If we are given the opportunity to learn creative forms of research and inquiry and the creative forms of expression , can we develop a more intimate understanding of language ? What happens when we use particular creative forms to create pleasurable relationships with language ? Might formal language play allow those who have been silenced the opportunity to speak ? Might methods of experimentation in creative writing help those who have been disenfranchised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How might such a practice allow us to understand the limits and power of language to both constrain life and to constitute new worlds of possibility ? In this class we will consider these questions and put into practice experimental forms of writing . <p> Please note : this class will have Community Service Learning component . Community Service-Learning ( CSL ) integrates community-based activities with classroom learning . For this class , the bulk of our time will be spent at the Boyle Learning Centre downtown where we will be working with adult learners from the Centre . The first and last two weeks of the class will be held at the University without the adult learners so that we can first prepare for the Boyle class and then discuss our experiences . At Boyle , you will be working with the adult learners on their creative projects , and you will be working on your own projects .

Van Camp <p> WRITE 498 ADVANCED CREATIVE WRITING : NONFICTION Instructor : C. Wiesenthal This course is a workshop-based nonfiction writing class and seminar . Although students will be encouraged to develop their facility with nonfiction forms and genres of particular interest to them , an emphasis will be placed on writing that is politically and culturally engaged , writing that reports and reflects on the wider world -- perhaps challenging or even hoping to change that world . Students will have the opportunity to research and develop stories in conjunction with an intensive study of established and new practitioners of the craft , both canonical and contemporary . At least a third of the course syllabus will be determined by members of the workshop collective . Students will be expected to read and edit each other 's written drafts in a spirit of collegial mentorship , and will be encouraged to experiment with all aspects of technique , including close observation , creative perspective , reportage , documentation , narrative structure , characterization and revision . Depending on workshop size , students can normally expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own stories . In addition , students will be asked to complete various informal writing exercises and to prepare a brief oral presentation analyzing the craft and technique of one of the assigned course readings .

##680351 <h> Tips for Reducing/ Cooking Tomato Sauce <p> With 8 bushels of tomato sauce preserved for the winter , we 're just about ready to stop posting about tomatoes for a while ! Well , that was the plan ... <p> We had several great questions when we had our big preserving day about how much we reduce our sauce and how vigorously . <p> You 'll probably have to watch this movie a few times to see much of anything ( it 's 4 seconds long ) but you 'll notice a gentle bubble near the top of the screen : <p> We will often make it bubble a little bit more than that but not a whole lot -- and we never want to get it to a boil . I wish I could tell you exactly why we do that , but I ca n't . I 've lost my reference . I am certain that I read a few years ago that bringing tomatoes to a rapid boil breaks them down and you lose consistency but I ca n't find that source anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil like this actually creates a pulp-like texture ( some particles get so thick that you can stack them high on a flat spoon ) . And that texture creates great sauce as long as you constantly stir the pot when bottling . <p> We do n't reduce our sauce as much as many . I have found that a thin sauce can always be thickened but can never be thinned out . As much as I love a thick pasta sauce , I love the option of a thinner starting point for soups , stocks and braising . <p> We reduce our sauce until the foam stops appearing on its surface and it changes to a lovely dark color . The giant surface area of the over-sized pots helps things reduce in a hurry as well . After that , it 's a matter of preference . This generally means 5-8 hours of cooking . When I make fresh pasta in the winter , I often reduce a pot for an additional hour . I have heard of others reducing for far longer . <p> If you make sauce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours for ? <h> Comments <p> I was just talking about this with a friend this morning . I usually cook my sauce down for about 4 hours or so , I would like to be able to do it longer , but I know I also have to allow time for processing the jars . I ca n't hold up the stove for hours on end , so after about 4 hours or so , I jar it up and start the processing . I always keep extra jars of tomato paste on hand in case I need to thicken up my sauce , but this process seems to work for me . <p> Yay ! Thanks for your explanation and video . Very helpful . And based on another of your posts , I 'll be looking for a different variety of tomato to grow/buy next 
##683250 <h> Retire ? Can you afford to ? <p> Andrew Pyle sees the growing concern among Canadians about their retirement prospects almost every day . <p> More people crossing the threshold of his office are worried about how to fund the time in their life after they finish working , says the Peterborough financial planner . <p> " There is a general anxiety over the ability to retire . . . that the CPP ( Canada Pension Plan ) is not going to be adequate , " Pyle says . <p> Setting aside the usual bromides about the necessity of getting a financial plan in place , these fears have merit . <p> A gathering battalion of retirees who will live longer than past cohorts , struggling companies not willing to top up pension benefits , and governments seeking ways to reduce public outlays for the elderly are combining to tarnish the lustre of the " golden years " of many . <p> " Canadians . . . want to maintain their lifestyle , have a guaranteed income and are worried about outliving their money . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their cake and eat it , too , " said a report from BMO Retirement Institute in 2011 . <p> Forty years ago , such retirement tradeoffs , while always of some concern , were less pressing for Canada 's retirees . Skilled workers probably had a job at a company that provided a defined benefit pension , a plan with a set payout that a firm might top up . <p> Also , any salary savings that worker managed to squirrel away earned a decent rate of return . For instance , a three-year Canada Savings Bond had a posted interest rate of 4.5 per cent in 1965 , enabling you to double your money in about 16 years <p> And the expectations this generation had for its retirement years were limited , maybe a game of golf or two and a chance to see the grandkids once in a while . <p> Things have certainly changed . <p> Nowadays , people live longer -- on average just over 81 years from birth , or , if you have already reached 65 , slightly more than 85 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund about 20 years of retirement . <p> The retiree already needs more money than in past decades . <p> In addition , after the economic debacle of the 2007-09 period , many Canadian companies either dumped their pension plan altogether or switched it over to a less lucrative defined contribution structure . <p> And , the yield for a three-year Government of Canada bond now stands in the range of 2.5 per cent , a level at which your money doubles every 32 years or so . <p> As a result , not only do Canadian retirees need more money , they are likely to have a less valuable pension plan and a not-so-big RRSP nest egg . <p> These trends make retirement tougher for many Canadians , especially the 60 per cent of people who do not contribute to an RRSP at all . <p> Now people are forced to make financial trade-offs not necessary previously . <p> " People need to ask this question : Are you willing to give up something today to have something in the future ? " says Tina Di Vito , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 Ways to Wreck Your Retirement ... And How to Rescue it . <p> Getting more people to plan decades down the road has been a daunting task for experts . <p> Years of low interest rates have left Canadians with record levels of personal debt , a factor in lowering available retirement monies . <p> But there are signs of better thinking among Canadians . <p> A September survey by compensation experts Towers Watson indicated that as many as one-third of respondents would forego extra salary in exchange for a defined benefit pension . <p> Fifty-three per cent of Canadians surveyed by CIBC are willing to work past retirement to maintain their lifestyle . The financial pressure will force some to stay on the job ; others just like to work . <p> " I do n't think I 'll retire because I actually enjoy what I do , " said Paul Matysek , an industrial tradesman and owner of Coffee and All That Jazz , a west-end coffee shop . <p> If more Canadians adopt this kind of thinking , the fear Pyle sees in his office these days @ @ @ @ 
##683451 <h> Accreditation &; Standards <p> FOCUS Accreditation is pleased to announce that Deafblind Ontario Services has been successful in its bid to be accredited . Accreditation extends from March , 2012 until March 2016 . <p> Deafblind Ontario Services provides supports adults who are deafblind across the province with community-based housing , trained Intervenor services , independent living skills , work experience and other specialized support . The organization elected to be accredited as a demonstration of accountability and as a way of having independent validation of the quality of the services it provides . <p> The accreditation took place over a four day period , and was conducted by a team of four unbiased professionals trained by FOCUS . Over those days , the team spent time with people using services , interviewed stakeholders and reviewed documentation . After all was said and done , many strengths were identified at Deafblind Ontario Services : <p> In the accreditation report , DeafBlind Ontario Services was lauded for : <p> Offering people who are Deafblind high quality Intervenor services <p> Having skilled , compassionate and dedicated staff and leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , knowledge and training in the specialized area of deafblindness . <p> " Deafblind Ontario Services should be commended for their accomplishment , " states Jennifer Keilty , Executive Director at FOCUS Accreditation . " Strengths were identified in numerous areas . The team found the organization to have a true emphasis on improving the quality of people 's lives , while also operating an organization that meets our challenging standards . " <p> As accreditation is not mandatory , it merits recognition that DeafBlind Ontario Services elected to be accredited by an impartial , objective third party . This decision , and the work that went into meeting the standards established by FOCUS , clearly demonstrates a commitment to quality and a desire to continue to improve the lives of the people they support . DeafBlind Ontario Services also worked with FOCUS prior to their accreditation journey to establish standards around deafblindness and Intervenor Services . <p> " DeafBlind Ontario Services is thrilled to have achieved accreditation .

" True to our vision of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly state we are the first organization in Ontario that provides services to people who are deafblind to become accredited . " <p> STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAFBLIND <p> In spring 2009 , DeafBlind Ontario Services received a grant from The Ontario Trillium Foundation to develop service standards and benchmarks to ensure consistency and accountability of the quality of services delivered to persons who are deafblind . This project is the first of its kind to evaluate services and supports within the deafblind sector . <p> An advisory committee was formed , comprised of representation from organizations in both the congenital and acquired fields of deafblindness . The standards were piloted in organizations that provide supports and services to people who have congenital and acquired deafblindness . The pilots resulted in feedback and suggestions from a wide variety of organizational staff and volunteers . Most importantly , recommendations from people who live with deafblindness were incorporated into the development of the standards . <p> Today , we are happy to report that we now have Standards of Excellence for People Who Are Deafblind . This guide provides direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are deafblind in four areas of governance , human resources , financial accountability , and direct service . The standards will help organizations develop and deliver practical and appropriate services , based on the premise that people who are deafblind have access to Intervenor services that best suits their needs and desires . <p> It is the goal of the committee to make the Standards available to all agencies that provide Intervenor services , ensuring consistency in services for people who are deafblind across Ontario . <p> For more information on the 
##687351 <h> Donatello 1386-1466 <h> Italian sculptor <h> INTRODUCTION <h> Donatello is considered to be one of the greatest sculptors of all time . His techniques are still used by sculptors today . <h> BACKGROUND <h> Donatello was a great Italian sculptor , who was born in Florence , Italy , in 1386 , and died at the age of 80 in 1466 . He did not marry and had no children . He started practicing at the age of 20 and worked in Lorenzo Ghiberti 's shop . Later in his life he studied Roman ruins and became a humanist . Donatello also had a shop in Florence where he created many of his masterpieces . <p> The city of Florence paid for his sculpture of David . Patrons found him very hard to deal with and to work with . He was not a cultured intellect like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo . Donatello was essentially a realist . <h> ACCOMPLISHMENTS <h> Many of Donatello 's masterpieces are located in Florence . Some of these masterpieces include : St. Peter , St. Mark , Zuccone , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magdalen , and Angel with Tambourine . Other pieces considered to be some of his finest work are : Herod 's Feast , St. Louis of Toulouse , St. Peter , St. Anthony , an equestrian statue called Gattamelata , and Jeremiah . <p> A lot of his sculptures were Renaissance breakthroughs . David , for one , was the first nude statue of the Renaissance , and the equestrian statue , Gattamelata , was considered to be one of the best proportioned sculptures ever . In Donatello 's Gothic style he used expressive ugliness to give the statue a life of its own . He used a powerful realism that gives his statues a distinct look . <p> IMPACT <p> Donatello had an immense impact on the art and the artists of the Renaissance . He invented the shallow relief technique . In the shallow relief technique the sculpture seems deep but is actually done on a very shallow plane . <p> Donatello characterized his figures as individuals . He also made the first bronze sculpture . These

Evans , a woodworker whose nickname is " Cap'n Halfbeard " ( cancer radiation treatment burned the hair follicles on one side of his face ) , believes Movember is n't only a fun and easy way to raise money for a serious issue , but a direct route for the general public to save lives . Evans told the Post how he manages to smile , even if he thinks a 16-year-old could probably grow a more impressive ' stache than he could . <p> Q : " Cap'n Halfbeard " is a pretty lighthearted way of dealing with a pretty serious issue .

A : I live near the waterfront in Victoria and so when I was in my kayak , I began seeing myself as a ship 's captain .

A : I 've lost a sibling to cancer and I have two brothers , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a family with seven children , five of us have had cancer -- and I 've had cancer twice . <p> Q : Given all that you 've endured , your attitude is pretty inspiring . A : When I first got my diagnosis , I grabbed my wife , Jane , and swore that I would n't go to a morose place with this . Cancer 's a serious issue , but that 's also why something like Movember 's important -- it 's important to have fun while you can . <p> Q : Why else should people pay attention to Movember ? A : Guys do n't like to get tested for prostate cancer , but I had an early diagnosis and it saved my life . <p> Q : What do you think when you see other people getting involved , either making donations or growing their own moustache ? A : I 'm inspired . It is n't pleasant , but cancer treatment 's important and it 's good that people talk about this horrible disease . <p> Q : Lastly , Cap'n Halfbeard not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

##730150 <h> Captain 's return to helm up in the air <h> DeMerit sidelined by concussion , but was seen heading the ball in practice <h> Whitecaps captain Jay DeMerit ( left ) could be cleared to play as soon as Saturday in Portland . <h> Photograph by : Darryl Dyck , CP , Vancouver Sun <p> A good indicator of Jay DeMerit 's status going into Saturday 's match against the Port-land Timbers came Thursday at Vancouver Whitecaps training . <p> Out of the lineup since sustaining a concussion on Aug. 11 in a match against Real Salt Lake , the Whitecaps 32-year-old defender and captain was up in the air on several occasions Thursday , heading the ball with the same confidence and efficiency since before his injury , when he knocked heads with goalkeeper Brad Knighton nearly two weeks ago . <p> Vancouver Sun sports reporter Gary Kingston reported Tuesday that DeMerit headed the ball " a couple of times " at practice ; however , there seemed to be no reservations on the part of the central defender when leaping for the ball two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cascadia Cup match in Portland , although , given the recent knowledge of how unpredictable concussions are , nothing has been made official . <p> " Again , we 're trying not to do too much of that stuff but we do need to test it to see where it 's at , " said DeMerit . <p> " It 's been fine so far , so hope-fully we can have another good day of training tomorrow and be ready for Saturday . " <p> The Whitecaps will travel to Portland today and hold one training session at JELD-WEN Field - home of the Timbers - before Saturday 's game . <p> DeMerit , who attended the first 30 minutes of last Thurs-day 's training session but then left , admitted to " naturally " being apprehensive when he first stepped onto the pitch for training earlier this week . <p> " It 's always a little bit of a transition to try to convince yourself to go out there and be 100 per cent , but it 's training sessions like these that will help you do that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more training session to try to gain a little bit more confidence and then Saturday you 've just got to go for it . " <p> The MLS concussion protocol , at least according to how head coach Martin Rennie laid it out , includes numerous steps that eventually lead up to a player training in full before being made available . <p> " The first few days , obviously he ca n't do anything , " said Ren-nie . " Then he has to go through a process where can do exercise but he ca n't train , then he can do exercise but he ca n't head , then he can play but he ca n't head and then he can play all in ... So he 's gone through all of that and everything seems to be fine .

##737852 <p> The origin of the human race and the general character of its development having been thus described , all that remained of importance to universal or sacred history , in connection with the progress of our race in the primeval age , was to record the order of the families ( chap . v. ) and the ultimate result of the course which they pursued ( chap . vi . 1-8 ) . -First of all , we have the genealogical table of Adam with the names of the first ten patriarchs , who were at the head of that seed of the woman by which the promise was preserved , viz. the posterity of the first pair through Seth , from Adam to the flood . We have also an account of the ages of these patriarchs before and after the birth of those sons in whom the line was continued ; so that the genealogy , which indicates the line of development , furnishes at the same time a chronology of the primeval age . In the genealogy of the Cainites no ages are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no future history . On the other hand , the family of Sethites , which acknowledged God , began from the time of Enos to call upon the name of the Lord , and <p> CHAP . V. 121 <p> was therefore preserved and sustained by God , in order that under the training of mercy and judgment the human race might eventually attain to the great purpose of its creation . The genealogies of the primeval age , to quote the apt words of hT Baumgarten , are " memorials , which bear testimony quite as much to the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promise , as to the faith and patience of the fathers themselves . " This testimony is first placed in its true light by the numbers of the years . The historian gives not merely the age of each patriarch at the time of the birth of the first-born , by whom the line of succession was continued , but the number of years that he lived after that , and then the entire length of his life . Now if we add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , and the hundred years between the birth of Shem and the flood , we find that the duration of the first period in the world 's history was 1656 years . We obtain a different result , however , from the numbers given by the LXX. and the Samaritan version , which differ in almost every instance from the Hebrew text , both in chap . v. and chap . xi .

In consequence of this , the interval from Adam to the flood is shortened in the Samaritan text by 349 years as compared with the Hebrew , and in the Septuagint is lengthened by 586 ( Cod . Alex . 606 ) . The interval from the flood to Abram is lengthened in both texts ; in the Sam . by 650 years , in the Sept. by 880 ( Cod . Alex . 780 ) . In the latter , Cainan is interpolated between Arphaxad and Salah , which adds 130 years , and the age of the first-born of Nahor is placed 150 years later than in the Hebrew , whereas in the former the difference is only 50 years . With regard to the other differences , the reason for reducing the lives of Jared , Methuselah , and Lamech in the Samaritan text after the birth of their sons , was evidently to bring their deaths within <p> CHAP . v. 123 <p> the time before the flood . The age . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the LXX. , is evidently to be accounted for on the same ground , since , according to the numbers of the Vatican text , Methuselah must have lived 14 years after the flood . In the other divergences of these two texts from the Hebrew , no definite purpose can be detected ; at the same time they are sufficient to show a twofold tendency , viz. to lengthen the interval from the flood to Abram , and to reduce the ages of the fathers at the birth of their first-born to greater uniformity , and to take care that the age of Adam at the birth of Seth should not be exceeded by that of any other of the patriarchs , especially in the time before the flood . To effect this , the Sept. adds 100 years to the ages of all the fathers , before and after the flood , whose sons were born before their 100th year ; the Sam. , on the other hand , simply does this in the case of the fathers who lived after the flood , whilst it deducts 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood who begot their first-born at a later period of their life than Adam and Seth . The age of Noah alone is left unaltered , because there were other data connected with the flood which prevented any arbitrary alteration of the text . That the principal divergences of both texts from the Hebrew are intentional changes , based upon chronological theories or cycles , is sufficiently evident from their internal character , viz. from the improbability of the statement , that whereas the average duration of life after the flood was about half the length that it was before , the time of life at which the fathers begot their first-born after the flood was as late , and , according to the Samaritan text , generally later than it had been before . No such intention is discernible in the numbers of the Hebrew text ; consequently every attack upon the historical character of its numerical statements has entirely failed , and no tenable argument can be adduced against their correctness . The objection , that such longevity as that recorded in our chapter is inconceivable according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we consider 11 that all the memorials of the old world contain evidence of gigantic power ; that the climate , the weather , and other natural conditions , were different from those after the flood ; that life was much more simple and uniform ; and that the after-effects of the condition of man in paradise would not be immediately exhausted " ( Delitzsch ) . This <p> 124 THE FIRST BOOK OF MOSES <p> longevity , moreover , necessarily contributed greatly to the in-crease of the human race ; and the circumstance that the children were not born till a comparatively advanced period of life , --that is , until the corporeal and mental development of the parent was perfectly complete , necessarily favoured the generation of a powerful race . From both these circumstances , however , the development of the race was sure to be characterized by peculiar energy in evil as well as in good ; so that whilst in the godly portion of the race , not only were the traditions of the fathers transmitted faithfully and without adulteration from father to son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took deep root , whilst in the ungodly portion time was given for sin to develop itself with mighty power in its innumerable forms . <p> The heading in ver . 1 runs thus : " This is the book ( Spher ) of the generations ( tholedoth ) of Adam : ' On tholedoth , see chap . <p> ii . 4 . Sepher is a writing complete in itself , whether it consist of one sheet or several , as for instance the " bill of divorcement " in Dent . xxiv. 1 , 3 . The addition of the clause , ' 1 in the day that God created man , " etc. , is analogous to chap . ii . 4 ; the creation being mentioned again as the starting point , because all the development and history of humanity was rooted there. --Ver. 3 . As Adam was created in the image of God , so did he beget " in his own likeness , after his image ; " that is to say , he transmitted the image of God in which he was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God , but in the form given to it by his own self-determination , modified and corrupted by sin . The begetting of the son by whom the line was perpetuated ( no doubt in every case the first-born ) , is followed by an account of the number of years that Adam and the other fathers lived after that , by the statement that each one begat ( other ) sons and daughters , by the number of years that he lived altogether , and lastly , by the assertion nn ' 1 " and he died : " This apparently superfluous announcement is " intended to indicate by its constant recurrence that death reigned from Adam <p> downwards as an unchangeable law ( vid . Rom. v. 14 ) . But against this background of universal death , the power of life was still more conspicuous . For the man did not die till he had propagated life , so that in the midst of the death of individuals , the life of the race was preserved , and the hope of the seed sustained , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CHAP . v. 125 <p> the case of one of the fathers indeed , viz. Enoch ( vers. 21 sqq. ) , life had not only a different issue , but also a different form . Instead of the expression " and he lived , " which introduces in every other instance the length of life after the birth of the first-born , we find in the case of Enoch this statement , " he walked with God ( Elohim ) ; " and instead of the expression " and he died , " the announcement , " and he was not , for God ( Elohim ) <p> took him . " The phrase " walked with God , " which is only applied to Enoch and Noah ( chap . vi . 9 ) , denotes the most confidential intercourse , the closest communion with the personal God , a walking as it were by the side of God , who still continued His visible intercourse with men ( vid. iii . 8 ) . It must be distinguished from " walking before God " ( chap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walking after God " ( Dent . xiii . 4 ) , both which phrases are used to indicate a pious , moral , blameless life under the law according to the directions of the divine commands . The only other passage in which this expression " walk with God " occurs is Mal. ii . 6 , where it denotes not the piety of the godly Israelites generally , but the conduct of the priests , who stood in a closer relation to Jehovah under the Old Testament than the rest of the faithful , being permitted to enter the Holy Place , and hold direct intercourse with Him there , which the rest of the people could not <p> do . The article in nriSmn gives prominence to the personality of Elohim , and shows that the expression can not refer to inter course with the spiritual world. -In Enoch , the seventh from Adam through Seth , godliness attained its highest point ; whilst ungodliness culminated in Lamech , the seventh from Adam through Cain , who made his sword his god . Enoch , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into the heavenly paradise , so that he did not see ( experience ) death ( Heb. xi . 5 ) ; i.e. he was taken up from this temporal life and transfigured into life eternal , being exempted by God from the law of death and of return to the dust , as those of the faithful will be , who shall be alive at the coming of Christ to judgment , and who in like manner shall not taste of death and corruption , <p> but be changed in a moment . There is no foundation for the opinion , that Enoch did not participate at his translation in the glorification which awaits the righteous at the resurrection . For , according to 1 Cor. xv . 20 , 23 , it is not in glorification , <p> but in the resurrection , that Christ is the first-fruits . Now the <p> 126 THE FIRST BOOK OF MOSES . <p> latter presupposes death . Whoever , therefore , through the grace of God is exempted from death , can not rise from the dead , but reaches aoOapo-la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " changed " or " clothed upon " ( 2 Cor. v. 4 ) . This does not at all affect the truth of the statement in Rom. v. 12 , 14 . For the same God who has appointed death as the wages of sin , and given us , through Christ , the victory over death , possesses the power to glorify into eternal life an Enoch and an Elijah , and all who shall be alive at the coming of the Lord without chaining their glorification to death and resurrection . Enoch and Elijah were translated into eternal life with God without passing through disease , death , and corruption , for the consolation of believers , and to awaken the hope of a life after death . Enoch 's translation stands about half way between Adam and the flood , in the 987th year after the creation of Adam . Seth , Enos , Cainan , Mahalaleel , and Jared were still alive . His son Methuselah and his grandson Lamech were also living , the latter being 113 years old . Noah was not yet born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of his walking with God , was " an example . of repentance to all generations , " as the son of Sirach says ( Ecclus. xliv. 16 ) ; and the apocryphal legend in the book of Enoch i. 9 represents him as prophesying of the coming of the Lord , to execute judgment upon the ungodly ( Jude 14 , 15 ) . In comparison with the longevity of the other fathers , Enoch was taken away young , before he had reached half the ordinary age , as a sign that whilst long life , viewed as a time for repentance and grace , is indeed a blessing from God , when the ills which have entered the world through sin are considered , it is also a burden and trouble which God shortens for His chosen . That the patriarchs of the old world felt the ills of this earthly life in all their severity , was attested by Lamech ( vers. 28 , 29 ) , when he gave his son , who was born 69 years after Enoch 's translation , the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us concerning our work and the toil of our hands , because of the ground which the Lord bath cursed . " Noah , Mb from M ? to rest and n ' ? ? to bring rest , is explained by Mn ; to comfort , in the sense of helpful and remedial consolation . Lamech not only felt the burden of his work upon the ground which God had cursed , but looked forward with a prophetic presentiment to the time when the existing misery and corruption would terminate , <p> CHAP . VI . 1--5. 127 <p> and a change for- the better , a redemption from the curse , would come . This presentiment assumed the form of hope when his son was born ; he therefore gave expression to it in his name . But his hope was not realized , at least not in the way that he desired . A change did indeed take place in the lifetime of Noah . By the judgment of the flood the corrupt race was ex-terminated , and in Noah , who was preserved because of his blameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secured ; but the effects of the curse , though mitigated , were not removed ; whilst a covenant sign guaranteed the preservation of the human race , and therewith , by implication , his hope of the eventual removal of the curse ( ix . 8-17 ) . -The genealogical table breaks off with Noah ; all that is mentioned with reference to him being the birth of his three sons , when he was 500 years old ( ver . 32 ; see chap . xi . 10 ) , without any allusion to the remaining years of his life , an indication of a later hand . " The mention of three sons leads to the expectation , that whereas hitherto the line has been perpetuated through one member alone , in the future each of the three sons will form a new beginning ( vid. ix . 18 , 19 
##752251 <h> Kia , Hyundai step up to the plate and reimburse buyers <p> The question is always whether to take the bad news first or to lead with the good news . There are arguments for both sides , of course . I would hypothesize that the more " sensitive " of us would always opt for the happy headline to lead , the concept , I 've always assumed , that the good news will somehow act as a cushion for the bad that is almost always sure to follow . I 've always been a rip-off-the-Bandaid bad news first kind of guy , willing to accept the anguish of the immediate for the long-term soothing of the pleasant . <h> Related <p> So , in that vein , the bad news on the fuel economy front ( especially if you own a Korean car ) , is that Kia and Hyundai are getting spanked for exaggerating their fuel economy estimates . Though the problem exists on both sides of the border ( and , indeed , both EPA and Transport Canada fuel economy testing are done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the damage is worse on the American side of the 49th because a ) Americans are always more histrionic about consumer protection affairs and b ) some of the numbers that were fudged were the magic 40 miles per ( US ) gallon ( 5.9 litres per 100 kilometres ) that Hyundai was trumpeting in a widely distributed advertising campaign . <p> According to the press releases that have followed , both companies blame the errors on procedural problems during testing . Of course , in this conspiracy defined age , blaming " procedural errors " sounds a lot like the automotive equivalent of an insider trading coverup . And , besides , what possible effect could a " procedural " error on Kia 's and Hyundai 's part have had on the final evaluation : Does n't the EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) do the testing ? <p> In fact , it does not . The government bodies do , in fact , set the very exacting standards that govern all fuel economy evaluation , but the individual manufacturers actually self-test in their very own laboratories . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% of all new cars during each new model year -- but the fuel consumption testing , like so many things we think are independent , is self-regulating . <p> So now , you 're absolutely convinced someone had their hand on the button , twirling the readout until the magic 40 came around . But you know what , it may have been just a mistake . For one thing , the testing procedure is extremely long and time consuming , not to mention complicated . Evaluations , for instance , are not done on real roads but in simulations conducted on rolling-road dynamometers , the same devices hot rodders use to measure horsepower . <p> Measuring fuel economy , though , is far more complicated . For one thing , the testing must simulate city driving , highway driving , accelerating , coasting , idling and operation with the air conditioning on as well as off . The first problem that arises is that consumption is affected by aerodynamic drag that happens when a car is cruising down the road at 100 kilometres an hour . Even a seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will affect a car 's fuel economy . Each of these factors becomes a mitigating factor in a complicated algorithim that governs the dynamometer for the testing procedure . <p> It is the latter that is one of the details being singled out for Hyundai 's procedural error . Faulty testing supposedly gave an errant reading for the rolling resistance that should have been fed into the computer and , as the say in the digital world , garbage in equals garbage out . <p> Nor can I be too skeptical that this is really what happened . Though the dynamometers I 've used are far more basic -- think First World War biplane compared with an Airbus A380 -- they all require futzing with " correcting " factors . Even the most basic must be calibrated for air temperature and barometric pressure , both factors that affect an engine 's output . Indeed , there 's a correction factor that should , in theory , have the same engine recording the same output , no matter what the ambient conditions . The theory , as any hot rodder can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different readings no matter how carefully calibrated . That a similar system , albeit much more complicated , to measure fuel economy can go a little wonky is to be expected . <p> In the end , the real-world difference in fuel economy is not substantial . South of the border , most Hyundai and Kia models will see their ratings drop by one or two mpg ( though one Kia model tumbles a whopping five mpg ) and in Canada , the two companies ' entire fleet average will have to be adjusted by 0.3 litre per 100 km . There is a little good news in all of this . First off , Kia and Hyundai have really stepped up to the plate , informing customers immediately about the problem and , as has been trumpeted in the media , offering all customers of affected models -- more than 900,000 in the United States and 172,000 in Canada -- compensation for the extra fuel they would have to purchase compared with what they had been promised ( visit **29;1294;TOOLONG and **25;1325;TOOLONG for more information ) . These payments will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> The other bit of good news is that I suspect had this problem occurred a few years ago , it would not be garnering the huge headlines that are being generated today . And , for a final bit of good news , the New York Times reported that a University of Michigan report says that cars sold in the US of A in October had the highest average fuel economy in history . Fuel consumption , it seems , has
