Steyn squares him up with a fierce away-swinger that as always angles in to land on leg and then goes away . It was too full for Watson to leave , and it moved too much for him to middle . It bangs the outer half of the blade as he gropes in search of the line , and balloons into the slips . Gone . Watson was made to look like a staggering drunk by the time the ball was done with him . 9/1 <p> 5.6 another stunner , not a bad way to get your first stick in Tests . Vernon wins the battle of the Phils . That 's 500 Test catches for Boucher , too ! 498 of them for South Africa ( the other 2 for the World XI ) . Similar ball to the previous one , lands short of a length around middle and off and then goes away like a charm . This was pacier than before , Hughes gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hope , but the ball takes the edge and is into Bouch 's gloves in a flash . He ends up looking just as clumsy as Watto did . This is brilliant bowling in great conditions for such bowling . 13/2 <p> 39.1 It 's taken him one ball to make a difference ! Marsh 's been ruled lbw , and he 's being very optimistic reviewing that . Good old patent indipper , lands at pace on a length around off stump and nips in , Marsh has been solid all day , but this time he does n't get bat and pad close together , and plays across the line . Was he lulled into this false stroke by the poor bowling until now ? Hit in front of middle , absolutely , hopelessly plumb . A complete waste of a review . Marsh played really well until this one , they may have be tempted into trying their luck with the review . 143/4 <p> 16.2 he has Ponting in trouble now , there 's half an appeal for lbw and they are considering a review . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steyn makes him play now , full ball angling in towards the middle and leg line . Ponting thrusts the front pad well across , as his wont , and then has to play around it with the ball straightening a degree down the line . No inside edge on that . This is touble for the Punter . It 's hit him on the front pad as the bat scissors down and hits the pad . The ball heads on unimpeded into the pads , and that 's super adjacent . Ponting is on his way . Steyn 1 , Ponting 0 . 40/3 <p> 44.3 and another , Hussey is gone off the inside edge . Morne 's getting the ball to whistle in sharply now , and it is too good for Mr Cricket .

It snuck through the gap , but not before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a good low catch . What a huge breach this , Hussey has been scoring runs by the bucket-loads in recent times . 158/5 <p> 45.5 ah well , Aus are in big trouble now . Haddin 's gone , not learning the lesson from the previous two balls . Stays on the crease again as Steyn gets fuller and closer to off stump to ensure Haddin does n't play and miss this time . Haddin obliges , gets across and thrusts the bat well in front of the body to get a big outside edge on a rather ambitious drive , into gully 's hands . 300 ? 200 is looking miles away now . 163/6 <p> 52.3 one shot too many , and that 's the end of Mitch . South Africa will breathe a sigh of relief to see their tormentor back , but this may prove to be an invaluable 20 . Short ball , angled across wide of off stump , and he tries to forehand it across to the leg side . He ca n't get on top of it , and lobs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical tail-ender job from Harris , he 's holed out to mid-on in comical fashion . Bouncer outside off , its heading for his face and he tries it swat it away as if it were a bothersome fly .

Morkel hits a good length once again and slants the ball into Siddle , who plays a loose drive . The ball lobs towards cover where AB takes a comfortable catch .

Harris goes straight through Rudolph 's defence and uproots off stump . The ball pitched on a good length and bent back in ever so slightly after angling across the left-hander .

##209450 <p> Just over a week ago , Australia were bowled out for 47 . It was an indignity that had not been suffered by men in the baggy green in more than a century . They lost the Cape Town Test before lunch on the third afternoon . The bright future that beckoned Michael Clarke ' s side after their series victory in Sri Lanka seemed to have been extinguished . It was standing-room only in the last-chance saloon . <p> Early on Sunday , things did n't look much better . Australia trailed by 209 and South Africa had seven wickets in hand . At 1-0 up , they could bat like Bill Lawry and still take the series . In a previous era , Shane Warne or Glenn McGrath might have taken the ball and forced the match in a different direction . In more recent times , winning from such a poor position has been next to impossible . <p> Few spectators expected a gettable chase . But a six-wicket haul from the teenager Pat Cummins set up a target of 310 , and half-centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the rookie Usman Khawaja , set up Australia 's win . Mitchell Johnson , whose bowling has been poor and makes him no certainty for the first Test of the home summer against New Zealand , got Australia home along with Cummins . <p> Last week , Clarke bemoaned a loss that was as painful as any he had experienced . The contrast could hardly have been more apparent after Australia 's two-wicket win , the highest successful chase ever achieved at the Wanderers , and a victory that concluded in fading light late on the fifth afternoon . <p> " I did n't score many runs in this Test match but it feels like I just got my first double hundred for Australia , I could n't be happier , " Clarke said . " This is one of my greatest Test matches , no doubt . A big part of that is the way we got beaten in Cape Town . To be able to fight back and the rollercoaster throughout the Tests , the light , the weather , the chasing , the record last-innings total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most special Test matches and I 'll remember it for a long time . " <p> Winning from any position was a hallmark of the great Australia sides of the past . Clarke 's side is not great , but this victory will give them confidence . Young men like Cummins , Khawaja , Phillip Hughes and Nathan Lyon might just begin to believe that they are never beaten . The challenge is not to fall backwards . <p> Late in 2008 , Graeme Smith ' s side chased down 414 at the WACA to beat Australia , and although they won the series , within four months they had lost to Australia at home as their self-belief waned . Australia 's next series is against New Zealand , and that will be followed by a tough four-Test battle against India . <p> " To be able to fight back and the rollercoaster throughout the Tests , the light , the weather , the chasing , the record last-innings total , for so many reasons it 's one of my most special Test matches . " <p> " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , " Clarke said . " I said after Sri Lanka we would bring confidence into this series because of our success there and I hope we do the same ; take momentum into the Australian summer . There will be some challenges that lie ahead and we 've already seen that in Sri Lanka and on this tour , but we 're getting better . " <p> Not that it was n't a nervous time for Australia as the chase came down to the wire . Clarke was bowled early on the final day , the victim of a fine ball from Vernon Philander , but also through a significant gap between bat and pad . When Ponting fell for 62 , Australia still needed 145 runs with five wickets in hand . Clarke had been nervous the previous day ; he was even jumpier on Monday . <p> " I started counting the runs down from 190 required yesterday , " Clarke said . " I was next in the batting , I was walking back and forth while the boys were batting , they would get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huss ' , ' 188 more of those , Huss ' . When I came here today I thought we were in a really good position . I thought the way Usman and Ricky batted the night before was outstanding . <p> " They played really positive cricket so I was confident we could win the game today . I would have liked Ricky and I to have spent more time out in the middle but that 's the way it goes . A lot of credit goes to our middle order batting in tough overcast conditions with a bit of rain around . We managed to hang in there and the youngster Cummins decided as he did in the one-day series to finish it off with ease . " <p> As a result , Australia will fly home without having lost the series in any format on this trip . It is an outcome that has left Clarke proud and buoyant . " We drew the Twenty20 series , we 've won the one-day series and now we have drawn the Test series against a fantastic opposition in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so proud of that . That 's an amazing performance by Australian cricket in my opinion . " <p> @5wombats - I have got them covered mate .

Look ; @Gerard Pereira &; @Full-Blooded-Wallop are just a couple of the hundreds of jokers headed your way in a few weeks . Be interesting to see how Aus fans deal with them . You 'd think that thrashing them would be the way to pursuade them - but as you rightly point out , there 's always an excuse . And within a few weeks - they forget it ever happened ! <p> Posted by RandyOZ on ( November 23 2011 , 12:47 PM GMT ) <p> @Meety , the funny think is , we could send out our D side against India and still smash them . They 've NEVER won a series here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ( November 23 2011 , 06:56 AM GMT ) <p> @Full-Blooded-Wallop - I agree that I have n't seen YOU give excuses , I was commenting on the flood of comments that were making excuses . For what its worth I am hoping for a good hard fought series , like the previous tours in Oz . IMO - this is India 's last chance to beat Oz in Oz in a series for a while . I remember back in the mid 80s when Gavaskar or Dev led an Indian side that flogged us everywhere except on the scoreboard , too scared to go for a win &; I thought back then they 'll never come close to us again in Oz ( not so ) , I also said 4 years ago to an Indian co-worker that as long as my preverbial points to the ground - India will NEVER beat us at the WACA , I got that wrong too , but despite that I am very confident that India can only win this series on the back of their aging legends piling up squillions of runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zaheer would also have to play out of his skin . I think Oz will have an attack that will test some aging reflexes ! <p> Posted by Full-Blooded-Wallop on ( November 23 2011 , 04:15 AM GMT ) <p> @meety : My friend , 2-1 escaped my mind , was thinking of 1-1 . And no , I am not the one who gives excuses.A win is a win and a loss is a loss , whatever the factors causing it : ) and regarding rest comments of yours , let time decideth it all ! <p> Posted by Barnesy4444 on ( November 23 2011 , 02:16 AM GMT ) <p> Watson is a bowling all rounder .

He is our only bowler at the moment who has the capacity to consistently get top wickets and he has a history of injuries if overworked ....... Batting order if all are fit : Hughes , Marsh , Khawaja , Clarke , Watson , Hussey , Paine , Johnson , Cummins , Harris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 , 00:53 AM GMT ) <p> @Gerard Pereira - " : Is Bucknor in the Australian team ... " - that my friend is the real reason why the BCCI wo n't use UDRS . So that " fans " like you can whinge if you do n't get the " result " you want . Well the other REAL reason is that the BCCI does n't have a patent on any of the technology &; will only approve it once they have the rights to a cheaper &; inferior version that always gives Green Lights when Sachin is batting ! <p> Posted by Meety on ( November 23 2011 , 00:49 AM GMT ) <p> @Full-Blooded-Wallop - " we accepted we lost , fair and square . " - no judging by the gazillion comments that came in describing the Test team as a B , C or D side , clearly the majority of Indian fans did not accept the scoreline . " But if you see the last two series against Australia . We thrashed them 2-0 at home .. " Hmmm a thrashing 2nil hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a UDRS in place Oz probably would of won the 1st Test &; the 2nd Test involved India chasing over 200 to win - historically not an easy assignment . The last series played in Oz - Oz won 2-1 , but you probably refuse to accept that because " we wuz robbed " . The series before in Oz was 1 all - but do you hear any Oz fans saying stuff like that was an Oz C side because Warne &; McGrath did n't play ? Nope - it was a drawn series . <p> Posted by Meety on ( November 23 2011 , 00:43 AM GMT ) <p> @ Full-Blooded-Wallop - I am assuming you are doing to us what RandyOz did to you with the ( all out for 10 joke ) - by stating that " ... fearsome attack of aaron , yadav , ishant , zaheer ( if fit ) and ashwin ... " Its funny that , given the WIndies - a modern day minnow , batted a whole day losing just 2 wickets to 3 of the bowlers you just mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zaheer is a very good exponant of seam &; swing &; if fully fit , will be capable of taking wickets . Ishant Sharma has struggled against good opposition since his Ozzy summer , he will need a massive form reversal to trouble Oz . Aarun &; Yadav have some talent &; did tour Oz recently in an emerging XI tournament , but they will get slaughtered . If you think Ashwin is going to trouble us - have a look at the best Indian spinners have done over the last 50 years , even Prassanna was below his best &; averaged about 30+ . Ashwin or Bhajji will not trouble Oz ! <p> Posted by Aussasinator on ( November 22 2011 , 17:12 PM GMT ) <p> SA lost this test , more than Australia winning it . As for the India series , the Oz will find it impossible to bowl out the Indian batting twice . India will lose only if they are careless

##411252 <p> LTE ( both radio and core network evolution ) is now on the market . Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment . LTE specifications are very stable , with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases . <p> The motivation for LTE <p> Need to ensure the continuity of competitiveness of the 3G system for the future <p> User demand for higher data rates and quality of service <p> Packet Switch optimised system <p> Continued demand for cost reduction ( CAPEX and OPEX ) <p> Low complexity <p> Avoid unnecessary fragmentation of technologies for paired and unpaired band operation <h> LTE Overview <p> By Magdalena Nohrborg , for 3GPP <p> LTE or the E-UTRAN ( Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network ) is the access part of the Evolved Packet System ( EPS ) . The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency , high peak data rates , short round trip time and frequency flexibility . <p> Figure 1 Network Solutions from GSM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , in a circuit switched manner ( in blue in fig.1 ) , with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection , with very low data rates . The first step towards an IP based packet switched ( in green in fig.1 ) solution was made with the evolution of GSM to GPRS , using the same air interface and access method , TDMA ( Time Division Multiple Access ) . <p> To reach higher data rates and data volume UMTS was developed with a new access network , based on CDMA ( Code Division Multiple Access ) . The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services ( in black in fig.1 ) . In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released . Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging . <p> The Evolved Packet System ( EPS ) is purely IP based . Both real time services and datacom services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off . The new access solution , LTE , is based on OFDMA ( Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access ) to be able to reach even higher data rates and data volumes . High order modulation ( up to 64QAM ) , large bandwidth ( up to 20 MHz ) and MIMO transmission in the downlink ( up to 4x4 ) is also a part of the solution . The highest theoretical data rate is 170 Mbps in uplink and with MIMO the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps in the downlink . <p> The core network EPC is prepared to work with other access technologies not developed by 3GPP , like WiMAX and WiFi . Non 3GPP developed access solutions are divided in trusted and non-trusted . This division is not based on the technical solution but the business relation/agreement between the operators . <p> The LTE access network is simply a network of base stations , evolvoed NodeB ( eNB ) , generating a flat architecture ( figure 1 ) . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface ( figure 2 ) . The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover . For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial , especially in on-line gaming . The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long . <p> Figure 2 . X2 and S1 Interfaces <p> Another advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer , which is responsible for scheduling , is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE . In UMTS the MAC protocol , and scheduling , is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer , responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB . <p> The scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TTI ) is set to only 1 ms . <p> During each TTI the eNB scheduler shall : <p> consider the physical radio environment per UE . The UEs report their perceived radio quality , as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use . The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations , employing HARQ ( Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request ) with soft-combining and rate adaptation . <p> prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs . LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates . To schedule a low data rate , real-time service leads to a pleased customer but a low utilized radio spectrum . <p> inform the UEs of allocated radio resources . The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink . For each UE scheduled in a TTI there will be a Transport Block ( TB ) generated carrying user data . In DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per UE -- if MIMO is used . The TB will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of channels is decreased compare to UMTS . For the user plane there is only one shared channel in each direction . The TB sent on the channel , can therefore contain bits from a number of services , multiplexed together . In theory the highest number of users that can be scheduled during 1 ms is 440 , presuming 20 MHz band and 4x4 Multi User MIMO . <p> To achieve high radio spectral efficiency a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP . For the downlink , OFDMA ( Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access ) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA ( Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access ) also known as DFT ( Discrete Fourier Transform ) spread OFDMA ( figure 3 ) . <p> Figure 3 OFDMA and SC-FDMA <p> OFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers . In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users . This solution is achieving very high spectral efficiency , but requires fast processors . It makes it possible to exploit variations in both frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak-to-average power ratio requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity , increasing the battery consumption . This is no problem in the eNB , but would lead to very expensive handsets . Hence a different solution with lower requirement on the handset was selected for the UL . <p> To enable possible deployment around the world , supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible , LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands , ranging from 800 MHz up to 3.5 GHz . The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz . LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology ( TDD ) as well as frequency division duplex ( FDD ) . Since LTE provides high spectral efficiency , supports high data rates and implements a flexible access architecture , it is proven 
##610050 <h> Obama 's Victory Keeps India 's IT Industry on its Toes <p> Barack Obama ' s return to the White House after his tight-race victory against Mitt Romney on Tuesday has raised concerns in India ' s outsourcing industry . <p> Office workers sit in front of their workstations on the floor of an outsourcing centre in Bangalore , February 29 , 2012 . <p> According to iGATE CEO Phaneesh Murthy , Obama 's hawkish stance against outsourcing will have an adverse impact particularly on the nation 's $100 billion IT services sector . <p> " Not the best news for India or the IT outsourcing industry . However , we need to understand how much of the election rhetoric continues into 2013 and that will determine the full implications to us , " Murthy told CNBC TV18 . <p> Job creation emerged as a top priority in the presidential campaign . In the run-up to the elections , Obama took a strong approach on the issue of outsourcing jobs overseas and announced a string of measures to award firms that create jobs within the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the presidential fight , particularly after Obama accused Republican challenger Romney of encouraging offshoring American jobs there . <p> Amongst the metropolitan cities in the country , Bangalore may face the impact of Obama 's second coming . Dubbed " Silicon City of India " , Bangalore is a global hub for major IT companies and is home to several IT outsourcing firms like Infosys and Wipro , which have a strong presence in the US . <p> The industry 's apex body Nasscom said that Indian IT firms have increased their investment by ten times in US-based centres . This has indirectly created around 175,000 jobs in the US , which at one time found itself in the middle of a lacklustre economy and high unemployment rates . <p> Rising visa costs have impacted the employment prospects of Indians going there . Many firms had complained against rejections and visa delays . Even the Indian government was prompted to lobby against the US law that required doubling the fees for visa applications . <p> Analysts shared similar sentiments about the effect on India 's IT industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visas for their staff during Obama 's second term in Office , The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) reported . <p> Infosys had earlier faced allegations of misusing US visa programs . The company was accused of using short-term US business visas , instead of the required H1B1 permits , for Indian employees to carry out full-time onsite . The lawsuit was eventually dismissed in favour of Infosys . <p> Despite the strong campaign against outsourcing , Infosys announced plans to step up hiring in the US , expecting to double its work force there . In realistic terms , the country is facing shortage of skilled technical employees , triggering the need for such workforce from India . <p> Besides job creation , Indian IT companies have contributed $15 billion in taxes to the US in the past five years . <p> Other IT firms are also seeking to increase their offshore presence there . Many companies are seeking to branch out to other segments like consulting and enterprise solutions rather than software application and development . <p> " That is where Indian companies are hiring in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rediff reported . " And , it will increase , " he added . <p> While some IT firms are wary of the effects following Obama 's win , others are optimistic about the growth of the industry in the US market . <p> " In the US , economic growth and employment growth is more muted than what we saw in June . However , the demand for IT service is holding out . The demand is not a bumper demand that was there a couple of years back . But it is reasonably strong , " Azim Premji , Chairman of Wipro , told Business Standard . <p> " That ( focus on economic activities ) translates into significant opportunity for the technology sector because it will be central in creating jobs in the US , India and in other markets which are used as

##642150 <p> There are two certainties in this cricketing life : Don Bradman was the greatest of all batsmen , and Garry Sobers was undoubtedly the game 's best all-round cricketer . <p> Sobers was cricket 's lion , and he heads my pride of the five best allrounders I 've seen . Because of his mercurial all-round ability , Sobers must be crowned the greatest player in cricket history . Statistics do n't always tell the full story , but his stats are n't half bad : 93 Tests , 8032 runs at 57.78 , with 26 centuries and a career best of 365 not out . With the ball , bowling left-arm fast , wrist- or orthodox spin , he took 235 wickets at 34.03 with six five-wicket hauls and a career best of 6 for 73 . <p> He also took 109 catches , some of them seemingly impossible ones at backward short-leg . During a charity match in Adelaide in which I played alongside Sobers , he took a catch off my bowling at short midwicket . There was not the hint of a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball had disappeared into a pouch of fur : Sobers was the epitome of the iron fist in the velvet glove . <p> Bradman reckoned Sobers ' 254 against Australia for the Rest of the World team at the MCG in 1972 was the " best innings I 've seen in Australia " . <p> Sobers had a sense of history and of fair play . When South Africa played South Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 1963-64 , he sidled up to his state captain , Les Favell , and asked : " Is it okay , skipper , if I wear my Test cap ? " Favell said he could n't care what cap Sobie wore , but he was intrigued as to why his great allrounder wanted to don the West Indies cap . With a not-so-subtle swipe at the injustices of the apartheid system , Sobers said : " I believe it is time these Springboks got a good , long look at the West Indies cap I am wearing . " He got a big hundred . <p> There have been a few better batsmen than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a complete package - batsman , bowler , fieldsman , cricket thinker - he reigns supreme . There was an ease of motion to this man which bordered on the poetic ; in a cricketing sense Sobers on the prowl was something to behold . <p> *** <p> Second to Sobers , in terms of skill and an innate ability to perform when needed , was Keith Miller . Miller was right out of the Boy 's Own Annual . He was a war hero and a supreme athlete with the sort of star quality we associate with stage and screen . In 55 Tests he hit 2958 runs at 36.97 , with seven hundreds , and he took 170 wickets at an average of 22.97 , with a career-best 7 for 60 among his seven bags of five wickets or more in an innings . <p> Sir Leonard Hutton told me that the best bowler he ever faced was SF Barnes . Barnes was 62 , Hutton a boy of 16 , but on the Test stage , Hutton said , " the most dangerous bowler was undoubtedly Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legbreak as he was a fast outswinger in his first over of a Test match . He batted and bowled on whim and the need of the side . If Australia were in trouble he lifted a few gears and got the job done . <p> In 1969 , Miller turned up to take part in a coaching film . All he had to do was to bowl three balls at an unprotected set of stumps . He walked past me where I stood some seven paces back from my mark and said , " Ahem , son , I 'll pitch leg and hit off . " His first and third balls did precisely that : the ball was propelled at a speed at least as fast as Graham McKenzie , who was a fast bowler for Australia then . The seam was perfectly upright and it pitched on both occasions on the line of leg stump and broke like a Shane Warne legbreak to hit the top of off stump . <p> *** <p> Imran Khan was a warrior cricketer if ever there was one . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could " lift " as a batsman or bowler . In 88 Tests , Imran hit 3807 runs at 37.69 , with a highest score of 136 among his six hundreds . With the ball he took 362 wickets at an average of 22.81 , taking five or more wickets in an innings 23 times . He was also a born leader , a trait that has stayed with him in his political quest to try and steer Pakistan towards a democracy of sorts . <p> Imran succeeded with his pace bowling on all surfaces , even on the bone-dry parched pitches of home that powdered to the touch like some river bed in biblical times after 40 years of drought . While he batted with skill and good judgement , especially when he needed to guide his country out of the mire , it was his bowling which fired the imagination . Imran loved a challenge and was his best against the best batsmen , for they provided the greater challenge . He could be operating at a pace around fast-medium , and then , suddenly , without any obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage express pace . When he was quick , he was seriously quick as he proved in Australia in the 1976-77 series . <p> Like a good-quality red , Imran got better with age . In his final 50-odd Tests he averaged a shade above 50 with the bat and just 19 with the ball . His stirring match figures of 10 for 77 against England at Headingley in 1987 gave Pakistan their first series win against the olde enemy on their home soil . And in 1992 he led Pakistan to World Cup glory . <p> *** <p> Ian Botham had an outstanding all-round record . In 102 Tests he scored 5200 runs at 33.54 with 14 centuries , and he took 383 wickets at 28.40 with 27 bags of five wickets or more and a career-best haul of 8 for 34 . He was probably lucky to have struck an Australian team mostly without its better players . Just after he began his career , Australia and West Indies lost their best players to World Series Cricket , and then came the rebel tours of South Africa . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he seemed a better batsman than a bowler . He hit with explosive power , especially straight . As a bowler he seemed to bowl well within himself , but every now and then he would drive through the crease with amazing energy and produce a pearler of a delivery . It was this element of surprise that had batsmen guessing , and it often led to wickets . He was n't in the class of Kapil Dev or Richard Hadlee as a bowler , yet he was a better bat than both men , and a brilliant slip fieldsman . <p> Perhaps Botham 's magnum opus came at Headingley in 1981 , when he flayed Dennis Lillee , Terry Alderman and Co to the tune of 149 , which turned the match on its head and won it for England - thanks also to an eight-wicket haul by Bob Willis - after the bookies were offering 500-1 against an England victory . <p> My fifth choice is a little controversial . Mike Procter played little international cricket , and in seven Tests he averaged a modest 25.11 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a bowler , Procter came at you like a raging bull . He was full on , bustling towards the batsman with a determined glint in his eye . At the point of delivery he was very front-on , not unlike Malcolm Marshall , and he seemed to bowl off the wrong foot , the ball seemingly coming on to you in a big rush . His pace was around Marshall 's but usually Procter 's deliveries came in to the right-hander . He bowled huge , dipping inswingers and clever legcutters . <p> In England in 1972 , I watched on television as Procter completed an unusual hat-trick , in that though the ball was bowled from around the wicket , every batsman was plumb lbw . <p> As a youngster Procter spent a season on the Lord 's grounds staff with Barry Richards , another player who was denied a long and successful Test career with South Africa . Procter knew that apartheid in his country would prevent him from playing any more than his seven Tests , and his ultimate became first-class cricket - mostly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches he scored 21,936 runs at 36.01 with 48 hundreds and a highest score of 254 . He also took 1417 wickets at 19.53 , with 70 bags of five wickets in an innings and 15 lots of ten wickets in a match . <p> That he was denied Test cricket could not dissuade me from counting Procter among one of the best allrounders I 've seen . I place him above the likes of Kapil , Hadlee , Richie Benaud , Daniel Vettori , even Alan Davidson , who was most assuredly Australia 's best allrounder seen since Miller . <p> Procter reckoned his loss of a long and successful Test career was little compared with the suffering of 40 million non-whites in South Africa . In April 1971 , Nelson Mandela was spending his seventh year in a cell at Robben Island , just across the water from Cape Town , where a cricket match between Transvaal and the Rest of South Africa was about to start at Newlands . The players knew the John Vorster government had decreed that it would prevent the South African selectors from picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of Australia . After one ball , four players - Procter , Graeme and Peter Pollock and Denis Lindsay - walked off the field and issued a press statement supporting the selection by merit regardless of skin colour . From that moment Procter and the others could walk tall forever . <p> Ashley Mallett took 132 Tests wickets in 38 Tests for Australia . An author of over 25 books , he has written biographies of Clarrie Grimmett , Doug Walters , Jeff Thomson and Ian Chappell <p> Jay57870 - Mallett is expressing his opinion . We are not talking absolutes here . My granddad used to tell my dad that Bradman was OK but not as good as V. Trumper , the hero from when he was a child . Bradman was a run machine and averaged nearly double his nearest rival ; " bodyline " was devised with him in mind , and his average during that series against England was reduced to the mid-50s . There is no question that Tendulkar is and always has been great . It is a big call to put him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likes of V. Richards or G. Proctor ) . On allrounders , I saw that double hundred by Sobers against Australia for the Rest of the World , and it was breathtaking . Lillee was at his fastest , and Sobers treated him like a medium pacer . Kallis is statistically as good as it gets in history ( and technically perfect ) , but I 'd go with Sobers personally . These , and the likes of Dev , Imran etc ( and wickie batsmen like Gilchrist ) are what any side would kill for . <p> Posted by jay57870 on ( July 13 2012 , 11:22 AM GMT ) <p> Ashley is killing a fly with a mallet(t) ! Poetic license aside , his lack of comprehension of the word ' certainty ' - meaning ' perfect knowledge that has total security from error ' - raises doubts about his journalistic norms ! To proclaim in the very 1st para " Don Bradman was the greatest of all batsmen " - as a ' certainty ' - is contextually over the top ! Let 's again weigh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He posed the question : " So what did the greatest of a former era think of the greatest of our time ? " Frith should know . The great Don personally wrote to Frith extolling Sachin : " My philosophy was to try and score off every ball and to take the initiative and I feel Tendulkar does this . " Like himself : an equal . Such comparisons arise with all-rounders too : IMHO again , Kallis is like the great Sobers , " best among all-rounders " ( my post ) . Still , Frith is philosophical about such comparisons : " The ' argument ' can never be settled absolutely " . Nobody has the final word ! <p> Posted by harshthakor on ( July 13 2012 , 08:36 AM GMT ) <p> @Phat-Boy You have made an important point and I greatly admire Kallis 's contribution.However remember he has scored more than half his run sin drawn games at an average of 79 , as against his match-winning average of 65 . Gary Sobers 's knocks could turn the complexion of game to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career he performed with the ball.Kallis has basically been a great batsman for a long period . <p> At the peak of their careers Botham and Imran were the closest equivalent to Sobers as match-winners.Botham was particularly flamboyant with the bat and a most intelligent seam bowler while Imran bowled with the heart of a lion and could bat for his life . <p> Posted by harshthakor on ( July 13 2012 , 08:28 AM GMT ) <p> @straight6:I share your admiration for Imran Khan.In the 1982 summer he defeated Ian Botham for the title of best allrounder with a Soberesque peformance of 21 wickest at 18.53 and scoring 318 run sat an average of 53 , almost winning a test series for his nation.Finally he achieved it in 1987 where his bowling at Leeds played an instrumental role.From 1981-88 Imran was arguably the best cricketer and best allrounder , winning his battles with both Ian Botham and Kapil Dev.Arguably Imran is the best cricketer and match-winner after Sobers . However I ca n't forget Ian Botham 's herculean efforts to win the 1981 Ashes with his 149not out at Leeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into victories.In the 1980 Jubilee test he surpassed any peformance by even Sobers , with 13 wickets and a hundred.I would rate Imran the better cricketer and arguably better allrounder but at his best Botham was the superior all-round cricketer . <p> Posted by g.narsimha on ( July 13 2012 , 06:59 AM GMT ) <p> KAPILDEV is all time best , wtether the writer agree or not that does nt matter as he may be driven by personel liking dis likings but one thing is sure KAPIL is instrumental in all round rise of INDIAN cricket had he not won THE 1983 WC for india we would not have seen the status INDIA presently enjoying in world cricket , more over he single handedly taken india to un emaginable standards . he never had the luxiry of a decent partner at other end as enjoyed by IMRAAN , BOTHAM , IMRAAN is famous more than for his non cricket activities , but for indians KAPIL IS TRUE CHAMPION does nt need certificates we are more than enough to admire our all time great . <p> Posted by BillyCC on ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know why you said the Sobers era was a bowling era . Looking back at that era , it was clearly one where quality batsmen and quality bowlers shone . If anything , it was the period after Sobers in the 1970s/80s which is deemed the bowling era with about ten truly greats across 4 teams , followed by the 1990s with about seven or eight greats across 3 teams .

##678351 <h> Other SQL Tutorial <h> SQL Joins <p> SQL Joins are used to relate information in different tables . A Join condition is a part of the sql query that retrieves rows from two or more tables . A SQL Join condition is used in the SQL WHERE Clause of select , update , delete statements . <p> If a sql join condition is omitted or if it is invalid the join operation will result in a Cartesian product . The Cartesian product returns a number of rows equal to the product of all rows in all the tables being joined . For example , if the first table has 20 rows and the second table has 10 rows , the result will be 20 * 10 , or 200 rows . This query takes a long time to execute . <p> Lets use the below two tables to explain the sql join conditions . <p> database table " product " ; <p> productid <p> productname <p> suppliername <p> unitprice <p> 100 <p> Camera <p> Nikon <p> 300 <p> 101 <p> Television <p> Onida <p> 100 <p> 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apple <p> 75 <p> 104 <p> Mobile <p> Nokia <p> 50 <p> database table " orderitems " ; <p> orderid <p> productid <p> totalunits <p> customer <p> 5100 <p> 104 <p> 30 <p> Infosys <p> 5101 <p> 102 <p> 5 <p> Satyam <p> 5102 <p> 103 <p> 25 <p> Wipro <p> 5103 <p> 101 <p> 10 <p> TCS <p> SQL Joins can be classified into Equi join and Non Equi join . <p> 1 ) SQL Equi joins <p> It is a simple sql join condition which uses the equal sign as the comparison operator . Two types of equi joins are SQL Outer join and SQL Inner join . <p> For example : You can get the information about a customer who purchased a product and the quantity of product . <p> 2 ) SQL Non equi joins <p> It is a sql join condition which makes use of some comparison operator other than the equal sign like &gt; , = , <h> 1 ) SQL Equi Joins : <p> An equi-join is further classified into two categories : a ) SQL Inner Join b ) SQL Outer Join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows returned by the sql query satisfy the sql join condition specified . <p> For example : If you want to display the product information for each order the query will be as given below . Since you are retrieving the data from two tables , you need to identify the common column between these two tables , which is theproductid . <p> The columns must be referenced by the table name in the join condition , because productid is a column in both the tables and needs a way to be identified . This avoids ambiguity in using the columns in the SQL SELECT statement . <p> The number of join conditions is ( n-1 ) , if there are more than two tables joined in a query where ' n ' is the number of tables involved . The rule must be true to avoid Cartesian product . <p> We can also use aliases to reference the column name , then the above query would be like , <h> b ) SQL Outer Join : <p> This sql join condition returns all rows from both tables which satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join condition from one of the tables . The sql outer join operator in Oracle is ( + ) and is used on one side of the join condition only . <p> The syntax differs for different RDBMS implementation . Few of them represent the join conditions as " sql left outer join " , " sql right outer join " . <p> If you want to display all the product data along with order items data , with null values displayed for order items if a product has no order item , the sql query for outer join would be as shown below : <p> NOTE : If the ( + ) operator is used in the left side of the join condition it is equivalent to left outer join . If used on the right side of the join condition it is equivalent to right outer join . <h> SQL Self Join : <p> A Self Join is a type of sql join which is used to join a table to itself , particularly when the table has a FOREIGN KEY that references its own PRIMARY KEY .

##791852 <h> Google Interview Question for Developer Program Engineers <p> there was a party.there was a log register in which entry and exit time of all the guests was logged.you have to tell the time at which there was maximum guest in the party . input will be the entry and exit time of all the n guests 1,4 2,5 9,12 5,9 5,12 the output will be t=5 as there was maximum 3 guest were there namly guest ( starting from 1 ) 2,4 and 5 . <p> 1 ) Have an integer array of size 24 initialize to 0 . lets call it t. 2 ) for each pair of start and end times , increment the t array corresponding indices from start to end 3 ) Finally check for the maximum in the t array and return corresponding index . <p> it was not 1-24 range of numbers . tht would be so easy.say the time limit is 10000 .. there is some DP approach of O(n) tht do nt require extra space but i was not able to recall tht at that time : ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an nlog(n) solution . Thought is : for each guest , say his time span is a , b , we reorgnize this data to : a , in and b , out , which means at time a , a guest came in , and at time b , a guest left . Do this for all guests , we have a bunch of data like x , in and y , out . Sort all these data by the time part in ascending order . Then traverse from the earliest time , if the data is in , have a counter++ ; if it is out , have the counter-- . After all , the max of counter is the answer . <p> You 're right . If there is same time for in and out , then the order of updating MAX is important . E.g. If we see multiple IN 's and OUT 's at one same time , then 1 ) update MAX , 2 ) decrease counter by OUT 's , 3 ) increase counter by IN 's , 4 ) update MAX again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fine . All you need to know is that when the timeline hits a number in the first array , someone enters , and when the timeline hits the a number in the second array , someone leaves . Think about it . <p> @cool indeed i have seen the same problem on z-training too thats why i am saying that there is some DP solution exist for this problem.well anyways nlogn solution seems gud enof and i actually gave that solution in the interview.lets see if the google guy knows the O(n) solution <p> I guess the problem would be more interesting if the interval of time where most people were present in the party was asked ... Though the solution would be not very involved , it 'd using Interval trees ; mapping each interval in the tree and increasing counts on the intervals already visited . At the end , traverse the entire tree to find the max count interval node . This data structure could be tweaked to find solution to stated problem as well .. <p> There is the same approach as some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have m intervals ( e.g. m=57 ) . First , go through all the intervals and check that the arrive time is smaller or equal to the leave time ( always check your input ) . <p> Create an array of length 2*m ( 114 ) , and put in the array both the arriving and the leaving times . Keep a bit for each time to know if this is an arriving time , or a leaving time . Sort the array by the time . In case of a tie , ALWAYS put all the arriving times before all the leaving times ( only if there is a tie ) . <p> This takes O ( m*log ( m ) ) , but if you know that the times are integers , or that they are in a certain interval , you can do it in O(m) using radix sort , count sort , etc . <p> Go through this array of length 2*m . For each element which is marked as an ival , add 1 to a counter . For each person that leaves , subtract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximal number of people at the party . <p> You can also keep a separate stack . When a person comes to the party , you push one element in the stack ; when someone leaves , you pop it . The maximum height of the stack is your answer . ( This also assumes the existence of the sorted array of length 2*m ) . <p> I have a O(n) solution . First we must see that for each interval a , b , based on specification , the guest does n't leave at time b , i.e. we count the that guest at time b , we make a modification that the guest leaves at b+1 , therefore , the interval becomes a , b+1 . <p> Next , sort the intervals all together . For example , 1,4 , 2,5 , 9,12 , 5,9 , 5,12 becomes 1 2 5 5 5 6 9 10 13 13 ( remember we add one to each leaving time ) . Then we iterate this series , for each number we encounter , if it is entry time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guest time -1 . We maintain the maximal number along the process . In this example , it is easy to see that the maximal guest number is 3 and it happens at two time spot 5 , and , 9 . <p> 1 . sort the intervals non decreasingly on start time . 2. maintain a min heap of end times as we scan the sorted intervals sequentially . insert the end time of an interval t ( start , end ) into the min queue q as follows <p> while ( start &gt; q.min() ) q.pop() ; q.insert(end) ; <p> 3. we keep a max size of the min queue during insertion , also the time t for the max size . return t after we are done insertion . <p> Here is the logic for the algorithm . A set of intervals overlap if all the intervals start before the earliest end time of these intervals . The min queue maintains the end time of the current overlapping intervals . Since intervals are sorted on the start time , when we process the next interval t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) t starts before any overlapped interval ends , i.e , end &lt; q.min() , then t overlaps with these intervals . <p> ( b ) t starts after some overlapped intervals end which means t does n't overlap with these intervals . In this case , we keep remove q.min() until start &lt;= q.min() , i.e. , t overlaps with the intervals whose end time 
##813652 <p> The conditions that surround our surroundings are our environment . The combination of external physical conditions that affect and influence the growth , development , and survival of organisms and the complex of social and cultural conditions affecting the nature of an individual or community define our environment . So a . ( All organisms like plants , animals , micro-organisms and humans etc ) and b . ( All non-living factors like wind , rainfall , temperature , soil and minerals etc ) and their healthy or unhealthy status together define our environment . We will now discuss the focus of lesson 1 . <p> In lesson 1 we will focus on the interaction between living and non-living components of our environment so that we are able to grasp the processes that affect its status . The relationship between the living forms and non-living factors of the environment signifies an ecosystem . In other words , you can say that ecosystem is the outcome of the interaction between environmental factors or between a. ( all the living organisms ) and b. ( their physical surroundings ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micro-organisms and humans ) and the physical surroundings interact with each other and while doing so maintain a balance in nature and thereby sustain a healthy environment . All interacting organisms in an area along with the non-living parts of the environment make an eco-system . You may like to know that the British ecologist Sir Arthur George Tansley coined in 1935 t he term ecosystem and he described natural systems in " constant interchange " among their living and nonliving parts . <p> The ecosystem concept fits into an ordered and balanced view of nature . Scientists developed this view to simplify the study of the relationships between organisms and their physical environment . The name of this study is ecology . <p> As you have already learnt in an earlier module , at the top of the hierarchy is the planet 's entire living environment , known as the biosphere . Within this biosphere are several large categories of living communities known as biomes that are usually characterized by their dominant vegetation , such as grasslands , tropical forests , or deserts . The biomes are in turn made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of an ecosystem , such as the plants , animals , and bacteria found in soil , are known as a community . The physical surroundings , or abiotic components , such as the minerals found in the soil , are known as the environment or habitat . <h> Abiotic components <p> In simple words you can say that abiotic factors are all the non-living factors while the biotic factors are all the living factors . These two components share the relationship of being dependent on each other and in this sense they constitute an ecosystem . In order to better grasp the abiotic and biotic components of an eco-system , you can carry out activity 1 before proceeding to learn about groupings of organisms . <p> A food chain is the flow of energy from one organism to the next . Let us now see whether we can draw a relationship between the producers , consumers and decomposers , in order of who eats whom . Yes , we can draw a relationship between producers and consumers on the basis of who eats whom . This is called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food chain is a relationship between various components of an ecosystem on the basis of who eats whom . For example , you may have noticed that grasshopper eats green plants and frog consumes grasshopper and snake eats frog and bird finally eats snake . Can we categorize this food chain in terms of producers and consumers ? Yes , we can do so . <p> You can call green plants producers while insect ( grasshopper ) , frog , snake and bird , all fall in the category of consumers . Insects since they feed directly on the producers are primary consumers and frogs are secondary consumers and similarly , snakes are tertiary consumers and birds are quaternary consumers . This is an example of a relationship between various biotic components of an ecosystem . This relationship represents a series of organisms feeding on one another . Organisms taking part at various biotic levels compose a food chain . Figure 1.1 shows you a food chain in nature , a ) in forest and b ) in grassland . <p> Figure 1.1 : Food Chain <p> On the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure to show a food chain in a natural pond . <p> Check through Activity -- 2 before proceeding further <p> In the ecosystem we have just discussed examples of three food chains . There can be many food chains existing in the ecosystem and these food chains may be interrelated , that is , at producer level there are similar plants that may be eaten at one level by many consumers . That is , plant is the same , but the consumer levels are different . At the top consumer level we find the similar consumers can be part of many food chains , which are interrelated in their intermediate levels of the primary consumers and secondary consumers . Such interrelated food chains may find the common producer and the common topmost consumer , forming a food web . So many food chains are interrelated in the ecosystem and their interrelationships make a food web . <p> In order to understand in detail the formation of a food chain , we need to talk in the sub-section 1.3.1 about each step of this process . <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place , that is , the transfer of food from one level to another . The transfer of energy takes place from one food level , that is , one trophic level to the next trophic level . So what happens as per the rule of the thermodynamics ( or the relations between heat and other forms of energy involved in physical and chemical processes ) , the transfer of energy is never efficient , that is , whenever energy is transferred from one system to another , that is , from one trophic level to another , hundred percent transfer is not possible because large amount of energy gets wasted . S ome energy and/or biomass is lost at each stage of the food chain as ; faeces ( solid waste ) , movement energy and heat energy ( especially by birds and mammals ) . Therefore , only a small amount of energy and biomass is incorporated into consumer 's body and transferred to the next feeding level , thus showing a pyramid of biomass <p> Only a very small amount of energy , calculated as ten percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . As mentioned above , when primary consumers eat green plants , there occurs a loss of energy as heat to environment , some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes in growing up and reproduction . So only an average of ten percent of the food consumed stores in one 's body and the next level of consumers can use only this amount of energy . You can take this ten percent energy as the average value for the amount of organic matter that the next level of consumer can receive at each step of transfer of energy . So you can say that o n average , only ten per cent of the organism 's energy is passed on to its predator . The other ninety per cent is used for the organisms life processes or is lost as heat to the environment . <p> So , if we go as per the ten percent law , we find that whatever the energy is transferred , from that only ten percent gets transferred and as it happens , by the time the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left for the last consumer is so less that it is absolutely negligible . That is why nature does not allow a very long food chain . The maximum it can have is seven levels or generally it has four or five levels . The loss of energy is really so much that very small amount of usable energy remains available after four trophic levels . <p> There are usually a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem . The greatest number in an ecosystem consists of the producers . <p> Food chains are overly simplistic as representatives of what typically happens in nature . The food chain shows only one pathway of energy and material transfer . Most consumers feed on multiple species and are , in turn , fed upon by multiple other species . The relations of detritivores and parasites are seldom adequately characterized in such chains as well . Usually the food chain has a producer , consumer , herbivore , carnivore , omnivore , and decomposer . <p> This is why it is easy to make that the length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds of organisms eat an organism and in turn several other organisms eat them and instead of a straight-line food chain , the relationship among the organisms is generally a series of branching lines . We call this series a food web . <p> A food web extends the food chain concept from a simple linear pathway to a complex network of interactions . Victor Summerhayes and Charles Elton in 1923 and Hardy in 1924 published the earliest food webs . Summerhayes and Elton depicted the interactions of plants , animals and bacteria on Bear Island , Norway , while Hardy 's food web showed the interactions of herring and plankton in the North Sea . Figures 1.3 shows you a food web of many food chains . Food sources of most species in an ecosystem are much more diverse , resulting in a complex web of relationships than shown in the figure below . <p> Energy enters the food chain from the sun . The flow of energy is unidirectional . It means that the energy captured by the autotrophs or green plants does not revert back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture does not come back to green plants or the producers . As the energy moves progressively through the various trophic levels , it is no longer available to the previous level . Figure 1.4 illustrates the unidirectional mode of energy flow . <p> Any given place may have several different ecosystems that vary in size and complexity . A tropical island , for example , may have a rain forest ecosystem that covers hundreds of square miles , a mangrove swamp ecosystem along the coast , and an underwater coral reef ecosystem . No matter how the size or complexity of an ecosystem is characterized , all ecosystems exhibit a constant exchange of matter and energy between the biotic and abiotic community . Ecosystem components are so interconnected that a change in any one component of an ecosystem will cause subsequent changes throughout the system . <p> Abiotic components play their role in the process when biotic components like green plants prepare food by drawing energy from abiotic sources . That is the green plants prepare their food with the help of carbon dioxide , water , minerals and chlorophyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Green plants prepare their food by utilizing the abiotic factors and once they become the producers they serve as the source of the food for the next trophic level of the food chain and this way the food chain functions . <h> Biogeochemical cycle <p> After these producers and consumers die , another set of organisms called the decomposers play their role . After the death of insects , birds and snakes ( whatever category they belong to ) decomposers feed on the dead bodies and then release minerals and chemicals from their body . This is how they play a very important role in regulating biogeochemical cycle . <p> Biogeochemical cycle as the name suggests is the bio , geo , and chemical cycle . Bio pertains to living , geo pertains to the earth and chemicals refer to the minerals . So , biogeochemical cycle means all the minerals , which are used up by the green plants in making up their body . <p> All the chemicals that the green plants use in making their body from the natural resources go back again to mineral pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learnt earlier in the lesson , the plants or producers , when they are eaten up the consumers and when the consumers die , they are decomposed by a set of organisms which are called as decomposers . Decomposers utilize the decomposed organic substances of a consumer 's body and then they release the minerals or chemicals that go back to the mineral pool , where the plant grows . The new plants can utilize these chemicals to make up the new body , and its new body once again gets into the cycle . <p> This is the way you can comprehend the nature of relationship between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem . <p> As mentioned earlier , we need to reflect on the ways to create a healthier environment for our next generation and us . Section 1.4 of this lesson included details on how human-made activities affect our environment . There we mentioned only negative impact of human-made activities on the environment . Surely , there can be ways to improve the current status of our environment by carrying out certain positive activities to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast subject and many environmental scientists are busy in finding out more and more ways of reducing the negative impact and promoting the positive attitude and practices to save our environment . Here , we will touch upon only those steps that we can take at our end in both reflecting and acting in positive ways to better manage and preserve our environment . Contribution of every single person will go a long way in making our environment healthy . <p> We can begin with our homes . For example , you can try to follow the practices listed below . <p> 5 . Store food in re-usable containers . 6 . Re-use shopping bags and produce bags made by paper and cloth . 7 . Donate used items to a charitable organization or thrift shop . 8 . Do n't leave water running needlessly . 9 . Turn your heater down in winter , and wear a sweater . 10 . Turn off the lights , TV , or other electrical appliances when you are out of a room . 11 . Flush the toilet less often . 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation . <p> Let us look at the amount of waste we generate in our homes and schools and then find out about the prevailing system of waste collection . Then the question would come up if there is any mechanism to sort out bio-degradable matter and non-bio-degradable matter in the total body of waste material . The next question would be to look for a mechanism to treat the two types of waste material separately . These are not very easy tasks to undertake but if you have fully understood the learning points of lesson 1 , our expectation is that you will at least reflect on these questions and then take some concrete actions to address them at a concrete level . <p> Since environmental concerns touch all of us , it is always a good idea to form a group to work on environmental problems . If your individual actions are part of a wider movement to create a healthier environment , even your tiny efforts will bear more fruits in terms of their visibility and deeper impact . <p> If as a user of innumerable consumption items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid anti-environment items like a bad virus , you will protect our environment in numerous ways . <p> Similarly , if you take care to segregate your waste material at home and school into bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable items and then your group of activists can initiate the action to set up with the help of local government and school authorities some mechanisms of treating both types of waste material into re-usable forms , you would be making efforts to save our environment . <p> If you make sure that you avoid the use of non-bio-degradable plastic and alternatively use paper or cloth bags to carry your purchases from shops to home , you would be avoiding use of plastic carry bags . You would have noticed that now vendors serve beverages in trains in India in disposable paper cups which are both hygienic and cost-effective . <p> We can keep on adding several more activities that you and I can undertake to improve the health of our environment . Let us now complete Check Your Progress 7 as the last task of lesson 1 . In addition , let us

Karan Johar is returning as director after two years , last time he wielded the megaphone for ' My Name Is Khan ' in 2010 . <p> The film marks the entries of three newcomers Alia Bhatt , Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra into the glamorous world of Bollywood . However , all three debutants are related to some or the other film personalities . <p> The film has been publicised as the new age story of three close friends , who study in a school with ultra-modern facilities . They are friends but their thought process differ from each other , and this gives rise to some tension among the buddies . <h> ' Shudra : The Rising ' was supposed to hit the screens in February 2012 , but the release was delayed . <h> So , which film do you think willl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension gets heightened when the school management announces a competition to choose the best student of the year .

But , Balakrishnan refused to resign as the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) chief over " such absurd " accusations . <p> During an interview with a leading TV channel , Justice Shamsuddin made allegations that he was asked by a person to ' approach ' KG Balakrishnan 's son and Son-in-law in connection with a case in the Supreme Court . <p> Shamsuddin refused to mention the name of his source and complained that the governemnt is going slow on action against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neccessity to file a case claims that , " There is a rule of law , there is a procedure and that procedure needs to be followed .

##836350 <p> Bathers join daily at the ghats that flank the western bank of the Ganges in Varanasi <p> Today , in popular practice , the Ganga ? s powers of purification and absolution are honored by all those who trek to her riverbanks to receive her compassionate cleansing . The most devout pilgrims walk the entire length of her flow braving the rugged conditions of the high Himals for a glimpse of her splendor . As an avatarana the Ganga has a place of ascent/descent known as a tirtha , located at the mouth of the river . " She as triloka-patha-gamini , ? flowing from the three worlds , ? has crossed over from heaven to earth to the netherworlds and has thus became a place of crossing for human beings , both the living and the dead " ( Eck 1982 : 176 ) . The Ganga is considered the supreme tirtha in the Kali Yuga , the current age of degradation ( Klostermaier 1989 : 312 ) . <p> Although valued for her absolute purity the river itself as the source of all life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last hundred years . Development , trade , and commerce are responsible for building new factories along the river , environmentally unsound installations that use the Ganga for waste disposal of industrial effluents . As the area grows and India ? s population increases many of the cities that the Ganges flows through have exploded in size . Some five hundred million people , accounting for approximately 8% of the world population , now occupy the Gangetic basin ( Stille 1998 : 58 ) . In tandem with the discharge of chemical materials municipal sewage is piped directly into the river only to become someone else ? s problem downstream . <p> Dhobis , or washermen , spread their clothes across the ghats in Banaras after washing them in the river <p> Organic waste , consisting mainly of municipal sewage but also containing trash , food , and human and animal remains , comprises 80% of total waste dumped into the Ganges ( Sampat 1996 : 24 ) . In Indian memory the Ganga has always served this purpose . Early sewage systems were instituted by the British , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carried out of each city . Sadly these systems which were designed in the late 1800 ? s and early 1900 ? s are usually found to still be in operation , poorly accommodating for many more people than they were originally designed for . Kelly Alley cites the example of Varanasi ? s Orderly Bazaar sewer , which was built in 1917 and , with minimal additions and repair , continues to serve the municipality today due to " lack of sufficient funds " . On such smaller scales these sewers effectively diverted human waste into the Ganga , which could , 100 years ago , sustain that level of pollution . The Ganges has long been known to decompose organic waste at an accelerated rate . This is attributed to the rapid rate at which aquatic micro-organisms are able to find DO ( dissolved oxygen ) and together break down organic waste . The measure of this is designated as BOD ( biological oxygen demand ) . D.S. Bhargava , an environmental engineer at the University of Roorkee , has found that " the Ganges decomposes organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khalshiyan 1994 : 1 ) . Today , however , no feat of organic decomposition can match the tons of organic waste that pour from 114 cities along the Ganga into her waters . <p> Industrial pollutants , although only currently blamed for 15% of the total waste found in the Ganges , are fouling the river and poisoning its natural wildlife . High levels of industrial effluents can be detected as far north as Rishikesh , the seemingly innocent pilgrimage city . Payal Sampat writes : <p> It is at Rishikesh that the defilement begins , as raw sewage is dumped into the river along with hydrochloric acid , acetone , and other effluents from large pharmaceutical companies , and heavy metals and chlorinated solvents from electronics plants . The electronics industry , like any other that uses heavy machinery , consumes large amounts of hydraulic fluid and heat transfer fluids that contain polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) . ( Sampat 1996 : 27 ) <p> As the Ganga continues to wind its way down towards Calcutta she experiences dozens of similar assaults that leave her waters fetid and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die manufacturers , textile industries , and tanneries pollute the Ganga with industrial waste as she flows past . Ironically many of the largest offending corporations , including the Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi , The Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd . In Hardwar , and the Ordinance Equipment plant in Kanpur are owned by the government , which claims to be taking steps to protect the Ganga and its people ( Weaver 1986 : 142 ) . <p> The World Health Organization standards for drinking water require coliform levels that do not exceed 10 per 100 milliliters of water . In Varanasi fecal coliform levels have been recorded as high as 100,000 per 100 ml . Elsewhere on the river the count ranges from 4,500 in the north to as high as 120,000 at its estuary before it flows into the Bay of Bengal . It comes as no surprise then that waterborne illnesses , such as viral hepatitis , dysentery , typhoid , cholera , gastro-enteritis plague communities up and down the Ganga . Sampat , writing for the Worldwatch Institute , lists these statistics : " One person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eight of every 10 people suffer from amoebic dysentery each year . " ( Sampat 1996 : 26 , 29 ) . Alexander Stille , reporting for The New Yorker , claims these water-related illnesses " account for the death of more than two million Indian children each year " ( Stille 1998 : 60 ) . 80% of all health problems in India and one-third of all deaths are attributed to the groundwater problem . A mere 7% of India ? s 3,000 cities have existing sewage treatment facilities ( Sampat 1996 : 33 ) . <p> One Indian student 's artistic comment on the degraded state of the Ganga . " Ganda Jal is a word play on Ganga Jal . Ganda means dirty and Jal means water . Today the river is filthy . The Ganga is pumped full of raw sewage , industrial waste while human and animal carcasses bob on the surface . Despite this people still regard the water of the Ganga as pure . They bathe in it , drink , sell , pray and pollute it . " <p> Indigenous marine life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch of hilsa , a species of Indian salmon , has been dramatically reduced in the last twenty years as has many other species . Those few that remain for local fishermen are of questionable value as many contain toxic levels of zinc and lead . As the sewage and bacteria encounter the hot sun of northern India algae proliferates . The natural need for algae is exceeded and rather than this decomposition resulting in increased oxygen it consumes oxygen . As a result marine life is threatened 
##836351 <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the early 1960s , the Goddess Santoshi Ma , previously unheard of , came onto the scene . Although no one knew where she had come from and and there was no oral tradition surrounding her , she began to command attention . ( Kathleen Erndl , Victory to The Mother ) Several temples were built in her honor and in 1975 , she manifested in a Hindi-language film , Jai Santoshi Ma . With the spectacular success of the film , Santoshi Ma became a major religious figure practically overnight . Today , she is thoroughly integrated into the pantheon of Hindu gods and goddesses . <p> Santoshi Ma has emerged within the lifetimes of many of her devotees . So , an outsider might call her a new goddess , a pop culture sensation legitimized by her acceptance into the more institutionalized forms of worship . But , most Indians themselves would disagree . Although she has her own history as the daughter of Ganesha , Santoshi Ma is not considered new or even separate from the other Hindu goddesses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mothers Are One : Hindu India and the Cultural Reshaping of Psychoanalysis , 3 ) Santoshi Ma has always existed . The popular movie which brought her to stardom can be understood as just another one of her worldly manifestations . Since shakti theology asserts the divinity of matter , any material - from wooden , stone or clay icons , to rivers , mountains or even popular films - can be considered a manifestation of the divine . Kurtz explains , " The Hindu notion of the divine knows neither borders of time , place , substance , nor identity . . . " ( Stanley Kurtz , All the Mothers Are One : Hindu India and the Cultural Reshaping of Psychoanalysis , 4 ) <p> Rather than dismissing the medium of film as profane ( and therefore having nothing to offer to the sacred practice of religion ) , Kurtz explains that in India , during showings of Santoshi Ma , " the theater is transformed into a kind of temple , and the act of seeing the film is often taken as an act of worship . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindu India and the Cultural Reshaping of Psychoanalysis , 18 ) However , he is careful to point out that the theater , while considered an acceptable realm of worship , is still seen as lower on the hierarchy and less pure than other types of worship because of its nature as a commercial medium . ( Stanley Kurtz , All the Mothers Are One : Hindu India and the Cultural Reshaping of Psychoanalysis , 18 ) <p> In the case of Santoshi Ma , modern media and technology can clearly be seen as advancing traditional religious beliefs rather than butting heads with them . For example , Kurtz points out that Santoshi Ma 's worship is not at all unorthodox in spite of the unconventional reason for her now widespread worship - the modern medium of film which was able to reach masses of people very rapidly . <p> Most devotees do not believe in any essential difference between Santoshi Ma and other Hindu goddesses , such as Parvati , Kali , Durga or Lakshmi . They are all manifestations of the same great Goddess , the same divine female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images that appear to be Durga or Vaisno Devi by the name " Santoshi Ma " and she is viewed as virtually interchangeable with the goddess Serenvali . ( Kathleen Erndl , Victory to the Mother , 143 ) Both Santoshi Ma and Serenvali are frequently called upon during jagratas - all-night devotional festivals where the goddesses frequently possess and act through human mediums . Santoshi Ma 's rapid acceptance as another aspect of the Great Goddess can be seen as an example of the inclusivity and flexibility of the Hindu Goddess tradition . <p> Even the plot of " Jai Santoshi Ma " asserts this idea that all of the Goddesses are one or at least that there is no conflict in worshipping all at once . The screen play departed from the popular myth surrounding Santoshi Ma . It created a dispute between her and three traditional Hindu goddesses - Laksmi , Parvati and Brahmani . However , in the end , it is revealed that these " older " goddesses were just testing their devotees ; since Santoshi is their granddaughter and she is one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Stanley Kurtz , All the Mothers Are One : Hindu 
##837951 <h> Pages <h> Tuesday , November 20 , 2012 <p> As the arguments in the now epic Novartis case draw to a close before the Supreme Court of India , I 'm glad to report that the bench , consisting of Justice Alam &; Justice Desai , gave Shamnad a patient and receptive hearing in his role , as an amicus curiae or ' academic intervener ' in Supreme Court parlance . <p> As our readers may remember , Shamnad had filed an intervention application before the Supreme Court last year in order to provide academic assistance to the Court in what is probably the most important IP case to be decided by the Supreme Court in its history . This was a relatively unconventional move as academics in India do not usually file such interventions and from what I 've been told Shamnad 's intervention was the first of its kind . His arguments before the Supreme Court continued over two days and one lawyer who witnessed the arguments wrote to me saying " Court 5 is expected to be packed on account of this unconventional academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncluttered , and with a delightful sprinkling of anecdotes and examples . Including quoting Ogden Nash . " The same lawyer also informs me that " This is a first of its kind academic intervention in over 60 years , and one that has had such impact . Honestly , with so little knowledge among us counsel on specific areas of law ( IP , IT , GI , Competition ) such steps must be encouraged . " <p> I second those views . Academics in India are usually cloistered in their classrooms and conference rooms . I hope we have several more of such interventions , especially since we now have a breed of brilliant young academics in India and for its part the Supreme Court appears to be very receptive to the idea . <p> The arguments made during the intervention <p> I 've posted below the links to the summary and written submissions made by Shamnad to the Supreme Court . I 'm not going to get into describing the arguments , lest I lose some in translation but it should suffice to say that Novartis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions that Shamnad has drawn in this case , especially the conclusion that " Therefore , under the present set of facts and the evidence filed , the new form does not cross the section 3(d) hurdle . " To translate that into simple English -- given the evidence on record , Novartis should not be granted a patent for Glivec . <p> At the same time the activist community &; generic drugs industry are going to be less than happy with Shamnad 's emphatic conclusion that excessive pricing can not be a ground to revoke a patent on the grounds that it offends Section 3(b) of the Patents Act , 1970 which in itself bars certain patents on the grounds of public order or morality . In pertinent part , Shamnad 's summary states " Does the claimed new form violate section 3(b) , owing to the high price of patented drug ? No , section 3(b) only applies when the commercial exploitation of the invention itself is barred by public order or morality . " <p> Well , I think it is safe to say that Shamnad is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case but as an academic it is a privilege and honor to lose such popularity contests . <p> With the country celebrating Diwali on 13 November , there have been a spate of public and Court holidays and as a result a much quieter week on the IP front . <p> Prashant started us off by doing this very interesting analytical post on the treatment of patients with Hepatitis C with Pegasys . Questioning the small percentage of patients who actually could afford the high price of the drug , Prashant suggests that the business model of innovator companies may need to be reassessed to suit the Indian market . <p> Prashant also brought us the breaking news in the new big ticket pharma litigation between Cipla and Pfizer over the Sunitinib patent . In an SLP filed by Cipla in the Supreme Court , the Supreme Court has stayed the order of the Delhi High Court which restrained Cipla from selling a generic version of the Sunitinib patent . In what appears to be a huge procedural gaffe - no notice of the SLP was provided to Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting battle and one that we will continue to track on the blog . <p> The highlight this week I think is Mathew 's post discussing the recent IPAB decision on the geographical indication application for the Payyanur ring . As our readers have undoubtedly already seen , the IPAB decision discusses the standing of parties filing as " producers " under the Geographical Indications Act . GI holders and applicants should definitely examine the decision in case they have n't already . <p> Shamnad closes out the week by inviting our readers to what promises to be an outstanding conference to be held on November 27 &; 28 , 2012 . The conference focuses on a very relevant topic ' The Copyright Amendments , 2012 : A fair balance ? ' . For more details , do look at Shamnad 's post here , and Sai 's earlier post about the event here . <p> International Developments <p> Globally , IP has been in the news for several reasons . But Google has a big role to play in the first three highlights . <p> IP licensing just got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are all over the news . The case Apple v. Motorola concerns fixing of royalty for Motorola 's patents that are licensed under RAND terms which Apple believes are unreasonably high . A week ago , the solution-oriented Judge in the Apple v. Motorola case cancelled the trial " with prejudice " once it became apparent ( much to her frustration ) that Apple would not abide by the decision if they believed that the royalty fixed by the Court was too high . Now it appears that the parties are exploring alternative resolution methods such as negotiation and arbitration . This article rather ambitiously believes that if successful , this will end all licensing disputes . A tall claim especially since the Microsoft v. Motorola trial litigating similar licensing terms just got underway in front of a packed courtroom . <p> In a strange twist of fate , karma seems to be catching up with publishing houses . Usually the defendants in litigation with freelance authors about re-publication rights , publishing authors are lobbying to have Google pay for the reproduction of news articles in the face of steeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get itself into ( and out of ) over the years , this will definitely be an interesting spat to watch out for . <p> Google remaining in the news : The bi-annual publication of the Google Transparency Report is out . Apart from data on removal of copyrighted data in accordance with DMCA take-down provisions , the Report also published very interesting data about requests from governments seeking user data . With cloud services already converging with privacy and security concerns , it may interest our readers to know that USA and India ( in that order ) have made the most requests of this nature . <p> There has been a repeat of a curious decision in the US Fed . Circuit Courts ( 2d Circuit ) . After a remand of the Transocean v. Maeserk in 2010 , Transocean II has come out with a stunning case stating that in some cases secondary indicia of obviousness may weigh greater than primary indicia . The decision has come out a few days ago , but this blogger shamefully admits that she has not had a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a handy analysis that you may want to read . <p> One of our nerdier bloggers has kindly pointed me in the direction of what is being dubbed " The Patent Prom " i.e. the Santa Clara University Software Patent Conference which had the who 's who of the patent world in the USA discuss issues and possible solutions to the problem of software patents . A short recapitulation can be found here . <h> Monday , November 19 , 2012 <p> As the dates for the 2 day conference on the copyright amendments draw closer , here is reminder inviting all of our readers to this intense brainstorming session on the amendments , the various interpretative issues and their likely impact . <p> ' The Copyright Amendments , 2012 : A fair Balance ? ' will be jointly hosted by the MHRD IP Chairs at the National University of Juridical Sciences ( NUJS ) and the Cochin University of Science and Technology ( CUSAT ) at the NUJS campus in Kolkata ( Salt Lake ) on November 27 and 28 , 2012 . The conference is supported by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society ( IPTLS ) . <p> The Conference will set the stage to brainstorm and reflect on the changes and various interpretative challenges to the provisions . The stellar panel put together by the organizers comprises academicians , policy makers , IP practitioners , industry voices , civil society organizations and students . And not to mention those responsible for the changes itself to give a comprehensive account to the legislative history of the amendments . <p> The aim of this conference is also to elicit various articles on the amendments and produce a special issue of the NUJS law review ( on the amendments ) and a book as well . One hopes that these articles will serve as good fodder for the interpretative battles that ensue in court in the aftermath of these amendments . <p> Here 's a glimpse of what these two days have in store for you : <p> The keynote address by noted composer and lyricist Javed Akthar will be followed by an overview to the amendments by Prof. N. S. Gopalakrishnan and history of the amendments by the Registrar of Copyrights , Mr. G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entertainment Sector ' will undertake a discussion on provisions affecting Bollywood and the entertainment industry from eminent voices in music industry and legal practice . <p> Session II on ' Copyrights &; Technology ' will brainstorm on the worrisome tech-related provisions of the Copyright Act . <p> Session III on ' Copyright Limitations &; Exceptions ' comprising strong voices from the civil society organizations and legal academia will evaluate the laudable exceptions to copyrights in the amendments and will also take stock of missed opportunities . <p> Session IV on ' Copyright Enforcement , Adjudication and Governance Issues ' will address the constitutional challenges to the Copyright Board and transparency concerns in collecting societies . <p> The schedule for the event along with the list of speakers and topcis can be accessed from here . <p> If you wish to join in on any of the panels and have something interesting to say on any of these provisions , please do drop us an email at iptls@nujs.edu ( with a copy to shamnad@gmail.com ) informing us . If there is space in any of the panels , we will certainly accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of the audience . And we really hope you can join us and enrich the discussion . <p> Registration <p> The conference is open to all . Those interested to attend the conference are requested to send an email to iptls@nujs.edu , with their names and designations by November 24 , 2012 . No registration fee is required for students enrolled in any university and non-profit organizations . For others , the fee is Rs 5000 for registering and attending . We also have a special creativity laden evening ( with dinner etc ) planned for the 27th evening ( entry by invitation only ) . <p> ps : We wish to thank the Ministry of HRD for supporting work of the IP Chairs including the holding of important conferences such as this one . We also thank K &S; Partners ( in particular , Mrs Latha Nair and Mr Rajendra Kumar ) for offering some sponsorship for this comprehensive 2 day conference . We 're still looking for additional funding to help support this conference ... and we 'd be very grateful if some of you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intellectual Property Appellate Board ( " IPAB " ) , in its recent order in SubhashJewellery v. Payyannur Pavithra Ring Artisans ( " Order " ) , decided on an appeal made against the order passed by the Registry on 14.07.2009 in opposition proceedings No . GIR/TOP 2/347/09 granting Geographical Indication registration of Payyannur ring to 1 st respondent/ applicant , Payyannur Pavithra Ring Artisans &; Development Society . The appellant had earlier filed writ petition in the Madras High Court for quashing the order of Registry and restraining the Registrar from proceeding further with the respondent 's application . The Division Bench of the Madras High Court dismissed the writ petition by order dated 07.04.2010 on the ground that the appellant could have exhausted its alternative remedy by filing an appeal before IPAB . For more on the background of the dispute , see here . <p> While removing the name of the 1 st respondent/applicant from the register and remanding the matter to the GI Registrar , the IPAB tried to iron out the creases and bring in clarity . The Order will have ramifications upon the pending applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite commendable considering the pragmatic approach adopted by IPAB i n deciding the dispute . The Order appreciated that the Geographical Indications of Goods ( Registration and Protection ) Act , 1999 ( " Act " ) is still in its incipient stage and the group targeted under the Act may not be adequately equipped to protect their own interests . It is to be appreciated that IPAB was not tied down by procedural formalities and in fact , adopted a lenient approach considering the very nature of the dispute . <p> Highlights <p> The Order examined the ambit of Section 11 of the Act . The applicant under Section 11 may be any association of persons or producers or any organisation or authority established by or under any law for the time being in force which represents the interest of the producers of the concerned goods , who are desirous of registering a Geographical Indication in relation to such goods . Section 11(2) specifies the particulars to be furnished in the application under Section 11 . Section 11 ( 2 ) ( e ) requires a statement " containing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be initially registered with the registration of the Geographical Indication " . In the light of Objects and Reasons and Section 11 of the Act , it was held that the Act clearly requires the submission of the particulars of the producers . The application should show that the association represents the interest of the producers . <p> The Order examined " producers " under Section 2(k) of the Act . The definition is wide and includes any person " who trades or deals in such production , exploitation making or manufacturing " of the goods . Even though the definition can include businessmen , the vulnerable groups viz. , artisans , actual craftsmen and growers who are the real interested persons can not be left out . The main object of the Act is to protect those persons who are directly engaged in exploiting , creating or making or manufacturing the goods . If the creators or makers prove that the application has been made without their knowledge , the registration will have to be removed . The application shall adduce credible evidence to show that the producers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was suggested that the Parliament may consider introducing a provision which requires each applicant to effect a publication akin to the publication of notice under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act , 1894 . The artisans like weavers , goldsmiths and other craftsmen may not be affluent or literate in English language . Therefore , the publication shall be in the local language . The targeted group under the Act can not be left unaware about the filing of any application which affects them . <p> The IPAB also looked into the constitution of Consultative Group . Rule 33 of Geographical Indications of Goods ( Registration and Protection ) Rules , 2002 inter alia states that a Consultative Group consisting of seven members " well versed in the varied intricacies of this law or field " shall be constituted for examining the application presented before the Registrar . In the light of the Rule , a person with expertise shall be a member of the Consultative Group . This will lend credibility to the proceedings . Further , the report of the Consultative Group shall be a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at his/her conclusion . It must contain all the details which are relevant for arriving at the conclusion . <p> Payyanur Ring dispute <p> It was held that the application filed by the 1 st respondent/applicant did not adduce evidence to the effect that the association represented the interests of the producers of the ring who were desirous of the registration of Geographical Indication . A mere claim that the society is called Payyannur Pavithra Ring Artisans and Development Society would not suffice . It was observed that the applicant failed to set out the particulars such as names of producers , the nature of their involvement ( whether they manufacture the ring or whether they trade/deal in the making or manufacture of rings ) , place of production being Payyannur etc . Considering the petition filed by the intervener and filing of affidavits by several persons stating their interest in the matter pursuant to the publication of instant proceedings in a prominent Malayalam newspaper , it was concluded that the actual interested persons were left unaware about the filing of the application . Further , it was noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Geographical Indications of Goods ( Registration and Protection ) Rules , 2002 was familiar with the craftsmanship of gold/ jewellery . <p> It was observed that the disputes in IP matters are not just private disputes . They always carry public interest element . Noting the improper filing of application and the inherent shortcomings in the proceedings , IPAB set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the Registrar for consideration . It adopted a lenient stand on the ground that the impugned Geographical Indication is one of the earlier Geographical Indications . The Registrar was directed to pass the orders within six months from the date of receipt of the Order . <p> Significance of the Order <p> The Order is expected to influence the outcome of the rectification petition filed against the grant of Geographical Indication tag for ' Darjeeling Tea ' in favour of the Tea Board . Prashant had covered the issue here . Tea Board is a statutory body set up under the Tea Act , 1953 . It is a government body , controlled mostly by the government with only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the instant IPAB order which unequivocally states that the main object of the Act is to protect those persons who are directly engaged in exploiting , creating or making or manufacturing the goods , Tea Board may find itself to be in a difficult position . If it can be proved that the application has been made without the knowledge of those who are directly involved , the end-result is a foregone conclusion in the light of instant Order . Note that " producer " in relation to agricultural goods , inter alia means any person who " produces the goods and includes the person who processes or packages such goods " . <p> Prashant had also noted that more than 50% ( fifty percent ) of all G.I. registrations are secured by the Central and State Governments here &; here . In the light of the instant IPAB order , such registrations may also come under the scanner . <h> Thursday , November 15 , 2012 <p> As per reports in the ET and IE , the Supreme Court , acting on a petition by Cipla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stayed the Patent Office 's decision to revoke Sugen 's patent for Sunitinib . <p> As readers may remember , a Single Judge of the Delhi High Court had earlier temporarily restrained Cipla from releasing its generic version of Sunitinib , the decision of the Patent Office to revoke Sugen 's patent since Sugen had claimed that the Patent Office had not provided it with a copy of the report of the Opposition Board . Sugen 's argument is extremely weak for reasons that I 've already discussed in an earlier post over here . A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had declined to interfere with the order of the Single Judge . The Single Judge was scheduled to hear the matter only on the 6th of December and declined , on the 5th of November , to entertain a petition by Cipla for early hearing of the case . <p> Subsequently Cipla , filed a SLP before the Supreme Court which was heard the matter on either the 7th or the 8th of November . According to the Economic Times , " Senior advocate Harish Salve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the bench . " From what I understand a matter can be ' mentioned ' only if counsels for both parties are present . On hearing the petition , according to the ET , the Supreme Court reportedly passed the following order : " Issue notice , returnable on December 5 , 2012 . There shall be interim stay of operation of the impugned orders of October 12 , 2012 and October 8 , 2012 of the high court for a period of one month . " I am unable to access this order on the SC 's website . <p> Usually , in such high-profile matters , the opposite side , in this case Sugen , would have filed a caveat before the SC to ensure that no adverse order is passed against them without prior notice . <p> Going by a subsequent order of the Supreme Court , which is available on its website , it appears that Sugen did indeed file a caveat but were not given notice of Cipla 's petition . The fact that Sugen did not get notice despite being on caveat , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Supreme Court . In pertinent part , the order of the Supreme Court states : <p> " Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina , learned senior counsel appearing for Respondent Nos.2 &; 3 submits that although the respondents were on caveat , no notice of listing by way of mentioning was given to them and the respondents could not be represented yesterday when the Court , while issuing notice , stayed operation of the impugned orders . <p> Registry to submit report as to why caveat was not considered and notice of listing of matter was not given to the respondents , who were on caveat . <h> Wednesday , November 14 , 2012 <p> In the month of October , 2012 the Controller 's offices issued 97 decisions . Out of these 97 , 52 decisions were granted ( including deferred , time allowed ) , 38 refused ( including abandoned and withdrawn ) and no file uploaded for the remainder ( 7 ) . Some interesting decisions : The decisions for application of sections 57 , 59 of the patents act 1526/MUMNP/2006 , makes for an extremely interesting read ! @ 
##839050 <h> ModNation Racers <p> Modnation racers ( United front games and San diego studios ) promised to be to the racing genre what little big planet was to the entirety of gaming , a breath of fresh air . The race create share mechanism seemed to be ready to take the world by storm ! That perfect game to relax and unwind with after a long day of head shooting opponents online or slashing my way through hordes of monsters . Having spent many hours editing and tweaking my custom track in just the demo version , it would be safe to say that this was one title I was eagerly looking forward to just because it seemed to be such great fun . Besides , any game that had a button dedicatedly mapped out just for drifting was bound to be great fun . <p> MNR is an arcade style kart racer that does not stray far from the norms in terms of its game mechanics . Your custom made racer races a custom made kart along a custom made track . Many elements such as boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more fun . ? <p> ? The single player career mode follows the tale of one young mod racer named Tag who 's helped out by an old racer who 's seen his days of blazing glory . The plot is very thin and even the hinted love interest of Tag fades out into obscurity . The game consists of you winning through various leagues and finally being crowned champion . No spoilers here , this is the only way the plot goes and it 's quite obvious right from the start . It 's like any run of the mill underdog takes all story , which is excusable since a deep story is not what you should be looking for in a game as casual as this . <p> Races are of two types , action and pure races the only major difference being the presence of weapon pickups in the action races . Players are awarded boost points for drifting , drafting , airtime , spinning and taking down opponents . These may be used to boost ahead , shield from enemy attacks or activate certain triggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon pickups while already equipped with a weapon . <p> Career races also offer you the opportunity of getting bonus creation items by performing certain tasks while racing such as taking down three opponents or drifting for a said distance . However , this is where one of the biggest flaws in the game becomes evident . Bonus tasks will often require you to perform feats which have never been taught or even referred to before such as getting 3000 spin points or 1000 pavements points . <p> There are no tutorials in the game explaining how exactly you are supposed to spin your cart or how to gain pavement points . This is very frustrating and the leaves the player franctically pressing buttons and twiddling sticks hoping to pull it off which is rather odd considering the game has an extensive video tutorial section explaining in detail each and every aspect of creating things in the world but absolutely no race tutorial . Yours truly has missed many a bonus item because of this very issue . <p> Some tracks in career have defending champions and if you manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge you to a grudge match with its own set of rules . If you manage to win these matches , you receive the challenger 's mod and kart . Kind of a pink slip system . Although this is fun and offers a change in play style , getting to a grudge match becomes near impossible after a first few levels <p> Mod Nation Racers ' real selling point lies in the creative freedom that is given to the player . Players are able to create from scratch or tweak existing mods(racers) , karts and tracks . Creating and editing is quite simple to thanks to the myriad of creation tools at your disposal and the vast tutorial segments that explain how to use them properly . The properties of the various design elements may be altered to change their colour , size and ? make them look more cloth , rubber or plastic like . In case you get confused or think you 're not able to achieve your desired result , you can always check the afore mentioned video tutorial segments . <p> Making a mod is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of creativity may be shown here to either create a new avatar from your imagination or recreate your favorite character ( Spartan god of war anyone ? ) . Mod creation is doubly rewarding as all cut scenes in the career mode will feature the mod you created which is kind of a joy in its own way . <p> Making a kart is similar to making a mod but is n't as rewarding due to what appears to be the total absence of any performance modifications . High rider , low rider , Cadillac engine , jet engine , warp drive , hamster wheel , it really makes no difference . Your kart will still drive and handle the same . This may have been included to keep the playing field level but simply rank limiting the online races and throwing in xp locked performance modifications would have been a great strategy . <p> Next comes the godlike " track creator " . You really get to play god with this little trinket ! Sculpting mountains , making lakes , building tracks , throwing in traps and triggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in props , testing some more ... suffice to say , expect to burn many many hours making your masterpiece . The various creation tools in the track creator are an absolute joy to use and from someone who 's used very little map editors before , this is one game mode that is incredibly easy to pick up and enjoy . <p> And of course , we have the online community making up the " share " . Right after your first qualifying race , you are dropped into a mod spot which is kind of a server having a few other players driving around along with many other zones such as highest rated karts etc . Communication is simple , there 's a global chat and you can also PM people who are in the same mod spot . I say same mod spot there because the game has many , many mod spots occurring simultaneously and you may find yourself in a completely different mod spot with different people at the end of any race ! You can setup races from the mod spot with people you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races that are scheduled to begin . Winning XP races will see you leveling up . Although this seems to be a great system , for some reason , nobody seemed to be even remotely interested in playing an online race . <p> Not only were all my race invites rejected but also the game rooms for scheduled matches were always empty ! The mod spots are filled with players at level 1 and finding anyone at a higher level is a rare occurrence . The only people who seem to be doing any sort of online racing are those who have formed friend parties and show up solely for racing against one other . The casual online racer is absent . The user community is however very actively producing and uploading their creations . Within just a week of game release , the community had managed to produce over 100 pages worth of creations for free download ! <p> Technically , the game is just ok . The graphics are alright but somehow the game gives you a feeling that it was really slapped together in a hurry . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Sound in the game is pretty good ; weapons sound real in their cartoony ways and voice over is solid . Poor data streaming however is a major negative the game suffers from resulting in incredibly long loading sequences before each race . <p> Overall the game has quite a number of flaws that show even through the fluffy adorable wall of kart racing and is a little disappointing . The game by itself would garner a 3.5 but the incredible fun of the track editor boosts the score to a 4 . Ideal game if you 've got two joysticks lying around at home and a 
##839051 <h> Motorola Defy - Is it Really as Rugged as it is Smart ? <p> The Motorola Defy is designed to offer the regular smartphone user just a little bit more than standard mobile functionality . Goodness knows we 've got far too many choices for that genre as it is with plenty more on the way . So as of just know , while the Defy can be your average mid-to-high end Android smartphone it 's slightly rugged shell gives it a wee bit of an edge over the competition . I 've already give you a quick rundown on the device in the preview here , but here 's a closer look . <p> Form Factor I 'm not going to go into too much detail here since I 've already done so in the preview . What I 'd like to state here , for the record , is that after prolonged use , I found the overall design quite comfortable especially since it 's quite light weight at just 118g . Button and port placement is optimum for accessibility and that 's another plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the device is designed to be water and dust resistant to an extent as well as a bit sturdy what with its 3.7-inch ( 480 x 854 pixel resolution ) Gorilla Glass encased display and hard plastic shell , I put it to work to prove its mettle . It stood up to quite a few hard knocks at drops from 5-6 feet , there was not even a hint of a scratch on the device . I tried a few scrapes with a slightly sharp object on the display and that too proved unsuccessful in making a mark on the display . <p> Totally immersed and still getting calls <p> Obviously I could not test its dust resistance but I did dunk it in glass of water and a foot deep bucket and made a few calls to it and even let the music play . The results were not all I hoped for . Water tends to seep in through the camera/LED flash gap as well as through the locking system of the rear panel . This is definitely not a good thing and to be honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charger but when I did , after a few hours of course , no explosion . When I unplugged the gaskets protecting the USB and 3.5mm handsfree sockets I noticed a fair amount of dampness on the insides of these areas as well . Even after a thorough wipe down water still seemed to be oozing out of the cracks for at least an hour later . The rear panel has a division which is designed to keep the water out of the battery compartment though . <p> Gorilla Glass encased hi-res display <p> In conclusion , accidentally spilling water on the handset might still be a cause for a bit of worry for a little while but nothing to stay too worked up about . All other functions seemed to be quite unaffected even after . <p> Features and Performance Interface Like I said in the preview , MOTOBLUR is a good looking UI and has its perks but on the whole I found it cumbersome to use . I had quite a few issues with the phone book to start off with . While it did take a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me sync my Facebook account with the phone book until I had reset the handset at least three times . Like all Android devices , it gives you the option of what accounts to view but did n't let the phone book display my FB contacts or sync them with my Google data . It also seemed like there were two versions of the phone book , one that did n't give me options to edit and control data within and the other with full access . The UI also seemed a bit sluggish and buggy so I decided to get rid of it and simply installed Launcher Pro which proved to be a much better option . I still however found a few other bugs , like how insanely long it would take to delete even four text messages . <p> MOTOBLUR , Colorful but lacks a certain something <p> What 's upsetting is that Motorola has launched yet another handset that 's running on Android 2.1 out of the box with no mention of an update to Froyo . Thankfully the 2GB of on board storage allows for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space issues . Swype is preloaded , making typing a seamless and speedy task . The Defy 's 800MHz Cortex-A8 processor does make it faster than the MILETSONE but the UI still has a few kinks . For instance , after hanging up from a call the ' time on call ' indicator would remain on screen for at least 5-6 seconds , not allow me access to any functions . The UI is definitely smoother than the MILESTONE 's , save for the few minor bugs . <p> Call quality was great almost all the time . With dual mics for active noise cancellation , rest assured you 'll hear everything clearly and so will whoever is on the other end . <p> Media Unfortunately the Defy does not support DivX or XviD video file playback but a quick fix would be to simply download Rock Player Lite ( free ) to make up for that . The good news is the processor allows you to play even larger resolution files quite seamlessly on that player . Music quality is great . Tones are refined and well balanced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another annoyance about the UI is that the EQ settings for the player are only available in the handset settings menu . You ca n't access them through the player 's interface . The FM radio worked out just fine too . <p> EQ Settings for the player , great audio <p> This player also comes with access to SoundHound for music recognition and TuneWiki for all kinds of data on your favourite artist or song . You can also watch music videos right from the player via YouTube of GoTV channels . Connectivity The Defy supports 3G connectivity but lacks a forward facing camera , making video calling a problem . For now EDGE/GPRS works just fine . It features a 3G Mobile Hotspot app that allows you to create a Wi-Fi hotspot for other Wi-Fi savvy devices in the vicinity . All of this on Android 2.1 . With Wi-Fi , DLNA is also provided . Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and USB 2.0 make up for the rest of the connectivity solutions . <p> Flash support even on Eclair <p> Adobe Flash is supported even on 2.1 - you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portal and Media Share apps for syncing with your PC 's media contest and for file transfer are also included . Although the handset comes with GPS and A-GPS support , Motorola has not deemed it fit to include MotoNav for mapping on the device . It would have been worth a slight hike in price considering it would most likely be Free for Life like it was with the MILESTONE . For now you 'll have to settle for Google Maps Navigation and Places for what to do and where to do it . <p> Misc . Features A Data Saver feature in the settings allows you to see just how much data is being consumed on the memory and helps optimise your space . There 's also a battery manager for keeping your battery usage in check . A root Folder app is also pre-loaded so you can access your memory card files if required . All other basic mobile handset amenities are present and accounted for . From Social Networking and chatting to QuickOffice for work , a voice dialer , text-to-speech and a calendar to sync with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widgets <p> Camera A 5MP camera with an LED flash are strapped onto the Defy . It 's not unlike the MILESTONE 's and offers a variety of scene modes , Effects and Geotagging . It lacks White Balance and more importantly even 720p video recording . Image quality is a non-issue . Photos in native resolution always seemed to appear quite dull even when taken in bright sunlight or in a brightly lit room there also seemed to be a bit of a problem with focus in certain areas . <p> Images look dull even in bright sunlight <p> Battery The 1540mAh battery should have been good for at least 6 hours plus of talk time but the Defy averaged in at about 5 hours and 20 minutes which is not bad either . On a single charge , with battery saver in play and a task killer app on board , you 'll be good for two days . Without either , you 'd be lucky to get that . It 's not something that you need be too concerned with however , but I did notice that Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than with most other handsets . <p> Water does get into the gaps <p> The Bottom Line With a price tag of Rs. 18,990 ( MOP ) , the Motorola Defy is a very well priced smartphone that unfortunately does n't deliver too well on all fronts . The UI may not be to everyone 's liking and perhaps the bugs could be attributed to an issue with this particular test device . It 's no doubt sturdy and does manage to keep most of the elements at bay . Camera quality is an issue and it 's a little hard to get past that . It 's a great handset with plenty of features but dealing with its various minor quirks , if they are indeed universal to the handset itself , could get a bit cumbersome 
##839052 <h> Epson PictureMate 210 <p> Our first reaction to this little photo printer was : " What the $%# is that ? " " Looks like an ice pail " " Awesome , bring in the beer ! " " No , wait its a photo printer " " $%# " <p> You really ca n't blame us for that kind of a reaction , because ... just look at the picture below . <p> But funny as it may look , this little gizmo can deliver pictures that will give you absolutely no reason to ever step into a photo lab again . But before that , let 's talk a bit more about it 's ' ice pail ' aspect . <p> Build &; Features The compact yet bulky build of the PM 210 , along with the easy carry handle gives it a very bucket-like feel , complete with a flip open top . It looks really cute and compact , and will look great on any desk . <p> Though the handle allows you to carry the printer around , I would not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because the rest of the build was not made to withstand any kind of rough usage . That , and the odd shape of the unit makes it a bit hard to carry around anywhere or pack up in a bag . Basically , the best place I can imagine this unit is at home . <p> PM 210 has a little LCD display fr you to check your pictures from your memory cards before giving that print command . The interface is filled with self-explanatory buttons that allow you to select the print quality as well as customize the quality of the print . <p> The only kind of paper that the PM 210 supports is Epson 's own 4x6 inch photo paper that comes bundled with the ink cartridge that the unit uses . Speaking of which , the cartridge itself is very different from the standard fare as the single cartridge contains all the ink colors required by the printer . <p> The thing is that the PM 210 wo n't replace your home inkjet printer , as it 's not meant to be one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches so they can be stored in your photo album or frames . <p> It 's a home alternative to getting your pictures printed at a photo lab or from a photo kiosk . That 's a pretty mean deal , because the quality you get from photo labs ( the good ones ) is way better than what you can usually churn up at home , so being an alternative to that is a pretty huge challenge . <p> But by the looks of it the printer is well prepared to take on that challenge considering it comes with all kinds of connectivity options like PC connectivity via USB , pict-bridge , as well as support for a large amount of memory cards including SD , CF and Memory Sticks . Basically it 's equipped to print from any medium you can throw at it . <p> If you think the specs are interesting , wait till you hear about the performance . <p> Performance In high quality mode , the print quality is actually a lot better than what you get from a lot of labs around here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally have not seen from any other photo printer before . Every little strand of hair was sharp and easily visible , with justice done to every little detail in bright areas and shadows . <p> There 's no chance you 'll ever give your digital pictures to a lab again after you see the kind of quality you get from this printer . <p> As mentioned before the LCD interface gives you all the options you need to customize and print your pictures the way you like , so using it is absolutely a cinch . <p> The time taken for each print is close to 52 seconds , which is pretty good considering the quality you 're getting . <p> Conclusion Quality always comes at a price , which is why this little printer will cost you Rs. 10,300 ( printer , cartridge , 150 4x6 inch photo paper ) , and every additional cartridge + photo paper bundle will cost you Rs. 1,350 . Its price and functionality make it more of a luxury item more than a necessary one . After all how many digital photographers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that said , I would still say that once you 've seen the results you get out of this one , there 's no going back to any other kind of 
##839451 <h> GAAR Rethink <p> Dear Dr. Parthasarathi Shome you have been handed a gigantic task . Many believe GAAR ( General Anti Avoidance Rules ) is a necessity in this day and age of multi jurisdiction business operations , financial complexity and aggressive planning . But no business in this country wants an anti avoidance law and definitely not the kind of GAAR that 's currently taking shape in India . So , to your committee falls the task of implementing a more humane GAAR . A fair , less ambiguous GAAR and a GAAR that does n't scare away legitimate investment . Now you said you will be studying what other countries have done and so we thought we would bring you on this special addition of The Firm , experiences of the oldest and one of the youngest anti avoidance regimes in the world . Here goes . <p> Ever since the Duke of Westminister Case , revenue authorities across the world have been trying to unravel the tangled strings that connect tax planning and tax avoidance . Specific transgressions have been curtailed by specific anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step ahead . And so in 1988 Canada became the first country to introduce GAAR . It was prospective including a grandfathering clause and aimed at preventing artificial tax avoidance agreements . Canada 's GAAR applies to transactions alone or part of a series , that result in a tax benefit , that can not reasonably have been undertaken for bona fide purposes other than that tax benefit and that can reasonably be considered to result in a misuse or abuse of other tax provisions . <p> David Duff , Professor &; Co-Director , National Centre for Business Law <p> " But notice the word reasonably . This is an objective test . It is reasonable to conclude that the transaction was primarily tax motivated . So it is not a subjective test and also there has been some discussion in the Indian context about whether the purpose test is subjective because it does n't use this word whether it is reasonable to conclude . <p> One will say you know , yes , you could have achieved those business purposes but in a much more direct way to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not reasonable to conclude that this was primarily not tax motivated and therefore the GAAR could apply . <p> Indian draft rule defines an arrangement to include steps in a transaction . Now from a Canadian perspective , we think of a transaction is singular which is why we have a rule which says that the GAAR applies if a transaction or a transaction is a part of a series results in a tax benefit . So in our system , a transaction is only one thing and in your system the way that you have defined arrangement , suggests that the transaction can be composite , I am not sure if that is the case but it is something to pay attention to . " <p> The US enacted the Doctrine of Economic Substance or the ESD as recently in 2010 . Under it , a transaction has substance if it changes in a meaningful way the taxpayers ' economic position besides the tax effect and if there is a substantial purpose for entering the transaction . <p> Bala Rajaraman , Partner -- US International Tax Services , Deloitte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both prongs of the conjunctive analysis required by the ESD . But there is no minimum profit or minimum rate of return that the taxpayer needs to demonstrate . Instead , what the loss is , profit potential or change in the economic position of the taxpayer will be considered by comparing the pre-tax profit that the taxpayer stands to gain from undertaking the transaction to the present value of the tax benefits and the pretax profit has to be substantial in comparison to the tax ratings . So it is not as if the taxpayer is precluded from realizing tax savings , from undertaking a transaction , you have to show that there is something else over and above the Federal tax savings that accrues to the taxpayer and that has to be fairly substantial . It is not a defined term so one could argue what substantial means . " <p> Since the ESD was a codification of common law and not a new law , it 's spared four types of commonly used transactions such as the choice of capitalizing via debt or equity , making a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related party transactions . The US ESD was applied prospectively and does not allow for advance rulings . <p> India 's GAAR is quite different from the US economic substance doctrine . Some say it 's a mix of Canadian and South African GAARs . Two key design principles are already enshrined in the Finance Act 2012 . A four part test to determine if a transaction is permissible and a three part commercial substance test . <p> The more recent draft guidelines distinguish between tax mitigation and tax avoidance and offer 21 illustrations of when GAAR could or could not apply . <p> Pranav Sayta , Partner , E &Y; <p> " I think two-three things immediately come to mind in terms of the design of the Indian GAAR . One is , unlike maybe Canada or US , we are talking here of not the main purpose being a tax benefit but even one of the main purposes being for tax , that 's one which is very unique I think . The other is there is the second requirement or condition which has four alternatives and that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . So we have not only the misuse or abuse of the law test which I guess is there in Canada as well and probably to some extent is derived in the US as well . But when it comes to the other three tests we see them missing , so the commercial substance , the bonafide purpose or the fact that the transaction is not -----(Interrupted) <p> Rajaraman : The four part test , if you will , in terms of where the Indian rules look to see whether or not there was an abusive purpose or related party transaction those things , we do n't have that significant level of detail in the US ESD rules . US ESD rules simply have a two part test that would say , ok did the tax payer have a business purpose ? Did they have economic substance to undertake the transaction ? So it 's a simpler test in that sense . <p> Duff : I think in common wealth countries there are lot of similarities in the GAAR . Canada has had three aspects to its GAAR and India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One the idea of a tax benefit which is in the Indian GAAR very similar to the Canadian language . Secondly the requirement of a tax purpose or tax motivated transaction which is also similar to the Canadian GAAR . Where the Indian version departs from the Canadian GAAR is the third aspect of the Canadian GAAR focuses solely on misuse or abuse and so there is a question of whether you violated the spirit of the Act while adhering to the words of the Act . India has that element but then has added on these other so called four tests ; one of which is a broad commercial substance test which does n't appear in the Canadian GAAR and does n't appear in most other GAARs that you see in the common wealth or the English draft GAAR , for example , is a more narrowly targeted GAAR focused on abuse like the Canadian GAAR . <p> Doshi : You made the point that India has a substance test which other GAARs do n't necessarily share . What are the consequences of trying to test substance as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it depends on what you are aspiring to accomplish in your GAAR . I think the GAAR that we have in Canada- it really plays a very residual role . We have a number of specific anti-avoidance rules layout the scheme of the Act and the GAAR is there as a back stop for things that could n't have been contemplated , that tax payers design clever way around the rules . Here it seems to me as though that the focus on commercial substance is attempting to do a lot more . <p> Rajaraman : I would echo Professor Duff 's sentiment in the sense that the US already has a number of rules -other types of anti-abuse provisions- that specifically target certain types of transactions . So , when the US economic substance doctrine came into play , it focused on transactions that where not necessarily covered by these rules . So it was more of a residual test and it was the way that I understand the Indian GAAR rules , it could be wielded to basically attack different types of transaction and so I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayta : The commercial substance test is further widened by saying in certain situations ; it will be deemed that there is lack of commercial substance . So , we are in a matter of GAAR , where we are saying that we have to look at commercial substance- is there scope to say that in certain situations it will be deemed to lack commercial substance . Commercial substance is something , which one has to look at under the general principles of whether there is a business reason , you ca n't deem something to lack a business reason if there actually is one , there should n't be a fiction created around that . <p> The first GAAR litigation in Canada came some 7 years after GAAR was first enacted in that country . In Canada a field officer is the first to determine if a transaction is to be subject to GAAR . His report is then sent to a head office that centralizes nationwide GAAR cases to ensure uniformity in application . A tax officer , in the Head office , is the next level of scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rated by a 12 member GAAR panel that has the final say . <p> Dale Hill , Partner , Gowlings , Canada <p> " This is where I was located in head office . So when I would get to see all these reports and remember like it was pointed out earlier , 867 cases were presented to the GAAR Committee . Thousands of cases that came into head office never made it . To give you an example I could be working on 15-20 cases in head office on GAAR proposals by a field examiner and I may only recommend that one , two or three of them go to the GAAR Committee because the stopgap was at the head office . I did n't have a final decision on whether GAAR applied then . I may make a recommendation . If I determine that it did n't apply and then my manager at that time disagreed with me because there was independence in head office as it would still go to the GAAR Committee as well then . But just assume on the premises I agreed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to prepare report . In every Wednesday afternoon I would go present in front of a panellist of 12 senior officials of the Canada Revenue Agency from Gowlings ' to Minister , to Finance , to interpret legislation , to appeals , to every specialty that that particular transaction related to . For example , if it was a financing transaction , then we would have the person responsible at the Department of Finance dealing with that . That person would be sitting on the GAAR Committee . If you noticed , it 's a broad group of people at GAAR Committee ; it 's not one or two or three people , it was a large group . " <p> " Panel for GAAR that is a part of the decision making process . The AO only has formed an opinion , he feels it is a fit case then his opinion on his belief gets filtered by the Commissioner level officer and then the matter goes to the Approving Panel - they are officers senior to the Commissioner and the panel consists of whole time members . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to do except to function as the approving panel . With DRP , there is not much of flexibility . If the workload is high then we can setup another DRP , but for the panel there is a provision that we will review the number of panels to be setup as and when the workload increases or decreases as a case maybe . " <p> In Canada the consequences of a GAAR invocation could range from a denial of that specific tax benefit that the transaction sought to a re-characterization of the transaction . In the US , it 's a 40% penalty . <p> Rajaraman : When ESD was formally put into the statute I do n't think taxpayers were significantly alarmed or concerned about it , but what was new about the provision was that there was this 40% penalty that now applied if the taxpayer 's transaction was found not to have ESD and there was tax that was underpaid as a result of that . So that aspect of this has given taxpayers some pass and has made them rethink whether or not certain transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a challenge by the courts will now have to overcome this potential hurdle of okay , what if I am wrong , I am going to have to pay this 40% penalty over and above my tax liability . So I think that has probably been the key impact I would say of the ESD program . <p> Sayta : The consequences of what would happen if GAAR is invoked- the Indian Law is very wide and it gives powers to the Revenue authorities which could enable them to do anything and everything - virtually meaning thereby that what they could do maybe far too disproportionate and not commensurate with what has been probably alleged to be the tax avoidance motive . <p> Doshi : The key concern here in India is , however moderate GAAR is in design , it is the implementation which is subjective that is going to really bite and I am wondering what the experience has been in the US ever since the ESD has come into force ? <p> Rajaraman : Again the ESD in my view has n't really changed the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sense that if prior to ESD being put into the statute if an IRS agent were to come in out of the taxpayers filings and if they raise this issue it will work its way up the system and if the position that the field officer took was unreasonable , he or she is going to be told pretty quickly that no this is not an issue that we are going to litigate through the courts . Let 's not concern ourselves with this , let 's settle with the taxpayer . With the implementation of the ESD rules , I do n't think that has altered or modified the IRS ' behaviour significantly in my view because they would again go through the same process with the same approach . So in my view the concerns that Pranav has with respect to how Indian GAAR would be implemented is probably not as severe from a US perspective . <p> Doshi : Proffesor Duff you spent sometime today on how the Canadian revenue department looks at GAAR , examines cases and takes them all the way up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you make of the role that process has played in implementing GAAR in a fair or unfair manner in Canada and actually bringing more certainty to the tax payer on what constitutes avoidance because this is so subjective ? <p> Duff : I think there are couple of things- one is what happens internally within the revenue department . We all live in rule of law , ultimately it 's the courts that decide whether the rules apply or not . So , we have to remember that , that 's an important check on excessive applications of GAAR . In Canada there have been a number of internal processes , a government committee that backs all decisions and I presented some statistics- since the GAAR existed something like 800 cases have been considered . Ultimately the GAAR committee has tossed aside a number of them and so it has played an important role of filtering and at least ensuring consistency across the country in application of GAAR . Interestingly enough in the UK , in their GAAR proposal , they have actually suggested a quasi-independent committee including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether a GAAR assessment would be made . <p> Doshi : But the 12 member GAAR committee is entirely government officials ? <p> Duff : Yes , in Canada its entirely government . In fact , there is a concern about having a quasi-independent committee to decide whether the GAAR will apply because in some sense its taking away the power ultimately from the courts that should be deciding whether the GAAR applies . <p> Doshi : In the 24 years of its existence , Canada 's GAAR committee has examined 867 cases and applied GAAR 614 times - that 's a 47% strike rate for the head office . Revenues success rate has also been good in the 40 cases that reached court . 33% wins at the Tax Court level , over 50% at the Federal Court of Appeal and 75% of the cases in the Supreme Court have gone in favour of revenue . <p> You have experienced GAAR in Canada since 1988 . So , you have a better ability to understand what other countries should or should not do ? What do you recommend based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going down the right road or not and what we need to fix ? <p> Duff : I prefaced my comments earlier today saying its always dangerous to make this kind of advice to a country that you do n't know that well . You do n't know the legal system as well to make those kinds of recommendations . That said , we do come from a common English traditional legal system , share values around the rule of law and we have the benefit of experience . I guess looking at the India GAAR proposal , those four factors that we have talked about do make me a little bit anxious . In fact one of the great innovations of the Canadian GAAR was to add this misuse and abuse test . To my mind , the idea of tax avoidance , the hallmark of tax avoidance is you are doing something contrary to what the legislation is intending . So , an abuse test gets at the essence of that . You are avoiding what was intended by the legislation . You are managing to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly is designed to prevent . But GAAR is not a broad brush tool to change all sorts of features of the tax system that you do n't like . Instead you should have detailed legislative amendments , if there are treaties that are causing a concern , renegotiate the treaties , introduce limitation of benefits provisions , if there are rules about buybacks that are causing a concern , there are rules in US and Canada . So , there are specific ways of dealing with specific problems and GAAR is a residual rule . It 's a bit of a concern that it seems to me as though the Indian GAAR is potentially much broader than that and is may be attempting to accomplish other things . <p> Doshi : I know India would have preferred many SAARs as opposed to one GAAR , but I think based on all the global experiences that we have discussed through the course of the day what are the few things that you are hoping in the discussion process that will now take place regarding these draft guidelines will get fixed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One , that if I am doing something which is already envisaged in other provisions of the Act , then those should not be disturbed or get impacted by GAAR . For example , if there is something like buyback as David just mentioned , that 's something that the Income Tax Act specifically deals with as to how it is to be taxed . The definition of dividends specifically excludes a buyback . There should not be a question then of GAAR being applied to re-characterize that buyback into a dividend when the Act itself categorically says that a buyback done in a certain manner will be excluded from the meaning of the term they have said . <p> This is my no means a comprehensive review of the many GAAR experiences . We would have loved to do China and South Africa , but this is all time will allow today . By the way Dr Shome , your team can also access many of these IFA presentations on our website and a very interesting one by GEs 
##847151 <h> This is the Hurd . Welcome . <p> Welcome to the Arch Hurd website . Arch Hurd is a derivative work of Arch Linux porting it to the GNU Hurd system with packages optimised for the i686 architecture . <p> Our goal is to provide an Arch-like user environment ( BSD-style init scripts , i686-optimised packages , use of the pacman package manager , rolling-release , and a KISS set up ) on the Hurd which is stable enough for use , if not as a primary OS , at least as something to consider as a dual-boot option . <p> Currently we provide a LiveCD for users to install or try Arch Hurd for themselves , and provide an installation guide covering its use , as well as an alternate installation guide for users for whom the LiveCD is not an option , for whatever reason . <p> We are attempting to bring the spirit of Arch Linux to the Hurd , and if you 'd like to help us achieve that , we 'd love to hear from you on the mailing lists or IRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are following suit . Only a few Arch Hurd packages use it , and those which do have new versions in testing without tcpwrappers support . This transition will be completed over the next day or two . <p> After much discussion , we , the Arch Hurd developers , feel that , due to the success of Arch Hurd , a remix focussed on netbook users is in the best interests of our community . We reviewed the typical usage of netbooks today and feel that despite our lack of wireless , sound and SATA ( amongst other things ) the superior design of the Hurd is worth the small hindrance that some of our users may experience . <p> After packaging some indispensable desktop applications , Calimero is starting a graphical livecd using the Hurd . Note that this is not an official Arch Hurd LiveCD , rather a project Calimero is doing by himself . The final goal is to do

##849050 <p> Showing great compassion for all living entities Lord Krishna 's lila avatar and literary incarnation Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa composed the authentic historical treatise known throughout creation as the Mahabharata . The eighteen chapters of the Bhagavad-Gita are found in the Bhisma-parva , chapters 25 to 42 of the Mahabharata and they are the exact words that Lord Krishna spoke in Sanskrit on the battlefield of Kuruksetra , India over five thousand years ago in 3137 B.C. The proof that the Mahabharata is definitely an authentic historical treatise and not allegorical or mythological is verified in the Srimad Bhagavatam , Canto 1 , chapter 4 , verse 25 as follows . <p> **25;4708;TOOLONG trayi na sruti-gocara <p> karma-sreyasi mudhanam sreya evam bhaved iha <p> iti bharatan akhyanam krpaya munina krtam <h> Translation <p> Out of compassion the great sage Vedavyasa thought it wise that all mankind achieve the ultimate goal of life . Thus he compiled the historical treatise known as the Mahabharata for the women , laborers and friends of the brahmanas . <p> The external reason chosen by Vedavyasa was to make easily available for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the path of righteousness . This is corroborated in Srimad Bhagavatam , Canto 1 , chapter 4 , verse 29 : <p> bharata-vyapadesena hy amnayarthas ca pradarsitah <p> drsyate yatra dharmadi stri-sudradibhir apy uta <p> Translation <p> Vedavyasa compiled the Mahabharata under the auspices of disciplic succession , properly explaining what is essential so that even women , laborers and those not qualified to read the Vedas can envision the path of righteousness . <p> Although Vedavyasa was an incarnation of Lord Krishna H imself he was also within the purview of disciplic succession having been initiated by Narada Muni who was initiated by Brahma who was initiated by Vishnu . After writing the four Vedas , the 108 Puranas and the Brahma Sutras , Vedavyasa composed the Mahabharata for the benefit of the common man . But the internal purpose and ultimate reason for doing so was to guide the attention to Lord Krishna . In Srimad Bhagavatam , Canto 3 , chapter 5 , verse 12 this is fully substantiated : <p> munir vivaksur bhagavad-gunanam sakhapi te bharatam aha krsnah <p> yasmin nrnam gramya-sukhanuvadir matir grhita nu hareh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sublime transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord Krishna in his epic narrative Mahabharata . But the real purpose was to draw the attention of worldly people away from mundane topics and direct it towards the divine revelation of Bhagavad-Gita spoken by Lord Krishna . <p> The Bhagavad-Gita chronology is given in Mahabharata , Santi-parva , CCCXLVIII . <p> treta-yugadau ca tato vivasvan manave dadau <p> manus ca loka-bhrty-artham sutayeksvakave dadau <p> iksvakuna ca kathito vyapya lokam avasthitah <p> Translation <p> In the beginning of Treta yuga the supreme science of Bhagavad-Gita was delivered by the sun-god Vivasvan to Vaivasvata Manu the father of mankind who gave it to his son King Iksvaku the ruler of the planet Earth . <p> Lord Krishna Himself also confirms this exact same disciplic succession in the transferal of th e supreme science in the Bhagavad-Gita , chapter 4 , verse 1 : <p> sri bhagavan uvaca <p> iman vivasvate yogam proktavam aham avyayam <p> vivasvan manave praha manur iksvakave'bravit <p> Translation <p> The Supreme Lord Krishna said : I instructed this supreme imperishable science unto the sun-god Vivasvan and he instructed it unto Vaivasvata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son King Iksvaku , ruler of all the Earth . <p> King Iksvaku was the sovereign ruler of Earth at the time he received the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita . He was the progenitor of the solar Raghu dynasty in which the Lord Krishna 's avatar as Rama appeared in Ayodhya also in Treta yuga . If we calculate we know that the present age we are in is Kali yuga in which 5000 years have transpired . Before this was Dvapara yuga which had 800,000 years and before this was Treta-yuga which began 1,200,000 before Dvapara-yuga . So from this Vedic information it can be determined that King Iksvaku received the Bhagavad-Gita in this world at the very least 2 million years ago . <p> Going even further , the lifespan of Vaivasvatu Manu who is the current and seventh Manu in this kalpa is calculated in the Vedic scriptures as being 308,571,428 solar years of which 120,400,000 have transpired . Since the Bhagavad-Gita was given to the sun-god Visvasvan before the current Vaisvasvatu Manu was born then it can be understood that the Bhagavad-Gita was spoken to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going even more further than this we know that one kalpa is calculated in Vedic scriptures as being 4 billion 300 million years . There are 14 Manus is this time period of a kalpa of which our current Vaivasvatu is the seventh Manu . So there were six previous Manus before him and they also received the supreme eternal science known as Bhagavad-Gita . So if we multiply 6 times 308,571,428 which is the time of existence for one Manu we arrive at the time span of 1,851,428,568 solar years and if we add the 120,400,000 years from our current Vaisvasvatu the seventh Manu . It can be determined the Bhagavad-Gita was also spoken 1 billion , 971 million , 828 thousand 568 years ago . <p> This supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita which the Supreme Lord Krishna gave to the sun-god is in our current time span of the seventh Manu . This is all under the duration of Brahma created from a lotus sprung from the navel of Vishnu . That Brahma was created from a lotus is confirmed in the Brahma Samhita , chapter 5 , verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tatra brahmabhavad bhuyas catur-vedi catur-mukhah <p> Translation <p> The divine lotus which sprung from the navel of Vishnu is in every way related to the spiritual communion of all souls in existence and is the origin of the four-faced Brahma versed in the four Vedas . <p> So this is the Vedic information regarding the chronology of the 18 chapters of the supreme science known as Srimad Bhagavad-Gita that was revealed by Lord Krishna to Arjuna amidst the 7 divisions of the Pandava army and the 11 divisions of the Kaurava army just prior to the 18 day battle of Kuruksetra in 3137 B.C. This all transpired during the present life of our current Brahma whose origin was the divine lotus manifested from the navel of Vishnu . <p> The Vedic scriptures confirm that creation is cyclic and lasts for a lifetime of Brahma . These calculations are measured by a system known as kalaganana which is determined by the astronomical calibrations and movements of celestial stars and planetary bodies in interlocking galaxies and universes . One day and one night of Brahma is 8 billion 640 million Earth years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 trillion , 110 billion and 400 million Earth years . One lifetime of Brahma is 100 of these years of Brahma equating to 311 trillion and 40 billion years . <p> The supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita is unable to be understood by unevolved beings of impure consciousness . This supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita is periodically given by the Supreme Lord Krishna or His scriptually revealed incarnations or by his authorised representatives through the auspices of disciplic succession in one of the four bonafide sampradayas being the Brahma Vaisnava Sampradaya , the Sri Vaisnava Sampradaya , the Rudra Vaisnava Sampradaya and the Kumara Vaisnava Sampradaya . Having manifested at the beginning of each cyclic creation it eternally manifests again and again with the birth of every Brahma . <p> Further information of the revelation of the existence of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita shall establish the chronology of six Brahmas previous to our present Brahma 's lotus birth from Vishnu as verified below in Mahabharata , Santi-parva , CCCXLIX . <p> In Brahma 's birth 311 trillion and 40 billion years previous to the birth of our present day Brahmas manifestation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a golden egg from Vishnu . When the golden egg cracked Brahma emerged and Vishnu communicated the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita to him . Brahma then delivered it to those holy sages known as the Varhishhadas who in turn gave it to a brahmana named Jeshthya well versed in the Sama Veda . The brahmana Jeshthya instructed a king named Avikampana . After this knowledge of the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita disappeared from this world . <p> In Brahma 's birth 622 trillion and 80 billion years previous to the birth of our present day Brahma and before the Brahma manifesting from the golden egg from Vishnu , Brahma then appeared from the nostril of Vishnu . At that time Vishnu himself sang the supreme science known as the Bhagavad-Gita in his presence . Then a fiat of Brahma born from his will named Sanat Kumara studied it thoroughly and instructed it to Prajapati Virana who after studying it taught it to the ascetic Raivya who imparted it to his son of pure soul and firm vows and great intelligence . After this knowledge of the supreme science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birth 933 trillion and 120 billion years previous to the birth of our present day Brahma and before the Brahma manifesting from Vishnu 's nostril , Brahma then appeared from the ear of Vishnu . When Vishnu lying upon Sesha Naga desired to manifest creation he reflected upon a being who would be puissant enough to accomplish this . At that time a being competent enough to fulfill this appeared from his ear and Vishnu named him Brahma . Vishnu instructed him to create various kinds of beings to populate creation . Also Vishnu imparted to Brahma the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita . After this Brahma created the various and diverse universes with their varieagated mobile and and immobile creatures . In this time the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita pervaded all of creation . With the knowledge of the Bhagavad-Gita which is paramount in righteousness Brahma who was the creator of all the worlds worshipped Vishnu a purusa incarnation of the Supreme Lord Krishna for the benefit of everyone in all the worlds . Then desiring to spread this knowledge Brahma instructed the supreme science of Bhagavad-Gita to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imparted that knowledge to his son Sankhapada who in turn taught this knowledge to his son Suvarnabha . After this knowledge of the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita disappeared from this world . <p> In Brahma 's birth 1044 trillion and 160 billion years previous to the birth of our present day Brahma and before the Brahma manifesting from Vishnu 's ear , Brahma then appeared from the speech of Vishnu . The supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita again manifested itself as well . At that time a rishi named Suparna received it from him . Suparna would recite the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita during the three sandhyas everyday . Knowledge of this supreme science is referred to in the Rig Veda . From the sage Suparna it was obtained by Vayu the wind god who communicated it to those rishis who subsist upon what remains from sacrificial yagna after feeding all the guests . From these rishis the supreme science was obtained by Varuna the god of the ocean . After this knowledge of the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita disappeared from this world . <p> In Brahma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of our present day Brahma and before the Brahma manifesting from Vishnu 's speech , Brahma then appeared from the eyes of Vishnu . At that time Brahma learned the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita from Soma the moon god . Having received it Brahma then imparted this supreme science to Shiva who subsequently communicated it to all those rishis who are known by the name of Valikhilyas . After this knowledge of the supreme science of Bhagavad-Gita disappeared from this world . <p> In Brahma 's birth 1666 trillion and 240 billion years previous to the birth of our present day Brahma and before the Brahma manifesting from Vishnu 's eyes , Brahma then appeared from the mind of Vishnu . Those rishis that subsist only upon the froth of water obtained the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita from Vishnu . These same rishis then gave it to those rishis who are known as Vaikanasas and from them Soma the moon-god received it .

This is confirmed in the sublime and authoritative biography Sri Caitanya Caritamrita by Krishna das Kaviraj in Madhya Lila , chapter 22 , verse 38 . <p> Lord Krishna again revealed the supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita which had disappeared from this world as is confirmed in Bhagavad-Gita , chapter 4 , verse 2 below : <p> evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh <p> sa kaleneha mahata yogo mastah parantapa <h> Translation <p> The supreme science of the Bhagavad-Gita was thus received through the auspices of disciplic succession and the saintly kings received it in this way . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost lost . <p> Thus has been given an authorized account of the chronological history of the supreme science known throughout all of creation as Srimad Bhagavad-Gita , according to Vedic scriptures compiled by Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa , the son of Parasara from the womb of Satyavati .

##849851 <h> I want to do a hardcore action film : Rahul Bose <p> New Delhi , Sep 21 ( IANS ) Rahul Bose is dying to do an action film as he is passionate about sports but says an emphatic no to typical Bollywood potboilers . He adds that offbeat movies and world cinema have always excited him . <p> " I have been seen less in out-and-out commercial films because my preference has always been world cinema . Whether it is ' Split Wide Open ' or ' English , August ' , my inclination has been offbeat cinema , " Rahul told IANS in an interview . <p> " I would never want to do a typical commercial film , but I want to do a hardcore action film now . Stunts and adventure have always interested me . My passion for sports pokes me now and then to consider action roles . And I have always thought of doing at least one film where I would fly through the air , " he added . <p> The 43-year-old , who was here as brand ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of residents of Leh - the area suffered hugely after a cloudburst in August - has always had a unique choice of projects . <p> He started his movie career with Dev Benegal 's 1994 film " English August " , a satire on bureaucracy . <p> Although he has acted in mainstream Bollywood films like " Thakshak " , " Silsilay " and " Pyaar Ke Side Effects " among others , Rahul is known for his portrayals in arthouse films like " Mr. and Mrs. Iyer " , " 15 Park Avenue " , " Anuranan " , " Chameli " and " Japanese Wife " . <p> Does n't he feel uncomfortable being tagged as a serious actor ? <p> " I feel proud that my work is worth being tagged ... even if it means being called ' different ' . The cinema that I do is different and is not mainstream - that is why people give different tags to it . But at least they recognise me . It 's better to be known with some name than to be neglected , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Am " , in which he plays a homosexual , and Vipul Shah 's " Kuch Love Jaisa " opposite Shefali Shah . <p> Rahul is quite excited about " I Am " . <p> " Working in ' I Am ' has been a phenomenal experience and I am quite happy with the way the film has shaped up .

##851552 <h> Sparks <p> Good Morning everyone and thank you for giving me this chance to speak to you . This day is about you . You , who have come to this college , leaving the comfort of your homes ( or in some cases discomfort ) , to become something in your life . I am sure you are excited . There are few days in human life when one is truly elated . The first day in college is one of them . When you were getting ready today , you felt a tingling in your stomach . What would the auditorium be like , what would the teachers be like , who are my new classmates -- there is so much to be curious about . I call this excitement , the spark within you that makes you feel truly alive today . Today I am going to talk about keeping the spark shining . Or to put it another way , how to be happy most , if not all the time . <p> Where do these sparks start ? I think we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million sparks . A little Spiderman toy can make them jump on the bed . They get thrills from creaky swings in the park . A story from daddy gets them excited . They do a daily countdown for birthday party -- several months in advance -- just for the day they will cut their own birthday cake . <p> I see students like you , and I still see some sparks . But when I see older people , the spark is difficult to find . That means as we age , the spark fades . People whose spark has faded too much are dull , dejected , aimless and bitter . Remember Kareena in the first half of Jab We Met vs the second half ? That is what happens when the spark is lost . So how to save the spark ? <p> Imagine the spark to be a lamp 's flame . The first aspect is nurturing -- to give your spark the fuel , continuously . The second is to guard against storms . <p> To nurture , always have goals . It is human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , that is success . It is what is possible for you . It is n't any external measure -- a certain cost to company pay package , a particular car or house . <p> Most of us are from middle class families . To us , having material landmarks is success and rightly so . When you have grown up where money constraints force everyday choices , financial freedom is a big achievement . But it is n't the purpose of life . If that was the case , Mr. Ambani would not show up for work . Shah Rukh Khan would stay at home and not dance anymore . Steve Jobs wo n't be working hard to make a better iPhone , as he sold Pixar for billions of dollars already . Why do they do it ? What makes them come to work everyday ? They do it because it makes them happy . They do it because it makes them feel alive Just getting better from current levels feels good . If you study hard , you can improve your rank . If you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in interviews . If you practice , your cricket will get better . You may also know that you can not become Tendulkar , yet . But you can get to the next level . Striving for that next level is important . <p> Nature designed with a random set of genes and circumstances in which we were born . To be happy , we have to accept it and make the most of nature 's design . Are you ? Goals will help you do that . I must add , do n't just have career or academic goals . Set goals to give you a balanced , successful life . I use the word balanced before successful . Balanced means ensuring your health , relationships , mental peace are all in good order . <p> There is no point of getting a promotion on the day of your breakup . There is no fun in driving a car if your back hurts . Shopping is not enjoyable if your mind is full of tensions . <p> You must have read some quotes -- Life is a tough race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I have seen so far , life is one of those races in nursery school , where you have to run with a marble in a spoon kept in your mouth . If the marble falls , there is no point coming first . Same with life , where health and relationships are the marble . Your striving is only worth it if there is harmony in your life . Else , you may achieve the success , but this spark , this feeling of being excited and alive , will start to die . <p> One last thing about nurturing the spark -- do n't take life seriously . One of my yoga teachers used to make students laugh during classes . One student asked him if these jokes would take away something from the yoga practice . The teacher said -- do n't be serious , be sincere . This quote has defined my work ever since . Whether its my writing , my job , my relationships or any of my goals . I get thousands of opinions on my writing everyday . There is heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it all seriously , how will I write ? Or rather , how will I live ? Life is not to be taken seriously , as we are really temporary here . We are like a pre-paid card with limited validity . If we are lucky , we may last another 50 years . And 50 years is just 2,500 weekends . Do we really need to get so worked up ? It 's ok , bunk a few classes , goof up a few interviews , fall in love . We are people , not programmed devices . <p> I 've told you three things -- reasonable goals , balance and not taking it too seriously that will nurture the spark . However , there are four storms in life that will threaten to completely put out the flame . These must be guarded against . These are disappointment , frustration , unfairness and loneliness of purpose . <p> Disappointment will come when your effort does not give you the expected return . If things do n't go as planned or if you face failure . Failure is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . What did this failure teach me ? is the question you will need to ask . You will feel miserable . You will want to quit , like I wanted to when nine publishers rejected my first book . Some IITians kill themselves over low grades -- how silly is that ? But that is how much failure can hurt you . But it 's life . If challenges could always be overcome , they would cease to be a challenge . And remember -- if you are failing at something , that means you are at your limit or potential . And that 's where you want to be . <p> Disappointment ' s cousin is Frustration , the second storm . Have you ever been frustrated ? It happens when things are stuck . This is especially relevant in India . From traffic jams to getting that job you deserve , sometimes things take so long that you do n't know if you chose the right goal . After books , I set the goal of writing for Bollywood , as I thought they needed writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years to get close to a release . Frustration saps excitement , and turns your initial energy into something negative , making you a bitter person . How did I deal with it ? A realistic assessment of the time involved -- movies take a long time to make even though they are watched quickly , seeking a certain enjoyment in the process rather than the end result -- at least I was learning how to write scripts , having a side plan -- I had my third book to write and even something as simple as pleasurable distractions in your life -- friends , food , travel can help you overcome it . Remember , nothing is to be taken seriously . Frustration is a sign somewhere , you took it too seriously . <p> Unfairness -- this is hardest to deal with , but unfortunately that is how our country works . People with connections , rich dads , beautiful faces , pedigree find it easier to make it -- not just in Bollywood , but everywhere . And sometimes it is just plain luck . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be aligned for you to make it happen . Merit and hard work is not always linked to achievement in the short term , but the long term correlation is high , and ultimately things do work out . But realize , there will be some people luckier than you . In fact , to have an opportunity to go to college and understand this speech in English means you are pretty damm lucky by Indian standards . Let 's be grateful for what we have and get the strength to accept what we do n't . I have so much love from my readers that other writers can not even imagine it . However , I do n't get literary praise . It 's ok . I do n't look like Aishwarya Rai , but I have two boys who I think are more beautiful than her . It 's ok . Do n't let unfairness kill your spark . <p> Finally , the last point that can kill your spark is Isolation . As you grow older you will realize you are unique . When you are little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you grow older to college , you still are a lot like your friends . But ten years later and you realize you are unique . What you want , what you believe in , what makes you feel , may be different from even the people closest to you . This can create conflict as your goals may not match with others . And you may drop some of them . Basketball captains in college invariably stop playing basketball by the time they have their second child . They give up something that meant so much to them . They do it for their family . But in doing that , the spark dies . Never , ever make that compromise . Love yourself first , and then others . <p> There you go . I 've told you the four thunderstorms -- disappointment , frustration , unfairness and isolation . You can not avoid them , as like the monsoon they will come into your life at regular intervals . You just need to keep the raincoat handy to not let the spark die . <p> I welcome you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone gave me the choice to go back in time , I will surely choose college .

##851952 <h> Do you love what you do ? <p> Do you look forward to get to work every morning ? Wake up before the alarm goes off , just waiting to get to work ? If you do , then it 's obvious that you love your job . Well , let 's just say you love what you do . But unfortunately , studies show that very few people in this world feel the same way about work . Very rarely do we really find people who look forward to get to work the next day . Those people who do n't enjoy going to work , have n't you wondered why you never look forward to get to work ? It 's obvious that you have n't , since if you had realised you still would n't be doing what you do now . <p> Research shows that an individual 's longevity depends not just on healthy habits or good genes but also on their work satisfaction . As a professional every one spends a lot of time at work nowadays and add to this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of mind goodbye forever . Yes , work related stress has become a part of today 's highly competitive professional life but you might not realise it but it 's a fact that doing what you love will help you make time to do other things that are important too . Living a balanced professional-personal life is what one strives for but very rarely does . So how do you do what you love to do ? <p> First of all , ask yourself whether you love the profession you 've chosen . Turn inwards and ask yourself this question . Analyse why you chose the particular profession , was it because you really love it or because you were told that it can help you make a living ? Most often that not , we end up doing things to make a living , yes there are times when we can not help it but the world has evolved today and we can still afford to pursue what we like even when we are working . There are thousands of people out in the world , who have switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , the transition has n't been drastic in most cases but carefully planned . Being successful at what you do depends a lot on how much you enjoy doing it . If you 're not sure about this , then try playing a sport or even a video game . If you already do , then have n't you realised that when you enjoy playing the game , there is a lot more energy , you 're more enthusiastic and you strategise so that you can win ? The same applies to work too . When you love what you do , you make sure you 're good at it , you dream of succeeding and in most cases you ensure that you do . Satisfaction is a state of mind that is felt only when you enjoy what you do and not when you do it because you have to . Yes , most people do that but why should you try to be like most people ? Why ca n't you try to find something that you love ? Living your dream is not so difficult anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you do it if you really want to succeed . <p> However , there are times when you might be doing what you love but still hate to get to work the next day . You have no job satisfaction ; you 're looking for a change every six months . Well , there are many like you too but this calls for a serious self-evaluation . Why do you hate to stick around for a long time ? When there are many others working in the same organisation , why is it that you 're not happy ? In most cases it is because you lack certain qualities yourself , be it team spirit or interest ; being biased without any particular reason is a common phenomenon , so do an attitude check because in most cases it is your attitude that can steer away people 's interest in you . So accept constructive criticism , take an interest , be more responsive and pay attention to what is being told . But at the end of everything if you 're still unsuccessful at trying to relax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then just quit rather than staying in a job that can stress you out beyond respite . <p> Another common scenario is lack of challenges . As an individual , we evolve only when we are ready to overcome the hurdles we face in our life , the same way a professional challenge will let you compete and achieve what is expected of you and this can expand boundaries and increase your scope for growth . So have a positive attitude and accept what you think you can endure , because you become what you are from your experiences and at the 
##852650 <p> After full discussion and mature deliberation , I took the vow in 1906 . I had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then , but only consulted her at the time of taking the vow . She had no objection . But I had great difficulty in making the final resolve . I had not the necessary strength . How was I to control my passions ? The elimination of carnal relationship with one 's wife seemed then a strange thing . But I launched forth with faith in the sustaining power of God . <p> As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow , I am filled with pleasure and wonderment . The more or less successful practice of self-control had been going on since 1901 . But the freedom and joy that came to me after taking the vow had never been experienced before 1906 . Before the vow I had been open to being overcome by temptation at any moment . Now the vow was a sure shield against temptation . The great potentiality of brahmacharya daily became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was in Phoenix . As soon as I was free from ambulance work , I went to Phoenix , whence I had to return to Johannesburg . In =within about a month of my returning there , the foundation of Satyagraha was laid . As though unknown to me , the brahmacharya vow had been preparing me for it . Satyagraha had not been a preconceived plan . It came on spontaneously , without my having willed it . But I could see that all my previous steps had led up to that goal . I had cut down my heavy household expenses at Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take , as it were , the brahmacharya vow . <p> The knowledge that a perfect observance of brahmacharya means realization of brahman , I did not owe to a study of the Shastras . It slowly grew upon me with experience . The shastric texts on the subject I read only later in life . Every day of the vow has taken me nearer the knowledge that in brahmacharya lies the protection of the body , the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard penance , it was a matter of consolation and joy . Every day revealed a fresh beauty in it . <p> But if it was a matter of ever-increasing joy , let no one believe that it was an easy thing for me . Even when I am past fifty-six years , I realize how hard a thing it is . Every day I realize more and more that it is like walking on the sword 's edge , and I see every moment the necessity for eternal vigilance . <p> Control of the palate is the first essential in the observance of the vow . I found that complete control of the palate made the observance very easy , and so I now pursued my dietetic experiments not merely from the vegetarian 's but also from the brahmachari ' s point of view . As the result of these experiments I saw that the brahmachari ' s food should be limited , simple , spiceless , and , if possible , uncooked . <p> Six years of experiment have showed me that the brahmachari ' s ideal food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I enjoyed when I lived on this food was unknown to me after I changed that diet . Brahmacharya needed no effort on my part in South Africa when I lived on fruits and nuts alone . It has been a matter of very great effort ever since I began to take milk . How I had to go back to milk from a fruit diet will be considered in its proper place . It is enough to observe here that I have not the least doubt that milk diet makes the brahmacharya vow difficult to observe . Let no one deduce from this that all brahmacharis must give up milk . The effect on brahmacharya of different kinds of food can be determined only after numerous experiments . I have yet to find a fruit-substitute for milk which is an equally good muscle-builder and easily digestible . The doctors , vaidyas , and hakims have alike failed to enlighten me . Therefore , though I know milk to be partly a stimulant , I can not , for the time being , advise anyone to give it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessary as selection and restriction in diet . So overpowering are the senses that they can be kept under control only when they are completely hedged in on all sides , from above , and from beneath . It is common knowledge that they are powerless without food , and so fasting undertaken with a view to control of the senses is , I have no doubt , very helpful . With some , fasting is of no avail , because assuming that mechanical fasting alone will make them immune , they keep their bodies without food , but feast their minds upon all sorts of delicacies , thinking all the while what they will eat and what they will drink after the fast terminates . Such fasting helps them in controlling neither palate nor lust . Fasting is useful when mind co-operates with starving body , that is to say , when it cultivates a distaste for the objects that are denied to the body . Mind is at the root of all sensuality . Fasting , therefore , has a limited use , for a fasting man may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said that extinction of the sexual passion is as a rule impossible without fasting , which may be said to be indispensable for the observance of brahmacharya . Many aspirants after brahmacharya fail because in the use of their other senses they want to carry on like those who are not brahmacharis . Their effort is , therefore , identical with the effort to experience the bracing cold of winter in the scorching summer months . There should be a clear line between the life of a brahmachari and of one who is not . The resemblance that there is between the two is only apparent . The distinction ought to be clear as daylight . Both use their eyesight , but whereas the brahmachari uses it to see the glories of God , the other uses it to see the frivolity around him . Both use their ears , but whereas the one hears nothing but praises of God , the other feasts his ears upon ribaldry . Both often keep late hours , but whereas the one devotes them to prayer , the other fritters them away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the one only to keep the temple of God in good repair , while the other gorges himself and makes the sacred vessel a stinking gutter . Thus both live as the poles apart , and the distance between them will grow and not diminish with the passage of time . <p> Brahmacharya means control of the senses in thought , word , and deed . Every day I have been realizing more and more the necessity for restraints of the kind I have detailed above . There is no limit to the possibilities of renunciation , even as there is none to those of brahmacharya . Such brahmacharya is impossible of attainment by limited effort . For many it must remain only as an ideal . An aspirant after brahmacharya will always be conscious of his shortcomings , will seek out the passions lingering in the innermost recesses of his heart , and will incessantly strive to get rid of them . So long as thought is not under complete control of the will , brahmacharya in its fullness is absent . Involuntary thought is an affection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind , which is even more difficult to curb than the wind . Nevertheless the existence of God within makes even control of the mind possible . Let no one think that it is impossible because it is difficult . It is the highest goal , and it is no wonder that the highest effort should be necessary to attain it . <p> But it was after coming to India that I realized that such brahmacharya was impossible to attain by mere human effort . Until then I had been labouring under the delusion that fruit diet alone would enable me to eradicate all passions , and I had flattered myself with the belief that I had nothing more to do . <p> But I must not anticipate the chapter of my struggles . Meanwhile let me make it clear that those who desire to observe brahmacharya with a view to realizing God need not despair , provided their faith in God is equal to their confidence in their own effort . ' The sense-objects turn away from an abstemious soul , leaving the relish behind . The relish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /1/ Therefore His name and His grace are the last resources of the aspirant after moksha . 
##852651 <p> Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannesburg , there was to be no settled life for me . Just when I felt that I should be breathing in peace , an unexpected event happened . The papers brought the news of the outbreak of the Zulu ' rebellion ' in Natal . I bore no grudge against the Zulus , they had harmed no Indian . I had doubts about the ' rebellion ' itself . But I then believed that the British Empire existed for the welfare of the world . A genuine sense of loyalty prevented me from even wishing ill to the Empire . The rightness or otherwise of the ' rebellion ' was therefore not likely to affect my decision . Natal had a Volunteer Defence Force , and it was open to it to recruit more men . I read that this force had already been mobilised to quell the ' rebellion ' . <p> I considered myself a citizen of Natal , being intimately connected with it . So I wrote to the Governor , expressing my readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He replied immediately , accepting the offer . <p> I had not expected such prompt acceptance . Fortunately I had made all the necessary arrangements even before writing the letter . If my offer was accepted , I had decided to break up the Johannesburg home . Polak was to have a smaller house , and my wife was to go and settle at Phoenix . I had her full consent to this decision . I do not remember her having ever stood in my way in matters like this . As soon , therefore , as I got the reply from the Governor , I gave the landlord the usual month 's notice of vacating the house , sent some of the things to Phoenix , and left some with Polak . <p> I went to Durban and appealed for men . A big contingent was not necessary . We were a party of twenty-four , of whom , besides me , four were Gujaratis . The rest were ex-indentured men from South India , excepting one who was a free Pathan . <p> In order to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with the existing convention , the Chief Medical Officer appointed me to the temporary rank of Sergeant Major , and three men selected by me to the rank of sergeants , and one to that of corporal . We also received our uniforms from the Government . Our Corps was 0n active service for nearly six weeks . On reaching the scene of the ' rebellion ' , I saw that there was nothing there to justify the name of ' rebellion ' . There was no resistance that one could see . The reason why the disturbance had been magnified into a rebellion was that a Zulu chief had advised non-payment of a new tax imposed on his people , and had assagaied =speared a sergeant who had gone to collect the tax . At any rate my heart was with the Zulus , and I was delighted , on reaching headquarters , to hear that our main work was to be nursing of the wounded Zulus . The Medical Officer in charge welcomed us . He said the white people were not willing nurses for the wounded Zulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at his wits ' end . He hailed our arrival as a godsend for those innocent people , and he equipped us with bandages , disinfectants , etc. , and took us to the improvised hospital . The Zulus were delighted to see us . The white soldiers used to peep through the railings that separated us from them , and tried to dissuade us from attending to the wounds . And as we would not heed them , they became enraged and poured unspeakable abuse on Zulus . <p> Gradually I came into closer touch with these soldiers , and they ceased to interfere . Among the commanding officers were Colonel Sparks and Colonel Wylie , who had bitterly opposed me in 1896 . They were surprised at my attitude , and specially called and thanked me . They introduced me to General Mackenzie . Let not the reader think that these were professional soldiers . Colonel Wylie was a well-known Durban lawyer . Colonel Sparks was well-known as the owner of a butcher 's shop in Durban . General Mackenzie was a noted Natal farmer . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and experience . <p> The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battle . A section of them had been taken prisoners as suspects . The general had sentenced them to be flogged . The flogging had caused severe sores . These , being unattended to , were festering . The others were Zulu friendlies . Although these had badges given them to distinguish them from the ' enemy ' , they had been shot at by the soldiers by mistake . <p> Besides this work , I had to compound and dispense prescriptions for the white soldiers . This was easy enough for me , as I had received a year 's training in Dr. Booth 's little hospital . This work brought me in close contact with many Europeans . <p> We were attached to a swift-moving column . It had orders to march wherever danger was reported . It was for the most part mounted infantry . As soon as our camp was moved , we had to follow on foot with our stretchers on our shoulders . Twice or thrice we had to march forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am thankful that we had God 's good work to do , having to carry to the camp on our stretchers those Zulu friendlies who had been inadvertently 
##852652 <p> The reader by now will be quite familiar with Parsi Rustomji 's name . He was one who became at once my client and co-worker , or perhaps it would be truer to say that he first became co-worker and then client . I won his confidence to such an extent that he sought and followed my advice also in private domestic matters . Even when he was ill he would seek my aid , and though there was much difference between our ways of living , he did not hesitate to accept my quack treatment . <p> This friend once got into a very bad scrape . Though he kept me informed of most of his affairs , he had studiously kept back one thing . He was a large importer of goods from Bombay and Calcutta , and not infrequently he resorted to smuggling . But as he was on the best terms with customs officials , no one was inclined to suspect him . In charging duty , they used to take his invoices on trust . Some might even have connived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gujarati poet Akho , theft , like quicksilver , wo n't be suppressed , and Parsi Rustomji 's proved no exception . The good friend ran post-haste to me , the tears rolling down his cheeks as he said : ' Bhai , I have deceived you . My guilt has been discovered today . I have smuggled , and I am doomed . I must go to jail and be ruined . You alone may be able to save me from this predicament . I have kept back nothing else from you , but I thought I ought not to bother you with such tricks of the trade , and so I never told you about this smuggling . But now , how much I repent it ! ' <p> I calmed him and said : ' To save or not to save you is in His hands . As to me , you know my way . I can but try to save you by means of confession . ' <p> The good Parsi felt deeply mortified . <p> ' But is not my confession before you enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me but Government . How will the confession made before me avail you ? ' I replied gently . <p> ' Of course I will do just as you advise , but will you not consult with my old counsel Mr ---- ? He is a friend too , ' said Parsi Rustomji . <p> Inquiry revealed that the smuggling had been going on for a long time , but the actual offence detected involved a trifling sum . We went to his counsel . He perused the papers , and said : ' The case will be tried by a jury , and a Natal jury will be the last to acquit an Indian . But I will not give up hope . ' <p> I did not know this counsel intimately . Parsi Rustomji intercepted : ' I thank you , but I should like to be guided by Mr. Gandhi 's advice in this case . He knows me intimately . Of course you will advise him whenever necessary . ' <p> Having thus shelved the counsel 's question , we went to Parsi Rustomji 's shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him : ' I do n't think this case should be taken to court at all . It rests with the Customs Officer to prosecute you or to let you go , and he in turn will have to be guided by the Attorney General . I am prepared to meet both . I propose that you should offer to pay the penalty they fix , and the odds are that they will be agreeable . But if they are not , you must be prepared to go to jail . I am of opinion that the shame lies not so much in going to jail , as in committing the offence . The deed of shame has already been done . Imprisonment you should regard as a penance . The real penance lies in resolving never to smuggle again . ' <p> I can not say that Parsi Rustomji took all this quite well . He was a brave man , but his courage failed with him for the moment . His name and fame were at stake , and where would he be if the edifice he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces ? <p> ' Well , I have told you , ' he said , ' that I am entirely in your hands . You may do just as you like . ' <p> I brought to bear on this case all my powers of persuasion . I met the Customs Officer and fearlessly apprised him of the whole affair . I also promised to place all the books at his disposal , and told him how penitent Parsi Rustomji was feeling . <p> The Customs Officer said : ' I like the old Parsi . I am sorry he has made a fool of himself . You know where my duty lies . I must be guided by the Attorney General , and so I would advise you to use all your persuasion with him . ' <p> ' I shall be thankful , ' said I , ' if you do not insist on dragging him into court . ' <p> Having got him to promise this , I entered into correspondence with the Attorney General , and also met him . I am glad to say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept back nothing . <p> I now forget whether it was in connection with this or with some other case that my persistence and frankness extorted from him the remark : ' I see you will never take a no for an answer . ' <p> The case against Parsi Rustomji was compromised . He was to pay a penalty equal to twice the amount he had confessed to having smuggled . Rustomji reduced to writing the facts of the whole case , got the paper framed and hung it up in his office to serve as a perpetual reminder to his heirs and fellow merchants . <p> These friends of Rustomji warned me not to be taken in by this transitory contrition . When I told Rustomji about this warning he said : '

##856752 <h> Box office numbers can be deceptive : Aamir Khan <p> In Bollywood , Rs100 crore has become the new definition of box office success . But actor Aamir Khan feels that numbers can be deceptive and the elite figure may not be the true measure to determine how well a film is made or received by the audience . <p> Three of Aamir 's films -- 3 Idiots , Ghajini and Fanaa -- have reportedly earned over Rs350 crore , Rs150 crore , and Rs100 crore respectively , scaling the touchstone of success . Yet he does not believe in the number game . <p> " A large number of people might see the film because a star is there . Numbers can be deceptive . To me success means when we as a creative team sit together to watch a film before it releases ... ( do we ) feel that we have succeeded in making what we set out to do .

If another film has done half the business and you ask people how they like it .. if eight to nine out of ten like it .. then , " he said . <p> The 47-year-old actor-producer feels filmmaking is a team effort and the credit for the success of a film should not entirely be given to actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team effort ... its tough . The director and writer play important parts but along with that there is the cameraman , the sound engineer , the song composer , lyric writer , actors ... so when a film does well , it is the result of this team doing good work .

I am happy that the right kinds of projects have come my way .

I want the suspense to be there , that 's part of the promotions . Sometimes being quiet also might promote it , " he said . <p> " Mere information is not promotion . I can create a desire by not being there too . The bottom line is to create a desire , " he added . <p> Directed by Reema Kagti , Talaash revolves around three characters - Aamir who plays a cop , Rani Mukherjee playing Aamir 's wife and Kareena Kapoor . <p> " Talaash is essentially a suspense drama .. there is no social message but there is an important aspect to the story .

##860050 <p> On Friday , Joanna Kirsten will turn one . Graeme Smith will be among the first to wish her happy birthday . The rest of the South African team will not be far behind . They may actually remember Joanna 's birthday for many years to come because she was born the night before they bowled Australia out for 47 at Newlands . <p> Gary Kirsten had only appeared at the ground briefly that morning to issue some early instructions to the bowlers , who had Australia on 214 for 8 . He left to be with his wife , Deborah , and their new-born daughter and only returned later in the afternoon with South Africa having lost one wicket in their second innings . <p> " Have we had rain around ? " he asked around in the change-room , thinking that play had been interrupted , hence the slow rate of scoring . " No coach , we 're into the second dig , " one of the players told him before they recounted the story of how only Smith and Jacques Rudolph had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a remarkable session , Australia were skittled for 47 after teetering on 21 for 9 at one stage . <p> " It was an interesting day 's cricket , " Smith remembered . A day so interesting it is unlikely to happen ever again . But it was with that day and two on either side that Kirsten 's tenure as South Africa 's coach began . A year later , he has been in charge for 11 Tests of which South Africa have won six , lost two and drawn three . It 's an impressive run , good enough to get the team to No.1 in the world . <p> Still , Kirsten 's tenure alone does not tell the full story of South Africa 's ascendency , nor does it illustrate the actual length of time it took for them to get to the top . Their six-year unbeaten streak away from home is the envy of the cricketing world . That , combined with the level of experience it has given them , has been the real secret to their success . <p> The record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other for weeks on end and the ability to adapt to varying conditions .

When he was first appointed , about 30 players - some established , some on the fringes - were invited to the Arabella Golf Estate for a three-day planning session . Before the series in England , the squad spent four days in Switzerland with adventurer Mike Horn , learning how to work for each other in circumstances Alviro Petersen said were sometimes " life or death .

" He allows the players do their own thing , " JP Duminy said . In other words , Kirsten has entrusted decision-making to the players themselves . It is up to them whether they decide to train and for how long , whether they want to put more effort into the fitness work or not or whether they want to have a night out or a quiet one before match day . Responsibility and accountability lies with them alone . <p> There have been a few teams that have touched No.1 recently and we know that is a big challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but we have also got to earn it . Graeme Smith <p> Had Kirsten been put in charge of a more junior team , this method may not have worked . Even with the ODI and T20 squad , it has its failings most evident in their inability to make the floating batting line-up work . In the Test squad , though , it has been immensely successful primarily because of its settled nature . <p> Of the current squad , five players have earned more than 50 Test caps and two others - Jacques Rudolph ( 46 ) and Morne Morkel ( 42 ) - are not far behind . Compare that with Australia 's three players who have recorded a half-century of baggy greens and the experience gap is obvious . With that experience comes knowledge and Kirsten is content that his players have the know-how to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects their years in the game . <p> From there , the rest has just flowed . Adjusting to conditions is easier when you have players in the squad who have been to those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa always travel with someone who has trodden the beaten path ahead of them and draw from that person . <p> It is a combination of those factors that South Africa think can give them a slightly longer time at the top than the most recent occupants , India and England . India 's struggles away from home improved only slightly ( in places like New Zealand and West Indies ) when they were at the top and England followed up their placing at top of the pile with a poor showing against Pakistan . South Africa are confident they will not be affected in the same way because of their away record . That also includes a series win in Australia in 2008-09 after four defeats on previous tours post readmission and South Africa see no reason that they can not repeat it . <p> " We got taught some good lessons from our previous tours and it was good to bounce back from that , " Smith said . " To come to Australia with a formidable side and know you can compete over here - that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> They also believe they have the personnel - a varied attack , a long batting line-up and the right mix of youth and experience - to avoid being found short on any count as other teams have been . " We would love the opportunity to create a legacy , " Smith said . " But you got to take steps one at a time . There have been a few teams that have touched No.1 recently and we know that is a big challenge . We believe we 've got the capabilities to do it but we have also got to earn it . " <p> Joanna 's birthday will be remembered as one of the most unusual days in cricketing history for what happened in 2011 . Depending on whether South Africa can stand up when the wind blows , as Smith has said , it could also be remembered as the day they began a successful title defence . If she is anything like her father , Joanna would probably prefer the latter . <p> The man 's abilities .

##860152 of the second test against South Africa ( 01:30 ) Nov 21 , 2012 <p> Press Conference : New Zealand captain Ross Taylor talks about coping with spin bowling and believes his team is capable of staging a comeback in the second Test against Sri Lanka 
##860250 <p> For all he might have done wrong over the last 18 months , MS Dhoni ca n't be faulted for his calls for pitches that will make for more exciting Test cricket , pitches with bounce and turn as opposed to ones with no bounce and slow turn . The Sardar Patel Stadium pitch definitely fell in the latter category , and that is why Dhoni " does n't even want to look at it " . And it 's good to see that Dhoni 's pleas are n't being affected by results . <p> India might have won the Ahmedabad Test - and to outsiders it might look like the perfect pitch , negating the England fast bowlers and offering some help to the Indian spinners - but it was just the kind of track India have had a problem with . A better batting line-up or better application from this line-up or a different outcome at the toss would have ensured a drab draw . For a while it seemed that India were uncertain about their own batting and had opted for safety in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts . <p> Ever since he made that call , Dhoni is being criticised for openly asking groundsmen to " doctor the pitches " . Among others , Steve Waugh , former Australia captain , told PTI : " Dhoni 's comments this morning were really negative to the game , when he asked Indian curators to doctor the pitches , which I ca n't understand . <p> " You want to be aggressive and be the best in the world , you have got to take all the conditions and not always ask for the conditions that suits your style of play . I was a bit surprised with that . I think if you are looking to be the best in the world you have got to learn to play in all conditions . " <p> While Waugh is right in repeating that India need to play well in all conditions , he will also know it is not done through pitches in home Tests . Australia did n't prepare for their India tours through rank turners at Gabba . The other thing that is often forgotten is Dhoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't play ball . At times , even Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble have struggled to get groundsmen to give them home advantage . <p> Dhoni is not " always " asking for these conditions ; he is almost pleading , " For once , let me have them . " Nor is he the first captain to have asked for certain conditions in a home Test ; it 's just that he is doing so openly because covert conversations have n't had any effect . <p> Dhoni 's first Test as captain was in Kanpur in 2008 , a square turner that produced an exciting Test that ended in three days . Dhoni was standing in for the injured Anil Kumble then . Later that year , Kumble retired , and Dhoni took over full time . It 's been four years since , and Dhoni has yet to captain India on a proper turner . <p> Consequently , even during their best times , India could n't whitewash Sri Lanka , New Zealand and West Indies in series longer than two Tests , forget stronger teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in India that would test the batsmen to the fullest , and that is a variety the game needs just as much as it does the green and overcast Headingley or Kingsmead 's Green Mamba or WACA 's trampoline bounce . <p> Dhoni and his spinners ' main grouse with pitches in India has for long been the lack of bounce more than the turn , but all India has seen over the last four years is low and slow pitches . Contrary to the belief that Dhoni is asking for the easy way out , pitches with turn and bounce will only even the playing field . If it will make life a little easier for the Indian bowlers , England 's fast bowlers will also prefer the bounce , Graeme Swann will become more effective , and also England 's batsmen will find value for their shots . <p> To blame the groundsmen alone ca n't be the solution , though . The ICC does n't like the ball turning from day one . It wants to standardise all pitches . In Galle last year , Michael Hussey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Australia posted one of their most-cherished wins , only because the conditions were so difficult . The ICC , though , put the groundsman on notice . It is perfectly understandable for the Indian groundsmen to not risk the Jayananda Warnaweera fate . <p> Dhoni , though , in his own way , tried to emphasise the ICC should n't have a problem with turn on the first day because it does n't have a problem with seam on the first morning . Change that claim with seam on the third or fourth day , and Dhoni is on to something . Except that , if the groundsmen do oblige Dhoni the captain in the upcoming Tests , Dhoni the keeper will have to raise his game drastically : his missed stumpings , especially that of Nick Compton when he was n't even expecting the ball to come to him , did n't make for good viewing . That , though , is a story for another day . <p> Nothing is wrong in asking for a pitch that turns and bounces . As waugh said to be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . Then what is the problem for england to play under spinning conditions . Recently they were the No 1 test playing nation . May be waugh said that because the only territory he did not conquer as a captain is India . Also when he was captain he had gread bowlers like Mcgrath , shane warne . They can bowl in any surface and take wickets . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 15:15 PM GMT ) <p> ICC went beyond the boundary , viz a viz the Sri Lankan pitch episode , where it was just assisting turn and was not dangerous to batsmen with skills to handle spin . ICC unwittingly ( or , perhaps willingly ) went overboard pandering to those teams who ca n't handle spin well . However they were right , regarding Kotla , where the bounce was uneven with unpredictable bounce and dangerous ! And , Dhoni , clearly said , he does n't want such dangerous pitches . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 15:04 PM GMT ) <p> @Varkay . Swann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his supreme skills ; and nothing to do with the low &; slow pitch at Motera . It was not BECAUSE of the pitch ; it is DESPITE the pitch . Give the devil , his due ! I mean , Swann . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 15:01 PM GMT ) <p> @Naresh28 . How tall is Sunil Gavaskar , when he performed exceedingly well in overseas tours , to such an extent , he is almost an adopted son of West Indies ? How tall is Sachin Tendulkar ? How tall was Don Bradman ? So , there goes your Tall Vs Short theory ! <p> Posted by itsthewayuplay on ( November 21 2012 , 14:58 PM GMT ) <p> @ AsitDe I wonder if you saw any of the series of India in England . There is no way those pitches could be descibed as hostile . The fact is the Indian bowlers could not adapt to the conditions . What did n't help was Zaheer getting injured because he bowled well in his opening spell with enough movement to ask questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect of recalling RP Singh from a Miami beach . Praveen was the only bowler who came out with any credit bowling with plenty of heart and movement but lacked pace to consistently trouble the batsmen . Mishra got some big turn but overall his batting was better than his bowling and the less said about Ishant the better . How do you expalin that SA played this year and were able to bowl England out twice in 2 of the matches . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 14:57 PM GMT ) <p> What was wrong with Dhoni , was his performance ; both behind the stumps and in front . Not , in what he said . Hang a man for his crime and NOT for telling a few truths ! <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 14:55 PM GMT ) <p> Some time Captains hesitate to enforce the follow-on , since the bowlers have to take " more than 10 wickets " -- in fact 20 wickets ! If circumstances force you to enforce it , to improve the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key bowlers have to bowl 70-80 overs , it is hard work on ANY surface . If a Captain mentions that , it is just a statement of fact , and an indirect way of appreciating the efforts of his bowlers in public . What is wrong in that ? Where is the criticism of the umpires in that ( Of course , umpires make it more than 20 -- around 25 or so , in my count ) . Again , if he asks for pitches , where toss will not be a decisive factor , and giving equal chance to both teams , what is wrong in that ? Most of the Indian pitches , which play low &; slow , give an unfair advantage to batsmen . So , asking for one where both batsmen &; bowlers can display &; exploit their skills , what is wrong in that ? In the whole process , if viewers enjoy test cricket better , what is wrong in that ? <p> Posted by Nampally on ( November 21 2012 , 14:48 PM GMT ) <p> @Nicholas Saunders : Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 20 Wkts . at the Oval Test match vs . Aussies . Also Vinoo Mankad of India took 5 for 192 in 96 overs at the Lords test match in 1952 . So England wickets do offer help to good spinners.Similarly good fast bowlers also revelled on some pitches in India dating back to Fazal Mahmood of Pakistan - who was also outstanding on the Lords wkt .. I do n't think anyone is moaning here . The fact of the matter is no Curator can prepare a pitch made to order . Dhoni 's is wishful thinking ! . He hopes Father Christmas will come with goodies for him.Every bowler has to work hard for his wkts . on the Indian pitches which are all batting friendly.It is the England batsmen who failed badly , to give India the victory . Cook &; Prior showed it is possible to score . <p> Posted by Nampally on ( November 21 2012 , 14:36 PM GMT ) <p> You say ICC does n't like the ball lturning from Day 1 &; that they want to standardise all pitches ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is " NO " . I challenge ICC to name a curator or give a recipe for producing the type of pitch they want ! . Even if Dhoni wants the ball to turn from Day1 of the 5 day test match + have a bit of bounce , can the Curator meet his recipe ? So all this talk from both Waugh &; Dhoni is just gamesmanship . Dhoni struggled behind the wkt . &; missed several chances including the one of Compton yard down the wkt . He must also make better use of all his bowlers.This was a test match with several deficiencies . Umpiring was very poor to start with , especially of Aleem Dar ! England batting can only improve from here . So India need to be prepared . Ashwin never met the expectations let alone his non existant mystery ball ! Ojha , ZAK &; Yadev bowled well.SRT &; MSD both need to step up to justify their spots.A right arm leg spinner will boost the Indian bowling . <p> Posted by enigma77543 on ( November 21 2012 , 14:32 PM GMT ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find seaming &/or; bouncy wickets , usually they do n't moan about it , they just accept the fact that they are not very good on seaming &/or; bouncy conditions &; that they need to improve , they do n't call them " poor pitches " simply because they ca n't play very well on them ! On the other hand , when teams that travel to sub-continent always whine about " poor pitches " even if the ball turns a little bit rather than manning up &; accepting that they are n't very good in these conditions &; that they need to improve their skills . And Ahmedabad pitch did n't even turn much , it was pretty flat &; a better team with better batting &; bowling skills would have easily drawn the Test . In sub-continent , there are two choices in the main , turning pitches or flat ones , &; making flat ones &; producing dull-draws definitely wo n't help the falling popularity of Tests around the world 
##860251 <p> Andy Flower has admitted that England made a mistake in not selecting Monty Panesar for the first Test of the series against India at Ahmedabad . England lost the Test by nine wickets after conceding a first innings deficit of 330 with Flower , the England team director , also conceding that he misread the pitch . <p> But Flower declined to confirm that England would alter the balance of their attack for the second Test , which begins in Mumbai on Friday . While he conceded that England 's seamers had been out-performed by their Indian counterparts in Ahmedabad , he said the England team management will inspect the pitch before any selection decision is made . As things stand , Flower expects Mumbai to offer more assistance to the seamers and would only confirm that England would bring in a batsman to replace Ian Bell , who is absent on paternity leave . <p> " With hindsight yes , it was a mistake not to play Panesar in Ahmedabad , " Flower said . " I did n't expect that pitch to turn as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turning early in the game I thought it might deteriorate more and I was surprised on day four and five how well it played . I certainly misjudged that pitch . <p> " There might be a little more bounce in Mumbai which will help our seamers . Of course we have to bring in a batsman , but on any other changes I 'd like to see the pitch first . Then I 'll try to make a better judgment than the last one . If it looks as though it will turn a lot , we will contemplate two spinners . <p> " I do n't think our seamers bowled as well as they could have and the skill with reverse swing and finding the right length to hit the pads is a particular skill . I think India did that better than we did . Their seamers out-bowled our seamers , but I also think we gave them a couple of soft dismissals . " <p> England 's attempts to square the series in Mumbai have been dealt a severe blow with the news that Steven Finn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , Finn undergoes a scan on Tuesday that will define whether he had any further part to play on the tour . Stuart Meaker , who was called into the squad when Finn was injured in the first warm-up game , will remain with them rather than joining the England Performance Programme squad . <p> " This will not go down as one of his memorable Tests but he 's got three more to contribute to winning games for England . " Andy Flower sanguine about Kevin Pietersen 's form <p> " Finn unfortunately hurt that same area of his thigh and he 's having a scan , " Flower said . " We do n't think there 's any structural damage , we need to check . If there is not he will go and join our performance programme . He 'll rehab with them and they 've got a three-day game starting on the 27th which is the last day of this Test . Hopefully we can get him in that and test him out and if he comes through well he 'll be available for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of predictability about England 's troubles in India but , despite the side now having lost five out of six Tests in Asian conditions this year , said " he would like to think " there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the team or the team set-up . Instead he felt that the batsmen , in particular , were guilty of simple errors . He did not condemn India 's decision to deny them quality spin bowling in the warm-up matches , though he did jokingly suggest that England would be unlikely to respond by providing only spin bowlers for India in their warm-up games on their next tour of England . <p> " We have to overturn what seems predictable the moment , " he said . " There are some very basic things that we have n't done well enough and I hope I 'm not making personal excuses here . I do n't think it 's anything to do with the environment , or team dynamics , or the way we train . I think that we have failed in a number of first innings and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the area where we have failed and I do n't think we should over-complicate it . I hope there is no real reason why it should keep happening in the first innings . <p> " If we 'd batted in the first innings like we batted in the second it might have been a different story . Those three wickets hurt us at the end of day two , obviously , and the ball turned quite sharply and quite quickly in that first innings . And there were a few soft dismissals which cost us . " <p> Flower was keen to defend Kevin Pietersen , who , in his first Test since his recall , scored 19 runs in two innings and was twice dismissed by the left-arm spin of Pragyan Ojha , but Flower stressed the excellence of his long-term record . <p> " Look , Kevin 's a very fine cricketer and he has 21 Test centuries , " Flower said . " This will not go down as one of his memorable Tests , of course , but he 's got three more Tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this last Test the left-arm spinner got him out twice and he obviously struggled against him . But , only a few Tests ago against Sri Lanka , he scored a magnificent 150 and they had a reasonable left-arm spinner playing in subcontinent conditions . The method he used there was a very successful one . I 'm not just talking about his very attacking method but his defensive one too . He 's a very experienced cricketer and I trust he 'll bring that experience to bear in the next Test match . " <p> 1 . while cook and prior showed great courage , so did IND bowlers to get wickets on a slow low , do nothing pitch .... so ind were in a situation where previously this would prob hve been a draw , so i think they showed immense mettle too ... <p> 2. time for dhoni to get out of tests , i agree <p> 3 . ENG not giving excuses ? , you need to try to understand how the excuse is given , its not outright like in india , its just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 21 2012 , 14:25 PM GMT ) <p> @stormy16 I agree with you and see through Andy Flower 's hogwash about misreading the pitch . Panesar should have played in the first Test and must play in the second . He is a fine spin bowler , and all this talk of how England are balanced only when Number 11 can also score runs is just clouding the issue . Many of the greatest bowlers in the world were poor batsmen , some poorer than Panesar . Just think of Courtney Walsh , Lance Gibbs and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar . <p> Posted by CricketingStargazer on ( November 21 2012 , 13:26 PM GMT ) <p> Well , the Mumbai pitch is one that was used recently and is worn . It must raise the prospect of England playing Monty , Swann and Samit . So , if England pick only 2 seamers , who are they going to be ? ? ? <p> Posted by CricketingStargazer on ( November 21 2012 , 13:11 PM GMT ) <p> @Paul Rone-Clarke , totally agree . Broad was clearly not match fit . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 2009 , 47 wickets @ 28.4 , 431 runs @ 25.4 ; 2010 , 26 wicket @ 37.7 , 292 runs @ 24.3 ( incl. 169 v Pak ) ; 33 wickets @ 22.3 , 239 runs @ 39.8 ; 2012 , 40 wickets @ 30.2 , 271 runs @ 18.1 . On the bowling side he has varied between mediocre and very good . This year has tended too much to mediocre , sulking when things go against him . At his best he is quick , gets bounce and is uncomplicated . He needs to run in hard at the Indian batsmen and push the ball through on a good length , using the bouncer as an occasional variation . <p> Posted by landl47 on ( November 21 2012 , 12:59 PM GMT ) <p> When nos. 3-6 make 68 runs between them in 8 completed knocks , you 're going to lose almost every test you play . Cook and Prior were the top scorers in both innings and their excellent stand in the second innings masked the inadequacy of the other batsmen . I only saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often simply misreading ordinary balls . I 'm not sure why Flower is giving KP a pass- that second innings dismissal was appalling . <p> Posted by jimmy2s on ( November 21 2012 , 12:58 PM GMT ) <p> Oddly similar to the Pakistan series in the UAE where they played one spinner in first test and included Monty in the second 2 . A case of not learning from mistakes ? Monty out-bowled Swann comprehensively in the 2 tests that he played in that series . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 12:43 PM GMT ) <p> If I was paying someone 100s of thousands per annum , I would expect them to be able to do the job . If they were n't performing consistently well , but I believed they had potential and talent , I would provide training and give them some time to gain experience . If they still did n't produce the goods , then I would be mad not to replace them . This is a reality faced by employers and employees all over the world . Time to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trott , Bell and Peitersen . There 's nothing to lose ! ! And if the supposed quicks ca n't adapt to bowl full and fast to a field to match , then time to replace some of them too . Sick and tired of watching highly paid professionals do unintelligent things on and off the field . By the way England , dark glasses do n't help you take catches ( you would bat in them if they improved vision ) and ionic bracelets do n't make you anything except a fashion victim wally . <p> Posted by BostonLegal on ( November 21 2012 , 12:40 PM GMT ) <p> Andy is honest enough to admit his mistake . But at the same time he was foolish enough to have made it in the fist place , and stubborn enough to suggest that Monty is not an automatic selection for Bombay test . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 21 2012 , 12:31 PM GMT ) <p> There were THREE areas , where England was far superior to India in the Ahmedabad test : <p> 1 . Fighting spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook , Prior &; Compton ( After VVS 's retirement , I wonder whether we will see that coming from India in the near future . One Pujara alone can NOT do it ) <p> 2 . The WK-Batsman . Performance of Prior , both before the wicket and behind the wicket ( Behind the wicket he also committed a few errors ; but far less &; less significant errors than Dhoni 's ) <p> 3 . England 's attitude of NOT giving any excuses for their poor show .. <p> Posted by Cricketfan08 on ( November 21 2012 , 12:26 PM GMT ) <p> As a Pakistan supporter , I was surprised when I saw the selection on the morning of the first test . England found them in the same situation after losing a test match vs Pakistan in UAE earlier this year and had to bring in Monty for the remaining tests . They still lost the series ( whitewash ) but the impact Monty had was huge and resulted in close contests . Such 
##860351 <p> The first time I faced Zaheer Khan was in a Duleep Trophy match against West Zone in Mohali . It was overcast , the track had a lot of juice in it and Zaheer was wrecking havoc with his pace . His stock ball , which was also his only wicket-taking delivery , went away from the right-hand batsmen . He would pepper the batsmen with some well-directed bouncers at a decent pace ( resulting in hitting a few of us on the head ) to push them on the back-foot , and then suck the batsmen into fishing the balls meant to be left alone . Yet , there was a catch -- he just could n't get the ball to shape into the right-hand batsman . Beyond a point we got used to the pace , the bounce and the angle . So much so , that I started leaving the balls pitching on the middle and off stump trusting the angle to take the ball away from the stumps . In any case , even if I misjudged , the chances of the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal , thanks to the angle and the predictable away swing . <p> Subsequently , Zaheer had a dip in form , got dropped from the Indian team and went to England to play a season of county cricket . And to every Indian 's delight , he came back a different bowler . He was no longer one-dimensional , for he had learnt the art of bringing the ball back into the right-hander too . He also sacrificed a bit of pace for accuracy and went on to prove that speed , at times , is an extremely overrated virtue . If you can pitch the ball in the right areas , ask the right questions consistently , you really do n't need the extra yard of pace to trouble the batsman . Not that pace does n't come handy , but you can also do without it . <p> This new-and-improved version of Zaheer is a far more difficult bowler to play than the older one . The next time I faced him in a match was an Irani Cup tie against the Rest of India on a win-the-toss-bat-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of grass or moisture to assist lateral movement off the pitch . But Zaheer did n't need these allies anymore to be effective . He started slowly , as he often does in the sub-continent , but with the precision of a mathematician . He bowled only two lengths initially , a full ball ( openers are n't used to playing full deliveries right at the beginning ) and the short ball delivered with cross seam ( in order to get one side of the ball rough as soon as possible ) . And once he managed to get one side of the ball nice and shiny , he changed once again , for good . He started hiding the shine of the ball on his run-up in such a way that it was n't visible to the batsman till the very last moment . He reminded me of Wasim Akram , albeit Akram had the advantage of a quick arm action , which Zaheer did n't . Zak made up for it by keeping both his hands together till the very last moment and then more than made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball is swinging , more than the length , the lines become crucial to a bowler 's success , for invariably the bowler has to pitch the ball up to get the most of the swing in the air . It is indeed , in my view , Zaheer 's line of attack that makes him such a dangerous operator . Regardless of the direction of swing , he would always pitch the ball in the area in which the batsman would have to make one of the two choices -- to play or to leave the ball . It is one of the most difficult decisions a batsman has to make if the ball is pitched in the right area because the wicket is on the line , which is not always the case when you choose between defending and attacking . <p> Another thing that he 's added to his Test bowling is the ability to bowl at 70% whenever required and still bowl a probing line unlike others who go for plenty the moment they drop pace or effort . Once again his control over the line comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fifth-sixth stump enticing the batsman to take a chance to go after him . His subtle variation in swing and pace would keep the batsman in check and would n't make him predictable . <p> Undoubtedly , the latest Zaheer is at par with the best Test bowlers in the world and continues to be a batsman 's nightmare . You can ask Graeme Smith of South Africa if you do n't believe me . <p> Former India opener Aakash Chopra is the author of Beyond the Blues , an account of the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy season . His website is here and his Twitter feed here <p> Zaheer is a good player but no where near Steyn 's class . For guys who say he does n't have support , he has Harbhajan who is the highest wicket taker of current players . In my view Harbhajan is of more value but needs support from Zaheer . Steyn is in a class of his own . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( January 01 2011 , 11:03 AM GMT ) <p> I believe the Indian fast bowlers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BCCI stopped him God knows why even when they have the glaring example of Zaheer Khan in front of their eyes.He came back a different bowler and he is the best in the world at the moment.i believe that Munaf Patel R.P.Singh Irfan Pathan Ishant Sharma and even Praveen Kumar should be sent to England to play a whole season of County Cricket and mark my words they will come back as a better player and bowler if not better than ZAK.As for Zaheer VS Steyn of course steyn is better there is no doubt about it but Zaheer is the best Left Arm Fast Bowler in the world . <p> Posted by catchamin on ( January 01 2011 , 07:18 AM GMT ) <p> He 's undoubtedly the King of Indian pace . If he had fitness on his side his wickets would have been at least a 100-150 more . For the last 3 years since his return to the Indian team , he 's been taking wickets and winning matches by the truckload for India . In India as well as abroad . Hats off to King Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Dale Steyn , I have only one thing to say . You ca n't compare them at all ! They 're in league of their own and comparing them is like deciding whether Mercedes is better than BMW or not . <p> Posted by AbhiBlr on ( January 01 2011 , 05:51 AM GMT ) <p> We see batting god in Sachin but we do nt have a bowling god . So lets make one . " Zaheer is the difference between 1st and 2nd Test . " Now , who knew how Zaheer would have bowled in the 1st test ? Why shoot Sree / Ishant for bowling badly ? " When Zak is there other bowlers get inspired . " Really ? When and where have the others whole heartedly and thankfully acknowledged that with conviction ? But still everybody would go on and snatch Sree 's credits and give them to Zaheer ! " Zaheer is the one with a plan .

##860352 <p> Playing against Bangladesh in an Asia Cup match in June last year , Pakistan 's lower middle order gave a fearful demonstration of the amount of havoc they could wreck in the last ten overs of a one-day innings . At the end of 40 overs , Pakistan had already reached an imposing total of 256 for 4 , but even so , Bangladesh would n't have been prepared for what hit them next . Shahid Afridi was already going strong , and he completely destroyed Bangladesh 's bowlers in the last ten . **27;3095;TOOLONG runs were scored in 60 balls , of which Afridi 's contribution was 73 off 24 , while Abdul Razzaq managed a mere 21 from nine . Pakistan finished with an untouchable score of 385 , and the contest was effectively over . <p> That match was just one example of how much damage can be caused in the last ten overs , and with the World Cup now less than a month away , teams have been honing up their final acts with both bat and ball , trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , especially in the subcontinent , where the short boundaries and quick outfields can make the experience especially nightmarish for bowlers . Here 's a look at the batsmen and bowlers - and the teams - that have best handled the pressures of the last ten overs in ODIs over the last couple of years . <p> Pakistan are n't among the favourites for the World Cup , but with Afridi and Razzaq in their ranks , their slog-over batting is an aspect that any bowling attack will be wary of . Not surprisingly , Afridi and Razzaq are among the most destructive batsmen in the last ten overs over the last couple of years . Afridi has an incredible strike rate of 10.38 runs per over , with 23 fours and ten sixes in 119 deliveries . The good thing , from the bowlers ' point of view , is the fact that he has been dismissed 13 times in those 119 balls , which works out to an average of about nine balls per dismissal . <p> With Razzaq , the torture for bowlers is only slightly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.18 runs to the over , and lasts 24 balls per dismissal , scoring about 37 runs in those balls . His recent form in ODIs has been quite scary : less than three months ago , he smashed South Africa 's bowling attack to the tune of 109 off 72 balls in what was a matchwinning knock . He was especially destructive in the last ten overs , scoring 75 off 36 balls . <p> Among the others in the top ten , in terms of scoring rate , is South Africa 's Albie Morkel . He has done pretty well in the last ten , but finds himself omitted from the squad for the World Cup . South Africa have two others - JP Duminy and AB de Villiers - in the top ten , while Australia have two . India do n't have any , but Suresh Raina and MS Dhoni come close , with run rates of 7.76 and 7.12 . Sri Lanka have lacked an explosive finisher for a few years now , and that is reflected in the fact that they do n't figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten overs of ODIs since Jan 2009 ( Qual : 200 runs ) <p> Batsman <p> Runs <p> Balls <p> Dismissals <p> Average <p> Strike rate <p> 4s/ 6s <p> Shahid Afridi <p> 206 <p> 119 <p> 13 <p> 15.84 <p> 10.38 <p> 23/ 10 <p> Abdul Razzaq <p> 297 <p> 194 <p> 8 <p> 37.12 <p> 9.18 <p> 26/ 16 <p> Albie Morkel <p> 251 <p> 170 <p> 8 <p> 31.37 <p> 8.85 <p> 26/ 8 <p> Elton Chigumbura <p> 441 <p> 305 <p> 14 <p> 31.50 <p> 8.67 <p> 32/ 25 <p> Eoin Morgan <p> 332 <p> 230 <p> 9 <p> 36.88 <p> 8.66 <p> 32/ 10 <p> Shakib Al Hasan <p> 218 <p> 158 <p> 9 <p> 24.22 <p> 8.27 <p> 27/ 3 <p> AB de Villiers <p> 206 <p> 150 <p> 8 <p> 25.75 <p> 8.24 <p> 26/ 3 <p> JP Duminy <p> 404 <p> 295 <p> 11 <p> 36.72 <p> 8.21 <p> 28/ 9 <p> Cameron White <p> 473 <p> 351 <p> 15 <p> 31.53 <p> 8.08 <p> 33/ 19 <p> Michael Hussey <p> 686 <p> 527 <p> 20 <p> 34.30 <p> 7.81 <p> 53/ 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , which is perhaps slightly surprising , but also a hint to captains that lack of pace might be a good option in the last ten overs , especially in the subcontinent . Ray Price and Proper Utseya have also prospered because they 've played plenty of games against lesser opposition , and while the same reason might partially explain the successes of Abdur Razzak and Shakib Al Hasan , there 's no doubt that Bangladesh 's spinners will be quite difficult to get away in home conditions during any part of the innings . <p> Harbhajan Singh does n't make the 200-ball cut , but he has an excellent economy rate of 6.16 , conceding only 183 run in 178 balls . The spinner who deserves a special mention , though , is Daniel Vettori : in the 163 balls he has bowled , Vettori has conceded conceded 130 runs and taken 12 wickets , for an average of 10.83 and an economy rate of 4.78 . <p> Among the fast bowlers , Shane Watson has done pretty well , as has Ishant Sharma , though Ishant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers below are a reflection of his performances in 2009 .

Australia have been struggling as a Test team , but in ODIs they 've put up some good numbers , and have been excellent with both bat and ball in the last ten . Michael Hussey has scored the most runs of all players in the last ten , with 686 runs at an average of 34.30 and a run-rate of 7.81 per over . James Hopes is next in terms of runs scored , with 512 from 407 balls . Watson , meanwhile has been superb with the ball in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson is the second-highest wicket-taker in the last ten with 22 , at an economy rate of 7.15 . <p> The presence of West Indies at No.3 in terms of difference between batting and bowling run-rates is more surprising , though . Some of it is because of an extremely low-scoring series against Zimbabwe in 2010 , when the visitors struggled to put runs on the board . However , West Indies have had their moments in the final overs in ODIs , twice adding 98 in the last ten - against Bangladesh in 2009 and against South Africa in 2010 , both in Rosseau . However , on both occasions , they did n't play such smart cricket through the rest of the match and ended up losing the games . <p> On the other hand , Bangladesh have struggled in the last ten , conceding one run per over more than they score . The two highest totals in the last ten overs since the beginning of 2009 have both come against them - Pakistan scored 129 in that Asia Cup game mentioned in the beginning of this piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 . <p> Teams with bat and ball in last ten overs of ODIs since Jan 2009 <p> Team <p> Bat ave <p> Run rate <p> Bowl ave <p> Econ rate <p> Diff in ave <p> Diff in run rate <p> Australia <p> 24.53 <p> 7.44 <p> 17.90 <p> 6.96 <p> 6.63 <p> 0.48 <p> South Africa <p> 25.15 <p> 7.93 <p> 19.21 <p> 7.47 <p> 5.94 <p> 0.46 <p> West Indies <p> 18.42 <p> 7.64 <p> 21.94 <p> 7.21 <p> -3.52 <p> 0.43 <p> New Zealand <p> 21.36 <p> 7.14 <p> 19.42 <p> 6.83 <p> 1.94 <p> 0.31 <p> Zimbabwe <p> 23.07 <p> 7.34 <p> 22.21 <p> 7.15 <p> 0.86 <p> 0.19 <p> Pakistan <p> 18.35 <p> 7.06 <p> 24.53 <p> 6.96 <p> -6.18 <p> 0.10 <p> Sri Lanka <p> 21.14 <p> 7.04 <p> 25.40 <p> 6.96 <p> -4.26 <p> 0.08 <p> England <p> 17.97 <p> 7.17 <p> 20.31 <p> 7.16 <p> -2.34 <p> 0.01 <p> India <p> 26.72 <p> 7.26 <p> 21.87 <p> 7.60 <p> 4.85 <p> -0.34 <p> Bangladesh <p> 17.34 <p> 6.26 <p> 23.40 <p> 7.26 <p> -6.06 <p> -1.00 <p> And the next table presents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innings of ODIs . The numbers in second innings are often skewed by the targets that teams are chasing - a team might not push the accelerator in the last ten when they know that the target is well within reach . Hence , first-innings numbers sometimes offer a better indication of a team 's batting and bowling abilities in the last ten . <p> There 's a bit of a shake-up here , with England moving much higher , to No.3 , while Australia slip to fifth place . India , though , remain near the bottom , which suggests it 's an area the team will have to look at when they plan for the World Cup . <p> Teams with bat and ball in last ten overs in 1st innings of ODIs since Jan 2009 <p> @CricketpunditUSA " Whenever any team plays against Pak , pak team starts playing for the opponent " what does that mean it makes no sense ! and then your going on about no balls ? these stats are about finishers . face it india have none pakistan are miles ahead of india @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mans afridi <p> Posted by CricketpunditUSA on ( January 22 2011 , 23:26 PM GMT ) <p> To Kiwirocker : Sorry mate !

Do nt forget Yuvraj &; Yusuf . In this world cup they will show how destructive they . They are not in list because they have not played games in last ten overs . The reason is India was missing there regular batmen in last two years . <p> Posted by gujratwalla on ( January 22 2011 , 19:12 PM GMT ) <p> Stastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 's moral and the players working as a team.Afridi and Razzaq are very destructive players but only when everything click for them ; Afridi has countless times thrown away his wicket when well set and on recent form he is on the wane.The South Africans de Villiers and Smith can be just as effective while India have Sehwag , Yuraj and Pathan.Similarly White from Australia and Pietersen from England have just got to have their eye in and all hell can happen ! Among the bowlers Umar Gul , Steyn , Zahir are probably the best at the moment though the Kiwis could spring a suprise with their tandem of pace bowlers . <p> Posted by Bilzkhan on ( January 22 2011 , 11:33 AM GMT ) <p> I hope , this year the statistics wil be more interesting , Yusuf Pathan , Umar Akmal , Kiron Pollard , K.White and M.Hussey will be the new cheeta for the last 10-overs .

Do not consider it a good thing for India mate ! Remember what happened to IPL 's founder ? LOL This is great analysis Rajesh . Numbers are always the most objective measure . Reality is that Indians have lulled themselves into a false dream . This Indian team is full of imposters . India has very average bowling line up and zero all rounders . Pakistani and SL batsmen will be licking their lips to see Harbhajan bowling . Harbhajan averages 65 with bowl against Pakistan in ODI 's . Last 10 overs and extremely crucial and this is where matches are won or lost as a batting/bowling team . You can go slow in first ten overs but last 10 overs are always the real test . An example was Pakistan 's win in 1992 that was built on using last 10 overs.India lacks match winners and their biggest weakness is their fiedling.I suspect many Indian imposter 's career will end when India 's compaign will end sooner than expected like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( January 22 2011 , 10:29 AM GMT ) <p> Vivek Sinha makes a telling point .

##860951 <p> ' Well , you see , when somebody drives a convertible with the top down and it starts raining , he finds out what the purpose of the top on there is . Ashram premies are people , who want shelter - who want Divine Shelter . ( Maharaji - January 22 , 1975 ) <p> There are a lot of premies who are very confused about the ashram situation . Really , I tell you , that 's where your mind comes in . Listen . You have to first understand the definition of an ashram ( read the Ashram Code , as written by Maharaji ) . Understand the definition of an ashram , and if it applies to you , go ahead , go and move in ; if it does n't apply to you , get out of there - what are you - doing there ? You know ? <p> And the definition of an ashram is that it is a place for a person who really wants to understand this Knowledge . It is for that premie who wants to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost that realisation , who wants - in other words - shelter from this world into something which is more applicable to him . <p> It 's like , the sun is beautiful , and the desert is beautiful , but only when you are looking at it from your air-conditioned room 's window . When you get out there it is not so beautiful , because it gets too hot . And it 's like , at that point you need a shade , you need something that 's applicable to you . <p> You will reap what you have sown , everybody knows that . If you sow mangoes , you wo n't reap berries . You will reap mangoes . If you build an ashram , many people will come and take knowledge and they will bless your soul . It will be a wonderful thing ! ( Maharaji - September 17 , 1974 ) <p> Q : For whom do you recommend ashram life ? <p> Ans : For whom ? Everybody , of course . For human beings , not chimpanzees . But first they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole life . <p> Q : I get confused about which service I should be doing as a devotee . <p> Ans : Common sense is uncommon . Now , just what do you think is appropriate for you to do ? Now , if you want to drive a plane , and you do n't know how to drive a plane , then that wo n't be useful service for you . You must know what to do . If you know how to work as a housemother in an ashram , then work as a housemother . If you do n't want to stay in an ashram , then do Satsang . Right ? Common sense is uncommon . Yes ? <p> Q : Guru Maharaj Ji , I had a lot of doubts and a lot of people I know still have the same doubts about the strictness of the ashram . I would like to know what to say to them about why this has to be . They feel you 're on a control trip ? <p> Ans : Now you see , God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you see with your mouth or with your nose ? Why only with eyes ? You talk about it being a control trip , then why do you only see with your eyes and not with your mouth ? Why ? Because that 's the way things are , and that 's the way things are going to be . Understand ? <p> A man who sees through his mouth , you are not going to call him a man . You are going to call him a monster ! A man must see through his eyes , that 's the way it must be . <p> ASHRAM has to be ashram , and an ashram is not a motel . An ashram is an ashram and an ashram has got something of a soul in it . You do n't go into a church and just start sleeping there and drinking your coffee there . You do n't do that , do you ? A church is a church , a temple is a temple . You are strict about doing certain things there . Understand ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation , read something , you understand something , and you become more spiritual , right ? <p> Why should there be so much strictness ? Because , we are the children of God and this is the house of God , that 's why there should be so much strictness . That 's the way it has to be , that 's why . <p> Q : What is confusing , though , is that some of the ashram people say , ' the whole world should be like the ashram . ' <p> Ans : If the whole world can be like that , it will be fantastic ! There is so much desperation around the world . I read advertisements encouraging people to smoke . And there is an ashram regulation saying , " Do not smoke " , so if that happens all the way round the world , it will be fantastic . No drugs nothing like that . Everyone neat and clean and active .

##866750 <p> " If we simply surrender unto Krsna 's lotus feet and take this Krsna consciousness movement seriously , we can be freed from the karma incurred by sin . If we are intelligent enough , we shall engage in the loving service of the Lord . Then our lives will be successful , and we shall not have to suffer like the hunter life after life . By killing animals , not only will we be bereft of the human form but we will have to take an animal form and somehow or other be killed by the same type of animal we have killed . This is the law of nature . The Sanskrit word mamsa means " meat . " It is said : mam sah khadati iti mamsah . That is , " I am now eating the flesh of an animal who will some day in the future be eating my flesh . " <p> Caitanya-caritamrta , Madyam lila 24:252 <p> " As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned , the performer is without knowledge , and therefore all his activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on toward animal life . Animal life is always miserable , although , under the spell of the illusory energy , maya , the animals do not understand this . Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance . The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them . That is the law of nature . In human society , if one kills a man he has to be hanged . That is the law of the state . Because of ignorance , people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord . Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord , and He does not tolerate even an ant 's being killed . One has to pay for it . So , indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance . A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things . If one indulges in meat-eating anyway , it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his future very dark . Of all kinds of animal killing , the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk . Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance . In the Vedic literature ( Rg Veda 9.4.64 ) the words gobhih prinita-matsaram indicate that one who , being fully satisfied by milk , is desirous of killing the cow is , in the grossest ignorance . There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states : <p> " My Lord , You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas , and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world . " ( Visnu Purana 1.19.65 ) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brahmanas . Brahmanas are the symbol of spiritual education , and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food ; these two living creatures , the brahmanas and the cows , must be given all protection--that is real advancement of civilization . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow killing is encouraged . It is to be understood , then , that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation . A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization . The present human civilization is , of course , grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance . It is a very dangerous age , and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process , Krsna consciousness , to save humanity from the greatest danger . " <p> Bhagavad-gita 14:16 <p> " Another significant phrase in this verse is natihimsrena ( " with minimum violence or sacrifice of life " ) . Even if a devotee has to commit violence , it should not be done beyond what is necessary . Sometimes the question is put before us : " You ask us not to eat meat , but you are eating vegetables . Do you think that is not violence ? " The answer is that eating vegetables is violence , and vegetarians are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Nondevotees are killing cows , goats and so many other animals for eating purposes , and a devotee , who is vegetarian , is also killing . But here , significantly , it is stated that every living entity has to live by killing another entity ; that is the law of nature . Jivo jivasya jivanam : one living entity is the life for another living entity . But for a human being , that violence should be committed only as much as necessary . <p> A human being is not to eat anything which is not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead . Yajna-sistasinah santah : one becomes freed from all sinful reactions by eating foodstuffs which are offered to Yajna , the Supreme Personality of Godhead . A devotee therefore eats only prasada , or foodstuffs offered to the Supreme Lord , and Krsna says that when a devotee offers Him foodstuffs from the vegetable kingdom , with devotion , He eats that . A devotee is to offer to Krsna foodstuffs prepared from vegetables . If the Supreme Lord wanted foodstuffs prepared from animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not order to do that . <p> We have to commit violence ; that is a natural law . We should not , however , commit violence extravagantly , but only as much as ordered by the Lord . Arjuna engaged in the art of killing , and although killing is , of course , violence , he killed the enemy simply on Krsna 's order . In the same way , if we commit violence as it is necessary , by the order of the Lord , that is called natihimsa . We can not avoid violence , for we are put into a conditional life in which we have to commit violence , but we should not commit more violence than necessary or than ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead . " <p> Srimad-Bhagavatam 3:29:15 Purport <p> " Lord Buddha , a powerful incarnation of the Personality of Godhead , appeared in the province of Gaya ( Bihar ) as the son of Anjana , and he preached his own conception of nonviolence and deprecated even the animal sacrifices sanctioned in the Vedas . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atheistic and preferred animal flesh to anything else . On the plea of Vedic sacrifice , every place was practically turned into a slaughterhouse , and animal-killing was indulged in unrestrictedly . Lord Buddha preached nonviolence , taking pity on the poor animals . He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the Vedas and stressed the adverse psychological effects incurred by animal-killing . Less intelligent men of the age of Kali , who had no faith in God , followed his principle , and for the time being they were trained in moral discipline and nonviolence , the preliminary steps for proceeding further on the path of God realization . He deluded the atheists because such atheists who followed his principles did not believe in God , but they kept their absolute faith in Lord Buddha , who himself was the incarnation of God . Thus the faithless people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord Buddha . That was the mercy of Lord Buddha : he made the faithless faithful to him . <p> Killing of animals before the advent of Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People claimed that these were Vedic sacrifices . When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession , the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge . In the Bhagavad-gita a comment has been made on such foolish scholars ( avipascitah ) . The foolish scholars of Vedic literature who do not care to receive the transcendental message through the transcendental realized sources of disciplic succession are sure to be bewildered . To them , the ritualistic ceremonies are considered to be all in all . They have no depth of knowledge . According to the Bhagavad-gita ( 15.15 ) , vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah : the whole system of the Vedas is to lead one gradually to the path of the Supreme Lord . The whole theme of Vedic literature is to know the Supreme Lord , the individual soul , the cosmic situation and the relation between all these items . When the relation is known , the relative function begins , and as a result of such a function the ultimate goal of life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , unauthorized scholars of the Vedas become captivated by the purificatory ceremonies only , and natural progress is thereby checked . <p> To such bewildered persons of atheistic propensity , Lord Buddha is the emblem of theism . He therefore first of all wanted to check the habit of animal-killing . The animal-killers are dangerous elements on the path going back to Godhead . There are two types of animal-killers . The soul is also sometimes called the " animal " or the living being . Therefore , both the slaughterer of animals and those who have lost their identity of soul are animal-killers . <p> Maharaja Pariksit said that only the animal-killer can not relish the transcendental message of the Supreme Lord . Therefore if people are to be educated to the path of Godhead , they must be taught first and foremost to stop the process of animal-killing as above mentioned . It is nonsensical to say that animal-killing has nothing to do with spiritual realization . By this dangerous theory many so-called sannyasis have sprung up by the grace of Kali-yuga who preach animal-killing under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discussed in the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Maulana Chand Kazi Shaheb . The animal sacrifice as stated in the Vedas is different from the unrestricted animal-killing in the slaughterhouse . Because the asuras or the so-called scholars of Vedic literatures put forward the evidence of animal-killing in the Vedas , Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas . This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood , peace , justice and equity . There is no justice when there is animal-killing . Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely , and therefore his cult of ahimsa was propagated not only in India but also outside the country . <p> Technically Lord Buddha 's philosophy is called atheistic because there is no acceptance of the Supreme Lord and because that system of philosophy denied the authority of the Vedas . But that is an act of camouflage by the Lord . Lord Buddha is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original propounder of Vedic knowledge . He therefore can not reject Vedic philosophy . But he rejected it outwardly because the sura-dvisa , or the demons who are always envious of the devotees of Godhead , try to support cow-killing or animal-killing from the pages of the Vedas , and this is now being done by the modernized sannyasis . Lord Buddha had to reject the authority of the Vedas altogether . This is simply technical , and had it not been so he would not have been so accepted as the incarnation of Godhead . Nor would he have been worshiped in the transcendental songs of the poet Jayadeva , who is a Vaisnava acarya . Lord Buddha preached the preliminary principles of the Vedas in a manner suitable for the time being ( and so also did Sankaracarya ) to establish the authority of the Vedas . Therefore both Lord Buddha and Acarya Sankara paved the path of theism , and Vaisnava acaryas , specifically Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu , led the people on the path towards a realization of going back to Godhead . <p> We are glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Buddha . But will they take the matter very seriously and close the animal slaughterhouses altogether ? If not , there is no meaning to the ahimsa cult . <p> Srimad-Bhagavatam was composed just prior to the beginning of the age of Kali ( about five thousand years ago ) , and Lord Buddha appeared about twenty-six hundred years ago . Therefore in the Srimad-Bhagavatam Lord Buddha is foretold . Such is the authority of this clear scripture . There are many such prophecies , and they are being fulfilled one after another . They will indicate the positive standing of Srimad-Bhagavatam , which is without trace of mistake , illusion , cheating and imperfection , which are the four flaws of all conditioned souls . The liberated souls are above these flaws ; therefore they can see and foretell things which are to take place on distant future dates . " <p> Srimad-Bhagavatam 1:3:24 Purport <p> " A cruel and wretched person who maintains his existence at the cost of others ' lives deserves to be killed for his own well-being , otherwise he will go down by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of another 's life . Political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell . That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit because in his next life he will not have to suffer for his act of murder . Such a death sentence for the murderer is the lowest possible punishment offered to him , and it is said in the smrti-sastras that men who are punished by the king on the principle of a life for a life are purified of all their sins , so much so that they may be eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven . According to Manu , the great author of civic codes and religious principles , even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer because animal food is never meant for the civilized man , whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners , and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly . He who gives permission , he who kills the animal , he who sells the slaughtered animal , he who cooks the animal , he who administers distribution of the foodstuff , and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers , and all of them are liable to be punished by the laws of nature . No one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science , and therefore no one has the right to kill a living being by one 's independent whims . For the animal-eaters , the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only , and such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses and not to encourage animal-killing . The procedure under which animal sacrifice is allowed in the scriptures is good both for the animal sacrificed and the animal-eaters . It is good for the animal in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human form of life after being sacrificed at the altar , and the animal-eater is saved from grosser types of sins ( eating meats supplied by organized slaughterhouses which are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society , country and the people in general ) . The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties , and by encouraging animal slaughter the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more by war , pestilence , famine and many other unwanted calamities . " <p> Srimad-Bhagavatam 1:7:37 Text and Purport <p> " Those who kill animals and give them unnecessary pain-as people do in slaughterhouses-will be killed in a similar way in the next life and in many lives to come . One can never be excused from such an offense . If one kills many thousands of animals in a professional way so that other people can purchase the meat to eat , one must be ready to be killed in a similar way in his next life and in life after life . There are many rascals who violate their own religious principles . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou shalt not kill . " Nonetheless , giving all kinds of excuses , even the heads of religions indulge in killing animals while trying to pass as saintly persons . This mockery and hypocrisy in human society bring about unlimited calamities ; therefore occasionally there are great wars . Masses of such people go out onto battlefields and kill themselves . Presently they have discovered the atomic bomb , which is simply awaiting wholesale destruction . If people want to be saved from the killing business life after life , they must take to Krsna consciousness and cease sinful activity . The International Society for Krishna Consciousness recommends that everyone abandon meat-eating , illicit sex , intoxication and gambling . When one gives up these sinful activities , he can understand Krsna and take to this Krsna consciousness movement . We therefore request everyone to abandon sinful activity and chant the Hare Krsna mantra . In this way people can save themselves from repeated birth and death . " <p> Caitanya-caritamrta , Madyam lila 24:251 <p> " Sometimes the Muslims , they kill the animal simply , and it throbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the hunters , some of the hunters , they also kill the animal half . So they take pleasure . I have seen in my own eyes in Calcutta . One hotel man was cutting the throat of a chicken and half-cut , and the half-dead chicken was jumping like this , and the man was laughing . His little son , he was crying . I have seen it . He was crying . Because he 's innocent child , he could not tolerate . He was crying . And the father was saying , " Why you are crying ? Why you are crying ? It is very nice . " Just see .

##875350 <p> C ephalic tetanus , a rare condition , variously known as kopftetanus and tetanus hydrophobicus is a subtype of tetanus in which cranial nerve palsy often precede trismus . The recognition and first description of the disease is usually ascribed to Rose , by whom the name tetanus hydrophobicus was given . At present , the term cephalic tetanus is applied to those cases which present as paralysis or paresis of one or more of the cranial nerves as a prominent symptom , together with more or less well-marked symptoms of tetanus , generally confined to the region of head and neck , though at times involving the entire body . The severity of tetanus is usually inversely proportional to the duration of the incubation period , periods of seven days or less carrying a grave prognosis .

To learn more about this mystical amulet click here <p> PISCES ASCENDANT/ MEENA Pisces can signify enjoyments and sensitivity . Pisces people are restless and are constantly on the move . A strong Jupiter can give the Pisces ascendant a spectacular rise in career as Jupiter rules Sagittarius ( as well as Pisces ) , which is the ruler of the tenth house for Pisces ascendant . <p> Pisces people are devoted to duty , have strong morals and are good advisors . They are idealistic , generous , emotional and enthusiastic . They are friendly and compassionate . Pisces people are truly intuitive and feel things very deeply . They are easily misled and moved by feelings from other people that are not always genuine . Pisces people can become prone to addictions . <p> Pisces people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They lack sometimes initiatives and self-confidence and often do n't want to be in the spotlight . They are amorous and hard to pin down and often they will appear in whatever way required or necessary to placate and please other people . They can be like the chameleon who camouflages their appearance to protect themselves . <p> Pisces ascendants get the unlucky privilege of having five functional malefic planets including Rahu and Ketu . Virgo and Taurus ascendants have the same misfortune and therefore these ascendants will have more chances of having the proverbial stick placed into the spoke of the wheel creating disturbances in their lives . Pisces ascendants have the Sun and Venus changing signs and houses almost every month , which makes the problems that these malefic planets offer short-lived . Saturn is the other malefic and the difficulties caused by this planet are prolonged because of its slow motion . Therefore , Pisces ascendants get it both ways , having short-lived problems mixed with longer term ones . Nevertheless Pisces ascendants do have the planets Jupiter , Mars , Mercury and the Moon as functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married life , a successful career and good status in life , as these planets rule the houses that indicate such factors , the second , fifth , seventh and tenth . <p> The mooltrikona for Mars is Aries placed in the second house . If Mars is strong and well placed for the Pisces ascendant , then the person stands to be successfu l and have a dynamic spouse . There will be material affluence and vitality as well as the person having an outgoing nature . If Mars is weak or afflicted , then there will be only average success in one 's life and there will be a lack of vitality and an inharmonious relationship with the spouse . Impatience and bad language could result . <p> The mooltrikona sign for the Moon is Cancer placed in the fifth house . A strong and well placed Moon will balance the emotions , create good relationship with children and bring good fortune . The Pisces ascendant will have more stability and they will have a perceptive intellect , be creative with ideas and make sound financial investments . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be progeny problems and loss of mental peace . There will be impractical investments perhaps based on wrong intuition . There can be emotional problems regarding one 's children . <p> The mooltrikona sign for the Sun is Leo placed in the sixth house . A strong Sun in the chart without any afflictions to other planets or houses will bring about sound health . It will also protect the Pisces ascendant from disputes and oppositions as well protecting the person from having high blood pressure and heart problems . The person will be guarded from debts and possible audits from government officials . If the Sun is weak , then the person will have opposition and lose arguments . Debts will occur as well as health related problems affecting the stomach and blood pressure . The person 's own vitality and enthusiasm will be less . <p> As the mooltrikona sign of Mercury falls in the seventh house in the sign of Virgo , then it is vital that Mercury is strong and unafflicted in order to create a marriage that will last . Strong Mercury will protect and boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can enhance partnerships , whether being in a relationships or a business . If Mercury is weak and afflicted , then the marriage is often stressful and ends in divorce . Partnerships in business suffer , as do stays in foreign lands . <p> The mooltrikona sign for Venus is Libra placed in the malefic eighth house . A well placed Venus that does not aspect any benefic planets or houses on account of its malefic nature will prolong one 's life-span . It will protect and prolong the marriage as this house signifies marriage , as does the seventh and the second house . There will be less chance of problems with low blood sugar and with kidney ailments . If Venus is weak , then the marriage can suffer as will as sexual enjoyments . There will be a lack of vitality and enthusiasm , and possible problems with the renal area . The malefic Venus that afflicts any planets will destroy the benefic signification 's of those planets . For example , Venus aspecting and therefore afflicting Mars in the chart can destroy courage , marriage bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign for Jupiter is Sagittarius placed in the tenth house . A strong and well placed Jupiter can bring about great status in their life . They will make good administrators and excel in training and development vocations . Jupiter connected with a strong Moon gives good academic qualifications and a possible career in teaching . The ambitions and success that the Pisces ascendant aspires for can come into fruition with a benefic Jupiter in their chart . For females , Jupiter may bring the same qualities to their husband .

##877252 <h> Blogs we like <h> What to do in Mumbai ? 10 cool do 's <p> Mumbai is often seen as a place to be deserted as soon as possible , but that 's not entirely fair . Here 's what I would do if I had four days on my hands in Mumbai . <p> 1 . Do the few points of interest : Gateway of India ( a must , even if it is just another disappointing colonial monument ) and Chor Bazaar ( pic on the right ) , the thieves market . I hear that the Prince of Wales museum in Colaba is actually pretty decent . Instead of displays on Charles and Camilla it boasts a wide collection of ancient vedic sculptures and at least used to offer free audio guides . And do n't forget the Oval Maiden ( pic on the left ) , where people play cricket in a wicked colonial surrounding . <p> 2 . Did you always dream of becoming an actor one day ? This is the site of Bollywood and this is your chance ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask around and you 'll find one . They hire extras for commercials and even movies . You can count on being payed about a thousand rs ( 14 euros ) for a long day , which involves a lot of waiting around , doing nothing . But in the end of the day , you 've been to a Bollywood film . That is still cool . They 'll fetch you from your guesthouse and give you a ride back . <p> 3 . Eat lunch every day at Cafe de Paris . Despite its name , this is a bare bones all you can eat thali joint with possibly the best price-quality ratio in Mumbai , which at least on Indian standards tends to be expensive . Incredibly popular with the locals , it serves fantastic thalis for the whopping price of 40 rupees ( that 's 60 cents , folks ) and can not be found in the Lonely Planet . It 's located on the Southern end of the Colaba Causeway , past the main hubbub . <p> 4 . You 've seen the Slum Dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One such place is the ominous red lights district , left out from the LP but featured with ample warnings in the Footprints guide . Some girls wear saris , some Western gear , some are kept behind bars . A stroll around the area is not as shocking as it could be but it 's definitely not another Reperbahn . It 's a rather straight forward but longish walk from the Central Train Station to Falkland Road and the way is badly signposted . But if you do n't mind asking for directions to prostitutes , then it 's not too hard to find . I succeeded with my second attempt . <p> 5 . Elephanta Island . A welcome retreat from the polluted city , Elephanta Island is a 40 minute boat ride away . It has pretty decent sculptures in caves ( pic above ) and a big monkey population . I liked it . <p> 6 . As you probably have never seen a man powered Ferris wheel , Chowpatty beach is the place to spend an evening . These crazy dudes climb up the wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reaches the ground in order to give it extra weight and thus an extra pull down . You should see it yourself . It 's mind-boggling . The beach is particularly popular with locals at evenings . They just come there to hang out . <p> 7 . Go clubbing ! As Mumbai is the home of India 's elite , it has quite a few crazy ass clubs where the bold and the beautiful hang out drinking champagne . But do n't bother trying to get in wearing the baggy pants brigade armour and flip flops . Dress to impress . <p> 8 . Okay , this is a lousy suggestions as you 'll probably end up inCafe Leopold 's anyway , but I happen to really like this restaurant/bar even if it is overpriced . And if you decide to steer clear from the Taj hotel , then this is your place should you want to do some terrorist tourism as Leopold 's was one of the sites of Mumbai terror attacks in November 08 . <p> 9 . If you do decide to check out the Taj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended drinks or tea at Taj 's top floor . There 's a new restaurant there serving nouveau Indian cuisine , meaning that the food is prepared without ghee and is thus not fatty . It requires a splash , but the food is amazing , <p> 10 . If you have read Shantaram , a novel I recommended in my list of books to read in India , then you might want to walk the route he walks every night through Bombay 's alleys . The walk gives you a cool perspective although I 'd do it in the daytime . <p> The article above originally appeared on 99 + 1 countries ; we selected it for our BlogSherpa program .

##882052 <p> The CRN Task Force was formed in response to the Foresight Nanotech Institute and Battelle research group 's well-funded initiative to develop a " Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems " link . Progress toward developing the technical requirements for desktop molecular manufacturing already was moving forward rapidly , and we knew that the Roadmap project would only accelerate it . We could not allow efforts to effectively prepare for the impacts of nanotechnology to lag behind advances on the technical side . The stakes are too high . <p> The mandate of the CRN Task Force is to thoroughly investigate the societal and environmental implications of advanced nanotechnology ; to separate real from fictional ; and to develop comprehensive , responsible , and workable recommendations . We began with a few core people , including Jerry Glenn ( Director of the AC/UNU Millennium Project ) , Nick Bostrom ( Director , Future of Humanity Institute , Oxford University ) , David Brin ( author of The Transparent Society ) , and Ray Kurzweil ( CEO of Kurzweil Technologies ) . <p> Since then , the CRN Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five continents . We will continue adding others with diverse backgrounds and points of view . Additional experts in geopolitics , economics , ethics , ecology , and international policy formation will be recruited . Without mutual understanding and cooperation on a global level , the hazardous potentials of advanced nanotechnology could spiral out of control and deny any hope of realizing the benefits to society . <p> NN : With the formation of the CTF , have you reached any conclusions ( however tentative ) regarding policy on advanced nanotechnologies ? <p> Reaching conclusions will not be a quick process . Our plan from the beginning was to concentrate first on fully defining the challenge : What risks do we really face ? How do they relate to each other ? What is most important to know in order to design wise and effective policies for molecular manufacturing ? <p> The initial work of the CRN Task Force has underscored the conviction of CRN that there are no simple answers or simple solutions . <p> For their initial project , the CTF chose to generate a range of independent essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of 11 essays will be published in the Nanotechnology Perceptions academic journal , and will be posted online at the Wise-Nano.org web site and at KurzweilAI.net . About six weeks later , we 'll have a second group of essays published in the same places . <p> Today 's nanoscale technologies are comparable to analog computers : they deal directly and elegantly with physical phenomena . However , digital computers have replaced analog computers in almost every instance , and have expanded to perform many tasks that would be impossible with analog methods . In the same way that digital computers attain greater flexibility , lower cost , and easier design by abstracting away from physical phenomena , molecular manufacturing will be able to take advantage of the precision of atoms and their bonds to build nanoscale manufacturing systems capable of making a wide variety of products . It remains to be seen whether molecular manufacturing methods will supplant or only complement other nanoscale technologies , but the history of computers suggests that such an outcome is possible . <p> Nothing 's been put to rest . If anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risen to a new prominence . For example , CRN has generally downplayed the much-publicized worries about accidental release of self-replicating nanorobots . Silly novels like Michael Crichton 's Prey do n't offer a realistic picture of the dangers , but that does n't mean dangers do n't exist . After hashing through the issue with some of our most knowledgeable task force members , we 've concluded that it would be premature and irresponsible not to study further the implications of deliberate release . <p> NN : Which issues remain foremost on your " to do " list ? Which represent the greatest potential danger to humankind , and what are some of the ways being discussed to mitigate them ? <p> One thing that has n't changed is our conviction that the most threatening and least understood danger is nanotech-enabled war . The massive increase in weapons potential that molecular manufacturing will offer could rapidly shift and destabilize present balances of power . All-out war between two or more rivals is a real danger , as is the possibility of one nation or group rising to global dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious problem is the persistent underestimation of both the hazards and the opportunities presented by advanced nanotechnology . If politicians , the public , and pundits do n't get a grip on the dangers we 're facing , it could be too late to respond effectively and avert them . On the other hand , if nanotech 's wondrous potential benefits are not fully appreciated , then irrational fear could delay or prevent them altogether , denying better health , prosperity , and fuller lives to billions of people . <p> NN : What are some of the recent technological advances that you view as examples of our steady progress towards advanced nanotechnologies ? <p> NN : Our perennial favorite question to policy makers and opinion shapers is " If you had the collective attention of every policy maker and stakeholder , what would you tell them about advanced nanotechnologies ? " <p> Both the beneficial potential and the grave dangers of molecular manufacturing are poorly understood and have been seriously underestimated . The changes to society will be abrupt , transformative , and probably disruptive . It is important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthroughs could occur , because that is what will trigger this sudden change . Today the pace of technical advance is far ahead of studying and preparing for the societal and environmental impacts of the technology . Unless this balance is corrected , we will enter the future unable to effectively and responsibly manage the tremendous power being unleashed by nanotechnology . We may have only one chance to get it right . <p> About the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology Advanced nanotechnology may build machines that are thousands of times more powerful-and hundreds of times cheaper-than today 's devices . The humanitarian potential is enormous ; so is the potential for misuse . The vision of CRN is a world in which molecular manufacturing is widely used for productive and beneficial purposes , and where malicious uses are limited by effective administration of the technology . <p> CRN acts to raise awareness of the issues . We believe that even a technology as powerful as molecular manufacturing can be used wisely and well-but that without adequate information , unwise use will be far too common . The mission of CRN is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits and dangers , and the possibilities for responsible use . <p> In order to provide well-grounded and complete information , clear explanation , and workable proposals , CRN studies , clarifies , and researches the issues involved-political , economic , military , humanitarian , and technological . CRN presents the results for both technical and popular audiences , and works to supply the information as effectively as possible . The purpose of CRN is to investigate the ethical , legal , and social implications ( ELSI ) of molecular manufacturing , and to educate those who will influence its use or be affected by it . <p> Mike Treder and Chris Phoenix are co-founders of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology . <h> Building The Winning Start-Up Team : Part 2 of 6 <p> By Bo Varga <p> Let us help you " ride the wave " of advanced technology with NanoStrategies provides the resources , expertise and connections throughout the global nanotech community to support the development and success of your venture . <p> Introduction : Bo Varga has recruited senior technical and executive talent for high technology companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a CEO for a CNT start up , a Scientific Advisory Board for an early stage nano VC fund , and world-class computational chemistry scientists for a nano energy start up . Bo is currently recruiting a CEO , VP Engineering , and VP Sales for a nano start-up focused on revolutionizing the global mining industry via a nano-scale " fishing net " for recovering metals from solutions . <p> Entrepreneurs , start-up teams , investors , and recruiters often intersect to match a startup with the experienced business management required for success . Different perspectives , needs and communication styles - as well as individuals egos - can lead to power struggles that can unify a team or break up a company . Building and maintaining a corporate culture focused on the company 's goals can promote success . <p> Many startups have a standard set of weak spots in their initial management team - a lack of customer focus , entrepreneurs with little to no background in launching or heading a corporation , or technologists that can not drive a business as well as develop a technology and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest potential and IP can become an unattractive investment decision if the right management team is not in place and if a cooperative and focused team environment is not established &; maintained . Developing an operations plan with performance requirements - so current team members can see where they can &; will perform and where new hires are needed - can also promote success . <p> Article : This article addresses how job requirements should be based on performance requirements which are driven by the company 's business model , business plan , &; stage of company . It also covers establishing &; maintaining a corporate culture and the process of building a winning team . <p> Objectives : Upon completion of this article , you will understand elements of a job requirement &; job requisition , the key role of performance requirements in driving hiring , the importance of a corporate culture , and the importance of process in hiring . <h> 1 . COMPANY JOB REQUIREMENT <p> ( i ) Usually job reqs cover job title , who the position reports to , job responsibilities , and experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason why anyone is ever hired - to accomplish a task , AKA performance requirements . <p> Performance requirements are driven by the business plan , which in turn is driven by the business model and the stage of the company 's development - what needs to get successfully completed each week , month , and year in the company 's path to success . <p> Standard business models include : <p> Engineering Consulting / Consulting Services <p> IP Developer / Licensing / Incubation <p> Product Company - Direct Sales <p> Product Company - Channel Sales <p> Product Company - OEM <p> Start-up companies are usually opportunistic and may adopt a combination of business models , direct sales to some customers , joint venture &; IP licensing with major corporate OEMs , etc. - and often transition from one model to another - one common model is moving from engineering consulting to a product model . Over time the start-up either focuses on one model or develops divisions or business units that specialize in one model . <p> The difficulty for a start-up is that people requirements for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater manufacturing people assets for a product company &; greater engineering assets for a consulting company . Each model requires different business development , sales &; marketing skills . Assuming the start-up accepts the need for experienced , successful executives in top management , different performance criteria and business experience will be required to successfully implmeent each model . For an initial period managers and executives can juggle multiple roles , but as business grows the need to focus increases <p> ( ii ) The business plan has ( or should have ) a staffing plan , which falls out from the operations plan that documents how the company will implement the business plan and establishes performance requirements for each functional area . The priorities on the staffing plan drive the hiring plan , which in turn drives the job requisitions which are the basis for hiring . Professional investors , consultants , &; recruiters can be of great help in preparing a realistic staffing plan and addressing key issues as they arise . <p> One issue that often arises is unrealistic expectations about the types of people who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a venture and need to be " sold " . And the more desireable a candidate the more the candidate will want from a company in terms of maturity of technology , product , and funding and the scale of the business opportunity . So compromises will have to be accepted . <p> As nanotechnology ventures are often spin-outs from academic , corporate , or government laboratories , nano start-ups are often led by scientists or engineers . In our experience the greatest single hurdle to success ( and certainly to acquisition of funding ) is the desire on the part of the scientist or engineer to retain control of his or her " baby " . <p> The core requirement for raising money is a credible business team , with a CEO who has proven success at raising money , assembling a core team , and building revenue . <p> Ideally the CEO will be supported by a technical team with people who have a customer &; product &; business focus - if they are not part of the start-up then hiring them should be a major focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment many times over . <p> A fundamental error which occurs in hiring is to focus on credentials and not on outcomes . Even a focus on credential &; experience can miss the point . The only purpose for hiring a permanent employee , on-going consultant , or project consultant is to achieve performance goals , desired outcomes - within the time , money , and other resources allocated for those outcomes . A top level example of a performance driven job requisition follows . <p> ( iii ) COMPANY JOB REQUISITION <p> Title ( Nominal ) CTO Role ( Real ) VP ENGINEERING/DIRECTOR MANUFACTURING <p> KEY PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS : <p> get coating manufacturing process set up within X months and Y budget <p> get production ramped up to Z units/week within 3 months <p> commit 20% of time with customers &; strategic partners to close deals <p> commit 20% of time with CEO in managing deals , both close &; on-going management <p> KEY BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS : <p> Strong management skills - minimum 10 years <p> Strong production skills - minimum 10 years <p> Chemistry or Materials Science Degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to have but proven ability to get things done is the key <h> 2 . PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND THE WINNING TEAM <p> ( i ) Job Titles are political in nature , in our example above the VP Engineering position was not available as a founder was " holding " this title and was unwilling to switch to a CTO title due to personal career requirements , so an " equivalent rank " title had to be found . In addition , the company wanted to be seen as a technical innovator and in fact had a Japanese manufacturing partner , so a VP Manufacturing or VP Operations hire was not desired as the company did not want to be pulled too far in the manufacturing direction but wanted to focus on development of innovative coating processes . <p> ( ii ) The example is a top level job requisition , which does not define the detailed parameters of job performance , which was defined by the business plan - in the case of coatings manufacture time &; budget to get manufacturing process up &; running , technical issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other metric used to measure the capabilities of the candidate - based on past performance - and establish future performance criteria . <p> ( iii ) Performance can only be measured by performance metrics - for example a CEO who has raised $1 million in private equity could be a good candidate for a company which wants to raise $2 million , but we would not recommend that CEO to a company which needs to raise $10 million or $20 million . Budgets , staff supervision , products released on time and on schedule , manufacturing volume &; quality goals met - a variety of appropriate metrics can be used to judge past performance . <p> Past performance measured by relevant metrics is the single best indicator of ability to meet target performance goals . The nano start-up can rarely afford on the job training ! <h> 3 : BUILDING CORPORATE CULTURE <p> ( i ) When we meet with founding teams and ask basic questions such as ( 1 ) where will the company be in 1 , 2 , 3 years in terms of products , customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 2 , 3 years in terms of your responsibilities , compensation , work hours , etc. we often find that real lack of match in the vision of the founding team . <p> Founding teams determine the future of the company , the " founder effect " is quite real and the founding team needs to consciously agree where the company is to go in order to actually get there ! <p> Agreement must be reached and maintained not only on goals but also on process . For example , will the team work on a consensual basis - everyone gets their say and work proceeds based on common agreement ( typical " Japanese " model ) or will the team work on an entrepreneurial , almost opportunistic basis ( typical " Silicon Valley " model ) - once vision is established and goals are set each executive , team leader , etc. leads in their area of responsibility and keeps others informed as required for common tasks . <p> ( ii ) Founding teams should regularly meet to define and agree on goals for the company and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other factors that create the work environment . <p> When we meet with founding teams and ask basic questions such as ( 1 ) where will the company be in 1 , 2 , 3 years in terms of products , customers , revenues and ( 2 ) where will you be in 1 , 2 , 3 years in terms of your responsibilities , compensation , work hours , etc. we often find that real lack of match in the vision of the founding team . <p> Once agreement has been reached on vision and goals this should be reflected in the company 's positioning in the marketplace , web site , and other aspects of the company 's appearance to both insiders and outsiders . <p> ( iii ) Communication styles , spoken , written , presentation , coaching , mentoring , etc. are key requirements to build the desired corporate culture . This includes communications from the team to candidates and by candidates to the team . Some areas of measurement for new hires include focus , clarity , appropriateness , etc . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as personal styles are present in even the most technical document . <p> ( iv ) In the recruiting process for new candidates for hire , repeated interviews with all key people on the existing team - both 1:1 and group interviews , as well as requesting formal presentations in response to performance requirements and on topics of interest to the company are two key ways to determine communications styles and fits with corporate culture . <h> 4 : PROCESS KEYS TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL TEAM <p> I. Establish a formal hiring process , including interview protocols , reference checking protocols , and so forth - an example of a recruiting protocol follows . <p> II . Hire top down - and have senior people work lower level jobs as required until funding or other constraints are relaxed to allow lower level team members to be hired . The keys to success in staffing are ( a ) the higher level people can scope out job requirements and are in a much better position to manage subsequent hires if they have successfully accomplished tasks ( b ) generally higher level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly evolving and semi-structured start-up situations <p> III . Hire " been there , done that " when possible - a start up lacks the resources - both people and the financial runway - to support " on the job training , " with the exception of specific domain knowledge relating to the company , its proprietary technology &; applications , and marketing network . <p> IV . Focus on benefits which align team members with corporate goals - bonuses , promotions , educational opportunities , flexible stock plans , flexible work places ( i.e. mobile tools so team members can work at home , on the road , etc . ) . <p> V. Stay as flexible as possible - leverage on-going and project consultants when possible , but convert them to " permanent " employees or hire a replacement when the role becomes critical for the company 's growth . Align consultants with corporate goals by providing stock &; other benefits . While the short term cost will often be more when working with consultants , this is an investment in your company which can often yield major payoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI . Timing of the hiring plan should never prevent the hiring of stars who will be needed " later . " The performance of one star often can not be duplicated by several intermediate players . We recommend the hiring of stars whenever they are found , assuming a cultural fit and compensation and other requirements that work for the company . <p> Bo has 30 years business development and team building experience .

Technical trends need to be followed and determinations made of where the efforts of money , researcher attention , and past success has been seen ; knowing what is already feasible and what is the current state of the art ; understanding the business and political environment that would make a real-world deployment successful . <p> Predicting the loss of privacy is an example of understanding what has already happened . There are already billions of camera phones , and digital and video cameras . More and more of these devices are transmitting information to the Internet . Higher resolution is a no-brainer . More energy efficiency so that the devices can stay on longer is a slam-dunk . Wireless transmission of data will improve , and better user interfaces for easy posting and sharing of digital files is assured . End result : everything is monitored , all the time . <p> Another useful thing to understand are the physics of how things work . How does strength and weight of material matter for the performance of systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with batteries that have five times the energy density by weight ? How could different improvements in capability interact ? Would people or businesses want to buy access to the capability or product ? <p> For example , I am quite confident that the technical capability for very high-speed communication will be available and will be ready to be deployed . I am less certain that the business climate will be suitable . Companies lost billions of dollars trying to deploy broadband communication during the dot.com days . What is in its favor is that analog TV that is transmitted to old style TV antennas is being legislated away by about 2009 . This will provide more spectrum for high speed wireless . Also , there are advances in artificial poor-man satellites . Balloons with tethers and long duration planes could go up 10-30 kilometers and would be super-antenna platforms . Therefore policy and several technology trends look like they will have a positive interaction . <p> A controversial area of prediction centers around human enhancement . I believe it will happen . Why do I believe this ? Millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures are costly and risky . The benefit that they are trying to achieve is an improvement in how they look . Millions of people take performance-enhancing steroids now . Steroids have clear health consequences , but they do enhance performance . Millions of muscle disease sufferers will be given clinical trials of muscle enhancement . This will spread and improve the knowledge to those who want to enhance a healthy individual . Those who get enhanced will be able to reap financial gains in sports and business because of performance advantages . If procedures are outlawed in one location , they could be encouraged in other locations . Those who allow procedures that actually enhance performance will have advantages over those that do not . Gene therapy is actively promoted in China . <p> Some people like to predict future economic collapse . I am willing to predict down business cycles and periods of slow growth ; I am more reluctant to predict long-term economic collapse . Why ? I believe that people are willing to go to extreme lengths to maintain a working economy or for large financial gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year ) for 30 years . In 2004 , China reported 136,000 industrial deaths . Perhaps 3 million have died in China in 2003 , 2004 from urban air pollution . <p> Each year , about 1.2 million drivers , passengers , cyclists and pedestrians of all ages are killed on the roads , according to the study prepared by the World Health Organization and the World Bank . <p> Each year in the United States , approximately 440,000 persons die of a cigarette smoking-attributable illness , resulting in 5.6 million years of potential life lost , $75 billion in direct medical costs , and $82 billion in lost productivity . The tobacco industry is in the range of a $100 billion per year industry . <p> Many thousands die each year from mining accidents and wars over oil . <p> Demographic predictions are usually among the safer predictions when forecasting out 2 decades . Especially if it is the future that has already happened . Predictions that people will age are pretty safe ; predictions about future birth rates are more risky . <p> Technology results with multiple paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from better wireless ( multiple types of systems here ) or more fiber optic deployment , or better use of television cable or microwaves , or data over power lines , or from algorithmic and protocol efficiency in data transmission . <p> When picking the technology-based winning approach it is important to understand the technical and other challenges and limitations of each approach . I think magbeam and magnetic plasma technology are good bets for future space technology because they have high performance but low energy requirements and do not require megascale engineering . Laser pushed solar sails have more challenges . <p> Other factors to consider are : <p> How big is the payoff ? <p> Why would someone with the resources want something to happen ? <p> If we are talking about a trillion dollar part of the economy which is dependent on computers getting faster then it is a pretty safe bet that a lot of effort will go into making faster computers . <p> How much resistance is there to the technology ? <p> How widespread is the resistance ? <p> Are there legislative hurdles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and atoms . I think that technological control and use of light ( lasers ) , other energy waves and frequencies , plasma , magnetism , genetics , cells , information and the integration of all this control will bring about surprising capability . Being able to leverage powerful forces of nature using those capabilities will also provide surprises . <p> Brian Wang is a long time futurist , who has been involved with nanotechnology associations since 1994 .

I was interviewed a few weeks ago for this podcast , and the first excerpt from that conversation is included in the February 11 show . <p> Defining Nanotechnology Responsible Nanotechnology February 16 , 2006 Definitions of nanotechnology are getting broader all the time . A draft definition recently crossed our desks , something on the order of " The study of things too small to see . " This is of course far too broad , and does not indicate what is special about nanotechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanotechnology ? What collective observation -- let alone formal definition -- can be made about a loose association of fields as diverse as fabricating computer chips , making movies of proteins in action , and analyzing the performance of future nanofactories ? <p> Molecular manufacturing and culture shock Responsible Nanotechnology February 14 , 2006 Chris Phoenix : In a comment on a recent post , Nato Welch asked , " But will fabs really produce any phenomena so startling revolutionary as their own exponential growth ? " <p> That got me thinking . Exponential manufacturing would be a large conceptual shock to many people . And Nato makes a good point that the existence of *any* exponential manufacturing system would help people accept MM and encourage them to pay attention to the implications of molecular manufacturing .

That 's a lot for a couple of volunteers to shoulder , but Mike Treder and Chris Phoenix have carried their burden well , and have done much to raise awareness of the potential risks and benefits of molecular manufacturing , including a major presentation at the US Environmental Protection Agency on the impacts of nanotechnology . We first linked to CRN back in October of 2003 , and have long considered them a real WorldChanging ally . <p> Late last year , Mike and Chris agreed to be interviewed for WorldChanging .

" <p> CRN is pleased to see this issue gaining momentum . Even though the first level of laws being discussed will deal only with nanoscale technologies and not with molecular manufacturing , it 's a step in the right direction -- a step that begins paving the way for even more important discussions about the societal and environmental implications of advanced nanotechnology . <p> Nanotechnology Regulation : More Thoughts Responsible Nanotechnology January 18 , 2006 Mike Treder : We want to make it clear that talking about the health and safety issues of nanoscale technologies is no substitute for awareness of the risks that molecular manufacturing will bring in a few years . <p> Nanoscale technology risks are of familiar types ( though , of course , varying in detail and severity ) . Molecular manufacturing , on the other hand , will create technological capabilities that have never existed , of a power that easily could be destabilizing on a global scale . <p> Impact on Everyday Life Responsible Nanotechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe will have the greatest impact on your every-day life ten years from now ? Nanotechnology was seen to have the second greatest impact , trailing only genetic engineering . <p> Sounds Too Good To Be True Responsible Nanotechnology January 11 , 2006 Mike Treder : We 've all heard that , and it is basically wise advice . I think it applies to a new report from Nature that says " Desktop fusion is back on the table " -- but does it apply equally well to molecular manufacturing ? <p> Simple Nanofactories vs . Floods of Products Responsible Nanotechnology January 05 , 2006 In last month 's CRN Science &; Technology Essay , Chris Phoenix explained why even the earliest meter-scale nanofactories will necessarily have a high throughput , manufacturing their own mass in just a few hours . He also explained how a nanofactory can fasten together tiny functional blocks ? nanoblocks ? to make a meter-scale product . The question to be discussed this month is what range of products an early nanofactory would be able to build . <p> Nanotech Regulation Needed ?

For a quick introduction , check out Productive nanosystems : the physics of molecular fabrication by K. Eric Drexler . <p> Aging , Death , and Nanotech Responsible Nanotechnology December 29 , 2005 Mike Treder : Among the most intriguing research of our time is the effort to understand the process of aging , and perhaps to arrest or even reverse its effects . <p> Watching the Meme Spread Responsible Nanotechnology December 21 , 2005 Mike Treder : " A revolutionary machine which can make everything from a cup to a clarinet quickly and cheaply could be in all our homes in the next few years . " <p> That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could Turn Homes Into Small Factories " -- which is not talking about nanofactories . We are watching a meme spread right before our eyes . <p> The Discovery Machine Responsible Nanotechnology December 21 , 2005 Mike Treder : It 's not just poetry to say that " unleashing of the best minds " is largely what drove the 20th century 's surge in innovation and productivity . In fact , since the invention of the printing press , our world has been made immeasurably better by allowing more minds to invent and create . Education , democracy , free markets , better communications technology , and improved travel and transport options -- all have made possible this spectacular liberation of human potential . <p> Transforming Society , at Yale Responsible Nanotechnology December 09 , 2005 Mike Treder : Two days ago , Wednesday , December 7 , I gave a talk at Yale University 's Institute for Social and Policy Studies . My subject was " Transforming Society : Ethical Issues in the Nanotech Revolution , " and my presentation was addressed to Yale 's Technology and Ethics Working Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community members . <p> A Global Surge Protector ? futurebrief.com December 08 , 2005 Mike Treder : Behind the economic and military power surges foreseen by Hanson and Gubrud is the strength of emerging technologies . In particular , advanced nanotechnology ? molecular manufacturing ? is expected to enable dramatic changes in virtually all areas of life , including the home , the hospital , the boardroom , the battlefield , and the natural environment . Some refer to this as the next Industrial Revolution , and that is not an unreasonable comparison . <p> The big difference , however , between previous industrial revolutions and the nanotech revolution is the time span covered . Steam engines , electricity , the automobile , telecommunications , computers : these all brought extreme transformations to society , but they each did so over a period of decades . When molecular manufacturing arrives , probably before 2020 , a shock wave of change could reverberate around the world in only a year or two . Never before have disruptive impacts occurred so rapidly . <p> Inside CRN , Part 5 Responsible Nanotechnology December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated on what might be called the middle period of nanotechnology development , the point between today 's nanoscale technologies and the fantastic possibilities of the further future ( again , the recurring theme of CRN being in the middle ) . <p> In response to the negative associations of ' molecular nanotechnology ' and ' MNT ' with visionary universal assemblers , we made an attempt in the latter half of 2003 to distinguish this middle period as dealing with a limited version of molecular nanotechnology , or LMNT . <p> Inside CRN , Part 3 Responsible Nanotechnology December 07 , 2005 CRN 's conclusions about the potentially transformative and disruptive nature of molecular manufacturing are still not widely accepted . It is sometimes easier to find disagreement ? occasionally vehement ? from influential persons in government , business , and academia , than to find sympathy with our positions . <p> Does this mean that we are wrong ? Obviously , it does not , although of course it also does not mean that our conclusions are necessarily correct . <p> Changing Scientific Opinion Responsible Nanotechnology December 06 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the American Institute of Physics on " The Discovery of Rapid Climate Change . " The article describes how climatologists slowly became aware , over a period of more than 50 years , that climate could change not in tens of thousands of years , but in less than a decade . <p> Inside CRN , Part 1 Responsible Nanotechnology December 06 , 2005 The mission of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology is to raise awareness of the issues presented by advanced nanotechnology : the benefits and dangers , and the possibilities for responsible use . We want to help create a world in which molecular manufacturing is widely used for beneficial purposes , and in which the risks are responsibly managed . <p> " This month 's science essay is prompted by several questions about nanofactories that I 've received over the past few months . I 'll discuss the way in which nanofactories combine nanoscale components into large integrated products ; the reason why a nanofactory will probably take about an hour to make its weight in product ; and how to cool a nanofactory effectively at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain it : today 's nanotechnologies use big machines to make small products -- by contrast , molecular manufacturing will use small machines to make big products . That sounds simple , but it is really a profound distinction . <p> The Four-Stage Sequence Responsible Nanotechnology November 22 , 2005 Mike Treder : Although I 'm not in any way endorsing the rest of the ideas on this website , this concept applies quite neatly to molecular manufacturing : <p> " In science , the acceptance of new ideas follows a predictable , four-stage sequence . " <p> Chris Phoenix : Molecular manufacturing will not be the same as nukes . Nukes come in a spectrum from massively destructive to awesomely destructive , and they 're quite hard to build . MM weapons will be in a much broader spectrum , from humane restraints through less-lethal all the way to awesomely destructive . And many of those technologies will be dual-use , and all will be easy to build ( given a nanofactory ) . These and other reasons imply that an MM arms race would be less stable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanotechnology November 18 , 2005 Researchers in Tunis have unveiled a $A137 hand-cranked laptop computer , saying they hoped to place them in the hands of millions of schoolchildren around the globe . <p> Mike Treder : If you believe in the value of empowerment through education , in the necessity of bringing technology to children in developing countries , and in the importance of global networking , then this is really good stuff . <p> What does " extremely powerful " mean ? Responsible Nanotechnology November 17 , 2005 Chris Phoenix : Someone emailed the following question , and I found myself writing a fairly long answer that seems worth posting here . <p> " You have said that molecular manufacturing will be extremely powerful , but very few people know what that really means . What does it mean ? What kind of an impact will molecular manufacturing have on politics , economics , law , sociology and the environment ? " <p> FedEx Delivers Nano Hype Responsible Nanotechnology November 16 , 2005 Mike Treder : Eric Mathews , associate director of the FedEx Institute of Technology , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks and biotech " to create products that no one has seen before . <p> The Need for Limits Responsible Nanotechnology November 11 , 2005 Chris Phoenix : Over the past few years , CRN has made several suggestions for controlling molecular manufacturing . An example is giving away lots of restricted nanofactories to reduce the demand for unrestricted nanofactories . Most of these suggestions have been criticized as leading straight to massive oppression . While recognizing the possibility , I have also recognized that a lack of such administrative measures would also lead straight to massive oppresion . <p> The science of nanotechnology **26;4518;TOOLONG November 09 , 2005 Patrick L. Barry : When it comes to taking the next " giant leap " in space exploration , NASA is thinking small - really small . In laboratories around the country , NASA is supporting the burgeoning science of nanotechnology . The basic idea is to learn to deal with matter at the atomic scale - to be able to control individual atoms and molecules well enough to design molecule-size machines , advanced electronics and " smart " materials . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 Mike Treder : Observing the disruptive effect of Google on traditional business -- and even on Info Age companies -- could help us understand how molecular manufacturing will shake things up in a few more years , albeit on a much larger scale . <p> " Scary " Article Counterpoints Nanotechnology Now November 03 , 2005 Steven G.

I wanted to put it on here so that everytime I feel down or depressed or upset about something , I can come over here and look at this post ! LIFE IS N'T ABOUT HOW TO SURVIVE 
##884952 <p> Mine is a 100% , real life Experience and I 'm happy to share it with all . My name is seelan , I 'm 23 and I 'm doing my Final year of Computer Engineering . I reside in Malaysia ( Johor ) . I have a brother , who is an Electronics-Engineer in UK . The age difference between me and my brother is 7 years , since one of our brother died in an accident when I was very young . My brother was married to an Indian girl and they both live in UK at present . When this incident took place , I was 19 years old . My Babhi ( Brother 's wife ) was around 23 years then . Her name is " Radhika " and she was a very nice girl . Since my brother arranged her VISA very early , she left for UK soon after her marriage , and I only had a very brief chance to chat with her during her stay in our home . She was very homely and She always spoke in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent and innocent . After she left India , I use to admire her beauty in the photographs present in her marriage Album . During my shagging sessions , I use to fantasise many women but my Babhi appeared to be the " BEST " . I demanded my parents to send me to UK during my Semester holidays as I was very eager to see the English Country and my brother 's family . My brother sponsored the VISA and I had the chance to visit UK . This was the greatest turning-point in my life . By this time my Babhi had given birth to a little kid named " Vicky " . And I was very eager to see them all . The flight to UK was a very long one almost 9-10 hours , but the British Airways was very luxurious and comfortable . I landed at the " Heathrow " airport and was received by my Babhi and Mr.Madhav , one of my brother 's friend . I asked about the kid and brother and she told me that the kid is with the Baby-sitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very responsible one . Mr.Madhav drove the car and my Bhabi was sitting in the front seat and I was given the rear seat.My Bhabi was chatting so freely with Mr.Madhav and me , and was making lot of witty comments about Malaysia . I was very much surprised and could not believe myself that she is the same , silent Bhabi , who I met in Malaysia . I noticed her change in the Dressing-habits , since she use to wear only sarees in Malaysia , and now she is in a T-Shirt and Jeans . We reached home . It was a place called " Colliers-wood " , in London . I was very happy to see their home which I 've only seen in Photographs . I found the kid sleeping and decided to have a bath and freshen myself . Bhabi prepared " Hot-Chocolate " for drinking ( which is my favourite ) and also some tinned-snacks . Since Mr.Madhav had already left , I asked Babhi about him and she told me that he is a very good friend of my brother and a well-wisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and thought that Bhabi may have a liking towards him . Then we discussed many things about our family and friends and I presented her the Best Collection of Sarees and Salwar kameezes and the exclusive Baby-Wears given by my Parents . I also gave her the Home ground Spices and Masalas prepared by our House-maid . My Babhi was extremely Happy and Thanked me very much for all those lovely things . I played with the kid and that day I slept very early as I was very tired of the journey and the time-lag between Malaysia and UK which is nearly 5.30 hours made me sleep earlier than the UK sleeping time . I slept thinking of my Bhabi 's changes in her way of behaviour , attitudes , way of dressing , and the wonderful changes that had taken place in her body after her Pregnancy and Delivery . She has put some more weight and her lovely " BOOOOOOBS " have become more bulky and bulging out . I felt that No Bra on Earth can hold her Breasts together and keep them inside . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were in the size of Two Massive Pumpkins kept together . Thinking all these wonderful stuffs , I slept . The next morning I was waken by my brother and I was glad to see him . We exchanged a little conversation and my brother left for work . The morning 6.00 AM in UK is around some 11.40 AM in Malaysia time and my watch was running in Malaysia time . During that morning as I was reading the Newspaper , the Baby-sitter came for her duty , But Bhabi asked her to take a leave that day and told her we are going out with the baby . Once the Baby-sitter left , my Bhabi gave me a sexy smile and told me to go and take bath as it is time for Breakfast . I took bath and Bhabi called me for Breakfast . As I was dressing up , she called me again and again , and then she came into my room and asked me why I 'm having a Make-up for so long when nobody is at home , and teased me whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and saying this she again gave a " Mischievous smile " and I just blushed nervously . We had Sandwiches and Orange juice for Breakfast ( actually it is " Brunch " ) . At this time Babhi brought the baby to the table and I gave the kid some Orange juice , Babhi told me that Orange juice is a very concentrated one and the baby could not digest it , and saying this she Opened the front Zip of her Nighty and took out her left " Breast " and started feeding the baby . I was almost about to faint and became so nervous that I could not swallow the Sandwiches . I bent my head down and tried not to see her . Then I left the table and went to my room and started reading the News-paper , But I could not read anything and the sight of her " Large Milky Boooooooobs " was the Only thought Constantly coming in my mind . Her Boobs were so " Bulky and Full of Milk " and she was not wearing a Bra inside her Nighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick " was in its full form , like a " Rock-Hard-Steel-Pillar " waiting for a " Juicy Cunt " to enter . After some 10-15 minutes later , my Bhabi came to my room and sat next to me and I noticed that the front Zip of her Nighty was Completely Unzipped and the loose material of the Nighty was very carelessly covering her breasts . She asked me Why I did not eat the full Sandwich and I told her that my stomach was upset and so I could not eat it . Hearing this she said that she has a very good medicine for that and saying this she got up from the bed and brought her " Big Booooobs " near my face and Exposed them completely to me , I still remember the smell of milk coming from her " Milky Booooooobs " . The sight of those two " Big Mammaries " , made me so horny and I began sucking her left one and fondle the other.Her " Nipples " were so " Big " and " Brown " in colour and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a piece of Chocolate . She held my hair and pressed my face more tightly towards the Boobs . I sucked and sucked ........... and Milk was coming out with great speed and I squeezed her Boob for more and more Milk . Babhi was moaning with pleasure and began calling me with some Bad-Names . I never minded her words and kept on doing my duty Perfectly . When the Left Breast became Empty I took the Right one and started sucking . WOW ....... , This Breast is better than the other and it is " Full of Milk " , since the kid did not drink from it . I started sucking , chewing , pressing , kneeding , and every possible thing that could be done with the Breasts . It tasted like some Heavenly food and this was the first time I am drinking " Breast-Milk " in my life from a woman other than my Mother . These thoughts made me Even More Horny . Bhabi was moaning and moaning and asked me not to stop my sucking and to suck More Harder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slave . By this time , I could feel her hands playing with my " Dick " and mine was already like a " Hot-Rod-Of-Steel " , my Bhabi shook it to and fro and made it even more harder . As it was my first Experience , I came very soon and poured my load of Cum on Bhabi 's hands and the bed-covers . My Dick lost its stiffness and My Bhabi told me that it would be better if we " Undressed " each other . Undressing my Babhi and revealing her " Private Parts " was such a " Thrilling Experience " to me for the First time in my Life and soon we were in our Birth suits . Now , She took my erect Tool in her Mouth and started giving me my " First and Best " blowjob in my life , I realised that my " Penis " was Regaining its " Jumbo-Size " in my Bhabi 's mouth after its First Cum . She sucked me so hard that I feared that Blood may be coming out from my Penis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly . And , She stroked and Sucked and Sucked and I came for the Second time in her mouth after a long time , She was just like a " Whore " and I could not believe that " Radhika " , my innocent Bhabi was doing all this . She then told me to do the same to her , I was so " Greatful " to her for giving me this " Chance of my Lifetime " . I smelt the fine " Aroma " of her wet Pussy and was aroused again , I started eating her pussy as if its the Best Nectar on earth , and the smell of her " Pussy " made me " Horny like Hell " . She was moaning with pleasure and her sounds of moaning gave me a great " Kick " and I began licking her Clitoris , and I licked every cell of her Clit and very soon I felt her Love-Juices coming down her already wet Cunt , I made my tongue more sharper and moved it Inside-Out and Inside-Out and continued it till my tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and I Drank and Drank all of it . She Finally asked me to Enter her as she could not wait any longer , and guided my " Eight-Inch-Steel-Rod " inside her " Wet-Pussy-Hole " . I felt so great and I started my Pumping with slow thrusts and increased the speed gradually and she too was moving her Hip in the Correct direction Opposing my thrusts.She was shouting like Hell and I asked her to lower her moans or else somebody may come or the kid may wake up . She lowered her voice and began to bite her lips . I held each of her Boobs and increased my Piston speed . After a long time , suddenly she asked me to do it more and more faster as she was about to come . I did it with all my Power and she suddenly Held me very tightly and reached Orgasm , But I did not come , as I ' ve already come Twice on the bed-covers and her mouth , it took a little longer than her . But then after some minutes I too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both our juices mingled together . I felt like flying in the Air and I were in some " Heaven " or in Some other Planet . We kissed each other Passionately and Embrased very tightly . Even in the UK climate , we both were sweating due to our body heat . I felt like sleeping and we both held each other and slept without taking out my Penis from her Cunt . We had a very sound sleep and When we got up , it was nearly 4'O Clock in UK time . We both felt very satisfying and tired at the same time . We both took bath together and We got into the Mood again and started to fuck in the shower itself . I still remember that day , it was May 6th , 1997 , the day I lost my Virginity to my Babhi and I have even made a note of that day in my Diary . When we were talking in the Evening , We both discussed so many things very frankly and she asked me not to call her " Bhabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radhika " . To my surprise she told me that she has Fucked many of my Brother 's friends and my brother also knows that and my brother has also fucked many of his friend 's wives during some parties and festival Get-togethers in UK and He does not care about it . She even told me that it is very Common in UK and she has got used to it . She also told me about her earlier Lesbian relations with her youngest Aunty who is staying in &lt;malaysia&gt; , BATU PAHAT , And suggested me that her Aunty can give me better company for me in India . She surprised me by telling me that she liked me very much even when she was staying in Malaysia home before leaving to UK , But the situation in our home was not Favourable for our sex and that is the reason why she did not move freely with me in malaysia.she also use to call me " Mr.Handsome " and not by my name , and also asked me to call her as " Radhika " and not to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she taught me every aspect of " Sex and Seduction " in detail and every day was a day of learning something New in Sex . And I found her to be an Expert in all types of sexual Topics . She trained me How to slow down my " Ejaculation Period " and told me that I have to withold my cum for very " Long " time since women reach Orgasm very Late . She taught me everything she knew and She was a very nice Friend , Philosopher and a Sexy Guide to me . I use to kiss her whenever I felt like kissing , and it is needless to say about our Fucking Sessions . We have fucked at almost all places in the house and even in the Shower , in the Garden , in the Kitchen , and all the rooms except the Prayer room ( Pooja room ) . We have even Fucked during her " Menstrual Periods " , using " Condoms " and she told me it is not Hygienic to lick her Vagina during Menstruation . She showed me tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected by my brother and " Sex Manuals " containing all the Possible Positions in fucking and Coitus . And we both tried the various positions which are Easy for both of us to fuck . During my entire stay there I would have Drunk " Gallons " of Milk from her " Boobs " and every time she fed the kid , she use to give me the other " Breast " for sucking . I was her Special son and She always use to appreciate me for my Performance in Love-making . She did not believe me when I said that she was the First Woman I fucked in my life . But I promised her that was true , because in Malaysia , i have few Girl-friends , But I did not have any Physical relations with them and my Babhi was the First one to Deflower my " Virgin Penis " . She was very happy to hear that and asked me not to forget her throughout my life . When I was leaving back home , she presented me with a 18K gold . ring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also gave me her " IBM Laptop " which she told she was using very rarely . I felt like Crying and she too felt the same . After my return to Malaysia , A month later , I contacted her Aunty who was in Batu pahat . She was also a nice and Broadminded lady around 38-40 years old who lives almost alone most of her time , since her husband is a Chief-Executive in a MNC in Batu pahat and he Hardly finds time to satisfy her . I use to visit Batu pahat once in a month and use to satisfy her till she attains Orgasm after Orgasm , till her Husband got a transfer to Kuala lumpur and she too went with him . She too liked me very much and we both had many Thrilling Experiences and I even visited Kuala lumpur in 1999 . She use to E-mail me and we Exchange our New Experiences very frankly . Now it seems that she has found a New Bed-partner in Kuala lumpur . I am at present Residing in Johor , Kuala lumpur is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindi , Tamil , English and Malay . I would like to satisfy other women also whatever their age may be and I can use my wider Knowledge on all aspect of Sex to satisfy any women to the content of her Heart in any Position . So any Female who live in any State of India or Any Part of Malaysia or Abroad can contact me with Confidence and Trust . They may be of any age , Chicks , Aunties , Unsatisfied Wives , Mummies , Widows , Divorcees , Broadminded 
##887652 <p> Even if you have knowledge , do not disturb the childlike faith of the ignorant . On the other hand , go down to their level and gradually bring them up . ( Ibid. 26 , 29 . ) That is a very powerful idea , and it has become the ideal in India . That is why you can see a great philosopher going into a temple and worshipping images . It is not hypocrisy . <p> Later on we read what Krishna says , " Even those who worship other deities are really worshipping me . " ( Ibid . IX . 23 . ) It is God incarnate whom man is worshipping . Would God be angry if you called Him by the wrong name ? He would be no God at all ! Ca n't you understand that whatever a man has in his own heart is God -- even if he worships a stone ? What of that ! <p> We will understand more clearly if we once get rid of the idea that religion consists in doctrines . One idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam ate the apple , and there is no way of escape . Believe in Jesus Christ -- in a certain man 's death ! But in India there is quite a different idea . There religion means realisation , nothing else . It does not matter whether one approaches the destination in a carriage with four horses , in an electric car , or rolling on the ground . The goal is the same . For the Christians the problem is how to escape the wrath of the terrible God . For the Indians it is how to become what they really are , to regain their lost Selfhood . ... <p> Religion is the realisation of spirit as spirit . What are we doing now ? Just the opposite , realising spirit as matter . Out of the immortal God we manufacture death and matter , and out of dead dull matter we manufacture spirit . ... <p> If you can realise Brahman by standing on your head , or on one foot , or by worshipping five thousand gods with three heads each -- welcome to it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any right to say anything . Therefore , Krishna says , if your method is better and higher , you have no business to say that another man 's method is bad , however wicked you may think it . <p> Again , we must consider , religion is a matter of growth , not a mass of foolish words . Two thousand years ago a man saw God . Moses saw God in a burning bush . Does what Moses did when he saw God save you ? No man 's seeing God can help you the least bit except that it may excite you and urge you to do the same thing . That is the whole value of the ancients ' examples . Nothing more . Just signposts on the way . No man 's eating can satisfy another man . No man 's seeing God can save another man . You have to see God yourself . All these people fighting about what God 's nature is -- whether He has three heads in one body or five heads in six bodies . Have you seen God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever see Him . What fools we mortals be ! Sure , lunatics ! <p> Each one thinks his method is best . Very good ! But remember , it may be good for you . One food which is very indigestible to one is very digestible to another . Because it is good for you , do not jump to the conclusion that your method is everybody 's method , that Jack 's coat fits John and Mary . All the uneducated , uncultured , unthinking men and women have been put into that sort of strait jacket ! Think for yourselves . Become atheists ! Become materialists ! That would be better . Exercises the mind ! ... What right have you to say that this man 's method is wrong ? It may be wrong for you . That is to say , if you undertake the method , you will be degraded ; but that does not mean that he will be degraded . Therefore , says Krishna , if you have knowledge and see a man weak , do not condemn him . Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must grow . I can put five bucketfuls of knowledge into his head in five hours . But what good will it do ? He will be a little worse than before . <p> Whence comes all this bondage of action ? Because we chain the soul with action . According to our Indian system , there are two existences : nature on the one side and the Self , the Atman , on the other . By the word nature is meant not only all this external world , but also our bodies , the mind , the will , even down to what says " I " . Beyond all that is the infinite life and light of the soul -- the Self , the Atman . ... According to this philosophy the Self is entirely separate from nature , always was and always will be . ... There never was a time , when the spirit could be identified even with the mind . ... <p> The reality in nature is spirit . Reality itself -- the light of the spirit -- moves and speaks and does everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the energy and soul and life of the spirit that is being worked upon in different ways by matter .... The spirit is the cause of all our thoughts and body-action and everything , but it is untouched by good or evil , pleasure or pain , heat or cold , and all the dualism of nature , although it lends its light to everything . <p> " Therefore , Arjuna , all these actions are in nature . Nature ... is working out her own laws in our bodies and minds . We identify ourselves with nature and say , ' I am doing this . ' This way delusion seizes us . " ( Ibid . III . 27 . ) <p> " Even those who know the path act impelled by their own nature . Everyone acts according to his nature . He can not transcend it . " ( Gita , III . 33 . ) The atom can not disobey the law . Whether it is the mental or the physical atom , it must obey the law . " What is the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> What makes the value of anything in life ? Not enjoyment , not possessions . Analyse everything . You will find there is no value except in experience , to teach us something . And in many cases it is our hardships that give us better experience than enjoyment . Many times blows give us better experience than the caresses of nature .... Even famine has its place and value .... <p> Now Shri Krishna says : " Better die in your own path than attempt the path of another . " ( Ibid. 35 . ) This is my path , and I am down here . And you are way up there , and I am always tempted to give up my path thinking I will go there and be with you . And if I go up , I am neither there nor here . We must not lose sight of this doctrine . It is all a matter of growth . Wait and grow , and you attain everything ; otherwise there will be great spiritual danger . Here is the fundamental secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving people " and all believing in the same doctrine ? It can not be . There are the general ideas that can be taught to mankind . The true teacher will be able to find out for you what your own nature is . Maybe you do not know it . It is possible that what you think is your own nature is all wrong . It has not developed to consciousness . The teacher is the person who ought to know .... He ought to know by a glance at your face and put you on your path . We grope about and struggle here and there and do all sorts of things and make no progress until the time comes when we fall into that life-current and are carried on . The sign is that the moment we are in that stream we will float . Then there is no more struggle . This is to be found out . Then die in that path rather than giving it up and taking hold of another . <p> If you want to be religious , enter not the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more evil than good , because they stop the growth of each one 's individual development . Study everything , but keep your own seat firm . If you take my advice , do not put your neck into the trap . The moment they try to put their noose on you , get your neck out and go somewhere else . As the bee culling honey from many flowers remains free , not bound by any flower , be not bound .... Enter not the door of any organised religion . Religion is only between you and your God , and no third person must come between you . Think what these organised religions have done ! What Napoleon was more terrible than those religious persecutions ? . . . If you and I organise , we begin to hate every person . It is better not to love , if loving only means hating others . That is no love . That is hell ! If loving your own people means hating everybody else , it is the quintessence of selfishness and brutality , and the effect is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working out your own natural religion than following another 's natural religion , however great it may appear to you . ( Ibid. 35 . ) <p> " Beware , Arjuna , lust and anger are the great enemies . These are to be controlled . These cover the knowledge even of those who are wise . This fire of lust is unquenchable . Its location is in the sense-organs and in the mind . The Self desires nothing . ( Ibid. 37 , 40 . ) <p> Then Arjuna asks , " Why do you speak thus ? You are a man born only the other day , and Vivaswan was born long before you . What do you mean that you taught him ? " ( Ibid. 4 . ) <p> Then Krishna says , " O Arjuna , you and I have run the cycle of births and deaths many times , but you are not conscious of them all . I am without beginning , birthless , the absolute Lord of all creation . I through my own nature take form . Whenever virtue subsides and wickedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation of the good , for the destruction of wickedness , for the establishment of spirituality I come from time to time . Whosoever wants to reach me through whatsoever ways , I reach him through that . But know , Arjuna , none can ever swerve from my path . " ( Ibid. 5-8 , 11 . ) None ever did . How can we ? None swerves from His path . <p> ... All societies are based upon bad generalisation . The law can only be formed upon perfect generalisation . What is the old saying : Every law has its exception ? ... If it is a law , it can not be broken . None can break it . Does the apple break the law of gravitation ? The moment a law is broken , no more universe exists . There will come a time when you will break the law , and that moment your consciousness , mind , and body will melt away . <p> " No action can touch me . I have no desire for the results of action . Whosoever knows me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ancient sages , knowing this secret could safely engage in action . Do thou work in the same fashion . ( Ibid. 14-15 . ) <p> " He who sees in the midst of intense activity , intense calm , and in the midst of intensest peace is intensely active is wise indeed . ( Ibid 18 . ) ... This is the question : With every sense and every organ active , have you that tremendous peace so that nothing can disturb you ? Standing on Market Street , waiting for the car with all the rush ... going on around you , are you in meditation -- calm and peaceful ? In the cave , are you intensely active there with all quiet about you ? If you are , you are a Yogi , otherwise not . <p> We can not remain without action for a moment . Act ! But just as when your neighbour asks you , " Come and help me ! " have you exactly the same idea when you are helping yourself . No more . Your body is of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more for your body than you do for John . That is religion . <p> " He whose efforts are bereft of all desire and selfishness has burnt all this bondage of action with the fire of knowledge . He is wise . " ( Ibid. 19 . ) Reading books can not do that . The ass can be burdened with the whole library ; that does not make him learned at all . What is the use of reading many books ? " Giving up all attachment to work , always satisfied , not hoping for gain , the wise man acts and is beyond action . " ( Ibid. 20 . ) ... <p> I see in my country a man becomes strong , educated , becomes a philosopher , and says , " All this praying and bathing is nonsense . " ... The man 's father dies , and his mother dies . That is the most terrible shock a Hindu can have . You will find him bathing in every dirty pool , going into the temple , licking the dust . ... Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from anyone . That is the truth . There have been more gods than human beings ; and yet no help . We die like dogs -- no help . Everywhere beastliness , famine , disease , misery , evil ! And all are crying for help . But no help . And yet , hoping against hope , we are still screaming for help . Oh , the miserable condition ! Oh , the terror of it ! Look into your own heart ! One half of the trouble is not our fault , but the fault of our parents . Born with this weakness , more and more of it was put into our heads . Step by step we go beyond it . <p> It is a tremendous error to feel helpless . Do not seek help from anyone . We are our own help . If we can not help ourselves , there is none to help us . ... " Thou thyself art thy only friend , thou thyself thy only enemy . There is no other enemy but this self of mine , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . ) This is the last and greatest lesson , and Oh , what a time it takes to learn it ! We seem to get hold of it , and the next moment the old wave comes . The backbone breaks . We weaken and again grasp for that superstition and help . Just think of that huge mass of misery , and all caused by this false idea of going to seek for help ! <p> There is only one sin . That is weakness . When I was a boy I read Milton 's Paradise Lost . The only good man I had any respect for was Satan . The only saint is that soul that never weakens , faces everything , and determines to die game . <p> Stand up and die game ! ... Do not add one lunacy to another . Do not add your weakness to the evil that is going to come . That is all I have to say to the world . Be strong ! ... You talk of ghosts and devils . We are the living devils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of death is weakness . Whatever is weak , avoid ! It is death . If it is strength , go down into hell and get hold of it ! There is salvation only for the brave . " None but the brave deserves the fair . " None but the bravest deserves salvation . Whose hell ? Whose torture ? Whose sin ? Whose weakness ? Whose death ? Whose disease ? <p> Where one sees another , one hears another so long as there are two , there must be fear , and fear is the mother of all misery . Where none sees another , where it is all One , there is none to be miserable , none to be unhappy . ( Chhndogya , VII . xxiii-xxiv , ( adapted ) ) There is only the One without a second .

##894851 <h> Jest a minute <h> TOPICS <p> Stand-up comedian Bharti Singh is all set to keep the audience in splits at the ' Laugh Chennai Laugh ' show on Tuesday evening <p> In a world where most people are weight-obsessed and think twice before biting into a muffin , here 's somebody who looks every bit unapologetic while tucking into her bowl of laddoos . " Main bilkul patli nahi hona chahti hu , " says the plus-sized comedian Bharti Singh . Often known to make self-deprecatory comments , especially targeting her own weight , she says , " To be a good comedian , you need to have the ability to laugh at yourself first . We often target other personalities and people in the audience so before trying it out on them we need to first try the jokes on ourselves . " <p> Foray into television <p> Having entered the television stand-up comedy circuit in 2008 , Bharti has been a staple in almost every comedy show on air . Other than her hilarious acts , she is well known for her ability to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a little sardar boy . She says she was the funniest and the chubbiest one in her class throughout her school days . But she never expected to end up as one of India 's funniest comedians . " My friends asked me to audition for The Great Indian Laughter Challenge . I participated , and was the second runner-up on the show . That 's how everything started , " says the 26-year-old . <p> The entertainer is now all set to perform in Chennai at Laugh Chennai Laugh . " I have n't prepared anything . My performance is going to be spontaneous . Hum bahut masti karenge , " says Bharti . Each show , each performance throws up a challenge -- connecting with the audience and making them laugh , and Bharti enjoys every bit of it . How does she manage to come up with concepts and jokes ? " Actually , we have concept writers who write wonderful scripts for us . They deserve a lot of credit . Getting the delivery and comic timing right is up to us . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and models have a shelf life , but a comedian does n't have such restraints . They never fail she says , giving the example of Johny Lever . " Being funny and having a good sense of humour is a god-given talent . You can send your children for singing and dancing classes , but you ca n't send them anywhere to learn comedy , " says Bharti . <p> So what else can she do apart from being funny ? Well , she can dance . A contestant on the recently-concluded fifth edition of Jhalak Dikhhla Ja , she was one of the top 5 contestants who battled it out , unleashing a range of twists , turns , lifts and pirouettes . " I was waiting for you to ask me about Jhalak , " she laughs , adding , " it was a fantastic opportunity for me , and I wanted people to say that Bharati is an all-rounder . All credit goes to my choreographer Savio . We practised for eight hours a day . " Not just providing entertainment through her dance , she also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always wanted to dance but were held back because of their weight . " Everybody can dance . Size does n't matter . " <p> Her popularity on the dance reality show ensured she got herself quite a few movie offers too . Bharti says she ca n't talk about the movies she 's shooting for yet . Not just shooting for the camera , the actor was also a pistol shooter and archer in college . But she could n't pursue these , as these sports turned out to be expensive . By then her focus shifted to stand-up comedy and she became well-entrenched in the television scene . Either way it 's been a good shot at success . <p> Laugh Chennai Laugh will take place on October 2 at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall , Chetpet , 7.30 p.m . Tickets , priced at Rs. 2000 , Rs.1000 and Rs.500 , are available at the venue . 
##896350 <h> Sons who soil <h> TOPICS <p> Raj Thackeray 's anti-Bihari invective , in the same vein as his rant against ' outsiders from north India ' at the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena public meeting in August , should surprise no one . After the Bihar police protested at not being taken into confidence in the arrest of an Azad Maidan rioter by the Mumbai police in Sitamarhi , Raj threatened to brand all Biharis as ' infiltrators ' and throw them out of Maharashtra if the Bihar government posed any impediments to the investigation . He also demanded registration of all migrants -- read people from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar . The call was quickly endorsed by his cousin Uddhav in the Shiv Sena , who revived the demand for a permit system to keep out ' Bangladeshis ' . The MNS has got away with worse , beating up students from the north appearing for railway recruitment examinations and Bihari taxi drivers and shopkeepers in Mumbai , apart from pouring vitriol on all migrants . After all , the MNS has learnt its political style from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bhaiyya " from Uttar Pradesh as dirty and criminal is reminiscent of the way " Madrasis " were once caricatured by the Shiv Sena . While nothing better can be expected from the two Senas bent on capturing the Marathi vote bank , what is inexplicable is the consistently limp response of the ruling coalition in dealing with these threats . <p> Bal Thackeray 's father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray or Prabodhankar , who encouraged his son to form the Shiv Sena , wrote in his autobiography that the family hailed from a place near Nashik . He went to Kolkata for his studies , after which he moved to Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh before arriving in Mumbai , all in search of livelihood . That makes it plain that Prabodhankar was no less a migrant than the tens of thousands arriving in Mumbai every day . India 's commercial capital owes much to the sweat and toil of migrants . Over the centuries the city has welcomed them and benefited from them . Both the MNS and Sena should know that without its multi-ethnic workforce drawn from all corners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . It is the constitutional right of every citizen to travel and live in any part of the country ; it is the state 's duty to secure this right . Unfortunately , the Congress lacks the gumption to tackle the chauvinism of the Senas . Political expediency might be the reason the Prithviraj Chavan government lets the MNS get away with its provocations , but it can continue to play this game only at great risk to the social and economic fabric of India 's biggest metropolis . It is time the Maharashtra government stood up and showed that the state has not withered away . <h> RELATED NEWS <p> As the article ' sons who soil ' argues , the migration towards Mumbai had created actual AAMCHI MUMBAI . The requirement of man power for growth created migration and thus Mumbai was built in progressive shape . This is shameful that lions of papers are targeting poor taxi drivers in name of regionalism and showing their strength against poor people . I do n't think Thackeray family is part of Mumbai for last thousands years , since Thackeray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone has right to go wherever he wants . Role of Congress government is also dubious , since it is letting Raj Thackeray to say anything , he wants . <p> Rajat Sharma " rajaji " <p> from : rajat sharma <p> Posted on : Sep 9 , 2012 at 16:29 IST <p> You are right in saying that the social and economic fabric should be protected by the govt . But , seriously , who in the government cares about it ? They are happy as long as their pockets are stuffed with money and their needs are met . <p> from : Nikhil <p> Posted on : Sep 9 , 2012 at 07:03 IST <p> Bad Politics is dragging our country behind . Its time to think for the nation building but it seems nation building still remaims a dream . Mumbai is for all . People residing there supports migration . It is the hard work of all people that makes a place for all . Lets us shun all regional differences and lets contribute towards nation building . Lets put politics aside and promote harmony as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sep 8 , 2012 at 11:37 IST <p> Blaming KCR or Thackeryes is no brainer . Inspite of its vast resources why US is trying to be protectionist country ? We all go out to protect rights of Tribals and farmers affected by Dams . Then , are we blind to see the effect of new populations taking over the resources which are scrace and not sufficient to feed all . The real culprits are the people who concentrated all job opportunities to Metros ' and did not think of developing infrastructure in rural areas . How does one feel when asked to vacate his house for road extension ? Or how does one feel when he does n't get job in his own city where he grew up ? Worst is in the field of low cadre jobs . The migrant people occupy all available spaces leaving the local population in total distress . It need not be Thackeray to lead these protests . Tomorrow some other leader will emerge . Unless local population is assured of their rights very soon every metro will face same situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 at 20:15 IST <p> There will be more Udhavs in other states if it is not controlled with a steel hand now . For example KCR and his Telengana Party want all Andhras from coastal AP should be sent out of Hyderabad . So If and when Telengana is created , KCR family will take the cue from Thakeray family and insist on Visas for rest of Andhras like YSR had predicted and KCR 's son KTR endorsed later . <p> from : MVJRao <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 20:08 IST <p> I am Maharashrian and working in Pune , why these fake people trying to didvide INDIA . Can Raj answer my question what happened if Marathi people need to go to Bihar for work ? IS this something going top happened when one district people can not work in other district ? <p> What i know is , this is dirty politics and i think we need to stand against this , be voted to person who speak for development .. <p> from : Nikhil <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 pieces as there are 28 states , or else divide the country into parts based on religion , otherwise divide it on the basis of caste , else skin color , else language ... <p> There is so much internal unrest in the country , why wont terrorist target us . If a foreigner says something , then it becomes ' racial abuse ' . <p> Its really pathetic that people are so narrow-minded in our country , no wonder everywhere Indians have bad reputation . And the people who boast about their land , caste , religion etc I want to say onething - ' There is no self-made man , you are made - up of thousands of others which you do nt even realize and probably will never realize . ' <p> from : Vidhi <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 17:52 IST <p> The unchecked trend of regional chauvinism is creating bitterness among Bihari and Marathi people.Both are good at heart and both want to live in peace , it 's the unjustified , unnecessary provocation from few disturbed politicians which is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian latter.This is a blot to our " Incredible India " . Not only the state government but also the UPA-led central government need to show these few insane people what true India is . <p> from : Sumit <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 17:19 IST <p> For those critical of this editorial : It is not enough to criticise the Hindu and vociferously state that the Senas do n't represent all Maharastrians . <p> If Maharastrians do n't identify with the Senas and their politics , then it is their duty to put this lot out of business . <p> from : Shahid Khan <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 16:09 IST <p> Let me be more practical.Unless and there is strict law to curb those kind of speech politicains in every part of our highly immoral , selfish and corrupt country continue to do so.The other way to reject them is to severly punishing them by ballott box , which is not going tohappen in my mother country for another 5 decades as we are more intersted to vote for money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to mega metro cities in the 21st century.As long as you do n't provide the basic necessities in rural area , no citizen has the right to stop the fleeing poor just for want of food to the cities.Imagine if you could get the same quality of life in a rural bihar as you get in metros any fool wil migrate leaving the tranquilled life in village.Can it happen with the current highly educated politicians we select , certainly not . The solution is kindly do the revoultion through the ballot box and eventually things will change probably in the next century . <p> from : R.Manivarmane <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 15:54 IST <p> I have two reservations regarding this editorial ; Firstly , Raj Thackeray did not " threatened to brand all Biharis as ' infiltrators ' and throw them out of Maharashtra if the Bihar government posed any impediments to the investigation . " What he said was , IF a letter saying that Bihar government will slap ABDUCTION &; KIDNAPPING cases against Maharashtra Police is really written THEN why should he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been great service by THE HINDU , if at all they would have quoted the source of Prabhodhankar 's book ( eg:Name.Publication . Year of Publication Pg No.etc ) <p> Its not that all MARATHI people support the Thackerays , but the hatred and language used by national media , be it print or electronic , pains common marathi manoos . <p> JAI HIND ...

Dude ! grow up this is 21st century India . <p> from : Amit <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 15:30 IST <p> previous i hate Raj thakray for his remarks against biharis.But after , deeply pondering i realise that , whatevr Raj thakray he is doing , doing for country.He avoiding directly blaming muslims because our country is secular country nobody can blame directly sentiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whole country then whole community of particular reasons are blamed . aif somebody goes anywhere in the country without informing their chief minister and without telling him that he is going to committing a crime then why any states police can enter in any states.if some politicions particular heads of states can accept responsibility what is doing their states people on another states only then other states police should ask whatever is doing by their states man in another states . <p> from : vikash abhishek <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 15:28 IST <p> @Suyash : How about controlling migration of companies and their headquarters in Mumbai first ? You want the Milk but keep the cows in neighbours house . This will not work . @All : Migration happens because job opportunities are not uniform . So in this case Govt of Bihar are equally responsible for not developing Bihar at Par with Mumbai or Gujarat . Raj 's behaviour is definately antinational , and it must be controlled by any means . <p> from : Avinash Baranwal <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system will be very difficult you will need another govt department for that &; still there will be leakages given the corruption . How come millions of Bangladeshi in India despite a border with BSF deployment . Secondly the moment you implement it industry will shut shop &; move to other place where there is no permit . Try it if you do nt believe , hahaha .... <p> from : Anish Khindri <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 14:00 IST <p> Being a Maharashtrian since birth , I know how various political parties claim to represent interest of the " Marathi Manoos " and whether they actually have the larger interests of the people in mind is another story . <p> However , I feel that atleast from a purely logistical point of view , the regulation of migrants coming to Mumbai is of utmost importance . The public infrastructure in Mumbai as we all know is not the robust mechanism that the city actually needs . Rather it 's like an old horse that may collapse under its own weight if more people keep on coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mumbai is bursting at the seams . <p> Hence I feel that influx of migrants to Mumbai should be monitored and severely regulated . <p> from : Suyash <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 13:52 IST <p> The Thackerays are goons , no more . Why are they at large ? If Mr. Bal Thackeray does n't approve of a movie , it is not released , under threat of unleashing his goons on any cinema which violates his order . What does this family think ? They act like some sort of godfather and think that Mumbai is their backyard . <p> Mumbai would have remained a small fishing village were it not for the Portuguese , the British , the Punjabis , Gujaratis , Biharis , Bengalis , and so on and so forth . <p> I wonder why the Mumbaikar put up with them honestly . It is not the Bihari or the UP-wallah that need to be thrown out of Mumbai , but rather the Thackeray family . Banish them to some tiny hamlet somewhere , to a place which represents Mumbai before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 13:37 IST <p> Your hard-hitting editorial is spot on but for totally unnecessary and irrelevant mention about Thackerays themselves being migrants . Whether Thackerays themselves are migrants or not is not germane to issue at hand . As you cogently pointed out , Indian constitution grants all Indians inalienable right to move and settle anywhere in country and but for the " limp response " ( as you memorably put it ) of successive governments , Sena 's ( and her progeny MNS ) vitriolic campaign would not have got any traction . The grand idea of India is being sacrificed every day at the altar of narrow , partisan and anti-national politicking . <p> from : abhijeet <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 13:32 IST <p> Raj Thakare is doing what he is doing because there is a problem in Maharshtra and he is responding in his own style . The Hindu paper and other media does not have knowledge of the problem nor they have willingness to understand that there is a problem and needs solution . The anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time to find reason and try to correct it . If Raj Thakere or Balasaheb were not in Mumbai , it would have become like Patna or UP . Do you want the economic hub of India to become like Bihar ? As far as progress of region done by Migrant in Mumbai is concerned just remember that Mumbai was much better place during 1950 &; 1960s before migrant started to pour in . Migrant always &; always go to better places from worse places and convert good places inot bad places . This problem should be addressed if you want to Stop anti migrant feeling which growing in many parts of India . Criticizing Raj without understanding the reasons for his stand is easy and shallow . <p> from : ANIL P. <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 13:27 IST <p> Who is really behind bihari bashing ? is it only Raj or is he only HMV for saffron brigade , to get back at Nitish , who is positioning and posturing himself as the messiah for biharis and distancing himself from modi led saffron brigade.The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manoos slogan , for the fear of a backlash in the next elections . How these divisive forces are to be handled ? Do we ignore them or push them into jail , at the drop of a hat and make them martyrs ? it is a known fact that thackrays ' have the financial backing of most of the business houses in Mumbai atleast , of course for their survival and safety . It is also a fact that Mumbai is inundated with influx not only from other states , which is not a big issue any more , but of migrant bangladeshi , who senak into the city and form militant outfits , creating havoc . We could see pakistani flags all over the slums in the city.We need someone to fight these forces.let raj not fight fellow indians . <p> from : P.G.RAVIKUMAR <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 13:22 IST <p> Time has come to come together as INDIANS . <p> from : Ashish <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 12:32 IST <p> Agreed with the arguments the editorial makes - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrants in the process of urbanization is not something this political ideology will understand - or wish to understand . Something like the insecurity created in the minds of the people by a political ideology of xenophobia does not just go away by the strict actions of the state . It needs to go away by gradual integration of all people - natural residents and migrants , in equal ways . Welfare and opportunities need to be created without jeopardizing cultural and traditional moralities . It cant be an either/or case of equality ; its more of a continuos proces of inclusion - and it has to be led by the state as much as the civil society . This is not mere vote-bank politics ; its a call to go back to conservatism , with a glorification of right-wing liberal economy . The reason to wonder is more that why these political wills are so popular - anyways ? ? <p> from : Saurabh <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 11:05 IST <p> Either citizen is Bihari or marathi , but it is the matter of statism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their vote bank nothing else . if he has real patriotism feeling for their state or their country , then should not doing such wasteful task to declined their image himself , this type idea create a situation like " AA BBAL MUJHE MAR " , this bihari verses navnirman is quite wrong thinking . can u tell me RAJ THAKREY SAHEB how many state are their which are not contributed by BIHARI OR BHAIYA . IF these people left the state than your navnirman never be possible , so calm down and think before saying some thing . <p> from : shiv varan singh <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 09:22 IST <p> Raj Thackeray is the true replica of ordinary leaders possessing no intellectual qualities to win the hearts of the masses . It could be childish to expect quality speech from the leader like Raj Thackary who ill-defines the word ' Infiltrators ' and unable to spell it correctly and is looking forward to opportunities to disturb the peace and harmony of country . His limited knowledge and minuscule thoughts will spread hatred across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the innocent mind . Such leaders in Bihar have been languishing in jail under the strict rule of Nitish government and hope Maharashtra will follow suit . Glare of TV cameras and much media attention also encourages MNS chief to speak venom and remain in public domain . It not the ethical duties of the media to telecast or publish hate statements of street leaders which stand no value at all . Thackeray will naturally gag himself up to the hilt if media avoid covering his story . <p> from : Rajeev Kumar <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 08:37 IST <p> The Permit system should be applicable to all migrants from any part of our country.It will really help in controlling the influx in metropolis . Also it will be useful for Mumbai Police to keep law and order in the city.It can be also useful for preventing future terror attacks . Permit system is good as long as we sees it in the ' security ' perspective . <p> from : Ajit Bhojane <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 08:07 IST <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent speech " Conflict is good , but what works in reality is Cooperation " . Sena 's Chauvinism is just a therapy to massage their own egos . It is high time they start looking at the Society through a different lens for a better tomorrow . <p> from : Raghavendra BT <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 08:02 IST <p> Raj Thackeray is never tired of treating the people from other parts of India as aliens . The Maharashtra government has turned deaf ears to the utterances of Sena leaders . It is obvious that the Maharashtra government is not averse to the statements of Sena men . It is evident that the people at the helm of affairs subscribe to the view of sena men without showing that they are so , so as to avoid the ire of people from other states . <p> from : K.V. Seetharamaiah <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 07:47 IST <p> I do not understand how any human can think in this manner . Although he has no right to decide who is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security point . The bigger issue is the people of state supporting them every aspect they can . Why these people do not understand that any candidate from MNS took any social initiative to eradicate poverty , infrastructure , corruption so that people in their state will not die due to starvation . <p> from : kamal <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 07:21 IST <p> Dear Thackeary Brothers , I want to draw your energetic attention towards some other " Marathi " problems.I my opinion your GK , and of course your brother your uncle 's also , is very poor and even poorer than a student of class X. For you , Maharashtra means , only Maumbai and Pune . And always fighting for the rights and identity of the people of these two confined areas.Thackeary brothers , there are some other areas also , please put a little bit of your " energetic " attention in Vidarbh to help poor farmers . But if you don 's want to work for a very long time . At least , go to Nagpur and help those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marathi " energy only in Mumbai.Just come out of your " nest " and see how big Maharashtra is , and left rest of the India to others . Because , that would be beyond your capacity.Also dear brethren , there is a thing in India name is CONSTITUTION , whenever you get leisure time please study it.A very intelligent person from your state had drafted it . <p> from : Narsingh <p> Posted on : Sep 7 , 2012 at 07:12 IST <p> In a developing world migration from one area to another in search of means of livelihood is inevitable . At the same time the migrants should adopt the culture of the new home which has provided them succour . Often migrants are found to continue to openly display parochial tendencies flouting the norms of behavior of the natives of the place . It is no secret that it is the migrants who toil hard whereas the locals rest on their laurels gained through inheritance and are not known to exert themselves choosing to lead an easy life .

##900750 <p> Darwin 's Theory of Evolution -- Is it Scientifically Verifiable or is it Disproven by Scientific Evidence ? <h> Vedic Science <h> DARWIN 'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION DEBUNKED <p> Darwin 's Theory of Evolution , as presented in his book " Origin of Species " has been widely accepted as fact , although it is based on Darwin 's fallible speculations . His critics write , " If the theory of natural selection of Darwin is correct , why ca n't we see the intermediate forms of species , the connecting links ? " Darwin did not have the answer nor the archeological evidence to back it up . Although there is ample evidence for many species , fossil records provide almost no evidence for the intermediate connecting links . <p> Later , scientists revised Darwin 's theory with their " Punctuated Equilibrium " evolutionary theory , supposedly making evolution invisible in the fossil record . Yet this theory is not verifiable in any way and is highly speculative . <p> An interesting article appeared recently in Pravda , in Russia , which gives an excellent argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the Half-Evolved Dinosaurs ? <p> BY : BABU G. RANGANATHAM <p> June 7 , RUSSIA ( PRAVDA ) -- Millions of people are taught that the fossil record furnishes proof of evolution . But , where are there fossils of half-evolved dinosaurs or other creatures ? <p> The fossil record contains fossils of only complete and fully-formed species . There are no fossils of partially-evolved species to indicate that a gradual process of evolution ever occurred . Even among evolutionists there are diametrically different interpretations and reconstructions of the fossils used to support human evolution from a supposed ape-like ancestry . <p> Even if evolution takes millions and millions of years , we should still be able to see some stages of its process . But , we simply do n't observe any partially-evolved fish , frogs , lizards , birds , dogs , cats among us . Every species of plant and animal is complete and fully-formed . <p> Another problem is how could partially-evolved plant and animal species survive over millions of years when their basic organs and tissues were still in the process of evolving ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reproducing if there respiratory , digestive , and reproductive organs were still evolving ? <p> In fact , precisely because of this problem more and more modern evolutionists are adopting a new theory known as Punctuated Equilibrium which says that plant and animal species evolved suddenly from one kind to another and that is why we do n't see evidence of partially-evolved species in the fossil record . Of course , we have to accept their word on blind faith because there is no way to prove or disprove what they are saying . These evolutionists claim that something like massive bombardment of radiation resulted in mega mutations in species which produced " instantaneous " changes from one life form to another . The nature and issue of mutations will be discussed later and the reader will see why such an argument is not viable . <p> The fact that animal and plant species are found fully formed and complete in the fossil record is powerful evidence ( although not proof ) for creation because it is evidence that they came into existence as fully formed and complete which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic and biological similarities between species is evidence of common ancestry . However , that is only one interpretation of the evidence . Another possibility is that the comparative similarities are due to a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes in all the various forms of life . Neither position can be scientifically proved . <p> Although Darwin was partially correct by showing that natural selection occurs in nature , the problem is that natural selection itself is not a creative force . Natural selection can only work with those biological variations that are possible . The evidence from genetics supports only the possibility for horizontal evolution ( i.e. varieties of dogs , cats , horses , cows , etc. ) but not vertical evolution ( i.e. from fish to human ) . Unless Nature has the ability to perform genetic engineering vertical evolution will not be possible . <p> The early grooves in the human embryo that appear to look like gills are really the early stages in the formation of the face , throat , and neck regions . The so-called " tailbone " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the rate of growth being faster than the rest of the body during this stage , appears to look like a tail . The coccyx has already been proven to be useful in providing support for the pelvic muscles . <p> Modern science has shown that there are genetic limits to evolution or biological change in nature . Again , all biological variations , whether they are beneficial to survival or not , are possible only within the genetic potential and limits of a biological kind such as the varieties among dogs , cats , horses , cows , etc . <p> Variations across biological kinds such as humans evolving from ape-like creatures and apes , in turn , evolving from dog-like creatures and so on , as Darwinian evolutionary theory teaches , are not possible unless Nature has the capability of performing genetic engineering . <p> Biological variations are determined by the DNA or genetic code of species . The DNA molecule is actually a molecular string of various nucleic acids which are arranged in a sequence just like the letters in a sentence . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct various tissues and organs . <p> The common belief among evolutionists is that random mutations in the genetic code over time will produce entirely new sequences for new traits and characteristics which natural selection can then act upon resulting in entirely new species . Evolutionists consider mutations to be a form of natural genetic engineering . <p> However , the very nature of mutations precludes such a possibility . Mutations are accidental changes in the sequential structure of the genetic code caused by various random environmental forces such as radiation and toxic chemicals . <p> Almost all true mutations are harmful , which is what one would normally expect from accidents . Even if a good mutation occurred for every good one there will be thousands of harmful ones with the net result over time being disastrous for the species . <p> Most biological variations , however , are the result of new combinations of previously existing genes - not because of mutations . <p> Furthermore , mutations simply produce new varieties of already existing traits . For example , mutations in the gene for human hair may change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the mutations wo n't change the gene so that feathers or wings develop . <p> Sometimes mutations may trigger the duplication of already existing traits ( i.e. an extra finger , toe , or even an entire head , even in another area of the body ! ) . But mutations have no ability to produce entirely new traits or characteristics . <p> Young people , and even adults , often wonder how all the varieties and races of people could have descended from Adam and Eve as the Bible teaches . Well , in principle , that 's no different than asking how children with different color hair ( i.e. , blond , brunette , brown , red ) can come from the same parents who both have black hair . <p> Just as some individuals today carry genes to produce descendants with different color hair and eyes , our first parents , Adam and Eve , possessed genes to produce all the varieties and races of men . You and I today may not carry the genes to produce every variety or race of humans , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of humans carry the genes for the same basic traits , but not all humans carry every possible variation of those genes . For example , one person may be carrying several variations of the gene for eye color ( i.e. , brown , green , blue ) , but someone else may be carrying only one variation of the gene for eye color ( i.e. , brown ) . Thus , both will have different abilities to affect the eye color of their offspring . <p> Science can not prove we 're here by creation , but neither can science prove we 're here by chance or macro-evolution . No one has observed either . They are both accepted on faith . The issue is which faith , Darwinian macro-evolutionary theory or creation , has better scientific support . <p> What we believe about life 's origins does influence our philosophy and value of life as well as our view of ourselves and others . This is no small issue ! <p> Just because the laws of science can explain how life and the universe operate and work does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational to believe that there 's no designer behind airplanes because the laws of science can explain how airplanes operate and work ? <p> Natural laws are adequate to explain how the order in life , the universe , and even a microwave oven operates , but mere undirected natural laws can never fully explain the origin of such order . <p> The law of entropy in science shows that the universe does not have the ability to have sustained itself from all eternity . In other words , the universe can not be eternal and requires a beginning . <p> It is only fair that school students be exposed to the scientific arguments and evidence on both sides of the creation/evolution issue . <p> REAL KNOWLEDGE We suggest that a body of knowledge does exist which provides sufficient explanation of the nature and origin of the universe and the living organisms that inhabit it . We refer to the ancient sanskrit Vedic literatures of India , an internally and externally verifiable and consistent presentation of information . Herein we find profuse descriptions of an intelligent creator god and his creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Bhagavad-gita explains the nature of the conscious soul as an indweller in the bodies of various species and it 's journey to other bodies after the death of it 's present body according to the laws of karma . The living entity has free choice to act properly or improperly and receives the resultant good and bad reactions in terms of success and failure , happiness and distress . <p> Also encoded within this vast body of literature is a description of the process of bhakti-yoga , a process for obtaining enlightenment and rising beyond the ordinary platform of eating , sleeping , mating and defending .
