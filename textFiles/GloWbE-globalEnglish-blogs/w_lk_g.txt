Next time when a box of chocolates is doing the rounds , watch carefully what each person chooses for them selves - for the kind of chocolate they like reflects the personality that they are . <p> Now this is no figment of my imagination - it 's the conclusion drawn after a thorough research was conducted . Have you ever wondered why some people like dark chocolate , some like milk chocolate and others like white chocolate ? The makers of a Swiss brand of chocolates commissioned a research to learn whether certain personalities matched certain types of chocolate . The results were astounding . <p> People who like dark chocolate are as complex as their tastes . They are connoisseurs of all things superior . They are very particular about quality and about achieving perfection . Dark chocolate lovers take the time to study about the things they care about , and value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose dark chocolate for its rich , satisfying flavour and its heart warming content . They are the kind of people who you will find in a pair of faded jeans during the weekend . If a lipstick colour was to be named after them , it would be called ' Complex &; Captivating ' <p> Milk chocolate lovers have a heart of gold . They are optimistic people who enjoy the sweetness of life . They have made the choice to see the good in people and everything around them . They spread joy through their infectious laugh . Eating chocolates evokes warm feelings and memories in these types of people . They are the type of loyal friends who remember your birthday and whom you can call at any unearthly hour to share your problems . Milk chocolate lovers would spend the weekend in an old school sweatshirt . The name of the colour of the lipstick best suited to their traits would be - ' Breath of Fresh Air . ' <p> White chocolate lovers are different from the above two kinds of people . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They love chocolates , but they love it just a little bit different . People who love white chocolates are great people to be with . They are adventurous and always willing to try out new things . They are daring and eager to be different from the average ordinary bloke . During a weekend , a white chocolate lover would be found in the latest new yoga gear . The colour of the lipstick that would best compliment their personality - is ' All the Rage . ' <p> And as for those who like all the three types of chocolates - they need to be in a freak show on display . For it is believed that people who like dark chocolates get put off by the white kind . Here 's a wise one from Terry Moore : " The 12-step chocoholics program : 
##904351 <h> The Dreams Of The World , In The Palm Of Your Hand <p> " Every year almost 9 million children and infants die from preventable causes . 1 in 5 children are now over weight . Childhood obesity is 10 times higher than it was in 1970 . " <p> " Poverty and disease in any one country has an impact on every other country because we are all living in an age where national borders should matter less and humanity matters more . " <p> These are some of the hard hitting quotes that Judith Rodin , the president of Rockefeller Foundation stated over the opening session of The First Global Symposium on Health Systems Research ( HSR ) which was held in Montreux , Switzerland , from 16 to 19 November 2010 . The event was hosted by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and its partners in order to scale up better health systems research . <p> Judith pointed out that the challenges of polio and yellow fever , which were faced in the last century have now been replaced by bigger challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating diseases . <p> Apart from this , many communities in developing countries are plagued by weak health systems which are insufficient to deliver life saving interventions to the poor and the ailing . <p> There is an urgent need to increase public awareness , to put more pressure on their own governments to spend for their social safety and health protection , said Rodin . In addition , citizens need to be empowered in order to demand simple access to appropriate health care services for all at an affordable cost . <p> As we are moving into the final stretch of Millennium Development Goals the Rockefeller Foundation aims to make ' transformation of health systems ' as its revolutionary goal . This would require sharing of experiences between partnerships of countries , finding sustainable solutions , improving human resources , and scaling up specific health services , alongside supporting the governments with technological training and tools , to become better stewards for improving the financing and quality and finances of their services . <p> " Universal Health Coverage would mean better health outcomes , greater equity and lower poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage is not so much about mobilizing more capital ( although it is necessary ) , but it is more about reorganizing health financing at country level . The key is shifting 50 to 80 percent of the total health spending to appropriate public and private risks pools , so that the resources can have a better impact on health interventions for the most vulnerable populations , " said Rodin . <p> As an example , Ghana spent approximately 150 million dollars in institutional reforms over the last 6 years . By a paradigm shift from the out of pocket model to the risk pools model , it has been able increase the population coverage from 5% of the population covered to approximately 75% coverage . <p> In India , in the state of Uttar Pradesh , they have invested more than 60 million dollars in 3 years on infrastructure and thus were able to scale up population coverage from 10% to 85% , including hospitalization and surgery . <p> " We believe that these successes will lead to other successes , only if international communities would learn from these achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , " she added . <p> Broadly speaking , it has to be a three pronged action plan : - Firstly we need more negotiations , more dependable data to guide theefforts of the countries . They need more research on mechanism that links universal health coverage with poverty and deprivation , with improved health outcomes . There is also need for more collaboration between researchers and policy makers so that proven solutions are put to work right away <p> Secondly we need to provide national governments with the technical and financial support that they need to transform their health systems . <p> Thirdly we need to make the case that health sector reforms for universal health coverage are sound financial investments and should be a priority for all national governments . <p> According to Judith , the Rockefeller Foundation , has been proud to support the great idea behind this conference in Montreux , the magnificent steps where the ideas , discussions , and relationships will be shared and will become the foundation for a movement to bring health care broadly , towards the common goal of universal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting on this imperative ; such as dedicated resources to support research on universal health coverage and establishing new centres for research and training on universal health coverage in Bangladesh and Vietnam and others . <p> The Rockefeller foundation has also supports nations to bring up national health reforms by convening cross border partnerships , by holding workshops for health , encouraging new developing countries to share the lessons that they have learnt in managing universal health coverage and set up a task force in universal health coverage , whose secretariat is based in Washington D.C. and Bangladesh . <p> At the end of the speech , Judith mentioned the song of Freddie Mercury , the lead singer of Queen , that he wrote in Montreux . <p> " It is about the place that is most quiet and magnificent -- a place filled with great possibilities . In his words , it 's a kind of magic in the air , with the dreams of the world in the palm of your hand . During your work in this conference , remember that you hold the world 's dreams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , we know how to start . So let 's begin here . " <p> And now let me pass

Present at this unprecedented gathering were innumerable devas and brahmas from ten thousand world systems who had come of their own accord without being invited , to pay obeisance to the Buddha and the five hundred Arahants . These Arahants gathered round the Buddha soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of the pleasant forest and entire universe overflowed with devas and brahmas eager to listen to what the Buddha would teach . The illustrious gathering of celestial beings was unparalleled . The Buddha occupied a central position emitting brilliant rays of six different colours , flanked by noble Arahants who had just cleansed themselves of all defilements . The Buddha , after observing with his divine eye the latent dispositions of the respective devas and brahmas , taught six different discourses suited to those present according to their respective mental disposition to enable them to gain awakening . <p> Of the six discourses , this Pur ? bheda Sutta was meant for individuals with very keen intellect . realising that no other individual had the aptitude to raise questions to satisfy the curiosity of those devas and brahmas , the Blessed One created an image of himself by his supernormal powers . Descending from the sky with radiance , this created image of the Buddha majestically took a seat before the real living Buddha , and began raising questions related to the six discourses . The first was the Samm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those devas and brahmas who were dominated by lust ( r ? ga ) . The last of the six was this Pur ? bheda Sutta . <p> It is so profound that men of ordinary intellect would find it difficult to explain . It will even be far more difficult to make it comprehensible with particular reference to the actual application and practice of meditation . Yet , the Venerable Mah ? s ? Say ? daw , with his penetrating wisdom and great compassion , explained this remarkable discourse , outlining a variety of methods with reference to the Commentaries and Subcommentaries . The discourse was couched in plain Burmese to enable the audience to easily understand the deeper aspects of the discourse . <p> The Pur ? bheda Sutta comprises fourteen verses of which only one is a question , while the remaining thirteen are replies . The object of the question is to find out what kind of morality and insight a person should possess to deserve being regarded as a wise and noble person with serenity of mind . The Buddha purposely made repeated utterances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . The fundamental point stressed therein is to strive for personal realisation of the Dhamma during one 's present life-time before death . The answers relating to the noble attributes of the Dhamma lay emphasis on the need to eradicate craving in as much as attachment to the pleasures of life can drag a person down to the lower realms . The noble qualities of peaceful sage are described fully with lucidity . It has also been made obvious that such an individual is an Arahant in whom all defilements have been extinguished . The method of severing the bonds of defilements has been effectively prescribed , and this method of practice is nothing but insight meditation . This would involve contemplation of the four foundations of mindfulness ( satipa ? ? h ? na ) . It has been clearly stated that this meditation exercise must be developed to ensure better prospects for future existences after one 's demise . It is also revealed that while living , an ordinary person will be beset with so many kinds of pitfalls in his life-time and with obsessions in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and improper behaviour , and that if these evils can not be rejected by contemplating and noting in his pursuit of worldly affairs or spiritual knowledge , he will remain unliberated from crushing misery and suffering in the present existence , and in the life hereafter . If vices become predominant by the inflammation of craving , it is most likely that he will descend to the lower realms . The best remedy therefore lies in practising insight meditation for one 's own salvation to attain the Noble Path . Different stages of achievement that can be reached up to knowledge of equanimity about formations ( sa ? kh ? rupekkh ? - ? ? a ) leading to nibb ? na has been elaborated by the author of this discourse . While emphasising the significance of insight meditation , the method of rejecting all kinds of vulgarity and remorse , verbally , mentally , and physically , has been lucidly explained . Clear exposition has been made that by contemplating and noting with good concentration after equipping oneself with purity of morality , one can achieve the highest state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discourse relating to the essential need to avoid all improper behaviour , to subdue anger , and to eschew self-conceit , which can hinder progress in the realisation of the noble Dhamma . <p> Furthermore , this Pur ? bheda Sutta has been clearly explained by the author , besprinkling it with relevant anecdotes , making it all the more effective and interesting . The Venerable Mah ? s ? Say ? daw with his genius has made us fully understand without skepticism the attributes of insight meditation . This is the only way to gain insight knowledge stage by stage bringing Arahantship within easy reach if there is faith , devotion , and diligence . Furthermore , the noble attributes of an Arahant are amply described . <p> The unprecedented nature and scope of this highly philosophical discourse , here expounded by the Venerable Mah ? s ? Say ? daw in simple language , which had once made its impact on a deeply appreciative audience to attain Arahantship in myriads on the spot , will , I am sure , likewise bring beneficial results to all meditators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daw emphasised the goal of nibb ? na as attainable in this very life existence . The proper practice of Buddha 's doctrine is clearly manifested to have involved a technique of living , which , while not worrying about the past , or the present or the future , would place upon the individual the art of living in sanctity until he has attained in this life the goal , nibb ? na . This way of living is essentially to practise insight meditation by developing constant mindfulness on the phenomenal occurrences of body and mind to the extent of gaining full awareness or perception of their true characteristics of impermanence , suffering and non-self , which will eventually lead to insight wisdom of varying degrees up to the attainment of Arahantship . By this ultimate attainment , defilements together with craving and wrong view which in fact bind a person from one existence to another , will be completely eradicated . One should therefore strive to accomplish this Dhamma . It is quite obvious that neither Buddha , nor anyone , prayer nor bribe , can help and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May you all be able to put forth effort to practise virtues unceasingly as a good person does , and follow a way of life that would end in the realisation of the goal , here and now . <h> A Discourse on the Pur ? bheda Sutta <p> Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahanto Samm ? sambuddhassa <h> Introduction to the Discourse <p> The teaching to be delivered today is on the last of a series of six discourses , taught by the Buddha at the gathering of a huge multitude of devas and brahmas , known as the Great Occasion ( Mah ? samaya ) . The essence of each different discourse is related to the natural inclinations and propensities of the respective deva or brahma . This is the Pur ? bheda Sutta ( Sn vv 854-867 ) . <p> ' Pur ? bheda ' is a compound of two words : ' bheda , ' which means ' annihilation ' or ' destruction ' , while ' pu r ? ' conveys the meaning of before , prior to , or foremost . Hence , ' Pur ? bheda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . ' The discourse has therefore been given the name of ' Pur ? bheda ' for being related to or in reference to the things that one should accomplish and would surely come across before his final death or utter destruction of his life . <p> The essence of what is contained in the Discourse will be clearly revealed in the course of my lecture explaining the basic facts of the Dhamma . In delivering this Discourse , as in the case of the Samm ? paribb ? janiya Sutta , the created image of the Buddha raised the following question as desired , for the benefit of those who were very learned with keen intellect , having a natural aptitude and inclination to acquire profound knowledge . <h> Verse One : The Replica Buddha 's Question <p> " Addressing the Buddha who belonged to the noble lineage of the Gotama clan , the question that we ask is what kind of insight and moral conduct should a person possess to be worthy of being called a sage ( upasanta ) ? Please tell us who is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put by the created image of the Buddha to the real Buddha . These two Buddhas , the created image and the Buddha himself had a dialogue , the one putting questions while the other giving answers . There was only one question as stated in the above P ? ? i verse , whereas the answers comprised thirteen verses . I will amplify in full only a few verses since an elaborated statement would probably be considered as mere repetition by some of the audience . In fact , there are only a very few unique features in each verse -- there are many which have similarity in meaning . I will therefore deal with only a few verses comprehensively . <h> Listening to a Discourse to Gain Peace of Mind <p> The primary object of the question is to find out what kind of conduct and what sort of insight a person should possess to be regarded as a distinctive individual endowed with serenity . In so far as this Dhamma is concerned , serenity or peace of mind refers to freedom and liberation from every aspect of suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lecture who are meditating , aim at achieving that kind of peace and calm . All meditation practices in the realm of this Buddha 's dispensation seek to realise real peace and happiness . Other religions outside the domain of the Buddha 's teaching likewise expect to gain such kind of peace . In their own way they all strive wishing to achieve that objective . The only difference between the two concepts lies in the kind of peace derived as to whether it is genuine or not . <p> There is no reason to doubt that in this universe every individual wants to enjoy peace and happiness . Nowadays , peace initiatives advanced by countries all over the world are intended to bring about World Peace with the sole object of finding a way for the defence of peace in the interests of all mankind . The main intention , however , is to avoid conflicts between nations and catastrophic consequences . This aim and object does not embrace a wider scope . The peace envisaged in this Dhamma is ultimate peace that would eradicate all troubles , tribulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in extinguishing all kinds of sufferings and worries , thereby bringing eternal peace and happiness . One who finds such noble peace and calm is called a sage . This means a person who has a tranquil state of mind . Such a person must be learned , wise , and noble and must have adequate worldly experience and knowledge . <p> The created image of the Buddha asked the Blessed One as to what kind of knowledge and worldly experience and good conduct such a peace-minded man should competently and sufficiently possess . I will recite the following motto for you to memorize easily . " What knowledge and what conduct , if acquired , would deserve to be called peace a sage ? " <p> The thirteen verses taught by the Blessed One in response to the query made by the Replica Buddha disclosed the noble attributes of a sage . Some of the words in the answers convey almost the same sense . To make the teachings understood by different kinds of devas and brahmas with different outlook and idiosyncrasies peculiar to the celestial realm to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways . Among such an audience who were present at the Great Occasion , there were some who could not grasp the essence of the teachings if rendered ordinarily by the Buddha . This is why different versions of teachings conveying the same underlying meaning were repeated . <h> Repeated to Make Everyone Understand <p> Likewise , I have to repeat teachings in a variety of ways although they carry the same sense to enable the audience to gain fuller appreciation . At the Great Occasion innumerable devas and brahmas from different celestial realms were present . Even in the human world different dialects spoken in a variety of languages are involved . Likewise , colloquial expressions with different shades of meaning could be in use among different celestial beings . <h> Verse Two : The Buddha 's Answer <p> The meaning conveyed by the above verse is : " Venerable sir ! I would say that a person who is not obsessed by craving , or in other words , who is free from clinging desires is a sage . " <p> Before one meets with death , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who gets rid of craving is said to be a sage , having been imbued with peace of mind . It means that one should be able to equip himself with the Dhamma emancipated from the bonds of attachment , i.e. free from the taint of craving . It is vital to remain unblemished by craving . Those who possess morality and sound intelligence , naturally have the ability to judge properly . This discourse was taught purposely for such learned people . This initial single expression itself stands out in conveying a profound meaning for the wise . There are different kinds of religious doctrines that earn reverence in this world . In most of these religions , reference is made to what will happen after death , such as the destiny that will befall a person after death . However , no one can verify what really happens to a person after death . <p> The fundamental point is to gain personal realisation of the Dhamma before death comes . One can rest assured if one could achieve the Dhamma that ought to be practised , and reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be satisfied and find contentment only if they could clearly realise the truth of the Dhamma before death occurs . Only that would give them positive assurance for the future . <h> Noble Attributes of the Dhamma <p> Some intelligent laymen , brahmins , and wise ascetics asked the Blessed One : " Venerable sir ! Frequent utterances are made saying that this Dhamma can be achieved right now . To what extent should a person possess the noble qualities to be able to claim that he has personally gained immediate results ? " The Buddha extolled his own Dhamma as : " It is a Dhamma that can be experienced personally in this present life-time through practice leading to personal insight ( sandi ? ? hiko ) . It bestows benefits without delay ( ak ? liko ) . It invites investigation as : ' Come and see for yourself ' ( ehipassiko ) . It is worthy of practising and conducive to perfect realisation by oneself ( op ? neyyiko ) . It can benefit and be experienced by each and every person ( paccatta ? veditabbo vi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these noble qualities . The Buddha answered the wise interrogators to their entire satisfaction . However , these questions and answers are not from this Pur ? bheda Sutta . I have clarified by drawing references from other discourses to make the meaning clearer and more convincing since they are relevant to the statement that craving should be dispelled before death . <h> The Way to Gain Immediate Benefits <p> The Buddha 's answer to the question on the Dhamma being realisable here and now was : " Brahmin ! You should reflect thus : a person who is overwhelmed and oppressed by lust and passion , may do things that are detrimental to himself and others , being incited by passion . He or she is capable of committing immoral deeds , by actions , speech , or thought . On the other hand , if one is free from lust , one will abstain from doing any such evil deeds . Hence , is it not true that freedom from lust and abstention from unwholesome acts are benefits to be actually realised in this present life-time ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buddha to let the questioners reflect and consider the immediate beneficial results of being able to expel lust and avoid evil deeds . This enabled the questioners to understand clearly . Of course , not all of them were able to dispel lust completely . There were some who just perceived the significance of the answer given in the form of a counter-question . The gist of it is urging them to practise meditation to get free from lust and passion . It is essential to get free from lust in the present life-time , for as long as lust has a firm grip , one is liable to commit evil deeds that are detrimental to oneself and to others . <p> Such malicious actions or evil deeds might also be done out of spite or anger , blinded by delusion . Lust is one of the contributory factors that stir up a person to commit evil deeds . It is because they are gripped by lust , being obsessed by their own happiness at the expense of others , that they tend to do evil wilfully and without shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery , and other harmful and foolish offences are committed . Commission of such evil deeds is mainly attributable to the presence of lust . Other evil deeds are committed due to pride or conceit ( m ? na ) . Some do evil , make mistakes , and utter obscene words impelled by egoism . Wrong view ( di ? ? hi ) is a belief which is erroneously considered as true . Depending on such wrong views , evil deeds are likely to be done . Sometimes , harm may be inflicted upon those holding different beliefs . Leaving aside religious beliefs , in the world , hot controversies often arise in political affairs among bigoted persons . Such incidents occur due to greed , hatred , delusion , pride , and wrong views . <p> Dogmatic and irrational views cause animosity and violence , which harm the interests of both the wrong-doers and their victims . We see these effects in the present day . The ill-effects will be even greater in the next existence . With the extinction of lust and the complete eradication of delusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no opportunity to occur . No harmful acts will be done to others . To get rid of these abominable feelings of lust , anger , ego , etc. , there is a method of practice . If this method is adhered to and practised in the right way , you will realise the truth personally . This truth of the Dhamma is realisable here and now . <p> When the Buddha replied those who asked the question became convinced and enlightened . Nobody can say with certainty what the destiny of a being will be after death . That is why the Buddha taught this Dhamma that could be personally realised in the present life-time . Before death , that is , before the destruction of these aggregates of attachment , craving is utterly destroyed . In other words , craving should be completely expelled before death . What the Buddha taught is that a person who is totally liberated from craving should be called a person endowed with serenity of mind -- a sage . <h> How to Eradicate Craving Before Death <p> The method to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of conduct and moral training there are three aspects : morality , concentration , and wisdom . It is essential to observe precepts , to practise ecstatic concentration , and to gain insight knowledge . Morality , or living according to precepts , will dispel the gross form of active defilements ( vitikkama-kiles ? ) , passionate cravings , both physical and verbal , which exceed the limits of moral restraint . Concentration expels wild imaginings that arise in a person 's mind . Wisdom expels latent defilements ( anusaya kiles ? ) , which may give rise to defilements when circumstances are favourable . <p> Sensual craving is of six kinds : craving for beautiful visual objects , melodious sounds or a sweet voices , fragrant odours , delicious tastes , soft touches , and refined ideas . If elaborated , the kinds of craving would be innumerable . Just try to imagine how many delightful sensations may occur at the sight of a single visual object . There is a multitude of different aspects . Attachment and craving not only occur in connection with one 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find others , such as family members and friends , as beautiful and smart . You want to possess pretty and dainty clothes of fine texture and other luxury goods . You may dream of nice things that you wish to own . If these have come into your possession , you will again continue to have pleasurable attachment to them . You like to choose different colours and designs of garments pleasing to your eye for your dress , foot-wear , umbrellas , motor-cars , etc . Everything that affords satisfaction will attract craving . In regard to beautiful sights and scenes , pleasant tunes and sweet voices , fragrant odours , tasty food , and tender touches , these would stimulate delightful sensations . Such sensations are too many to enumerate . In the case of fantasies and day-dreams that may find a place in your heart , enjoyable feelings might arise in longing to have them . This is craving for mental objects . All those cravings , which are likely to occur through the six sense-doors , and bring pleasurable sensations , must be extinguished . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilance by full accomplishment of morality , which will eliminate the extreme forms of physical and verbal intrusions . <h> How to Expel Defilements by Morality <p> A person who does not respect and observe the rules of morality , may cheat , steal , or even commit murder to get something that seems highly attractive . If such an evil deed is committed , it would amount to a breach of morality . Then it means that craving arose and went beyond the bounds of morality . One who respects morality and keeps it intact will not give way to craving , and so will abstain from cheating , stealing , or killing . By so doing , he or she is free from the craving which could have urged him or her to resort to an evil deed . This shows how extreme forms of craving could be expelled . <p> As for monks , there are many things that they ought not to do or say , though they may wish to . Mental perversion should also be kept in check . Self-restraint or avoidance of perverse thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permissible for a monk to ask for a thing from a lay person with the motive to make him offer it . Restraint should be exercised even though a monk may be eager to obtain some property . No attempt should be made directly or indirectly to ask for anything . Inducing others to offer donations is prohibited . If such inducement or insinuation is made , irrespective of whether a thing or property is received or not , the purity of morality is deemed to have been broken according to the rules of monastic discipline . If morality is properly protected and kept pure , it would amount to remaining free from craving that goes beyond the bounds by virtue of moral restraint . <p> In brief , observance of these moral principles by way of refraining from committing evils either physically or verbally , the least that must be done in this Buddha 's dispensation is to eliminate the gross forms of craving that lead to moral transgressions ( vitikkama kiles ? ) . <h> How to Expel Defilements by Concentration <p> However , the subjugation of craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the development of concentration through tranquility meditation ( samatha ) . Fixed concentration on the meditation device ( kasi ? a ) , a process inducing jh ? na with constant mindfulness is samatha-bh ? van ? . By being mindful with fixed concentration , the mind is riveted on a single object . If the mind sometimes wanders , it should be recalled and put back on the object of contemplation . Therefore , during tranquility meditation , pleasurable attachment to sensations on sights , sounds , etc. , that may arise by wishful thinking , will cease to occur . This is how nascent craving is expelled by developing concentration . <h> How to Eradicate Defilements by Wisdom <p> Concentration can only dispel craving during meditation . Once meditation is over or loses is momentum , craving will infiltrate and overcome concentration . To root out craving , insight meditation must be practised to develop wisdom . This simply means meditation to gain insight knowledge . Accordingly , contemplation with mindfulness must be made at every moment of seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bending , stretching , or moving . In brief , all phenomena arising at the six sense-doors must be contemplated . If this is done , what is seen , heard , or cognised will not being regarded as delightful or pleasurable , and so no passionate desire will have the chance to occur . <p> An ordinary worldling who fails to contemplate and note , will find pleasure in everything good and agreeable that is seen , heard , or cognised , giving rise to craving . If disagreeable things are encountered , craving will arise for agreeable sense-objects . However , a meditator who constantly contemplates every phenomenon arising at the moment of seeing , hearing , or knowing , will ( if insight is developed to the stage of knowledge of dissolution ) no longer think of the phenomena as being agreeable or disagreeable , but will become aware of them as being impermanent , having truly realised the phenomenal arising and dissolution of things . Moreover , because of the natural characteristics of impermanence , the meditator will realise them as unsatisfactory . Having appreciated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognised , no pleasurable sensation associated with craving will occur . In respect of every sense-object contemplated , no craving will arise , and so the mind remains at peace . This is how latent craving is removed . <h> Two Kinds of Latent Defilements <p> ? ramma ? ? nusaya means the passionate desire that can occur with retrospective reflection on the objects of sense that have escaped the attention of contemplation by means of insight . A meditator whose insight knowledge has matured to the stage of dissolution , will not miss a single phenomenon that occurs at every moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing . All mental and physical phenomena that appear will be found to vanish and dissolve immediately whenever they are contemplated . Thus the meditator will realise these phenomena as impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . Having realised them as such , the phenomenal nature of all such happenings will be reflected upon and perceived in the light of their true characteristics thereby preventing craving from arising . This explains the eradication of the subtle form of craving latent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nusaya means the passionate desire that can occur in an ordinary person under suitable circumstances , and which has not yet been dispelled by the Noble Path . These latent defilements can only be eradicated by the Noble Path . The manner of removal is that while in the process of contemplating on the continual dissolution of mind and matter , the arising and passing away of mental formations is realised through the achievement of the path of Stream-winning . When nibb ? na is reached all latent defilements are found to have been exterminated by mature insight . A Stream-winner is totally free from the latent defilements of personality-view ( sakk ? yadi ? ? hi ) , and doubt ( vicikiccha ) . Whether practising insight meditation or not , no false view or doubt about the Dhamma can possibly occur connected with any kind of sense-object . Nevertheless , a Stream-winner is not yet free from passionate desires . However , powerful and unruly passionate desires , which can drag down an ordinary worldling to the lower realms , will not arise in a Stream-winner . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying , etc. , which could relegate a person to the lower realms . An ordinary worldling could do these misdeeds , either because of attachment to property , to family members , or to his or her own life . In connection with this fact , there are many instances in the P ? ? i texts . Among these , the most interesting example relates to the personal guarantee or affirmation made by the Commander-in-Chief of the army , General S ? ha , who was a Stream-winner . <h> The Guarantee Given by General S ? ha <p> The gist of the above P ? ? i phrase is : " Having regard for life , we will never intentionally take the life of another living being in self-defence to protect our own life from imminent danger of death . " <p> This is not just a fanciful statement . It is a guarantee by General S ? ha , a Stream-winner , of his own mental attitude . In that statement the word ' j ? vitahetupi ' should be given particular attention . Some may hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remain , could commit an act of killing in self-defence or in anger , when faced with an enemy who is going to harm him or her to the extent of causing death . General S ? ha 's statement is that even to save his own life , he could not possibly kill another . This statement accords fully with the Buddha 's teaching . It should be remembered that though a Stream-winner is not totally free from craving , he or she is free of the strong craving that could lead to rebirth in the lower realms for having committed such acts of killing , stealing , etc . <p> An ordinary person who has not rejected even a fraction of craving , will no doubt commit evils as urged by violent passions , which can cause rebirth in the lower realms after death . Neither will he or she avoid doing unwholesome acts such as stealing other 's property . This reveals the unabated strength of craving . There are some ordinary people who dare not commit evil deeds . They have sincere devotion due to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is not guaranteed . If falling into bad company and repeatedly hearing evil or profane talks , an ordinary person might deviate from the right path either in this present life-time or in future existences . A Stream-winner is not like this . Passionate desires invoking attachment have become weak , and so he or she can not even think of doing unwholesome actions that will lead to the lower realms , neither in the present or in future existences . This is indicative of the liberation or disengagement of craving . <p> On the attainment of Once-returning one will be free from the strong forms of craving , ill-will , and anger . When reaching the stage of Non-returning , the passionate desire and ill-will are totally eradicated . As such , a Non-returner becomes tranquil in the matter of sexual desire . Despite this achievement , as feelings of delight and pleasure in respect of existence remain , a Non-returner is not totally free from suffering . The desire for existence will be eliminated only after one has reached Arahantship . Then only , all other defilements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of sanctity can be realised in this very life existence . A noble person possessing such attributes and devoid of craving is called a sage , one who has attained tranquility of mind according to the teaching of the Buddha . Such an Arahant , after parinibb ? na , will not be reborn again since the aggregates of mind and matter have become extinct . No new existence will come into being and with the absolute extinction of becoming eternal peace will be gained . Such a blissful stage is called " cessation without remainder ( anup ? disesanibb ? na ) . " A sage who is freed from craving before death remains in a blissful state known as " cessation with remainder ( sa-up ? disesanibb ? na ) , " which means annihilation of everything except the five aggregates . <h> How Calm and Blissful Is It ? <p> The meaning is that an Arahant who is totally devoid of craving , still possesses the five aggregates , which continue to undergo the process of arising and dissolution . For this reason , he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , odour , etc . In particular , he or she is still subject to bodily suffering caused by heat and cold . Owing to the indisposition and transient nature of the bodily elements , the body has to suffer ailments such as stiffness , pains , and aches . An Arahant may also fall sick . However , there is a complete absence of miserable mental feelings even if an Arahant has to endure excruciating pain . This is the extraordinary characteristic of an Arahant , who is mentally unperturbed and at peace , the mind being calm , unaffected , and purified . It is the sobering and unflinching effect of feeling extremely better and tranquil . <p> Those Stream-winners and Once-returners who have not yet escaped from the fetter of craving will have two kinds of suffering : disagreeable sensations while in physical pain or discomfort , and unhappiness when reflecting on misery endured . It is like getting a thorn stuck in the hand or the foot , then taking out the thorn with a needle . Pain will be felt in two ways , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the flesh and the pain that is felt when extracting the thorn with the needle . Likewise , an ordinary worldling will suffer two kinds of misery : one from disagreeable sensations and the mental distress caused by having a sensitive mind . <p> As for an Arahant , he seldom meets disagreeable sensations . If disagreeable sensations do occur , there will be no consequential unhappiness . The mind remains serene and pure . Apart from that , all defilements such as anger , delusion , conceit , pride , etc. , have been removed . Therefore , the Arahant is neither irritated nor excited by any form of feeling no matter how unpleasant or pleasant it may be . That is why , when an Arahant attains parinibb ? na , the mental and physical aggregates will not arise again . It is eternal peace . Such a person is , therefore , said to be a sage . As stated earlier , a sage is freed from craving before death . He or she holds no attachment to the present , and neither longs for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free from craving . <p> Let us recite this motto : <p> " Whoever eradicates craving before death , neither relying on the past nor longing for the future , avoiding the two extremes by being mindful of the present , is called a sage . " <p> If that is so , the question may arise as to why the teaching is repeated as " pubbamanta manissito , " etc . In brief , due to not being understood yet by the devas and brahmas , repeated utterance was made to amplify the teaching . This has been referred to in the beginning of this lecture . In the part that follows too , teachings are repeated in the same way . <h> How to Eradicate Craving <p> How to eradicate craving before death is explained as " pubba-manta-manissito , " etc . That means practice to escape from clinging to the past , and abandon all hope for the future . In the present , practice to avoid enlistment . This statement is not easy to comprehend either . However , as mentioned at the beginning , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect . These intelligent individuals were able to understand the teachings , though persons of mediocre intellect might not comprehend . Since it is meant for the learned , it is necessary to mention a few things that need reflection . As such , from the very outset , it has been taught in this discourse that craving must be eradicated before death . <p> This is interesting for intelligent people . In practising religion , only if its benefit could be derived before death , can one rest assured . It is uncertain what will happen after the present life has ended . For instance , when suffering from a disease , only if it could be cured will it be worth taking treatment . If it could be cured in the next life , no one will be inclined to take treatment . The quicker the recovery , the better . In the same way , if peace of mind can be acquired in the present life-time , it will be extremely satisfactory . Only if one practices serious ly , can one attain Arahantship in this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be called a sage . Therefore , in the ninth verse given in reply , it states : " Ta ? br ? mi upasantoti , " which means : a person totally liberated from craving is called a man of serenity . In the last verse too , it has been taught as : " sa ve santoti vuccati . " All qualities mentioned in the previous verses shall be ended with either one of the aforesaid two phrases . Hence , a person who is devoid or entirely freed of craving is said to be a sage . The method of practice embracing morality , concentration , and wisdom , has already been described fully . However , a few points deserve mention on how serenity occurs without the slightest tinge of craving at the moment of insight contemplation . <p> Insight means constant contemplation of all phenomena arising at the six sense-doors at every moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and cognising . It is done to get rid of craving . In respect of every sense-object contemplated , defilements cease to occur momentarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation becomes , the more craving can be mopped up . When contemplation is prolonged , defilements will be greatly reduced . Vehement and coarse defilements will be minimized . At times , serenity of mind will be achieved to the extent that one might think the coarse defilements will never arise again as before . This serenity is only a momentary achievement while contemplation is going on . Some people have a wrong notion that this peaceful state of mind is indicative of the complete cessation of defilements . However , until and unless the Noble Path is attained , the serenity achieved is not stable yet . After a considerable lapse of time , say , a number of days after insight practice has stopped , coarse defilements will gradually reappear . Serenity is realised while contemplation is being done . This serenity is the benefit gained before one 's own death . <p> It is more obvious to those whose concentration is strong . Pleasurable sensations that may arise will vanish without recurrence after contemplating and noting them once or twice only . Craving will be found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delightful sensations will subside without being able to manifest . Although the pleasurable sense-objects are noticed , since contemplating and noting are vigorous , they will be vanishing so fast that they will not even be thought of as pleasurable . Hence , serenity of mind prevails without pleasurable attachment . This is the way that craving is removed while contemplation is proceeding . It is the benefit realised before death comes . As contemplating and noting continue to accelerate , the Noble Path is reached by virtue of insight knowledge , which becomes mature with full accomplishment . All craving that can cause one to land in the lower realms will then be extinguished followed by personal realisation of real peace . This is also evidence of how freedom from craving is experienced prior to death . All passionate desires and pleasurable attachments will be completely eliminated when Arahantship is attained . This is , in fact , the clearing away of craving , human passions , before demise . <h> Immediate Personal Realisation <p> Craving , lust , and attachment cease altogether in an Arahant , then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ( sandi ? ? hiko ) , and without delay ( ak ? liko ) . To put it another way , this Dhamma can be achieved in no time . Moreover , as the benefits can be reaped immediately , it warrants urging and inviting others to come and see ( ehipassiko ) . After extending an invitation to others , if no beneficial results are derived at once by them despite their practice of the Dhamma , it would be unsatisfactory . Satisfaction will be obtained only if the benefits are gained more or less immediately or without undue delay . If satisfaction is obtained , thanks will be showered upon the person who urges or encourages others to do the practice . <p> An analogy may be given . If a sick man was advised to take medical treatment failed to recover immediately , he may lose confidence in the physician . Only if he recovered overnight after taking medicine , will he have confidence in the medicine prescribed , the physician , and the person who earnestly offered advice . Similarly , the Buddha 's Dhamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see " and " Try the practice for yourself . " If practice is performed with diligence as urged , one will be liberated from craving in this present life . Certainly , if the truth of Dhamma is realised , one who practices meditation will be grateful to the one who urged him to practise the Dhamma as prescribed by the Blessed One . <p> Let the Dhamma , which is worthy of practising ( op ? neyyiko ) , permeate your mind . Let it pervade the whole body and remain absorbed just like taking medicine orally or as an injection to cure a disease or to rejuvenate one 's strength . It is a Dhamma deserving of practice to spread it within yourself . If the Dhamma could be retained in oneself by practising it , pleasant or odious sensations can be resisted . The disease of defilements can be completely cured . How ? When encountering a sensation that may arouse defilements , it should be rejected by contemplating and noting it , as it arises . If it is noted and contemplated , the sensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , no craving will occur at all , and anger will cease too . If craving or anger do occur , they will disappear at once if contemplated and noted with constant mindfulness . This vanishing will become even more conspicuous when unhappiness occurs . If a person who practises can not as yet dispel such miserable feelings of distress by contemplating and noting , then it may be considered as unsatisfactory . If so , it should be noted that one is not yet accomplished in the Dhamma . <h> Courage Is Tested When Faced with Danger <p> Under ordinary circumstances , a person 's true calibre can not be judged , though he might have been extolled as a brave person with great ability . It is only when faced with danger that a person 's true courage can be known ( ? pad ? su th ? mo veditabbo ) . An accurate assessment of courage and ability can only be made if someone can tolerate severely adverse conditions , and make decisions that run counter to personal interest in a perilous situation . However much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their true colours . Only when confronted with real danger and put into a tight corner that calls for decisive combat and true valour , if he is found fighting against his foe valiantly at the risk of his life , then it can be said that he is a tough and courageous man . Likewise , in matters concerning the Dhamma , one may be said to be highly accomplished and noble , but unless he faces adverse conditions , he can not be vouched for as truly noble and knowledgeable . Only if he can tolerate and exercise self-restraint in subduing passionate desires , which when they occur , or in suppressing his anger to the point of near obliteration , or when sorrowful sensations that might arise do not manifest , he is praiseworthy . According to the quality of the Dhamma that is achieved , the more tolerance and forbearance he will show , no matter from which sense-door unpleasant and harmful sensations might appear . This Dhamma therefore needs to be practised with all one 's might to let it permeate one 's whole body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhamma can be realised by oneself by practising it ( paccatta ? veditabbo ) . It is solely dependent upon one 's own effort and can not be achieved indirectly . The Dhamma that has been gained by one 's own personal perseverance can not be given or shared with another . The teacher can not bestow the Dhamma he has in him upon his disciple . Parents can not hand it down to their children . Neither can children give it to their parents , nor can close friends share it with each other . <h> One Only Gets Satiated If One Eats <p> In this world , during one 's life-time , only by doing the work that needs to be done , will one 's objective be achieved . Even in taking meals , only if one eats , will one be satiated . If another person eats one will not be satiated . Likewise , one should sleep for one 's own recuperation . A good sleep can not be hired . Any kind of phenomenon that occurs in one 's self can not be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice , no one but oneself will gain accomplishment in the Dhamma . The Dhamma can be fully appreciated individually and separately by those who practise . To make the meaning of this sandi ? ? hika aspect of Dhamma , more distinct , the Buddha taught in this Pur ? bheda Sutta that before the destruction of the aggregates , craving should be eradicated . The phrases that followed the first were statements of explanation in detail , that is why there is similarity in their meanings . Let me continue by explaining the subsequent phrases . <h> Do Not Rely on the Past <p> No reliance should be placed on the former existences ( pubbamanta ? ) , if said in terms of existences . However , it is rare for humans to recall past existences . There are only a few who are said to remember their former existences . As the majority of human beings are unable to do this , the expression should be taken to mean " earlier , " that is all preceding years , months , days , hours , minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what has been seen , heard , sensed , or known are all recollections of the past . Even the words just spoken and heard already belong to the past . What is being spoken or heard at this very moment constitutes the present . What is going to be said or heard may be regarded as the future . In this case , what has been seen , heard , sensed , or known previously are what is meant by " former existences . " It was stated that these should not be relied upon . <h> Relying on Craving and Wrong View <p> Relying on means nothing but craving and wrong view . I have given lectures about craving and wrong view so often that the subject has become somewhat stale for our benefactors . However , I have to repeat it here or there will be a gap in my teaching . In all the Buddha 's teachings , whenever the expression " relying on " is used , it refers to craving and wrong view . Only with reference to these two , either relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taught . This is true . When a pleasurable sensation occurs in respect of a sense-object , it amounts to relying on the sensation . Because of wrong view , if craving or grasping is occurring , it is relying on the sensation that arises , without letting go of it . If there is attachment to past events , it is said to be relying on with craving . For instance , if one sits against a wall , it may be said to be relying on the wall . One is leaning against the wall , which lends its support . If sitting against a column , the column is relied upon as a support . If sitting on the floor , it amounts to relying on the floor . Likewise , craving , by reflecting repeatedly on the past sensations that had been perceived , it relies on them with pleasure . Various kinds of sense-objects that have been seen , heard , smelt , tasted , or touched in the past , are often reflected upon with pleasure . Such reminiscence constitutes acts of reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensations that have arisen in retrospect relating to events of the former existence should be regarded as reliance made with craving . Those who remember their former existences are few . <p> However , since this discourse was delivered at the Great Occasion , the devas and brahmas who were present could probably remember the events that happened in their former existences . If pleasurable sensations are felt by reflecting on the events that had occurred in the former existences , it must be interpreted as being relied upon with craving . As far as human beings are concerned , it is hard to remember past events from one 's childhood , let alone from former existences . The key point is that events occurring in the past could be reflected upon from the time of becoming adults . There are past events relating to food taken with relish , or joy and happiness found , or activities done in the company of friends , etc. , to which pleasurable sensations have become attached . Sometimes , such events might come into one 's head spontaneously without making any special effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means relying on the past . Such a state of mind should not be allowed to occur . As taught before , if craving is eliminated , it can no longer be relied upon . Therefore , the phrase stating that no reliance should be made on the past appears to be redundant . Nevertheless , the first phrase wherein mention has been made as " free from craving , " is the summarised statement . Teaching was done to elaborate that no reliance should be made on the past , and it was meant for those people who could not yet understand with just a brief statement . <p> This is important for those who are currently engaged in meditation . While meditating , if one reflects on past events with pleasurable feelings , it would amount to relying on the past . No such reminiscence should be allowed to occur . If such feelings do appear , they should be abandoned by contemplating and noting them . If imagination occurs by reflecting on what has been seen , heard , or tasted with enjoyment before , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past should be contemplated and noted the moment they creep into one 's mind . If this is done , reminiscence , which is likely to attract pleasurable attachment , will not occur . One will then be completely free from relying on the past . <p> With regard to this , it includes all kinds of recent events . It may be things that took place on the previous day , in the morning or afternoon , or events that have only just been heard , sensed , or known . Recent events are more conspicuous . Things that happened just a few seconds ago , or in the morning or afternoon might appear in the mind 's eye without reflection . They appear spontaneously , so more care should be taken regarding recent events . All such sensations should be abandoned by contemplating and noting at every moment of their arising . This is how reliance on with craving is abandoned . Relying on with wrong view is similar . What has been seen , heard , touched , or known is wrongly assumed as " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflected on as a person , a human being , an animal , etc . Since the manner of this reflection is as a person or being , it may be said that reliance has been made on wrong view . This is retrospection with personality-view and self-view . If such thoughts arise , they must be contemplated and noted , and thus abandoned . Therefore , the motto was said : " He who eradicates craving before death neither relying on the past , etc . " <p> The expression " neither relying on the past " refers to the events that had happened in the past . A pleasurable sensation with craving should not be allowed to occur by reflecting on past events . If such a sensation or thought arises , it should be abandoned by contemplating and noting . This method is extremely subtle . If noting is done through mindfulness on the consciousness that arises , it will be found to be disappearing . This state of mind or mental activity was absent before . It occurs at this very moment and vanishes at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there any living being . It will be vividly known as a natural phenomenon arising and passing away . Having realised the truth , craving for the pleasurable sensation can not arise . Nor will wrong view appear with the idea that it is a living being or a person . Therefore , this method of contemplation and noting is very effective in abandoning the craving and wrong view that occur by relying on the past . All imaginations that may arise relating to past events should be dispelled by contemplating and noting in the way stated . If rejection is done by contemplating and noting with mindfulness , it will eventually lead to the attainment of Arahantship . On reaching that stage , craving and wrong view , which are prone to rely upon the past , will be uprooted . This is why practice should be done from the very beginning by an ordinary person to get rid of craving and wrong view completely . Without practising in this way , craving and wrong view could never be abandoned . If one takes up the practice as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has developed insight knowledge in the course of meditation . When one reaches this status , coarse craving that could lead to the lower realms will be removed . <p> If a Stream-winner continues to meditate , he or she will become a Once-returner . Further practice will bring progressive insight and one will become a Non-returner . On reaching that stage , all desires connected with sensual pleasures will be extinct . If a Non-returner proceeds with contemplation , he or she will become an Arahant , whereby all defilements will be eradicated . Of course , wrong view has been expelled since the time of Stream-winning . However , Stream-winners , Once-returners , and Non-returners still have pride or conceit ( m ? na ) . This conceit , though devoid of attachment to the existence of a self , it resembles wrong view . Pride may cause one to think of virtues as one 's own . It is because of the presence of wrong view working as an agent , it is called self-pride ( asmim ? na ) or pride of views ( di ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path attained by insight will abandon wrong view . However , on reaching Arahantship , all clinging , wrong view , and pride will be completely eradicated . It was with the intention of eradicating all leaning or grasping that may appear in connection with the past that it was taught that the past is one extreme that should not be relied upon . <h> Abandon All Hope for the Future <p> Let me explain how to restrain oneself from looking forward to the future , having mentioned about non-reliance on the past , according to the motto . This was contained in the teachings as the fourth stanza of the verse , which runs as " Tassa natthi purakkhata ? . " It means , a person who does not hold any expectations for the future . For example , one who intends to travel by train will have to arrange to get to the railway station , and reserve a seat for a comfortable ride on the train to reach a certain destination , without any hitch . This is planning and making arrangements in so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dhamma . All beings are mere travellers journeying without a pause in the cycles of existence . They are therefore looking forward to what might happen to them in their next existences , hoping to find things according to their desires . They yearn for a better life , aspiring to gain greater power and prosperity in the next existence in the human world . They wish to be born into an aristocratic family , or a wealthy family of higher social status . Moreover , they wish to be born with handsome looks , fair complexion , and hope for a luxurious life in the company of followers and attendants . If they were to be born in the celestial realms , they hope to become powerful devas . In the present existence too , they want to be free from all dangers , and to become opulent among a high class society of friends and relatives . These are longings for the future . It is just looking forward , and hence in the motto , it has been stated as : " nor looking forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to and yearn for the future . If you happen to imagine so , you should contemplate , note it , and then abandon it . <p> This advice is intended for those who are practising meditation and not for those who are preoccupied with their daily chores at home . As regards people who have to perform their domestic duties and are fully preoccupied , not having time to meditate , it is impossible to take up the practice and to contemplate and note . Therefore , the method of practising contemplation on the right lines is only important for those who are meditating . If and when practical exercise in meditation is made , say , for an hour or so , or both day and night continuously , it will be the meditator 's duty to contemplate and note with diligence . Hence , if any thought or imagination occurs relating to matters concerning the future , it must be noted . There are so many things to be contemplated and noted . If what is going to happen in the future is reflected upon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present life-time , one is likely to think and yearn for what one wishes to acquire or to be done according to his own will or desire . Sometimes , one may be imagining and longing for happiness in the world of human beings or devas by virtue of morality which one has gained . These arising thoughts and imaginations should be contemplated , noted , and then abandoned , Also , one may be planning to promote the practice of meditation . That of course , is a virtuous thought . However , if one dwells on it for a significant period , it will interfere with the practice of meditation . If this happens , knowledge through concentration will fail to occur . Then the progress of insight will be deterred . So even virtuous thoughts should be abandoned by contemplating and noting them . If one intends to develop deep concentration , contemplation and noting will be hindered . As such , this type of imagination must always be abandoned by proper contemplation and noting . <p> If all such thoughts , ideas and longings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to the attainment of the Noble Path . On the achievement of Arahantship such thoughtful imaginations will be totally eradicated . For this reason an Arahant , having got rid of all craving , will have no new existence of mental and physical aggregates after death thereby gaining eternal peace . Ordinary people and trainees on the path , having had craving , will cling to one of the sensations appearing as kamma , signs of kamma , and signs of destiny visualized on the verge of death . Then the mind being fixed on that particular sensation , the decease-consciousness , sometimes called relinking-consciousness , hangs on to it leading to rebirth , That is how they will be reborn in another existence with a new set of aggregates . Rebirth and a new existence opens the door to misery such as old age , disease , and death . Therefore , to be able to avoid such misery , do not reflect on past events or long for anything to take place in the future . These thoughts should be abandoned after contemplating and noting . <h> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made between the two extremes , that is , do not permit oneself to reach a situation whereby enlistment could occur in the present existence . This means to avoid being regarded as a person indulging in sensual pleasures or debauchery . Avoid being regarded as a person full of anger and spite . Give no chance to be regarded as a deluded , egoistic , or arrogant person ; nor as a faithless sceptic , nor as an immoral person full of licentious desires . Do n't become one heading for the lower realms of animals or hungry ghosts ; nor even one who will be reborn a human being or a deva . In essence , meditation should be practised to escape from enlistment as a person belonging to any of the foregoing categories . <p> The statement , " Do not rely on the past , and abandon all hope for the future " was the terminology used in the discourse . It is nearly impossible to understand for the present generation . This Dhamma taught in ancient times was not meant for ordinary people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be easier for them to understand . The expression " Do not get enlisted in the middle ( nupasa ? kheyyo ) , " is even more profound , so I will explain it again . <p> In the phrase , " Do not get enlisted in the middle ( vemajjhe nupa-sa ? kheyyo ) , ' the middle ' refers to the phenomena occurring at the six sense-doors on every moment of seeing and knowing . One should not allow oneself to be enlisted as a person dominated by passion or seething with rage regarding any kind of sensations that occur in the present . If pleasurable sensations occur with attachment at the sight of a visual object , one should be called a lustful person . All kinds of sensations arise at every moment of hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , knowing , etc . A person who feels angry on seeing a sense-object , may be called an angry man . Then , one can be called deluded if one does not appreciate the truth of the phenomena that have arisen and attracted one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with the sensations arising from what have been seen , heard , touched , or known , a person deserves to be called proud . If one considers that it is one 's own self who sees or hears , then one should be called a holder of wrong views . If demerits occur relating to what has been seen , heard , or known , one may be said to be heading for the lower realms . On the other hand , if merits are being achieved one may be called a virtuous person who will be reborn as a human being or a deva . Hence , one must conduct oneself to avoid being enlisted as stated . <p> Then , what should one do to achieve that objective ? The method is to contemplate and note , as they really are , all mental and physical phenomena that arise at the six sense-doors on every moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing . If thus contemplated and noted , it will be clearly known that the arising phenomena are merely mind and matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they are impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . If this is truly realised , pleasurable feelings and attachment will cease to occur . If not , all sensations will stick to the sensitive mind just like an image sticks to a film when taking a photograph . Delightful sensations may occur repeatedly when the mind is impressed with the picture of a pleasurable sensation on which mental reflection is made . If it happens to be a grudging or spiteful sensation , anger may arise . I will relate a story where anger became prominent . <h> A Story from the Mahosadha J ? taka <p> In the Mahosadha J ? taka , 3 the Brahmin Keva ? ? a advised the king : " Your Majesty ! If you follow my advice and carry out everything exactly in accordance with my directions , you will become a Universal Monarch . " The king replied , " Venerable sir ! This is quite simple and easy . " <p> " You should mobilise your troops and raise a big army , and subdue with the great force at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The king remarked in agreement : " What has been stated by the Brahmin Keva ? ? a is true . It is easy for a powerfully nation to invade a weak nation and conquer it . This plan is acceptable and will be adopted . Threaten them by a show of force and pressure them to submit to our authority as vassal states . Any country that concedes to our demands will be left unharmed and will be allowed to maintain its status quo . We will tell them to follow our leadership and extend full co-operation according to our dictates . These smaller nations will no doubt obey our directions through fear . With the enlistment of their support , as our country gets strengthened , we will proceed to coerce and subdue the bigger nations in a similar way . These big nations too will have no alternative , but to acquiesce to our will . " <p> The Brahmin Keva ? ? a therefore gave orders that all neighbouring states should be subjected to their king 's control . Keva ? ? a was quite intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plots can be hatched . In the modern world , imperial colonists assume a similar aggressive attitude . <p> King C ? ? ani Brahmadatta found it appropriate to adopt the policy of aggrandizement -- the strong oppressing the weak -- as advocated by Keva ? ? a . He met with outstanding success in his venture as advised by Keva ? ? a . If a small nation is threatened with aggression by a big nation backed up by a huge army with overwhelming superiority of strength , the small nation has to give way and obey in the face of an imminent danger to avert disaster . In this way , all neighbouring states , big or small , had to capitulate and concede to humiliating negotiation as dictated by King Brahmadatta . <p> After succeeding in its efforts to subjugate a good number of states , and on making further incursions with their military strength , some of the big nations became concerned and could not endure any more . The mighty force was gradually advancing towards the country of Videha . It was a modest sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M ? gadha . In those days , the states were not very big . None of them would be comparable in size to the Union of Burma , though their size is exaggerated in literature . The Brahmin Keva ? ? a purposely delayed the execution of his plan to invade the country of Videha simply because of the presence of the minister Mahosadha , who was a reputed sage . In the Commentary , it mentions that the royal army besieged a fairly small state of Videha with eighteen divisions of armed forces . It was very large and broad-based . In those ancient times , the weaponry used in warfare was mainly swords , spears , and bows . There were then no sophisticated weapons as there are in modern times . As such , it is likely that the strength of the fighting forces might have been fairly large . Mithil ? , the capital city of Videha , was surrounded by eighteen army divisions . The attacking force sent a message to the besieged city whether they would make an unconditional surrender . The king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you suggest that we combat this dire situation which calls for an urgent solution ? " <h> The Wisdom of Mahosadha <p> Mahosadha had envisaged beforehand that Keva ? ? a 's armed forces would one day march on Videha and lay siege . He had therefore made early preparations to make the city self-sufficient within its own city limits in food and other essential materials . Dams , lakes , and canals were constructed within the precincts of the city to ensure an adequate supply of water both for consumption and for cultivating crops . Spies and informers had been sent to various other countries . Even among Keva ? ? a 's army there were fifth-columnists who had done the work of propaganda to the effect that food supplies were in abundance within the city , etc . They , of course , made exaggerated statements regarding the stock-piling of all sorts of provisions , and the state of preparedness in the event of a siege . This information had made Keva ? ? a 's troops to consider an alternative strategy to the original plan . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectuals of either party and mutually agree to submission to the winner of the contest . <p> Mahosadha accepted this proposal . He therefore sent word to the enemy camp that on the next day at sunrise , he would come out from the western gate of the city with valuable gifts to hold negotiations , and that they should wait for him . Keva ? ? a 's party with a huge array of armed forces awaited eagerly for the occasion . Since they had to wait at the western gate , selected for the rendezvous , their faces were scorched by the burning rays of the rising sun . The climate in India at that time was unbearably hot . They were facing the sun as they looked up at the eastern horizon while waiting for Mahosadha 's arrival . Mahosadha did not arrive early . His delay was intended to keep the other party in suspense and make them suffer with the heat . It was a cunning way of ill-treating others . Keva ? ? a 's troops , who were perspiring heavily , had to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their appearance . Keva ? ? a then said , " Friend ! As we two are men of wisdom , courtesy should have been shown between intellectuals . Depending upon you all , Mahosadha , we arrived here a few days ago , yet , until today you have not made a friendly gesture by presenting us with gifts . " This was an insinuation . Mahosadha then responded that he had not been able to offer gifts yet , due to the time taken in considering what kind of gifts would be appropriate . " I have brought a priceless gem to be presented as a gift , please honour us by accepting it , " said Mahosadha . So saying , he made as if about to hand over the gem . <p> Keva ? ? a reflected in this way . " As Mahosadha has come to offer this gift , it amounts to paying homage and submitting to subjugation . " So he thought he was the victor . With great delight and eagerness , he extended his hands and spread his palms to receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keva ? ? a 's fingers so that it slide down . Being heavy , the gem dropped through the gaps in the Brahmin 's fingers and landed on the ground between Mahosadha 's feet . Impelled by greed , Keva ? ? a bent forward to pick up the gem . At that moment , Mahosadha caught hold of the Brahmin 's neck , pressing his head down , causing his brow to touch the ground , and exclaimed loudly , " Venerable Brahmin ! I 'm obviously younger than you . You are senior to me . Please do n't worship me . It is highly improper . " <p> In fact , Keva ? ? a was certainly not paying homage to Mahosadha , he merely bent forward and tried to pick up the gem . However , it would appear to others by his posture that he was paying homage . Mahosadha therefore , placing his one hand on the neck of the Brahmin and holding the knot of the garment at the waist of the Brahmin with the other hand , pressed him down , brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , teacher ! Please stand up , I 'm too young to be deserving of reverence in this way . I 'm only about the age of your grandson . Do n't worship me . " So saying , he swept the Brahmin off his feet by pulling him hard . <p> Almost at once , Mahosadha 's spies among Keva ? ? a 's retinue proclaimed , " Our teacher , the great Brahmin Keva ? ? a is paying homage to Mahosadha for having failed in the battle of wits . " When this loud proclamation rang forth , the entire armed forces of King Brahmadatta ran helter-skelter . King Brahmadatta also fled having been caught unawares . Many soldiers must have suffered injuries in the commotion . Fear usually spurs men to take to their heels in a mle to save their own lives . It is really dreadful . In ancient times , it must been all the more horrible . <p> The victors in battle plunder the property of the vanquished as they please . Both life and property may be destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men are captured and might be executed . Prisoners-of-war are treated as slaves . Those defeated in battle and the country that is invaded , lose their freedom , sovereignty , and national prestige , and may be cruelly suppressed . This fear of impending disaster must have made King Brahmadatta and his armed forces take flight . <p> The Brahmin Keva ? ? a caught up with King Brahmadatta and prevented him from running away . He explained that they were not defeated yet , and that he had not paid homage to Mahosadha . The battle of wits had not started and it was merely a trick played by Mahosadha by offering a gem as a gift . King Brahmadatta , realising what had actually happened , rallied his scattered and disorganized troops , came back again , and laid siege to the city of Mithil ? with his armed forces firmly pitched for battle . <p> Despite the siege , the sage Mahosadha deputed a Brahmin of his own choice , named Anukeva ? ? a under sham orders of expulsion . Anukeva ? ? a sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keva ? ? a , and among other ministers and the troops . Investigations were made by King Brahmadatta , and soon he could no longer trust any of his generals and other courtiers including his adviser Keva ? ? a , having found with them in possession of weapons and presents bearing the insignia of Mahosadha . Suspicion overwhelmed him , thinking that his courtiers had surreptitiously pledged allegiance to Mahosadha . One night , Anukeva ? ? a and King Brahmadatta secretly fled the place as arranged by the spy , Anukeva ? ? a . At the same time , other spies working for Mahosadha publicly announced the secret and sudden departure of King Brahmadatta . The royal army of great magnitude woke up in surprise and dismay , and fled at once in confusion . From the point of view of some these days , such an incident might be regarded as just a myth . However , considering Mahosadha 's remarkable ability , wisdom , and glorious attributes , it could have really happened in those superstitious days . Even in Burmese history , such incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fear . <p> As a result of this battle , Keva ? ? a 's forehead was disfigured by an ugly scar . It is said that every time he looked at a mirror , the scar reminded him of past events . Brooding over the past humiliation infuriated Keva ? ? a who swore vengeance on Mahosadha for causing him injury , humiliation , and ignominy . Every time he saw the scar on his forehead , it made him reflect on the past incident , which stirred up his imagination : " Mahosadha deceived me . I failed to get the gem and the only result I have is this scar on my brow . He is really wicked . I will take my revenge one way or another , and make him suffer . " With this resentment goading him , he was constantly plotting against Mahosadha . The ruse he employed was to invite the king of Videha to be given the daughter of King Brahmadatta in marriage . The intention behind this move was when the king of Videha with Mahosadha and their retinue came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be captured and massacred . However , this plot was spoilt by cautious handling of the situation by Mahosadha who had taken preventive measures , being aware of the plot prior to the occasion . <h> How Anger Arises on Reflection <p> The point that needs emphasis here is the way in which anger arises when reflecting on past events . Anger does not normally arise on seeing a scar . In this case , however , the reason for the upsurge of anger at the sight of the scar was because Keva ? ? a , the Brahmin , had an indelible impression of the past events . If he could forgive Mahosadha , there is no reason why he should get angry with Mahosadha . It happened because of the presence of the wrong notion of self and the scar on his forehead as being " mine , " which is a concept , just as Mahosadha was thought of as a " being , " an illusion that is known or manifested in name only . If it was truly known and realised , anger would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind clings to a sensation , and if reflection is made on it , it would be the root cause for the occurrence of greed , anger , delusion , and other defilements . These sensations arise from what is seen , heard , touched , or known . It is true . If no contemplation and noting is done at the moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing , greed , anger , delusion , pride , etc. , can occur . <p> It resembles taking a thing from one 's pocket and looking at it frequently . Repeated occurrences of greed , anger , and other defilements , occur by reflecting on what has been seen , heard , and known . A person who fails to contemplate and note at every moment of seeing , etc. , will be wrapped up in greed from the time of seeing , hearing , or knowing . Such a person can be called avaricious . They may also be said to be someone in whom anger , delusion , and pride have arisen . Since he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kamma , he or she is included in the list of those who are destined for the lower realms , such as animals or hungry ghosts . If that is the case , it is truly a cause for great alarm . <h> How to Avoid Enlistment <p> This is to say that if one fails to contemplate and note at every moment of seeing a sense-object or hearing a sound , etc. , greed and anger can arise out of the sensation that occurs from what is seen , heard , touched , or known . When greed , anger , etc. , have become overwhelming , either foul or fair deeds are liable to be done . If it yields unmerited results , he will descend to the lower realms . Therefore , he has been enlisted as one who will go down to hell , the lower realms , or the animal kingdom . <p> Merits can also be derived depending on greed or anger . How ? It is done , for example , by giving donations wishing to acquire and enjoy the kind of pleasurable sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touched , or known in the next existence even though it may not be within one 's reach in the present life-time . One may keep the moral precepts wishing to gain merits . It shows how moral merits are derived depending upon greed . If meritorious deeds are done in anger with a view to fulfilling one 's own desire , the resultant effects will be gained relying upon anger . If merits are acquired in this manner , these actions will pave the way or bring good results to be reborn as human beings or devas . If exertion is made to achieve jh ? na , it can bring beneficial results even to the extent of becoming a brahma . Such kinds of action , speech , or thought bringing forth good and bad effects are experienced by everyone . These have so happened and made their appearance at the time of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing , and since then they have become enlisted . <p> Meditation should be practised to avoid being enlisted . The way of practising is to contemplate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and matter from the six sense-doors at every time of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing . While contemplating , the true characteristics of impermanence , unsatisfactoriness , and not-self should be clearly perceived . Awareness occurs in this way . It will be known as vanishing if contemplation and noting is carried on at the moment of seeing . It is also realised as arising and passing away instantaneously . Hence , it becomes obvious that it is impermanent and not lasting . If also what is heard is contemplated and noted , it disappears all at once after hearing has taken place . It is also found disappearing and dissolving . Awareness then comes of the truth of impermanence . In the same way , what has been contacted and known immediately disappears . It arises and dissolves , and this phenomena will be realised as impermanence . If realisation occurs in the way stated , no enlistment is possible as a man of greed , anger , or delusion . Such a person should not be called greedy or lustful . Nor should he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who is puffed up with false pride , nor one with defilements , nor , one deriving merits or demerits . One will then escape from enlistment as a person who will have take rebirth either in the lower realms or in the human or celestial realms as a result of demeritorious or meritorious deeds . Meditation should be practiced to escape from being enlisted by every sensation that may arise , to avoid becoming entangled . <h> An Arahant Is Free from Entanglement <p> On becoming an Arahant , all sensations that cause entanglement and pave the way for enlistment are eradicated . Even a Non-returner is not yet be free from all kinds of sensations . Sensations which are listed and present in a most complex form remain to be accounted for in the case of an ordinary person . Those that need be reckoned , comprise rebirths as a human or a deva , or in the lower realms of animals and hungry ghosts . Hence , ordinary people have all these things to be reckoned and to give their results . In this regard , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no cause to be relegated to hell or the lower realms . He or she has been enlisted to become a human being , deva , or brahma . A Once-returner is in the same boat . A Non-returner , however , has hardly anything to be accounted for since there is no enlistment to be reborn a human or a deva . He or she has been firmly enlisted to become a brahma . When Arahantship is attained , there is nothing left to be reckoned . Everything has been completely settled and fully accounted for . That is why it is vital to practise -- to settle and liquidate all entanglements . Regarding this point , the teaching is profound . However , those who have the right inclination with noble attributes can understand and appreciate these profound aspects of the teaching . <p> In the motto , the statement is to avoid being enlisted in the middle , i.e. in the present existence , by practicing meditation . To elucidate further , the middle means the arising of mind and matter at the moment of seeing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation is done by our meditators . They have to contemplate at every moment that physical phenomena arise according to the method of mindfulness . They have to contemplate every sensation that occurs at the moment of seeing , hearing , or thinking , and on all sensations of stiffness , heat , pain , aching , etc . This is done to prevent defilements from arising in the present , and to avoid being assailed by passion , ill-will , and delusion , or to avoid being enlisted as one destined for heavenly abodes , or the lower realms , or drifting in the endless cycle of existences . On becoming an Arahant , the things to be accounted for will be totally removed . A person becoming fully accomplished as such , is a sage who has gained real peace . <p> The above P ? ? i stanza may be explained thus : an individual who is free of craving in the present life-time , neither reminisces about the past , nor craves for the present , nor longs for the future . Such an individual is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with this explanation relating to a single verse . However , when the Buddha delivered this discourse , only a few devas and brahmas were able to grasp the full meaning of this first verse . Some were unable to appreciate it fully . For those who still failed to comprehend , the Blessed One proceeded to deliver the remaining twelve verses to enable them to realise the Path and Fruition and become well accomplished . <h> Verse Three <p> In the text of this Sutta , there is only one question in the form of a verse while the answer embraces thirteen verses . Therein , it is stated that if craving has been got rid of before death , one has already become an Arahant . If a person does not deserve being called one who relies on the past , longs for the future , or is wrapped up in defilements in the present , he is said to be an Arahant . After attaining Arahantship no further practice is needed . That is why the Dhamma is found to be adequate and comprehensive even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some of the devas and brahmas clearly understand the Dhamma , which they had failed to appreciate fully , the Blessed One continued to elucidate it in detail . <p> The meaning of the above phrase is : " One who is not prone to anger . " In other words , a person should be free from anger , mild and gentle , without spite or resentment . He is also free from worry and anxiety . Neither is he egoistic and boastful . He is far above contempt in regard to his physical and mental behaviour and does not adopt a despicable attitude in speech or deed . He does not speak without reflecting wisely . He is not restless , and is endowed with stability of mind . A monk possessing such noble attributes is one who exercises restraint in speech . The Buddha said : " Such an individual is , I say , a person who is at peace , calm , and serene -- a sage . For the sake of memorising , let us recite a motto . Then , I will explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anger and avoid worry without being arrogant and stay free from restlessness and remorse ( kukkucca ) . " " <p> Restlessness and remorse ( kukkucca ) can not be translated satisfactorily in one word -- it will be explained later . It should be reflected upon with one 's own knowledge . These are the six noble attributes of a sage . As it would be hard to understand in P ? ? i , it is composed in plain English as concisely as possible . <h> Tame Anger and Exercise Restraint in Speech <p> A person should not allow himself to become indignant . In other words , do not let the anger overwhelm you . All individuals with the exception of Non-returners and Arahants , have anger to varying degrees . When loathsome sensations arise , anger generally occurs . Leaving aside ordinary people , even Stream-winners and Once-returners still have anger . Anger arises in them when disagreeable sensations are felt . Fury or violence is the natural characteristic of anger . It is far from being meek and mild . It resembles a cobra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is touched . Anger may suddenly become vehement beyond control . Anger rages on hearing unfair criticism or any kind of harsh talk . If is just like a snake hissing with great fury . Greed and anger are in rivalry . Anger is , of course , more conspicuous because of its ferocious nature . Anger truly reflects the mood of an individual or a person 's mental disposition . Since anger is rough , wild , and fierce in nature , contemplation should be done to dispel it completely . <p> Ill-will usually arises when one comes across loathsome sensations . The moment contact occurs , causing disagreeable sensations , ill-will arises . Unpleasant and hideous sounds stimulate wrath almost simultaneously the moment they are heard . It is more likely that feeling of ill-will will arise when a sound or voice is heard rather than when an object is perceived by the eye . One can tolerate to a certain extent when a disagreeable object is seen , but it is hard to tolerate abuse or derision , which cause bitter feelings or indignation . <p> Ill-will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such words , however , do not cause even a slight injury , not even an abrasion on the physical body . It is just a voice , yet it may provoke bitterness to the extent of murder . Such a human tragedy begins from the time of hearing harsh words . Nations may even declare war over disputes arising from disparaging talk due to divergent dogmatic views about political issues , which eventually lead to a crisis . Hence , abusive speech may cause a great deal of trouble . <p> Sometimes , a foul odour from a neighbouring house may cause a nuisance to others living nearby , and may lead to petty quarrels between neighbours . Disagreeable or bitter food can make a person angry . A married couple may quarrel over likes and dislikes of food according to their preferences . Such cases are fortunately very rare . <p> One 's patience may be tested by sensations of touch . Painful sensations arising from touch may make a person angry , such as the irritation caused by mosquitos biting . One may also get angry if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one 's own fault . If someone shoves us while rushing in a crowd , or hits us with a stick , these are obviously instances when anger might arise . Anger may not always occur at once . If someone insult us or talks rudely , it might lead to anger later either after repeated provocation or by brooding over what was said . Anger brings about a change in one 's appearance , which becomes sullen . When tempers flare , angry words follow . Anger gradually make one irate , leading to fits of rage , or it may develop into a blind fury to the extent of committing murder or suicide . Anger may progressively swell up to a raging fury . <h> Resembles a Toad <p> It has been taught in the Vammika Sutta that anger is like a toad that puffs up if touched . In Shwebo district , such a toad is called a " Phar-om . " Some called it " Phar-gon-hnyin . " In some places it is called " Phar-byoke , which is poisonous . The toad called " uddhum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous . Everybody will know if it is described as a frog that swells in size every time it is touched . It stays among dry leaves or at the foot of a tree . Sometimes , it may stay inside a hole in the earth . As it grows swollen every time it is touched , it eventually becomes unable to move . If it is put upside-down , it will not be able to resume its normal posture on its legs . It can not even move about if crows or other birds come to prey on it . It will then become a victim to crows and birds . <p> Anger is similar to that kind of toad . On hearing unpleasant or undesirable sounds , unpleasant sensations become puffed up . If such contacts occur repeatedly , anger grows in proportion . It may cause one to do things that should not be done . It can go to extremes . <h> The Remedy for Anger <p> Since anger tends to increase , the moment it arises , it should be dispelled by contemplating and noting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will suffer mentally whenever anger arises just as a sick person has to suffer due to lack of medicine . If medicine is readily available , relief can be obtained and the patient can recover from his illness . If the Dhamma is not available , there is no helping a person if anger has gripped him . He will suffer from mental distress . Some are so blinded by ignorance that they can not help behaving impulsively in fury . This shows the nature of anger . However , those who know the Dhamma well , can easily contemplate , note , and dispel anger whenever it appears . <h> Nine Causes of Resentment <p> When arising anger is unabated and becomes intense , malice and desire for vengeance can occur . The vengeance or ill-will that occurs in connection with human beings , is of nine categories . This is known as nine occasions for ill-will or resentment ( ? gh ? ta ) . <p> A person may bear a grudge merely out of discontent . Then , awareness of grievance will occur . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular person has given him a lot of trouble detrimental to his well-being . This is bearing resentment against that person to retaliate for the ill-treatment received . Again he may think of taking revenge on a person who is doing him harm at the present , assuming that in future this person is likely to harm his interests . These are the three kinds of resentment arising out of the present situation . This kind of resentment may be generated not only against people , but also against other sentient beings . Vindictive thoughts can occur even against mosquitoes , fleas , ants and other biting insects . These tiny insects may be regarded as a nuisance , and so feelings of disgust or hatred may occur . If no virtuous thoughts were entertained , these insects would be killed . A person may take revenge on a dog that had once bitten him , or barked at him . These sorts of grudge are not uncommon . Much worse are massacres of innocent people that can happen due to resentment and vindictive feelings . <p> The above three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after brooding over incidents where harm has been done in the past , is being done at present , or worrying that harm may be done in the future . There are three further kinds of resentment relating to a person for whom one has deep love and affection . One may harbour resentment against someone who has done harm to a loved one in the past , is doing wrong now , or may do harm in the future . Then , with regard to a person whom one hates , vengeance may be taken on another person for giving help to the person whom one hates , for giving assistance to that person at the moment , or for any offering assistance that may be rendered in the future . Thus , in all , there are nine kinds of basis for resentment . Apart from these , one may unnecessarily become angry with lifeless or inanimate things , such as , sharp-pointed stumps , pegs and thorns , or the burning rays of the sun , a sudden downpour , and so on . This is called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment of inanimate things , there are ten categories in all . I will explain a little more how resentment of inanimate things occurs . Anger may arise if the weather becomes hot when coolness is desired , or , if there is a heavy downpour when rain is not wanted , or if a strong wind blows when it is not needed . Sometimes , one may get angry with the disease he is suffering , which may be prolonged in spite of his wish for a speedy recovery . When natural phenomena such as , wind , rain , thunder , etc. , occur , or if unpleasant sensations arise in him according to circumstances , one may be intolerant and angry . These events are indicative of wrath in cases where angry sensations should not have arisen . Some people even become angry at a stump on which they have stumbled while walking . If this happens , they may even kick it repeatedly in a rage . Some may become so enraged by having dropped something from their hands that they throw it away or beat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger arises without any known reason . To prevent such anger from arising , it should be contemplated , noted , and then rejected . All undesirable sensations arising at the six sense-doors that invoke impulsive angry moods should be dispelled by contemplating and noting . If anger appears , it should be suppressed from the very outset to bring it to cessation to prevent any improper physical behaviour . After the rejection of such undesirable sensations , when insight becomes stronger , the Noble Path can be attained . A Stream-winner is not yet free from anger , but no vehement anger will arise in him or her to be capable of killing another person , which if committed , would have caused one to descend to the lower realms . A Stream-winner will be able to control his or her temper from becoming furious though he may still become angry with undesirable sensations that may arise . However , no anger that can cause him to steal other people 's property , or bring financial ruin to others , or to tell lies , will occur . He or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts . <p> On reaching the stage of Non-returning , all kinds of anger will cease . Nothing need be said of an Arahant in whom all defilements have become extinct . Hence , it is stated as " one not prone to anger ( akkodhano . ) " Non-returners and Arahants , in whom anger does not reside , are liberated from suffering and misery in so far as defilement of ill-will is concerned . Such a person is called a sage . <h> Should Have No Fear or Anxiety <p> Moreover , it is stated as free from fear and anxiety ( asant ? si ) . In this world , the majority become anxious , worried , and dejected if unable to fulfil their desires . In the verse referred to , this feeling of anxiety or worry is called " sant ? sa . " Monks may become worried and dejected due to scarcity of donors or helpers . Sometimes they may become down-hearted for not having friends and disciples on whom to rely . In brief , out of eight worldly conditions , if any unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , or suffering , are met with , a person may become dejected . He may be disappointed or discontented for lack of hoped for gifts or privileges , or for having no followers or companionship , or for want of assistance when the need arises . It is only natural for people to wish for fame and honour , and to avoid criticism . They hope to be fortunate and find happiness , and to avoid misery . Hence , if they have come across miserable conditions that bring them no happiness , they may become depressed , reflecting that misfortune has come as a result of bad kamma . <p> The above instances reveal how dejection occurs because of unfulfilled desires brought about by unfavourable circumstances . Hence , such depression should be discarded . If such bad moods do occur , they must be abandoned by contemplating and noting them . There is no reason why a person should be morose and dispirited . He needs encouragement from others . Some people are optimistic while others are pessimistic . Some people become very disheartened and miserable when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withstand the onslaughts of worldly conditions . One should remain serene and unaffected whatever the consequences of worldly vicissitudes . If one does become dejected , dejection should be contemplated , noted , and abandoned . Therefore , the motto says , " Avoid anger and worry . " Do not let anger raise its ugly head . If anger does arise , it should be contemplated , noted , and then dispelled . Then it says " Avoid worry . " Do not become dejected due to not getting pleasant sensations , property , companions , or helpers that you want . If you are disappointed this should be contemplated , noted , and abandoned . <h> Should Have No Pride <p> Apart from getting rid of anger and worry , a person should also have no pride . It has been stated as " avikatth ? " and that means not to allow pride to manifest . This discourse was taught with particular reference to monks for whom it is intended , and the Commentators have therefore expounded the nature of a variety of circumstances that are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have absolutely no pride -- all pride must be avoided . Some speak falsehood relating to their lineage as if they have descended from a noble and distinguished family line . Some boast of possessing morality although they do not , or without having much learning , they may pretend to be learned in the scriptures . Some pretend to have undertaken the ascetic practises , without having done so . They may even boast of having attained jh ? na or sam ? patti without any genuine attainment . This discourse does not embrace the supramundane . Hence , without being fully accomplished in worldly Dhamma , one should not boast of accomplishments . <p> As regards lay people , they should not be proud of their success in social and financial status in worldly and business affairs . Neither should they be proud of their relatives , friends , and good company . Some have a natural inclination to brag , while some are humble and honest . In this regard , even as a lay person who is practising the noble Dhamma , if the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then discarded . Efforts should be made to get rid of this pride by constant practice . A Stream-winner will have no such pride . That is why it has been stated that meditation should be practised , and pride rejected by contemplating and noting . Let us recite the motto : <p> Speaking what is appropriate when the occasion arises , after careful consideration . <p> Remaining calm and serene with complete control of the flitting mind after gaining concentration . <h> Remorse Should Be Dispelled <p> It has now time to speak about freedom from remorse ( kukkucca ) -- one of the attributes just mentioned . It needs to be explained in detail , as it is noteworthy . It is of three kinds : 1 ) Hatthap ? da-kukkucca , 2 ) Vinaya kukkucca , and 3 ) Vippa ? is ? ra kukkucca . " Kukkucca " means misbehaviour . It is so called because it is devoid of benefit to have bad manners or misbehaviour . Being contemptible , misbehaviour may be said to be malevolent . <p> Hattha-kukkucca and p ? da-kukkucca are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindfulness and concentration are restless , and unable to keep their hands and feet still . Nor can they remain silent . They chatter and often change their sitting posture by moving their hands and feet to relieve discomfort even while delivering a lecture . This restlessness is indicative of a fickle mind that wanders without steady mindfulness . Not only the hands and feet , but also the head or the entire body not remaining still , being in a state of agitation , may be regarded as hatthap ? da-kukkucca . Only an Arahant will be totally free from restlessness . It is therefore advised that all others should devote themselves to mindfulness to get rid of this defect . Care should be taken to reduce feelings of restlessness . Those who are mindful will be calmer than those who do not meditate . The Kandaraka Sutta serves as evidence of this . <h> The Reverence of Kandaraka <p> Two wandering religious mendicants , Pessa and Kandaraka , once visited the Blessed One . At that time monks had come to pay homage to the Buddha . Kandaraka noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgeting their hands , feet , or head . None were talking , fidgeting , or even coughing . Not one of them made a sound . All of them were absolutely still , calm , and serene . It is stated in P ? ? i 4 as : " tu ? h ? bh ? ta ? tu ? h ? bh ? ta ? . " Despite the presence of a large number of monks , all of them were tranquil . The effect of the quiet and peaceful atmosphere was such that as a wandering hermit himself , it generated profound respect and awe in Kandaraka , who marvelled at the effect of the Buddha 's noble teachings . This state of mind had aroused faith in him , and he respectfully told Buddha , " Venerable sir ! It seems to me that all Fully Enlightened Buddhas of the past must have taught their disciples in the same way as you do now . The audience in those days might be similar to the present audience . Fully Enlightened Buddhas in the future will teach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire gathering of noble ones is likely to be of the same kind , and being calm , serene , and gentle , they are indeed worthy of reverence . " <p> In response to this praise , the Blessed One said , " Kandaraka ! You know only this present audience . I will explain to you the reason for their tranquility and serenity . Among this assembly , there are Arahants who are fully accomplished in the practical knowledge of mindfulness , having eradicated all defilements after practising the noble Dhamma . Of course , no commendation is called for in regard to the noble Arahants . Being Arahants , the noble quality of mindfulness reflects in them and makes a full display with reference to all sensations arising from the six sense-bases . How could one refrain from respecting and revering them ? All have become admirably noble , gentle , and refined . The Buddha then went on to say that among the congregation present were those practising meditation called trainees ( sekkha ) . This includes Non-returners , Once-returners , Stream-winners , and ordinary good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , lofty thoughts , and lofty wisdom , and they are undergoing training in the four foundations of mindfulness ( cat ? su satipa ? ? h ? nesu suppati ? ? hitacitt ? ) . The meaning of this P ? ? i phrase is that , possessing mental stability by earnest devotion to the four foundations of mindfulness , they remain in a tranquil state of mind cultivating these four kinds of mindfulness : mindfulness on the impurity of the body , on the evils of sensations , on the evanescence of thoughts , and on the conditions of existence . <p> Meditators are well aware of these four foundations of mindfulness . Nevertheless , an explanation will be given to make the meaning vivid . Some have established their mindfulness on the body , some on feelings , some on consciousness , and some on mental states . If attention is established on the four foundations of mindfulness , one does indeed become calm and tranquil . No change of posture is made without mindfulness . If any change in posture is made , or arising thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always gentle and composed . Nothing is done haphazardly or in a disorderly way . This is because contemplation and noting is done with mindfulness acting as a forerunner . That is why the Blessed One said that this entire assembly was extremely calm , unruffled , and fully refined . <h> King Kosala 's Solicitation <p> King Pasenadi of Kosala once reverentially said to the Buddha : " Venerable Sir , we are monarchs with absolute powers . We have the powers to confiscate the property of the people and impose penalty on them . We can also punish them with death sentence according to our own will , or banish them if we prefer . " <p> It is true . Such despots wielded supreme sovereign powers unlike the present day rulers of states in which the rule of law prevails . Hence , in modern times , cases involving any breach of law are brought before the courts for trial where the accused has the right to be defended by lawyers and advocates . Only in cases where there is sufficient evidence against the accused for the offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no clear , substantiated evidence against an accused person for the alleged offence , he is either discharged or acquitted by the court according to law . These despotic rulers of ancient times had unlimited powers and their word was law . There was no right of appeal against the orders passed by them . Sometimes , however , there had been instances where the ministers commented upon the king 's orders or pronouncements with the best of intention , though their behaviour might have been looked upon as disrespectful . On such occasions , it was stated that they had to be entreated or appeased . <p> The audience consisting of the disciples of the Blessed One was extremely gentle . The Buddha never resorted to force , influence , coercion , or threats . He merely gave his exhortation or due admonition by way of delivering a lecture . Yet , his adherents who formed the congregation were remarkably refined and delicate in manners . While listening to a discourse with great reverence , the whole congregation was perfectly calm . If a monk could not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain silent to avoid causing interference to others . King Pasenadi of Kosala extolled the qualities of the members of the Sa ? gha in the way described above stating that all of them were perfectly pure in thoughts and faultless in manners , and were therefore entirely free from restlessness . In the era of the Buddha 's dispensation , if meditation is practised with mindfulness and clear comprehension ( satisampaj ? na ? ) , one would become gentle . However , some people who are not able to exercise restraint in action and thoughts , would speak ill of others , disparaging them while acting pretentiously . Some monks teach without dignified manners , yet some people may appreciate that kind of misbehaviour . Different people have diverse outlooks and mentalities . Such an improper attitude bears testimony to the absence of the noble quality of mindfulness . These improper acts and misconduct should be discarded . If they can not be completely eradicated , practice should be done to avoid or reduce such misbehaviour as far as possible . It has therefore been stated that restlessness should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now come to the subject of vinaya kukkucca . Doubt may arise concerning certain matters relevant to the rules of discipline ( vinaya ) . Sceptical doubt may arise regarding one 's own actions or the use of requisites as to whether it is suitable or allowable . When such doubt occurs , it has not yet reach the stage of committing an offence . This kind of doubt is relevant to the rule of discipline . It is therefore regarded as an attribute that all monks should possess . Yet some monks pay no heed to any such doubt that might occur . In the absence of any such doubt or hesitation , they may do a misdeed that amounts to contravening the rules of discipline . These monks will not have purity of mind or morality . Without reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of any such acts , they may do anything they like regardless of the rules of discipline laid down for monks . If they misbehave in this way , they are open to derision and it amounts to dereliction of their duty as monks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should and it can not possibly be entirely dispelled . However , if one knowingly eats , drinks , or makes use of anything with doubt in the mind , it amounts to committing an offence . This worry and doubt about the disciplinary rules should be expelled by avoiding any dubious actions . <h> Remorse and Regret <p> The next type of remorse is called " vippa ? is ? ra kukkucca , " which is the remorse where there is regret . This regret is of two kinds : one may occur for any wrong-doing one has done , and the other for not doing something that should have been done . Wrongful acts means unwholesome acts or evil deeds . Feelings of repentance may occur when reflecting that one has done something wrong , and how unskillful it was , relating to any improper act done physically , verbally , or mentally . One may become sad and remorseful with bitter regret for any wrong-doing . If this state of mind pervades , it is known as " vippa ? is ? ra kukkucca . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , it will be almost impossible to get rid of this feeling entirely . To find a person who is totally free from regrets for wrong-doing , which could have taken place at any time from the time of birth up to the present moment , will be extremely rare . The only difference may be that remorse may or may not occur though wrongful acts would have been committed . Hence , feeling of remorse may or may not take place . Nevertheless , if it occurs , it should be rejected after contemplating and noting it . This wrong-doing was a thing of the past , and therefore , it is not worth recalling and regretting what had been done previously . This kind of thought may be dispelled determining that such acts will in future be avoided . It is best to dispel any regrets that may arise . <p> Acts that ought to be done are meritorious deeds . These virtuous deeds are charity ( d ? na ) , morality ( s ? la ) , etc . Repentance may occur for not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Acts of charity and observance of morality should be done as far as possible within one 's own means and capability . One may worship the Buddha whenever time permits , and pay respects to the teachers as and when an opportunity arises . If such good actions or meritorious deeds are performed , there is no need to worry . That means one should do everything that ought to be done within one 's own capability . When such feelings of remorse appear , these should be dispelled by contemplating and noting them with a firm resolve that no such shortcomings will be allowed to happen again and that what should have been done , would certainly be done without lapse in the future . <p> Among such remorse , feelings of regret that may arise for not being able to fully accomplish morality is particularly important . Remorse may arise for having so far failed to practise meditation to gain concentration , wisdom , and the Noble Path ; and then for not being accomplished in Dhamma to escape from the cycle of existence . Is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries ? Those who are now practising meditation have this objective in mind and , if full accomplishment is achieved , no such feelings of regret will worry them . This is even more important on the threshold of death . On the verge of death , one will no doubt reflect on what has been done throughout life to ensure well-being in future existence . When reflecting thus , one would have bitter feelings of regret if one has not yet accomplished the Dhamma . Therefore , to get rid of such worries and anxieties , one should practise as early as possible . The sooner the better . <h> The Story of a Sick Young Monk <p> During the life-time of Buddha , there was a sick monk . 5 Usually , of course , a number of monks were on the sick list . For easy remembrance , we shall give an account relating to only one such sick monk . Another monk was deputed to inform the Buddha about the serious illness of a young monk . Though this young monk was an ordinary monk the Buddha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearing the news of this poor sick monk belonging to an unknown lowborn family without any helper to nurse him , the Blessed One , with great compassion , decided to visit him . On his arrival at the place of where the young monk was residing , the Buddha asked the young monk how he was faring and whether he was getting better or worse . Under ordinary circumstances , the young monk would have been greatly encouraged and enraptured by the presence of the Buddha in person before him . However , his condition being serious , he replied that the condition of the disease was deteriorating . Although the condition of a patient is known to be bad , an inquiry should be made in that way . In any case , the Buddha had come over to this place to bless him with some teaching . The Blessed One them asked the young monk whether he had anything to be worried about . The young monk replied that he was full of remorse , saying : " Anappaka ? kukkucca ? anappako vippa ? is ? ro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had feelings of repentance for not being accomplished in morality . The answer given was that he had nothing to regret whatsoever in connection with morality . <p> It is important that monks are scrupulous 7 regarding morality . They may not be free from doubt about their morality . This point is important for monks . It is easier for the laity if they have breached the principles of morality , they can regain moral purity by taking the five precepts . It is more difficult for the monks to do so . Certain offences can not be expiated by merely uttering and listening to the formula for confession . They must abandon any property in their possession that was acquired improperly , or they must undergo probation ( parivattha ) and rehabilitation ( m ? natta ? ) if they have committed a Sa ? gh ? disesa offence . That is why they would usually become repentant in connection with their moral conduct . This is why the Buddha asked whether the young monk had any regrets regarding his morality . The Buddha further asked the young monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you concerned about ? " This question was put to let the young monk divulge his problem . The young monk fervently replied . " Venerable sir , as I understand it , the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One is not practised only for the purification of morality . " The Buddha asked further : " Dear son ! If it is not meant just for the sake of purity of morality , do you know the other purpose for which it is intended ? " <p> The young monk then respectfully replied : " For the attainment of nibb ? na which is devoid of cravings for human passions ( r ? ga vir ? gattha ? ) , 8 one should follow the practice leading to the extinction of passionate desires to attain nibb ? na with no remainder ( anup ? da-parinibb ? nattha ? ) . 9 I understand this is the Buddha 's teaching , so I have been practising the Dhamma to reach nibb ? na , where all craving for human passions is annihilated . However , nibb ? na not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious . " <p> The reply given by the young monk was quite realistic and natural . It is essential to have something to rely on to face any crisis that may arise when death approaches . To have such reliance close to death is more important than other matters . It there is nothing to depend on , feelings of remorse and anxiety may occur . If one feels sure of the purity of his morality , he will have full confidence in rebirth in the celestial realms in the next existence . This young monk 's objective was not just to reach the heavenly abode of devas after his demise . His ultimate goal was to achieve nibb ? na . However , not having achieved his objective yet , he was greatly worried . This feeling of anxiety is nothing but " kukkucca . " So one should practice meditation to get free from this kind of anxiety . In response to the young monk 's answer , the Buddha taught as follows : <p> " Oh , dear son , you shall pay careful attention to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye is permanent or impermanent . It asks if the material form of the eye is everlasting or not . If the answer were to be given according to the sense conveyed in the question , it would be quite easy . If such a question were raised at a congregation , the questioner 's expected answer being clearly known , the answer to be given would be simple enough to meet the wish of the teacher . The question now put by the Buddha was however to be answered after the underlying meaning of the question had been fully grasped . That is why it is rather difficult to give the right answer . Therefore , the answer would be meaningful as expected , only if one has the knowledge of the characteristic of " impermanence " in as much as what has been ascertained is whether the eye is permanent or not . Roughly speaking , when death occurs , the material eye is destroyed . If this is appreciated and if the answer were that the eye is impermanent , it would be relevant . Then also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could have been destroyed . The destruction of the eye may be caused by serious injury or by affliction of the disease . Hence , the answer can be considered as proper if it is stated that the eye is not permanent . However , such an answer , being simplistic without the essential or deeper meaning , is not derived from insight knowledge . <p> Insight can be gained only through the practice of meditation . While contemplating on mind and matter at the moment of their occurrence at the six sense-doors , every time it is perceived by the eye , if contemplated as " seeing , " " seeing , " both the tangible physical eye , the visual object , the eye-consciousness , and the mind that is contemplated and noted , will be found to disappear at every moment of noting . Only if these natural phenomena are truly known and realised , would it be possible to give a proper and accurate answer . The young monk , being an insight meditator , was able to give a proper answer . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> A question may , therefore , arise as to why it is impermanent . It is because at every moment seeing occurs , it disappears , or in other words , the moment it is perceived , dissolution of the sensation arising from perception follows suit . When asked if the thing that is seen is permanent , or impermanent , the answer given by the young monk was : " It is impermanent . " In the same way , the subsequent answers given in respect of consciousness of sight , awareness of the visual contact , and the pleasurable or unpleasurable sensations arising out of contact with the eye and the visual object , were " impermanent and not lasting . " The characteristic of impermanence is likewise found when hearing occurs . The sound , the knowing mind , the sound that is perceived by the ear into which it flows , and the pleasurable and unpleasant sensations arising from contact with the sound , disappears all at once the moment it is heard . <p> Similarly , when smelling , tasting , and touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pass away or disappear at every moment they are contemplated and noted . <p> " Bending " and " stretching " are tactile . Every time it is noted as " bending " or " stretching , " the mind that perceives the sense of touch will be found to be arising followed immediately by dissolution . The same nature of phenomena will be realised at every moment of noting " stiffness , " " heat , " " pain , " or " aching " as they occur . Such occurrences are personally found to be occurring by the meditators themselves . <p> When imagination or mind-consciousness occurs , the mind that imagines , the sensation that appears and the knowing mind , and all contacts and awareness of thoughts will be found to be vanishing . While imagining , delightful or unpleasant feelings , or feelings of indifference may occur . All these sensations whether good , bad , or neutral are impermanent simply because they arise and then disappear , being transient by nature . <p> All those who are meditating now should note each and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them will be found to be arising and vanishing . Nothing will be found to remain constantly . Their true nature will be realised personally through the mind 's eye . Realisation then comes of their transient nature incessantly appearing and disappearing in a state of flux . Being impermanent , they are unsatisfactory . There is , therefore , no such thing as an individual or a living entity . All these are conditions coming into being and passing away in a ceaseless whirlwind . This is natural phenomena occurring in accordance with their own conditions under different circumstances , and all are arising and vanishing . Hence , they are stated to have the characteristic of impermanence . They are unsatisfactory and never oblige one with what one wishes to happen . They are unmanageable and ungovernable . As such , they are to be contemplated with awareness as being uncontrollable , and as not-self . <p> Then , although they are said to be unsatisfactory or suffering ( dukkha ) , it is not that they are unendurable . What is meant is that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could one rely upon them if they fade away in a split second after emergence ? In fact , every time they vanish , death can take place . If new mind and matter fail to appear , death is inevitable . As this is so , it is really terrifying . For this reason , it is said to be painful , misery , and suffering , and as they appear and disappear on their own because of their phenomenal nature , they are also ungovernable . Since these conditions are uncontrollable , how can they be a self ? Yes , they are truly not-self . The Buddha therefore taught the young monk to contemplate on impermanence , unsatisfactoriness , and not-self . <p> When impermanence , unsatisfactoriness , and not-self are realised , one becomes weary of the vanity of life , or in other words , disgusted with existence ( nibbindati ) . On becoming disgusted with these wearisome conditions , one will be free from craving and attachment ( nibbinda ? virajjati ) . Then , one is fully released or emancipated , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g ? vimuccati ) . When fully liberated in accordance with what has been stated as having destroyed birth ( kh ? ? ? j ? ti ) and having lived the holy life ( vusita ? brahm ? cariya ? ) , and so on , no new existence will take place . The Supreme Buddha gave his teachings up to the stage of Arahantship , saying that one would also come to realise by one 's own personal insight knowledge that one had reached the final goal of practice . While listening attentively to this Dhamma , the sick young monk attained Arahantship . All remorse and regrets were eradicated . <p> It is vital to get rid of all restlessness and remorse as explained above . I exhort all meditators not to become dispirited , though they may not yet be fully accomplished in the practice of the Dhamma . You can all gain realisation of the special Dhamma if you carry on with the contemplation like the sick young monk on his deathbed . This young monk achieved the highest stage of Arahantship . This should serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice before one becomes old or sick , and before death arrives , to dispel anxiety . Remorse will be eradicated on becoming a Non-returner . Nothing further need be said regarding an Arahant . A person who is entirely free from restlessness and remorse is called a sage . <h> Consider Carefully before Speaking <p> Next , one should consider carefully before saying something . Only speak what is proper and appropriate to the occasion . It has been taught as : " Weigh things up before speaking ( mantabh ? ? ? ) , after careful consideration and reflection , and be one who speaks in this way . Avoid talking nonsense , but speak what is suited to the occasion . It is not time-consuming . What is to be spoken will come into one 's head automatically while conversation is going on . Avoidance of making improper and inaccurate statements amounts to weighing things before speaking . If one does so , words that will bring demerits can not come out of one 's mouth . It will have the effect of deterring one from speaking falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor will one slander others or gossip ( pisu ? av ? c ? ) . Harsh or abusive speech ( pharusav ? c ? ) will be avoided too . It is important to tame and control the tongue simply because , if something disagreeable is heard , anger can suddenly arise , possibly leading to the use of aggressive and offensive words that insult others . Vulgar and unbridled speech must be restrained . A person who ponders before speaking is likely to avoid frivolous , trifling , and futile talk ( samphappal ? pa ) . However , it will not be easy for some to abstain from talking foolishly if they are habitually inclined to talk insolently . Those not accustomed to talk rudely seldom slander or insult others . Only appropriate words suited to the occasion should be spoken gently . Words of Dhamma are included in the ten suitable topics for conversation ( kath ? vatthu ) . <p> Speech relating to lack of greed . <p> Speech relating to contentment . <p> Speech on how to remain in solitude for meditation to eradicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour avoiding contact and familiarity with male and female benefactors without attachment . <p> Speech relating to the practise of meditation seriously with relentless exertion . <p> Speech relating to morality . <p> Speech relating to concentration . <p> Speech relating to wisdom . <p> Speech relating to liberation . <p> Speech relating to knowledge and vision of liberation . <p> These are specifically for monks . Lay people need to be talk about business dealings as and when necessary . When talking , only beneficial speech should be used without harming others ' interests . <h> With the Mind Restrained <p> Next , the mind should not be permitted to wander . This requires accomplishment in concentration . To gain concentration , one must practise meditation strenuously . Only when meditating , the mind will remain stable without flitting . While not engaged in meditation , one should continue to maintain mindfulness . The mind shall be restrained to prevent it from flitting here and there . All Arahants possess a tranquil mind that does not stray . An Arahant with peace of mind remains calm with constant concentration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person with serenity of mind . What has just been stated are the noble attributes possessed by a sage . <h> Verse Four <p> The Buddha proceeded to repeat the noble attributes of a sage in the fourth verse : <p> This verse has almost the same meaning as that conveyed in the verse beginning " V ? tata ? ho pur ? bhed ? . " I mention it now briefly to avoid any possible criticism , as it was omitted in my first lecture . <p> The gist of it is that in connection with anything that may happen in the future , one should not speculate with desire , yearning for anticipated results . If this kind of thought anticipating the future occurs it should be rejected by contemplating and noting . If something has happened in the past , such as the destruction of one 's own limbs or sense-organs , or of one 's personal property , or the death of relatives and friends , one is likely to become anxious , tearful , and sad . This worry , regret , and lamentation should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be dispelled by contemplating and noting them . All occurrences of what has been seen , heard , smelt , touched , or imagined , should be realised by contemplating and noting them as governed by the law of impermanence and that they immediately pass away . Having caused suffering and harassment without let up by continuously arising and disappearing , they are not dependable , and do not provide any satisfaction . Thus they should be known and realised as impermanent . Since they depend on conditions , appearing and disappearing according to circumstances , one should know that they are ungovernable and not-self . Contact does not mingle with or concern the nature of impermanence . Neither does it mingle with the nature of pleasure , nor is it a self . This should be fully comprehended . Furthermore , what has been seen , heard , smelt , tasted , and touched has nothing to do with the present sensations arising from such occurrences . It will bring satisfaction with the realisation that what is going to happen after subsequent contacts will be quite separate from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly evident because of the fact that a meditator who is continuously contemplating and noting such transient phenomenal occurrences will find them in a state of flux , appearing and disappearing without a break . <p> Then also , one should not be subjected to persuasion in respect of wrong views . This means that one should practise to free oneself from all kinds of wrong views . The Buddha taught that a person endowed with these attributes is a sage with serenity . <p> One who is accomplished with the four attributes : not anticipating the future , not regretting nor reminiscing about the past , having distinguishing knowledge of seeing , knowing , touching , etc. , and not being persuaded by wrong views , is said to be a sage . This means that a person is recognised as such by the Buddha . <h> Verse Five <p> After explaining this verse , the Blessed One continued to teach as follows : <p> This means that such an individual is inclined to hesitate . He is not pretentious . Neither does he anticipate , long for or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slanderous . A person endowed with such attributes is a sage . To hesitate in performing noble and meritorious deeds is bad . Such reluctance or hesitancy is laziness . Here , the meaning of the word ' hesitate ' is not concerned with defilements . It refers to preventing desires from arising , in cases where passion is likely to occur . As regards ordinary people , they become enthusiastic and invigorated when passion arises . In those who are meditating strenuously , the strength of passion becomes weak commensurate with the different stages of progress in the achievement of the Dhamma . Though passion may appear , it does not become strong and violent . For instance , if the parents have neglected to give due and proper advice to their children , the young children will have no control over themselves , and may utter or behave or do anything according to their own wishful thinking . They will , however , have the power of restraint from the time they have received instructions or parental advice as to how they should conduct themselves in worldly life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their manners as they had been before . The same thing applies in the matter of noble Dhamma . In those who make no effort to enhance their morality and knowledge of the Dhamma through meditation , passion , anger , and delusion will wreak havoc without restraint . People who are following a virtuous path will be able to minimise passion . Shame and fear of doing what is improper will abide in them . Therefore , what has been stated is that a sage would hesitate to do anything that is connected with passion , anger , and delusion . Reluctance to avoid doing unvirtuous things should be cultivated to the best of one 's ability . It is wise to restrain to the extent of totally suppressing passionate desires , anger , and delusion . How could one be said to have calmness of mind and serenity if desire , anger , and delusion are generated with vigour and delight ? <p> Among mankind , it is because of desire , anger , and delusion that heroes and other outstanding individuals have appeared . In this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thereby become famous and distinguished with their inherent lust for power or fame , passion , anger , and delusion , are regarded as outstanding personalities . They are said to have achieved success . On the other hand , from the point of view of Dhamma , it is quite the contrary . They are not regarded as heroes , and only those who dare not perform things connected with the contaminating influence of desire , anger , and delusion are considered to be truly outstanding . If seen from a different angle , they might be regarded as persons who are inferior in strength , will-power , and courage -- who are just mediocre without any ambition . Those who have undertaken meditation practice hesitate to indulge in mundane affairs though they might have been very active , vigorous , and enthusiastic prior to taking up meditation . Some of them may even abandon their worldly activities . It might seem that they have become enfeebled and indolent . Nevertheless , after reaching Arahantship , they will be devoid of worldly desires and defilements , which become extinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend in nothing and always calm . Such hesitation in worldly affairs is another attribute of a sage . <p> It is for those who are meditating or listening to this lecture to weigh things and see for themselves how they have become hesitant in the matter of desire , anger , and delusion . The strength of desire , anger , and delusion will diminish to a certain extent . This is stated as reluctance or hesitancy . Hence , the motto says : " Seemingly hesitant without making pretence . " <h> Make No Pretensions <p> One should not make pretension to evoke awe in others . This was said regarding monks . Pretension aims to make oneself appear worthy of reverence by acting deceptively . There are three kinds of pretence : 1 ) in the way of using property , 2 ) relating to attainment of noble attributes , 3 ) in connection with the way of deportment . <h> 1 . Pretension in the Use of Property <p> When male and female benefactors offer donations , the pretender would say , " Oh , my benefactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am content with robes that have been discarded by others . As regards a monastery , I am content to remain in solitude or dwell at the foot of a tree . For my meals , it is enough to accept what is offered on alms round . In regard to medicine diseases can be cured by drinking cow 's urine as medicine . Extremely good requisites are not required . " After telling the donors that such valuable properties are not wanted , the properties which are donated are stated to have been refused . Such utterances are made under false pretence although the monk may be really fond of the things that are offered . He is in fact willing to accept them . When speaking in the said manner under false pretences , the benefactors ' faith and generosity will be greatly enhanced thinking that the monk is indeed a noble person with hardly any greed . As such , the benefactors will become all the more generous and offer more and more . When things are donated profusely , the pretension monk accepts the offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not gain any merits . " The offerings are then accepted as if he has great compassion for the donors . This kind of pretence concerns monks only . Such pretentious behaviour should be avoided and dispelled . <h> 2 . Pretension Relating to Noble Attributes <p> Under this sub-heading , pretension is by making misleading statements to make others think highly of him as an Arahant saying that a monk who can be content with whatever has been provided , such as robes , a begging bowl , a monastery or other requisites ( like himself ) , is an Arahant or a Noble One . Such kind of insinuation should be avoided . Generally , it concerns the monks . However , at the present day , even among laymen , some impostors present themselves as Non-returners or Arahants , while leading an ignoble life with wife and children , are ridiculed by some for not being liberated from human passions and sensuous pleasures . In refuting such derogatory remarks , they explain that their mode of living is permissible as they enjoy no pleasurable sensations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people revere such pretenders as real Arahants . Such cases are mentioned to make you ponder and be wary . <h> 3 . Pretensions Relating to Deportment <p> Pretension relating to postures or deportment is to make others think one is practising meditation without actually doing the practice . Although lacking in concentration , he moves about as if he is calm and tranquil . He pretends when taking a sitting posture to give a good impression to others who might see him . Or , when walking , he pretend to walk with complete mindfulness . In this way , whatever he does , he will change his deportment to make himself appear noble in the eyes of others who will overestimate his good qualities . Such pretension should be avoided and dispelled . These three kinds of pretensions are dealt with comprehensively in the P ? ? i texts . <h> Do Not Be Envious <p> If one admires fine clothes or jewellery one may yearn to possess similar things . Yearning is of different kinds . Having seen something , one may wish to possess the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplating and noting what is heard , smelt , tasted , touched , or cognised , one may wish to be accomplished like others , to emulate their achievements in Dhamma . This is longing for attainments , and such yearnings should be dispelled . Wishing to reach the abode of devas to enjoy celestial pleasures and the luxurious life of celestial beings either through reading books or listening to others , is another kind of yearning . One should not entertain such feelings . If they do appear , they should be rejected by contemplating and noting . <p> To yearn for the Noble Path is a wholesome desire , which one should cultivate . Those who practise meditation wish to gain the noble attributes of insight knowledge . They are intent on gaining the Path and its Fruition . However , if this desire becomes extreme , it will not be proper . If extreme yearning appears , it should be rejected by contemplating and noting , otherwise concentration will not develop . It is vital to reject such yearning by contemplating and noting it . In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of excessive zeal . Excessive yearning is improper , but if zeal is slack it wo n't do either . It is difficult to maintain the proper balance , but the mind must be restrained within proper limits . <p> The Pa ? isambhid ? magga says that the mind , which is very much inclined towards passion , always follows in pursuit of it . ( Abhinata ? citta ? r ? g ? nupatita ? ) . 10 If one becomes over-enthusiastic to achieve the Path and its Fruition , it amounts to passion trailing behind . This might give a wrong impression of the appearance of a desire to gain merits because he would have in mind that what has been longed for is a virtuous thought in connection with the Noble Path , but in fact , passion is following the mental activities . Moreover , extreme yearning is a danger to concentration . It says : " Ta ? sampaj ? no hutv ? r ? ga ? pajahati . " This means that passionate yearning should be rejected after contemplating and noting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter the development of concentration , it should therefore be rejected . Meditation teachers should correct such thoughts . As concentration gains momentum , such yearnings are bound to arise . The meditator usually wishes to gain speedy accomplishment of the Dhamma . When becoming overzealous , yearning accompanied by mental distress will become exuberant , and the development of concentration is likely to be hindered . <p> One should suppress such thoughts , and keep the mind restrained , calmly reflecting : " Let concentration take its own course . Special knowledge may not be gained even though I make the utmost effort to bring about progress . Insight can not be forced . Under favourable circumstances that occur on their own , knowledge will arise by itself . My business is only to contemplate and note continuously whatever sensations arise from the six sense-doors . I shall therefore simply carry on contemplating and noting these sensations without a break . " <p> If carried out like this , progressive insight through stable concentration will soon be realised . However , yearning should not be dismissed completely by getting disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of disappointment , it would be what is stated as : " Apanata ? citta ? by ? p ? d ? nupatita ? , " which means the mind that shirks will abide in the person who will remain aloof . If yearning is avoided in that way , it will amount to shirking the burden of practice . Then the mind would embrace discontent . All such thoughts should be rejected by contemplating and noting . As such , one should have at least a modicum of yearning relating to Dhamma . If extreme forms of yearning are dispelled by contemplating and noting , progressive knowledge of the Dhamma is likely to be achieved . The motto therefore runs as : " If no pretension is shown as being reluctant , envy is discarded . " One should not be envious . To resent another 's good fortune is meanness ( macchariya ) . Being unsociable and unwilling to befriend others , avaricious and unwilling to share one 's own property , and envious of another 's good fortune is meanness . The Commentary says that meanness will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore meditate diligently to reach that stage . <h> Vulgarity Should Be Avoided <p> The motto says : " Reject vulgarity which is disgusting , without being envious . " One should not be vulgar . Vulgarity comprises three kinds : physical misbehaviour , coarse language or speech , and perverse thoughts . It has been explained for monks as indiscreet or rude behaviour without giving due respect when meeting other monks . Those deserving respect and reverence , may be jostled while walking . One may stand in front of a senior monk , blocking his way , or remain sitting nonchalantly if he enters the room , or pass by while walking , without showing respect . Such behaviour is rude and vulgar . There are cases where seats are occupied in places reserved for the elders , and where some of them would squeeze in making the junior monks feel congested and become uncomfortable . These bad manners are rude and vulgar . This kind of conduct is very disrespectful . There are other bodily behaviours which are ugly and disgusting . Some may spit carelessly , expel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heedless of good manners . People in Burma are , of course , accustomed to those kind of mannerisms which may be excused as being habitual . Foreigners may make a wry face at such indecent mannerisms . <p> In regard to speech , vulgarity is commonplace . Indecent or harsh words obviously run counter to any civilised culture . In an assembly of monks , teaching should be done only when granted permission by the elders . To join in a group discussion without invitation is considered uncivilized . All such misbehaviour should be avoided . <p> As regards vulgarity or corruption of the mind , the occurrence of wild and evil thoughts without proper restraint is regarded as vulgar . Competing with others in personal status and social standing , and putting oneself on an equal footing with others of higher status is considered to be vulgar mental behaviour . This , of course , concerns laymen or ordinary persons . However , in connection with the matter relating to Dhamma , a person may speak ill of others without having purity of morality , if thought or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished with purity of morals . Or , he may consider himself as being equal in ability to others who can practise ascetic practices , while he himself is lacking in any such practice . Or he may think of himself as being accomplished in scriptural knowledge placing himself on equal footing with other more learned scholars , though he himself has not studied the Commentaries and Subcommentaries . Some individuals may think of themselves as being equal in to those who are meditating though they themselves are unable to meditate and contemplate . All these are instances of mental vulgarity . <p> Reject vulgar thoughts if they occur by contemplating and noting them . However , if morality , concentration , and wisdom have been methodically practised , no vulgar thoughts will have the opportunity to arise . Those who are well-accomplished will be free from vulgar thoughts . If they do happen to occur , they can easily be dispelled by contemplating and noting . <p> All behaviour that is disgusting and rude should be completely dispelled . Here , what is disgusting or rude refers to immorality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thoughts and deeds . A vagabond arouses disgust in others who may harbour strong feelings of dislike . People do not wish to mix with a person who is dirty in ways of living , dress , or in thoughts . A person whose morality is polluted will be detested by people who have a pure mind . If a person of pure morality associates with a wicked person , others may think of him as being the same . They shun the evil-minded because they are disgusted with immoral persons . However , it is not out of hatred . Such disgusting immorality must be got rid of . <p> Morality means observance of precepts by which one should refrain from committing improper acts both physically and verbally . To eradicate these immoral acts , one should earnestly practise meditation . The Buddha 's dispensation is where holy persons dwell in peace . It can be considered in that light . This dispensation is the abode of Noble Ones with purity of mind like Venerable S ? riputta , Venerable Moggall ? na , Venerable Mah ? kassapa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also sincerely practise to become pure in mind like these Noble Ones . If morality is observed , all disgusting factors will disappear . This observance , however , is not as yet the practice of meditation . Those who have come to this meditation centre are fulfilling the need to acquire concentration and wisdom , not only morality . Therefore , both their physical and mental behaviours are really courteous and worthy of reverence . If , by practising to get accomplished in noble qualities , one becomes free from all loathsome misdemeanours , one is deemed to be regarded as a sage who is calm and serene . The motto goes on to say : " Disgust and rudeness are wholly shattered . Words devoid of love and fondness shall not be uttered . " <p> Backbiting causes discord . No vile words should be spoken to create a dissolution of friendship between one person and another who are on good terms . If malicious thoughts arise intending to slander , they should be either discarded as improper by seeing them as such , or rejected by contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in worldly affairs . In connection with sensations likely to occur concerning passion , one must be reluctant to prevent such passions from arising . Similarly , reluctance should be minimized in connection with anger , pride , or other defilements that may occur . Practice should be done to let all cravings and vehement desires become subdued or dormant . <p> Next , making no pretence means not to pretend to possess attributes that one does not really have . Pretension should not be made to having finer attributes than those that one truly possesses . This is relevant to monks as well as others who deserve reverence and respect . Monks should refrain from claiming the attributes of morality , concentration , and wisdom that they do not truly possess . They should not boast about these attributes to earn reverence from benefactors . Monks who are genuinely modest usually remain silent regarding their own virtues . An Arahant will usually conceal his attainment of the Dhamma , and reveal it to his fellow monks only on the eve of his parinibb ? na . Next , no yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments . It also conveys the sense that a meditator should avoid extreme yearning to attain special Dhamma , because that will hinder the development of concentration and wisdom . The matter concerning free from envy has already been explained quite clearly . <p> " Disgust and rudeness be wholly shattered " means , to avoid and reject all forms of aggressive or gross forms of physical , verbal , and mental behaviour . Disgusting moral impurities should also be dispelled . Then it says , " Words devoid of love and fondness shall not be uttered . " It is also necessary to abstain from backbiting and slander to cause others to lose confidence or respect , or create dissension among any group of individuals . These are the seven attributes of a sage who remains tranquil . <h> Verse Six <p> I have already explained the answers given in four verses . I will now start with answering the sixth verse . 11 <p> A person should not indulge in and drift towards sensations connected with sensual pleasures . This is one of the attributes . Another attribute is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other attribute is to be gentle and devoid of vulgarity in bodily , verbal , and mental behaviour . The next attribute is to be wise , that is , to be endowed with knowledge that will enable him to understand problems relating to study and practice . Moreover , one should not become completely dependent on others . This is also one of the attributes . This discourse , being for those of great intellect and sound wisdom , contains some expressions that are profound . Since it is said not to repose complete confidence in others , it would perhaps amount to inhibiting faith and generosity . This expression is a riddle . I will explain it later . Then , the words " na virajjati " which means not yet free from clinging attachment . ( This expression has a double-meaning in that the usage " not as yet free from clinging attachment " may carry the meaning as " still having clinging attachment . " It is not , however , intended to convey that sense . The expression " not yet free from clinging attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping desires . " Since totally devoid of such clinging attachment , it means that no further practice needs to be done . ) This also is one of the attributes . Buddha had taught thus : " I say that such a person is a tranquil sage . " A person who is fully endowed with such attributes is a sage . The Buddha stated that he gave due recognition to such an individual . This is really worthy of noting and bearing in mind . The practice of meditation is also included in this verse . <p> To make the above statements easily understandable , the motto that is couched in plain language , may be recited as follows : <p> " Not drifting into the current of pleasurable sensations , with pride dispelled and gentleness maintained , gaining wisdom , incredulous , cravings detached by clearing away , these six attributes are his glorious array . " <p> " Not drifting into the current of pleasurable sensations " means : not to be mentally inclined towards pleasurable sensations with attachment . " With pride dispelled and gentleness maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pride , assuming others to be inferior , and so having a low opinion of them . " Gentleness maintained " is to be refined in physical , verbal , and mental behaviour by dispelling all rude and vulgar manners . " Gaining wisdom , incredulous , cravings detached by clearing away " means to easily understand with ready wit all profound questions relating to study and practice , and to gain person realisation , not solely placing trust in others ; and to be free from craving . A total of six attributes are embraced in this verse , and they constitute the six noble attributes . <h> Not Drifting towards Pleasurable Sensations <p> The expression " Not drifting into the current of pleasurable sensations " may be elaborated in this way . Pleasurable sensations give delight to people who crave what is desirable . Beautiful sights , melodious sounds , fragrant odours , delicious food , delightful touches , and inspiring ideas are desirable . Delightful sensations naturally attract one to gravitate towards them . Those who are not yet free from the fetters of defilements , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , therefore , allow your mind to drift into this current of pleasurable sensations . Every time the mind drifts towards them , restrain it by contemplating and noting . <p> Regarding those who have no control over their mind , the raging torrent of defilements will be rushing into the sensations of sight through the eye-door . The ear , the nose , the tongue , the body , and the mind will , likewise , flow in a torrent into all the respective sensations of sound , odour , taste , touch , and imagination . It is like a torrent of flood-water in a mountain stream flowing down to a lower level when it rains heavily . In P ? ? i this flowing is called " ? sava . " This human passion or mental defilement is of four kinds : sensuality ( k ? m ? sava ) , becoming ( bhav ? sava ) , wrong views ( di ? ? h ? sava ) , and ignorance ( avijj ? sava ) . As far as this verse is concerned , it refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stream of pleasurable sensation . In essence , they are passionate desire . <h> Flowing to the Highest Existence <p> This passionate desire flows up to the highest formless realm , if stated with reference to abodes . From the point of view of the nature of Dhamma , it flows right up to maturity knowledge ( gotrabh ? ? ? a ) , a stage where the mind inclines towards the Path , its Fruition , and nibb ? na . The highest and the noblest existence is called " bhavagga . " To understand this highest and noblest abode , one must know about the intermediate and lowest forms of existences . Of the thirty-one realms of existence , the lowest are hell ( naraka ) , hungry ghosts ( peta ) , animals ( tiracch ? na ) , and the world of jealous gods ( as ? r ? ) , which together form the four lower realms ( ap ? ya ) . The lowest of them all is hell . Of all the hells , the lowest level is known as Av ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a libation ceremony , it is usually stated as from the highest existence ( bhavagga ) to the lowest ( Av ? ci ) . <p> The human world is higher in the scale of existences than the four lower realms . Above that are the six celestial realms ( devaloka ) in order of precedence : C ? tumah ? r ? jika , T ? vati ? sa , Y ? ma , Tusita , Nimm ? narati , and Paranimmitavasavatti . In the six celestial realms , as in the human world , both male and female beings are present . There , all pleasures of sense are enjoyed in abundance . Above the celestial realms , there are three abodes of the first jh ? na . Though it is said to have three stages in the world of brahmas , they are on the same plane . They are called three abodes depending upon the three types of brahmas residing in that world . Extending above that , there are three abodes of the second jh ? na . They too are on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brahmas it is stated to be three abodes . Beyond that abode , come three abodes of the third jh ? na . These are also on the same plane inhabited by three kinds of brahmas . Above the abodes of third jh ? na , there exists the world of fourth jh ? na . The lowest stage in this realm is inhabited by two kinds of brahmas : Vehapphala and Asaasatta . This is also to be called the two abodes . <p> Out of these two kinds of brahmas , Vehapphala brahmas like other brahmas , have both mind and matter . Therefore , the Vehapphala brahma and the nine other kinds of brahmas belonging to the lower three abodes or heavens , altogether ten kinds of brahmas , can come down to devaloka and the human world to listen to the teachings of the Buddha . They also have the ability to teach . What is special about them is that they have no masculine or feminine sexual characteristics . Though their facial features contain the shape or figure of a nose , they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed the figure of a tongue , but have no sense of taste . They have the body but not tactile , without the sense of touch . They possess no parts or limbs of the body which are vile to be able to enjoy the depraved forms of sensuous pleasures , such as , the sensations of smell , taste , and touch . This is pretty good . They have eyes and ears and are therefore capable of developing merits . That is why they can revere and worship the Buddha , and listen to the Dhamma . Apart from that , since they possess mind , they can practise the Dhamma . So the majority of these brahmas attained special Dhamma when they heard the discourse delivered by the Buddha . It is indeed very fine . In the case of Asaasatta brahmas , they do not have the knowing mind that brings consciousness . They have only material form . It may be similar to the carved images hewn out of wood or marble . Since they are deprived of mind they have no consciousness . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility . They can not even shake . They are like lifeless images . They are therefore not aware of the appearance of Buddhas . Nor can they listen to the Dhamma . After the life span of five-hundred aeons is exhausted , they die and return to their original abodes in the human world or the celestial realms . For them there is absolutely no benefit . That is why the Asa ? satta is included in the eight faulty abodes . <p> Above the Vehapphala and Asaasatta abodes , come the realms of Suddh ? v ? sa , having five different levels in serial order , populated only by Non-returners and Arahants . The names of these realms are : Aviha , Atappa , Sudassa , Sudass ? and Akani ? ? ha . These five realms of form , being inhabited only by the Non-returners and Arahants , who are free from any attachment that can relegate them to the lower sensual realms , are known as the pure abodes ( Suddh ? v ? sa ) . The inhabitants are collectively called Suddh ? v ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sa abodes , there are the abodes of formless brahmas ( ar ? pabrahm ? loka ) , consisting of four levels : the sphere of infinite space ( ak ? s ? nanc ? yat ? na ? ) , the sphere of infinite consciousness ( vi ? ? ac ? -yatana ? ) , the sphere of nothingness ( akica ? yatana ? ) , and the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception ( nevasa ? -n ? sa ? yatana ? ) . In these formless realms , the brahmas have no bodily forms , but are mere radiance endowed with intelligence , and with mind and matter . Being formless without material aggregates , they are invisible . They can neither see , nor hear , nor appear before the Buddha to listen to the Dhamma . Ordinary beings who reach this abode will revert to the human world or the devaloka when their life-span expires . They derive no benefits , so these abodes of formless brahmas are included in what are known as the eight unfavourable existences . Beings living in such abodes will miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Noble Ones can progress on the path of the Dhamma while residing in these abodes . Stream-winners , Once-returners , and Non-returners who are reborn in such abodes can attain Arahantship through the proper method of contemplation and by practising mindfulness which they have learnt before , and while living in these abodes they will eventually attain parinibb ? na . Of the four formless realms , the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception is the highest and noblest existence ( bhavagga ) . The clinging mind flooded with pleasurable sensations is likely to flow into the realm of thirty-one abodes beginning from the lowest Av ? ci hell , to the highest abode of neither perception nor non-perception . Because of its tendency to flow into the pool of passionate desires , it is called ? s ? va in terms of abode . Since , it is expressed as " anass ? vi " according to the verse , it may be stated as " ass ? va . " Hence , passionate desire called " ass ? va , " which tends to drift along should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let oneself drift towards any of the thirty-one abodes , with pleasurable attachment . <h> Is Hell Pleasurable ? <p> In this regard , a question may arise . Is it possible for pleasurable attachment to despicable existences , to occur , since hell is the worst abode among the thirty-one different realms of existence , and the worlds of hungry ghosts , jealous gods , and animals are obviously inferior and ignoble ? The answer is quite simple . It is true that a person who knows hell and how bad it is , will surely have no yearning for it . However , one who is not aware of hell will become attached to it with passionate desire . This is evident if considered in the light of what had happened to Mittavindaka . <p> At one time , a person by the name of Mittavindaka left his home after offending his own mother verbally and disrespectfully , and was roving about like the present-day youngsters playing truant . While thus roaming about aimlessly , he reached a wharf at a seaport , and boarded a ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the ship got into trouble on the high seas , the ship 's crew believed there must be a vicious person among them who had committed a serious fault . They devised a method of drawing lots by which the vicious person could be identified . Mittavindaka , having drawn the short straw , was set adrift on a raft . From that moment the ship began to sail smoothly . While drifting in the ocean , Mittavindaka , by virtue of merits derived from having observed moral precepts in a previous existence , reached a palatial mansion , an abode of four female hungry ghosts . Though they were hungry ghosts , their abode was the results of mixed merits and demerits . They enjoyed the pleasures of devas for a period of seven days , and then for the next seven days they had to endure various kinds of severe pain and suffering , similar to those in hell . After arriving at this abode , Mittavindaka was very well looked after during the first seven days . Then after the period of warm reception was over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in that abode and wait for them for seven days telling him that after expiry of that duration , they would come back and that in the meantime , they had to leave the place to undergo torment in hell . Mittavindaka , however , refused to comply with their request and left , floating away on the small raft . With his good fortune still smiling on him for his virtuous kamma of the past , he again reached the abode of eight hungry ghosts . After a period of seven days ' sojourn as in the former case , he left and like this passed through the abode of sixteen hungry ghosts , eventually reaching the abode of thirty-two hungry ghosts . He put up at that abode for seven days as previously , and then proceeded from there on his journey . Finally , he landed on an island of Hell in the sea for having done wrong , a demeritorious act , to his mother . While he was walking about on the island , he found a person whose neck was chopped off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out profusely from the neck which had been cut , and the person was found shouting at the top of his voice and crying bitterly in great pain and suffering . <h> Wrong Notion of Bad as Being Good <p> The above sub-heading in the original Burmese version of the lecture is a well-known proverb which may be literally translated as " The hell of a fiery flower is wrongly conceived as a heavenly fine flower . " Finding the man being subjected to immense suffering in hell , Mittavindaka had a different opinion as to why the person was screaming and yelling despite the fact that he was adorned with an extremely beautiful flower on his head . He imagined how nice it would be if he were to have this big pretty flower stuck on his head . Referring to this incident , sages of the past had provided us with a proverb : " The hell of a fiery flower was wrongly conceived as a heavenly fine flower . " He therefore told the man , " Please give me that full-bloom flower on your neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus : " I could not possibly dodge the terrible knife when it is about to fall right on my neck to slice it off . The thing on the back of my neck is not a golden flower but a sharp blade of a machine-driven knife . It is really terrible . Please do not wish to suffer that great pain and misery . " However , Mittavindaka did not believe the man 's words . He therefore retorted , " My friend , I have seen that big flower with my own eyes . Do n't tell me lies . Perhaps the way you have just spoken to me was probably because you are unwilling to offer me that flower . You must have worn this big flower on your head for a long time . " Mittavindaka persistently asked the man to yield to his request and hand over the flower to him . This repeated utterance made that condemned man reflect : " This man is driven by awfully bad kamma just like me . It seems that the time has arrived for me to get released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , he conceded , saying . " Well , my friend , since you want that flower , you may have it now . " So saying , he threw the automatic knife to fall onto Mittavindaka . The moment it came to rest on the back of his neck , the mechanical device started to function on its own , cutting off his neck . Only then , Mittavindaka realised that it was not a golden flower at all , as he had thought , but a terrible cutting machine with a sharp blade . Now he was helpless and could not get away from it . As long as his bad kamma was not exhausted , he was cruelly cut by the automatic knife . <p> Considering this tragic episode , it is obvious that those who have unwholesome kamma , not knowing that hell is terrible , would probably think of it as pleasurable . Then also curiously enough , although one may know what hell really is , when he himself has become an inmate of hell , he could find delight and pleasure in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be inclined to find happiness though he might even consider hell as undesirable . This amounts to taking pleasure in the hellish aggregates . It is therefore clear enough that pleasurable attachment to hell itself is caused by this clinging desire and that the very clinging desire is drifting towards the hellish aggregates . <h> The Abode of Hungry Ghosts Also Seems Pleasurable <p> Some hungry ghosts suffer misery almost as much as those in hell . A hungry ghost also finds existence pleasurable . Since they are indulging in matrimonial affairs among their own kind , there is hardly any doubt that they have their own pleasurable attachment to one another who have the same fate and are living a similar existence . Moreover , among hungry ghosts , there are some known as Vem ? nika Petas who , because of the effects of mixed merits and demerits , are suffering all day long but enjoying pleasures at night time , or undergoing suffering for seven days , and then becoming enraptured with pleasurable life during the next seven days , alternately . When the turn of meritorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as devas do . Therefore , even an ordinary person who has come across such pleasurable conditions , would have delightful attachment to such a low existence . Jealous gods are somewhat similar to hungry ghosts . <h> Animals Also Enjoy Their Own Existences <p> Among animals , there are dragons of the N ? ga world , which have supernormal powers . It was stated that during the life-time of our Buddha , a daughter of the king of dragons , named Erakapatta created herself as a human and then danced while singing a riddle . It was mentioned that having heard an announcement made by the king of dragons conveying the news that anybody who could solve the riddle would be given his daughter 's hand in marriage , the number of people who visited the place wishing to get the dragon princess as a wife , was so large that there was hardly space to stand . In the Bh ? ridatta J ? taka also , mention was made that children were born of the two parents , the father being a human prince , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Campeyya J ? tak a , it was stated that the Bodhisatta , having yearned for the existence of a dragon , had indeed been reborn as a dragon . In the Vidhura J ? taka , a deva of an inferior type belonging to the lowest celestial abode , by the name of Pu ? ? aka , was said to have fallen in love with a female dragon . He carried off a renowned sage by the name of Vidhura to the realm of dragons as prompted by his sweetheart , the female dragon , and her parents . Hence , it can not be disputed that one can be attracted to the animal kingdom , with pleasurable attachment impelled by desire . People keep dogs as family pets caressing them with love and attachment . In the same way , other kinds of animals are brought up with affectionate care and attention . These are all pleasurable attachments . <p> If a person , who moulds his destiny according to the law of kamma , by force of unwholesome kamma , is reborn as an animal such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , or elephant , then pleasurable attachment to the physical self in any kind of existence is bound to take place , wherever he may be reborn . Pleasurable attachment with delight also occurs in the company of those belonging to the same worldly existence . This can definitely be known with reference to the Campeyya J ? taka . Having seen the remarkably high status and charming appearance of Campeyya , the king of dragons , who had come in the guise of a human with all pomp and splendour to pay reverence to his father , the great hermit , the Bodhisatta was greatly enchanted . Accordingly , he had a longing to become the king of dragons . He was therefore reborn as Campeyya , the king of dragons , after his death . Initially , after his rebirth in the new existence , when he found that he possessed the despicable body of a snake , he was said to be greatly depressed and disappointed . However , no sooner had he become a dragon amidst the pleasant company of a retinue of young female dragons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and dancing to the accompaniment of music , his dejection and sorrow evaporated as he was dominated by pleasurable sensations derived from the pageantry and rejoicing . Hence , the presence of pleasurable attachment or clinging to one 's own existence is common to everyone . No further comment is necessary relating to the pleasurable and luxurious life in the abodes of human beings and devas . Even the lives of brahmas afford them pleasure and delight in their own way . <p> Followers of other religions desire such brahma realms under the false belief that such abodes are paradise , a divine state of supreme bliss free from old age , suffering , and death . During the life-time of the Buddha , a brahma god by the name of Baka , assumed that his abode was eternal , devoid of old age , suffering , and death . He even invited the Blessed One to his heavenly place with great delight and satisfaction . Without even entertaining such thoughts , some have been enjoying their lives there for having found happiness with longevity . One of the brahmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being and passing away in so short a time with a brief span of life , was said to be teaching with eagerness to practise mental development in order to reach their abode of brahma and to be able to live long , as : " One should earnestly endeavour to practise for the attainment of jh ? na by which sensual desire can be dispelled similar to a person who would have tried in emergency to pull out the spear which is pierced through and stuck in the vital part of his body at the mouth of the abdomen , or to extinguish the burning fire on his head . " <p> However , a question may arise if pleasurable sensations will occur in the Suddh ? v ? sa abode which is inhabited only by noble persons whose minds are purified . Even in this abode , Non-returners not yet free from desire for existence find pleasure in their own existences . <p> Moreover , ordinary people , Stream-winners , Once-returners , and Non-returners , take delight in the formless brahma realms . In the formless realms where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , some people have thought of it as nibb ? na , and crave for it . <h> ? ? ? ra K ? l ? ma and Udaka R ? maputta <p> Immediately after his renunciation of worldly pleasures , the Bodhisatta practised meditation under the guidance of the great hermits ? ? ? ra and Udaka learning the method of practising jh ? na , that these hermits were then practising to reach the heavens of the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception , thinking that these realms were free from suffering . They were also teaching others with this misconception . The Bodhisatta , however , was aware that the achievement of jh ? na is not the right way to attain nibb ? na . That is why he abandoned them , and sought for the true Dhamma , eventually gaining Enlightenment . After becoming an Omniscient Buddha , when he thought to deliver his first discourse , he came to know through his divine eye that the two hermits , ? ? ? ra and Udaka had unfortunately passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they thought of as being nibb ? na . <p> Since these heavenly abodes are formless , the inhabitants residing there can not listen to discourses . Such abodes have a very long life-span . The life-span in the realm of nothingness is sixty-thousand world cycles , and in the realm of neither perception nor non-perception it is eighty-thousand world cycles . After the expiry of the respective life-span , they will die , and revert to the human world . However , by then the Buddha 's dispensation will have long since faded out . So the attainment of the Path , its Fruition , and nibb ? na is remote from them . The Blessed One therefore said that it was a tremendous loss for them . In view of these facts , if spoken of in terms of abodes , craving with pleasurable desires is likely to drift from the lowest abode of Av ? ci up to the highest existence . Therefore , to prevent drifting in the current of existence , insight meditation must be practiced . <h> Likely to Drift Up to Maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhamma , tends to drift right up until the stage of maturity knowledge . Looking at it from the aspect of phenomena , it clings with delight to all phenomena within the domain of sensual pleasures . It grasps at realms of form and formless realms with the lofty and virtuous qualities of jh ? na . That is to say that craving continues with delight and attachment right up to maturity knowledge , which occurs close to the attainment of the Noble Path . It also tends towards and holds onto all pleasurable sensations that arise at every moment of seeing , hearing , contacting , and knowing . One who is practising to gain form and formless jh ? nas , has a desire for their achievement . Moreover , one continues to find pleasure with clinging attachment in jh ? na when it is achieved . <p> One who is practising insight meditation eagerly expects to gain good concentration before concentration becomes strong . Then , when mental tranquility becomes stable , pleasurable sensations associated with concentration occur . Again , while the power of contemplation and noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it becomes strengthened , one is happy with joy and attachment to what is good . One who is not yet able to distinguish between mind and matter is eager to know their distinctive features . When it is known , one takes delight and pleasure in the knowing-mind . One then inclines to know the characteristics of impermanence , etc. , and when appreciated as such , one is greatly satisfied with this insight knowledge during the continual process of contemplating and noting . At the stage of arising and passing away ( udayabbaya- ? ? a ) , when brilliant light or radiance are found or visualized , one is likely to become extremely satisfied with rapture , tranquility , bliss , and confidence in respect of this insight knowledge , which occurs with great speed . <p> Briefly stated , when reaching the stage of equanimity about formations , all sensations that need be contemplated and noted will appear one after another automatically without making any special effort . Sensations that may occur will be automatically realised with ease and comfort without exertion . This fine realisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at a stretch without losing momentum . This progressive insight gained by contemplation will also be looked upon with pleasurable attachment . When this knowledge of equanimity about formations becomes fully strengthened , all noting and awareness will take place in an accelerated motion , and will be found pleasant in its own peculiar way . This is known as insight leading to emergence ( vu ? ? h ? nag ? mini ? ? a ) , which also may be found pleasurable . Noting will then becomes fast , and while insight knowledge is continuously occurring , consciousness will appear inclined towards nibb ? na where all mental and physical formations cease . This realisation and mental inclination will bring about the knowledge of the Path and its Fruition , which will move towards the experience of nibb ? na . In this way , path and fruition consciousness glimpses nibb ? na . Thereafter , knowledge of reviewing ( paccavekkha ? a- ? ? a ) occurs . <p> Among what has so happened , the nature of the mind that inclines towards nibb ? na is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reviewing , pleasurable attachment to maturity knowledge can also take place . After that , nibb ? na -- where all formations cease -- and the consciousness of the path and fruition that realise cessation , are not obvious as being pleasurable . Only the nature of cessation is clearly known . Hence , no pleasurable attachment to the path , its fruition , and nibb ? na can arise . Pleasurable attachment can only happen up to the earlier stage of maturity knowledge . That is the why it has been stated that craving desires drift up to maturity knowledge . <h> Resembles a Wealth-conscious Person <p> Without being well-accomplished in Dhamma by personally practising meditation , some may talk with ego or conceit . They offer advice not to get involved in any kind of sense-pleasures and not to crave for anything pleasurable . This kind of talk may be considered valuable if made by a credible person at the right time . However , if one who talks in that way is a person without any dependable knowledge of the Dhamma by which he can aspire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human beings or devas , it would be highly improper . Furthermore , if he himself is still clinging to trivial pleasures of life , it will be inappropriate for him to talk like that . Some may slander others , criticising , finding fault , and disparaging contemplation and noting of all phenomena arising at the six sense-doors are mere tranquility . Such derogatory speech might be due to ignorance regarding the distinguishing features of tranquility and insight . It may also be due to impudence , not knowing that tranquility meditation is a fundamental exercise practised by the Buddhas and Noble Ones . Such people talk with vanity , thinking highly of themselves without any basic knowledge of the Dhamma . They may be likened to a person who assumes himself as a man of substance without possessing any wealth or property and also without the ability to conduct any business enterprise considering the venture as one below his dignity and financial standing . Any Kind of Merit Should Be Cultivated <p> Any kind of meritorious deed that will lead to nibb ? na is something worth doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts indicate that the method of contemplating and noting every phenomenon arising from the six sense-doors is tranquility meditation . It is only mentioned as amounting to insight meditation . <p> Not to enjoy pleasure and yearn for it is easier said then done . From the practical point of view , it is extremely difficult to restrain oneself from enjoyment . It is because the defilement of craving , which is susceptible to enjoyment and inclined to generate passionate desires , and is likely to drift along with delightful sensations up to the highest realm of existence if described in terms of abodes , and up to maturity knowledge , with reference to the Dhamma . As such , in regard to one who has practised meditation to achieve jh ? na , craving and attachment to such an achievement , which arose before that attainment , can occur . After the attainment of jh ? na , the meditator again takes pleasure in what has been achieved . As regards a meditator indulging in the practice of insight , the mind is not at rest or tranquil at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindrances to the progress of concentration . The mind is then still polluted . So the meditator is eager gain purity of mind and concentration . He or she also wishes to make good progress in noting with serenity , without the mind going astray . Then again , when noting can be done vigorously and effectively with a calm mind , he or she finds is delighted with being able to note thoroughly and satisfactorily . While contemplating , the mind remains calm and fixed , continually dwelling on the objects that ought to be noted , without wandering and flitting . The object that is noted change constantly , but the mind that is noting remains stable . The mind is calm and steady without deviating from the point to which it is directed . This is called momentary concentration for insight ( vipassan ? -kha ? ika-sam ? dhi ) . It is similar to access concentration ( upac ? ra sam ? dhi ) obtained through tranquility meditation . Hence , it is to be called purity of mind ( citta visuddhi ) . When the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and mind , are distinguished . It becomes clear that the sense-object that is noted is one thing , and the knowing mind is another . This means that analytical knowledge of body and mind ( n ? ma-r ? pa-pariccheda- ? ? a ) occurs , and the two distinctive features are clearly known in the act of noting . Then satisfaction arises regarding the insight that is gained . <p> As one proceeds with contemplating and noting , awareness becomes clear that phenomena are merely arising and passing away in an instant being governed by the law of cause and effect , and that everything is impermanent , unsatisfactory , and unreliable . In the process of contemplating and noting , realisation comes with satisfaction that all these are mere natural phenomena without any self or living entity . Brilliant lights will also be visualized , and both body and mind will be pervaded with intense joy , happiness , and rapture . These experiences are also regarded as delightful . All such feelings must also be contemplated , noted , and then rejected . After rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight will deepen , leading to the knowledge of dissolution ( bha ? ga- ? ? a ) regarding every object of awareness , and the awareness itself at every moment of noting . In brief , if further contemplation is made , insight will gradually develop right up to knowledge of equanimity about formation s ( sa ? kh ? rupekkha- ? ? a ) . How this knowledge arises will be explained at length later . On reaching this stage , noting becomes very easy , smooth , and gentle without making any special effort , with awareness occurring spontaneously and incessantly . This constant awareness is also appreciated by the meditator with delight . <h> Maturity Knowledge Can Be Pleasurable <p> If the pleasurable sensations that have arisen have been rejected , and if contemplating and noting is continuous , insight will progress to a stage where the Noble Path can be achieved . On reaching this stage , noting accompanied by awareness will automatically become accelerated . While becoming aware in this way , the insight knowledge inclines towards the sensation of formations . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way stated and flows into the cessation of formations . This realisation is the Path and its Fruition . At that moment , there is no chance for pleasurable attachment or craving to arise . The arising of path and fruition knowledge ( magga-phala ? ? a ) , which have penetrated into the nature of cessation does not also afford any opportunity to think of any pleasurable condition . As such , there can not be any pleasurable attachment to those Dhammas conditioning the Path , its Fruition , and nibb ? na . However , the mind that has become very active and has arisen earlier with insight towards the cessation known as maturity knowledge , may be regarded as pleasurable if and when reflection is made retrospectively . There can also be expectations before realisation of these insight knowledges . For this reason , it has been stated that , according to Dhamma , this pleasurable attachment of craving , can flow right up to maturity knowledge . <p> What has now been taught describes the way in which the flood of craving drifts into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or harmful cravings are indeed truly awful . Therefore do not permit this craving to drift along and to arise . To prevent it from drifting and arising , all sensations that occur should be continuously contemplated and noted without any break . If contemplation is done continuously , since any object will vanish immediately after it is seen , the realisation will dawn that it is impermanent ( anicca ) , unsatisfactory ( dukkha ) and not-self ( anatta ) . Similarly , it will be truly realised as such at the moment of hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , and knowing . Hence , nothing will be found to be pleasurable . It is only because of one 's own inability to contemplate and note , and to know the truth , that sensations arising from the six sense-bases are erroneously thought of as being pleasurable . If so considered as pleasurable , suffering will follow in train with worry and anxiety over all of these sensations . <h> Gestation for Seven Years and Seven Days <p> During the life-time of the Buddha , a lady by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a royal family was pregnant for seven years instead of the usual period of nine or ten months , as the result of an unwholesome deed done in a previous life . During labour , she had to endure great pain and suffering for seven days continuously before giving birth to a son . The child was a prodigy who was later to become an eminent elder -- Venerable S ? vali . In one of their previous existences , these two were the queen and son of the king of Benares . At that time the king of Kosala invaded the kingdom of Benares , and after his annexation of that country , he put the king of Benares to death . The Queen , however , was made one of his wives . Her son fled , and after rallying a mighty armed force , advanced towards Benares in an attempt to reoccupy it . Taking advice from his mother , he laid siege to the city and sent a message to the king of Kosala asking whether he would surrender or fight a battle . The king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The citizens , being able to bring food and other supplies into the city through a small gate in the city wall , were quite at ease . On receipt of further advice from his mother , the prince blocked all of the city gates , large and small . After seven days ' siege , the citizens revolted and killed the king . Thereafter , they proclaimed the young prince as their monarch . For this evil deed in laying siege to the city , the prince had to suffer in hell for innumerable years . In his final existence , he had to remain in his mother 's womb for seven years . Moreover , for having closed all the gaps in the city wall for seven days without leaving any loop-hole , he had to endure immense suffering for seven days at the time of his birth as a result of his past bad kamma . The effect of unwholesome kamma is truly terrible ! <p> As a mark of honour for having given birth to a healthy son , a ceremony was held by offering alms food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venerable S ? riputta beckoned the infant prince to come nearer to him and spoke to him . Although this child was newly born , he was seven years old . Therefore , he was able to understand what was said . Not only that , he could already speak and walk . Venerable S ? riputta asked the young child , " How are you son ? Did you suffer pain and misery staying so long in your mother 's womb ? Was it not terrible ? " S ? vali replied , " Yes , Venerable sir . It was indeed terrible . " Having heard her son 's reply , Suppav ? s ? was overjoyed and thought , " My son is outstanding . Just imagine , he can ably answer on the Dhamma even to an eminent elder like Venerable S ? riputta . " At this point , the Blessed One asked , " My dear daughter Suppav ? s ? , are you willing to have another son like S ? vali , if it were possible ? " Suppav ? s ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have seven like him . " Hearing her reply , the Buddha uttered this verse : <p> " Anything that is neither good ( as ? ta ? ) nor delightful ( appiya ? ) , seeming to be good ( s ? tar ? pena ) and delightful ( piyar ? pena ) , makes a heedless person ( pamatta ? ) suffer immensely ( ativattati ) . " <h> Deceiving by Pretending to Be Pleasant <p> In this regard , the word ' heedless ' does not mean " not being conscious of something . " It means becoming careless without the mindfulness usually acquired by meditators who are contemplating and noting with awareness . Such a heedless person is said to be preoccupied with trivial matters that seem pleasurable . It is like an imposter practising deception on a simple person . Do you understand this point ? Suppav ? s ? had undergone a great deal of suffering for seven years to get a son , and had to suffer pain for seven days during labour , yet she still wanted such a son for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the fact that she had found pleasure in what was actually suffering , because of her ignorance of the noble Dhamma . This shows that what is unpleasant has been deceiving under the guise of being pleasant . Whom does it ill-treat ? The answer is that it ill-treats a heedless person . The question then arises how one should properly reflect or bear in mind . Reflection should be made with mindfulness bearing in mind that all these unsatisfactory things are , in fact , stressful , painful and suffering . The cause leading to such suffering should also be reflected upon and fully realised . From the worldly point of view , one who is lazy and negligent in connection with business matters and livelihood , and hopes to succeed , without effort or taking care , is heedless . It may be said that he or she has no wisdom regarding the results to be expected . Such a simple person can easily become a victim to unscrupulous swindlers . <p> From the Dhamma point of view , one is heedless and lacking insight , overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinking about merits and demerits for future existences in sa ? s ? ra . Sensual pleasures , which last only for the duration of this life-time , under the guise of having great value , will swindle a heedless person . A heedless person will be unaware of the deception until on the threshold of death . To others , realisation comes only in the next existence after death . <h> Kammic Effects Known after Death <p> In the country of Surattha during the time of King Dhamma Asoka , there lived a general by the name of Nandaka . He believed in the false doctrine that there was no result of kamma , and no future existences . Hence , his personal endeavours were limited to the extent of deriving worldly benefits during his life-time . When he passed away , he became a hungry ghost ( peta ) within the confines of a forest named Vindhy ? . Then only he came to realise personally that there really exists the law of kamma with its causes and effects , and future existences after death , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , should not have been regarded as pleasurable . While he was reminiscing about the past and reflecting on his present existence , his daughter Uttar ? was making a libation after her donation in offering food and drinking-water to the Sa ? gha . She prayed for him to share in the merits . After saying S ? dhu to appreciate the merits shared by his daughter , he immediately received food and other comestibles , such as might be available to devas , to his heart 's content . The benefits so derived made him all the more convinced that he had wrongly accepted a false belief in his previous existence . He realised that he had been a victim of fraud in his previous existence . <h> Essential Not to Forget <p> What is essential is not to forget about matters concerning sa ? s ? ra . It means to say that all vices and unwholesome mental states should be avoided to gain real happiness and to minimise misery throughout future existences . Meritorious deeds and wholesome mental states should be cultivated as far as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , a person may be said to be always alert and heedful relating to the cycle of existence . In particular , what is most significant is not to forget to escape from the whirlpool in the deep ocean of sa ? s ? ra . The way to escape is to be always mindful of the continuous arising and dissolution of mind and matter occurring within , by contemplating and noting . This is all that need to be done . If one is unable to contemplate and note as stated above , the continuous flux of mind and matter will be regarded as good and pleasurable . Pleasurable sensations will occur from the seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , and knowing . <p> All natural phenomena will be regarded as pleasurable , then suffering will arise from these pleasurable sensations in the present existence . If , under unfavourable circumstances , one goes down to the lower realms , misery will ensue . This is the cruel treatment given by things which are , in fact , not pleasurable . If mindfulness is maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known by their true characteristics as impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . If realised as such , there will be no suffering during the present life-time because of such sensations . Neither will one be relegate to hell in the rounds of sa ? s ? ra . If circumstances permit , the special dhamma of the Noble Path can be achieved in the course of contemplating and noting . If the Path is gained , one will be fully liberated from the lower realms . Therefore , emphasis is laid on the importance of heedfulness , and on the need to exercise vigilance so that trivial matters , which do not deserve to be regarded as pleasurable , can not possibly deceive you . <h> Suffering from the Viewpoint of Insight <p> Though a sense-object is not delightful , it pretends to be , arousing love , which cruelly causes one to suffer . These are the things or objects that people see , hear , smell , taste , touch , and know . Seen with the naked eye , it would seem as if the visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , which is perceived with a misleading notion as delightful and fascinating . That is why people hanker after these ostensibly delightful things . Looked at from the point of view of insight knowledge , they are found to be mere natural phenomena of mind and matter , which are continually arising and disappearing , and are impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . With insight , they will be perceived as detestable and terrible . If the truth is realised as it truly is , these sensations will have no power to deceive . <p> It was also stated as " dukkha ? sukhassa r ? pena . " The meaning of this is that all painful and unsatisfactory phenomena appear to be pleasant and a source of happiness . They cruelly deceive a heedless and unwary person . In fact , all animate or inanimate things that people encounter , give rise to pain and suffering , which is the Truth of Suffering ( dukkha sacc ? ) , from the viewpoint of a Noble One , who perceives them in their true light with the eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all these are found to be ceaselessly arising and vanishing , and are therefore miserable . Similar perceptions occurs at every moment of hearing , smelling , tasting , touching , and knowing . However , to those who are unable to contemplate and note , due to being heedless and lacking insight , these miseries seem to be pleasurable and delightful . Due to this deception , worldlings always crave for things , trivial or not so trivial , with pleasure and delight , hoping that they would one day find real happiness . This clearly shows that what is really suffering , is cruelly deceiving by pretending to be objects of pleasure and joy . It is , therefore , vital to diligently contemplate and note these unsatisfactory phenomena every time they arise and disappear . On attaining Arahantship , one will become always mindful without any heedlessness , so no unsatisfactory phenomenon can deceive him or her . <p> An ordinary worldling who practises insight meditation will be better off to the extent of being able to contemplate and note with mindfulness . The statement that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conveys the same sense as pleasurable things ( s ? tiyesu ) , as stated in this Pur ? bheda Sutta . Hence , care should be taken not to allow one 's mind to flow into pleasurable sensations . If pleasurable attachment occurs to those who can not practise insight meditation , they should take care not to go to extremes . An insight meditator must continuously contemplate and note all occurrences arising out of the six sense-doors to prevent himself drifting towards pleasurable conditions . If pleasurable attachment occurs , it should be rejected by contemplating and noting . The process of rejection should continued relentlessly by contemplating and noting until attaining the Noble Path , since it has been stated that pleasurable conditions drift up to the stage of maturity knowledge ( gotrabh ? ? ? a ) . If rejection is done in the way stated , knowledge of the path will ultimately be reached . The motto has , therefore , been couched as : <p> " Not drifting into the current of pleasurable sensations , with pride dispelled and gentleness maintained , gaining wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six attributes are his glorious array . " <p> According to this motto , a sage in whom defilements have become extinct , is endowed with the six noble attributes . The first attribute : " Not drifting not into the current of pleasurable sensations " has already been explained . <h> Not Puffed Up with Conceit <p> The next attribute is : " One should not be arrogant and haughty with excessive conceit ( atim ? ne ca no yuto ) , belittling others and regarding them as unworthy of attention . " It is important not to underestimate others in either worldly affairs or spiritual matters . Low estimation of a person in respect of worldly affairs may refer to parentage , financial standing , or education . Do not disparage a person in any way , since you may be mistaken . By holding a low opinion of a person who really deserves respect , one may get into trouble . I will relate a story in connection with this . <p> During the Buddha 's life-time , King Pasenadi of Kosala daily invited five-hundred monks for alms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the offering of alms . The king himself took the lead in serving meals for a period of seven days in succession . For the remaining days , however , the king was unable to do so personally , but he failed to delegate others to perform his duty . Without specific orders , no one dared to carry out what should be done , the serving of meals being in the king 's palace . So , not even seating arrangements were made to receive the monks . A number of the invited monks therefore left , due to not being provided with seats . On the following day , a similar situation prevailed and more of the monks left . On the third day , only Venerable ? nanda was left alone at the place of offering , the rest of the monks having departed . Venerable ? nanda remained out of regard for the faith and generosity of the benefactor . This unsatisfactory state of affairs was witnessed by the king himself when he came over to the place personally . Finding Venerable ? nanda alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king felt very sorry and upset . He therefore , proceeded to the Buddha to whom he respectfully asked , " Venerable sir ! I extended my invitation to five-hundred monks to honour me with their presence at my palace for alms . However , only Venerable ? nanda came . " He asked why the other monks had failed to visit his place in response to his request . <h> Nine Qualities of a Good Benefactor <p> The Blessed One replied : " Oh , king ! My disciples have probably failed to visit your palace due to not being familiar with you . " Then the Buddha said : " The monks should not associate with a benefactor who does not possess nine qualities . " The Buddha then taught that monks should only visit a benefactor 's house and sit down there if the benefactor is endowed with nine qualities : 12 <p> He stands up and welcomes him courteously , <p> He is pleased to pay homage , <p> He allocates a suitable seat with reverence , <p> He does not hide things that he owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> He donates the best of what he has , <p> He gives the donation respectfully , <p> He sits close to listen to the Dhamma , and <p> He listens attentively to what is said . <p> The Buddha then recounted the story of a hermit named Kesava , 13 who though fully provided with delicious meals and good medicines by the king of Benares who was not familiar with him , had become sick to the point of death , but regained his normal health within a few days after after returning to stay with his intimate disciples , both lay supporters and ascetics , having been provided with wild fruits . <h> The Pride of the Sakyans <p> It thus occurred to the king that he should try to get well-acquainted with the Sa ? gha . He sought to make himself related by marriage to the Sakyans . He therefore sent his emissaries to ask for a daughter of the Sakyan royal family . The Sakyans lived and ruled one of the semi-independent states in the country of Kosala . It was akin to the Shan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burmese kings . On receiving the message , the Sakyan rulers realised that refusal to comply with the express demand made by King Pasenadi would lead to trouble . The Sakyans were extremely proud and conceited . They considered themselves as belonging to the noblest race . Due to their egoism they held the view that Sakyan women should not , under any circumstances , marry anyone not of their own clan . They were very close-knit and had a strong sense of racial superiority . They convened an emergency meeting to discuss the matter . King Mah ? n ? ma said that he had a daughter born of one of his maids-of-honour , a mistress , and suggested that this girl should be offered to King Pasenadi . She was not a real maid-servant though . Ancient absolute rulers regarded the people as servants . She might have belonged to a rich family , but not to the royal family . This advice given , was unanimously accepted by all those present at the meeting , and hence , the king 's daughter , a commoner , was proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amounted to deceiving King Pasenadi who had asked for a Royal Princess , a pure descendant of the Sakyan family . <p> A person not knowing that deception has practised on him is usually pleased , but when the truth is known , can become very angry . Later , when King Mah ? n ? ma 's half-caste daughter was handed over to King Pasenadi 's envoys , they took her away and presented her to their king . The king , believing that the girl was of pure royal blood of the Sakyan family , was delighted and made her his Chief Queen . Her name was V ? sabakhattiy ? . Later , she gave birth to a son . The name given to the young prince was Vi ? a ? ? bha . The king , being very fond of his young son since his infancy , appointed the prince though still young , as Commander-in-Chief of the Army . When Vi ? a ? ? bha was about seven years old , he asked his mother whether she had no relatives on her side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandma and aunts while others among his play-mates had received gifts of toy-elephants , toy-horses etc . He inquired if the Queen Mother was still living . The prince 's mother , realising that trouble would brew if the truth were revealed , wilfully told a lie that her parents and relatives were of the royal blood of the famous Sakyan clan residing in Kapilavatthu . She mentioned that King Mah ? n ? ma of Kapilavatthu was her royal father and that the said king was , therefore , the prince 's grand-father . She further comforted her son that no gifts could be sent to him as all of them were residing in a far distant land . <p> When the young prince reached the age of sixteen , he sought his mother 's permission to allow him to visit his grandfather , King Mah ? n ? ma , and his maternal kinsmen . His mother at first refused , but he persisted in asking to go to Kapilavatthu . He asked so often that she was unable to dissuade her son from visiting her relatives , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Kapilavatthu so that there might not be any unpleasantness on her son 's arrival . She feared that members of the Sakyan family might not give a fitting welcome to her son and might treat him with disrespect . <h> Vi ? a ? ? bha Was Slighted <p> The royal family of the Sakyan clan sent away all princes younger than Vi ? a ? ? bha to a remote place before the prince 's visit . When Vi ? a ? ? bha arrived they accorded a very warm reception . He was introduced to the elder members of the royal family , including the king himself who was his grandfather , and his uncles , and so on . Vi ? a ? ? bha paid his respects to all the elders who were introduced to him . He then remarked that it was surprising to find no younger princes ( who would have to pay respects to him ) . They replied that at all of the younger princes had gone to a far off place . Later , they held a ceremonious feast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days , a servant of the royal family washed and cleaned up the place with cows ' milk uttering , " This is the place where the son of the maid-servant , V ? sabakhattiy ? , sat . " While this ritual cleansing with milk was going on , one of Vi ? a ? ? bha 's body guards returned to to recover a small weapon that was inadvertently left behind . He saw the ritual cleansing being performed and overheard the disparaging remarks . This body guard gossiped among his colleagues that Vi ? a ? ? bha 's mother was not a genuine princess of the royal family , but the daughter of a maid-servant . This news spread and ultimately reached the ears of the young prince , Vi ? a ? ? bha . This shocking news enraged him , and he made a vow swearing vengeance that when he became king , the same places would be cleansed with the blood from the throats of the Sakyan royal family . <h> The Sakyans Meet Disaster <p> When Vi ? a ? ? bha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kosala , he marched against the state of Kapilavatthu with his armed forces with the intention of killing all the members of the Sakyan royal family . Seeing this unfortunate state of affairs , the Buddha made his way to where the troops were advancing towards Kapilavatthu , and intervened to prevent bloodshed . Three times the Blessed One prevented Vi ? a ? ? bha from waging war against his own kinsmen , and three times Vi ? a ? ? bha withdrew his armed forces . However , on the fourth occasion the Buddha remained equanimous , foreseeing that the Sakyan rulers ' past unwholesome kamma would inevitably bear fruit . After entering the city walls with his troops , Vi ? a ? ? bha ordered all members of the Sakyan royal family to be executed except for King Mah ? n ? ma and those present with his grandfather , the king . The soldiers of Vi ? a ? ? bha killed all those who admitted to being descended from the Sakyan royal family . They did not even spare the lives of babies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close proximity to King Mah ? n ? ma , and those who were not descended from the royal family , were left unharmed . <p> The reason for this disaster and misery for the entire Sakyan royal family was simply because of their own pride and racial superiority-complex . They treated people other than their own race as low-born , ignoble , and inferior to themselves . When one becomes egoistic , it is natural to look down upon others . They would also speak disparagingly of others . In the present day too , there are some who are egoistic and conceited . They can face trouble like that suffered by the Sakyans . They are liable to be deprived of help and assistance when the need arises . There were also instances where people got into trouble and distress for slighting an enemy . <p> What has been stated above concerns mundane affairs , However , the point stressed in the Pur ? bheda Sutta is to dispel feelings of superiority from the aspect of Dhamma . To clarify this point , it may be that a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come up to the required standard of morality and is far behind me in the purity of moral conduct . He can not maintain the Dhamma as I do . He is unable to practise meditation . Neither is he pious . He is uncivilised , worthless , and ignorant . If one considers another as inferior to oneself , one is inevitably conceited . One may take proud as : " My moral conduct , is more purified than others . I 'm fully accomplished with the noble Dhamma . My efforts in practising meditation bear fruit and are far-reaching . I 've become a Stream-winner , a Noble One ! " If it is true as imagined , there is no fault . However , one should not underestimate others though one might think very highly of oneself . The reason being that it might ultimately prove to be untrue -- not as one has imagined . Later , the other might attain a higher stage of insight than oneself . Thinking highly of oneself is conceit ( m ? na ) . This conceit is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in Noble Ones such as Stream-winners , Once-returners , and Non-returners . Nevertheless , the peculiar feature is that the feeling of pride or conceit that occurs in the minds of the Noble Ones , only arises depending on their own real attainment of those noble attributes . It is not that they think highly of themselves without reason . Hence , this kind of conceit is called " yath ? -m ? na . " It means taking pride where it is deserved . Ordinary worldlings may think themselves superior , taking pride in trivial things . Such false-pride is called " ? yath ? vam ? na . " <p> On becoming a Stream-winner by practising insight meditation , this false-pride is removed . However , the kind of conceit that occurs in connection with real attributes still remains . It will be eradicated completely on reaching Arahantship by practising insight meditation in serial order . This teaching , therefore , says that efforts should be made to meditate to eradicate conceit and become an Arahant . <p> The motto was therefore stated as : " Not drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentleness maintained . " <h> Becoming Gentle in Behaviour and Speech <p> To become gentle in bodily behaviour , one should avoid all acts detrimental to others and do wholesome deeds as much as possible for their welfare . Therefore , killing , stealing , and adultery , which are immoral physical vices , should be avoided . <p> To be gentle verbally may be explained as abstaining from lies , slander , obscene abuse , and idle chatter , the four vices of speech . Of the two stated above , to be gentle and polite in speech is more important than to be gentle in behaviours . This is because , among those who have a religious inclination , only a few will be found to be coarse in their physical behaviour . Concerning speech , anything that has sprung up in the mind will ordinarily find an outlet or expression through the mouth , which makes utterances , polite or vulgar , either intentionally or inadvertently . Any perverse or indiscreet utterances should therefore be avoided . <h> Gentle Mental Character <p> The meaning of gentleness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( abhijjh ? ) -- unlawfully or unfairly wishing to possess other 's property -- and ill-will ( vy ? p ? da ) , or vicious thoughts wishing others to meet with death or destruction of property , should be dispelled . Wrong views ( micch ? di ? ? hi ) such as believing that there is no harmful or beneficial results of kamma , or no future existences , should be expelled and banished . In short , it means that one should have a virtuous mind devoid of malevolent feelings towards others . Virtuous thoughts comprise the requisites of enlightenment ( bodhi-pakkhiya dhamma ) , such as the four foundations of mindfulness . So mindfulness should always be practised . The four right efforts ( sammappadh ? na ? ) , should be aroused . If contemplation and noting is done continuously based on the four foundations of mindfulness , cruel thoughts or activities will have no chance to occur . The mind will become very gentle . If the four foundations of mindfulness are practised , it would embrace the four right efforts , the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five faculties ( indriya ) , the five powers ( bala ) , the seven factors of enlightenment ( bojjha ? ga ) , and the eight factors of the path ( magga ? ga ) , otherwise known as the Noble Eightfold Path ( ariya a ? ? ha ? giko maggo ) . The thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment comprise the constituents of true knowledge . <p> Therefore , if the practice of mindfulness is developed , not only the mind , but also both physical and mental behaviours become gentle . This is to say that if one is developing mindfulness for insight one will invariably consider carefully before doing anything , and will only do things considered to be proper . One will not perform any act casually or carelessly . When about to speak , one will ponder whether it is sensible and reasonable . While speaking too , one continues to contemplate and note . By so doing , one will undoubtedly restrain oneself from uttering harsh or rude words . Every time any thought or imagination arises , it must be contemplated and noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does , it will not last long . Therefore , if mindfulness is well developed , all physical , verbal , and mental behaviour will become pure and gentle . Moreover , since the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment are embraced , as they may be relevant , at every moment of contemplating and noting while practising and developing mindfulness meditation , it has been stated in the Mah ? niddesa as : " Sa ? hehi satipa ? ? h ? ne hi samann ? gato , " which means accomplishment is achieved with gentle mindfulness . The motto says : " Not flowing into the stream of pleasurable sensations , with pride dispelled and gentleness maintained , gaining wisdom ... " <h> Ready Wit <p> After gentleness comes reflective knowledge with which a person should be equipped . In connection with learning , one should have quick comprehension or ready wit ( pa ? ibh ? na ) . One should also possess intelligence and be able to quickly comprehend the Dhamma connected with practical meditation exercises . Regards any problem that is posed , one must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learning , it would manifest in a person who is knowledgeable in the P ? ? i texts , Commentaries , and Subcommentaries as knowing readily what should be said next when delivering a lecture . To a person who systematically practises insight with diligence , this ready wit is likely to occur , even without scriptural learning . One who has practiced meditation will readily grasp the profound meaning of the Dhamma relating to mind and matter or stages of insight . One may easily and deeply appreciate though the teacher has made a mere mention of the gist of the Dhamma . <h> Truly Learned Only after Meditating <p> Those who have already practised insight meditation will easily understand the meaning of the scriptural texts just by reading them . Whatever was not properly understood before , practising insight meditation , will perhaps be understood clearly . A great teacher once stated that he had passed his examinations on scriptures with credit and that he had also taught others . He then considered himself as being truly learned . However , it was found to be wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been fully grasped before was vividly comprehended only after he had practised meditation . It is true and correct . This comprehension of the deeper meaning of the Dhamma is the knowledge of ready wit ( pa ? ibh ? na ? ? a ) , which is achieved through insight meditation . This knowledge becomes more obvious to those who have meditated after having studied the Dhamma . This knowledge is distinctive because it is not book knowledge . What has been stated above is how this knowledge occurs in relation to learning . <h> Theoretically Easy but Practically Difficult <p> In connection with the practise of insight meditation , the way of gaining ready wit is that it would easily arise in the minds of those meditators what is feasible if they just reflect about the practice . The ability to understand the texts relating to practice is the quality of ready wit connected with practice . As regards practical realisation ( pa ? iveda ) , it will be clearly realised by one who has practised meditation . This means that the natural phenomena of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it is not so easy to appreciate from the practical point of view . In fact , it is extremely difficult . One who has practised meditation seriously will know the true nature of mind and matter with direct insight , which is hard to perceive and understand . At every moment of noting it will be known that matter -- which is the sense-object noted and realised -- is quite different from the knowing mind . <h> Analytical Knowledge of Body and Mind <p> According to the texts , matter ( r ? pa ) consists of the elements of earth ( pathav ? ) , water ( ? po ) , fire ( tejo ) , air ( v ? yo ) , and so on , a total of twenty-eight forms of primary and derived matter . Common mind consisting of eighty-one kinds of consciousness ( citta ) , together with fifty-two mental factors ( cetasik ? ) , is mentality ( n ? ma ) . All of these constitute the body and mind of an individual -- an aggregate of material elements and properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ma ) . It has to be mentioned arithmetically to emphasise the fact that there are only two categories , namely mind and matter , found in the Buddhist texts . However , not all of these are present in a person . Merely knowing as such is not analytical knowledge of body and mind . This knowledge is only perception ( sa ? ) . Consider this : of the abovementioned twenty-eight kinds of matter , a man has no element of femininity . A woman has no element of masculinity . Then , of the eighty-one types of consciousness , one who has not attained jh ? na will have no consciousness of the formless realms or the realms of form . Only the Arahants have functional consciousness ( kiriya ) -- ordinary people have no such mental faculty . Therefore , could this be the real personal knowledge that knows the Dhamma or conditions which do not abide in one 's own personality ? No , it can not possibly be . It is merely the knowledge of perception . <h> Even the Illiterate Can Realise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be learned , or unable even to read and write , can know the distinctive features of mind and matter through direct personal insight . Every time it is contemplated and noted , it will be realised that there are only two kinds of phenomena : matter , which is the object to be known , and the mind that knows . A similar realisation will occur whenever seeing , hearing , smelling , or tasting occurs . Touching has a very wide scope . All acts of bending , stretching , walking , standing , sitting , lying down , moving , and changing the postures are included . When bending and stretching , the mind that intends to bend or stretch is one thing , the acts of bending and stretching are another , and the noting mind is something else . It can be differentiated and clearly known . The same realisation takes place when walking and so on . Imagining and knowing , as well as noting and awareness are mind , which has the faculty of knowing . Moving and stiffness are matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matter in pairs combined together are vividly known by personal realisation . <h> How to Know Arising and Dissolution <p> Some teachers say to contemplate on arising and dissolution without having had any personal experience of the realisation of the transient nature of matter and mind . They are simply contemplating by uttering verbally or mentally without the faculty of perception . This is quite unnatural . A meditator who is continually contemplating and noting will perceive mind and matter at every moment of their arising , and will become aware of them both at the beginning of their arising , and when concentration becomes mature , will be aware that their dissolution follows immediately . For instance , when painful sensation occurs , while noting " painful , painful " with fixed concentration , the painful sensations will clearly be found to arise and disappear , falling away at each moment . Such occurrences will be revealed to the mind 's eye as if they are known and felt by one 's hands without needing to utter a word . Similarly , joy ( p ? ti ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , on reaching the knowledge of arising and passing away ( udayabbaya- ? ? a ) , a meditator will definitely realise joy and tranquillity since they occur conspicuously . Moreover , the mental state of evenmindedness ( tatramajjhattat ? ) can hardly be known by mere book-knowledge . This will , however , be known automatically when the stages of arising and passing away and knowledge of equanimity about formations ( sa ? kh ? rupekkh ? - ? ? a ) are reached . <p> On reaching those stages , these will be clearly found equally balanced , and on attaining the knowledge of equanimity all sensations will be known and realised without special effort as they occur spontaneously , and that awareness of noting becomes obvious on its own as it occurs automatically . At that moment , the sensation that is known and the knowing mind , while in the process of knowing and disappearing , will be found to be incessantly arising and vanishing . Hence , their inherent nature of impermanence ( anicca ) , is extremely obvious . Similarly , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and not-self ( anatta ) . Having personally realised with clarity and without ambiguity in the course of contemplating and noting , the three characteristics of phenomena will be clearly perceived through knowledge when reflected upon even while taking a brief respite from meditation . Also , if contemplated and noted , the usual insight knowledge will be gained . One who has reached the stage of the cessation of formations , would recall such cessation while contemplating and noting . If later reflecting on what has already been achieved , realisation will take place as before . This quick and easy revival of his comprehension of the nature of Dhamma every time he reflects is the attribute of the ready wit relating to realisation ( pa ? ivedha ) . <p> The knowledge of ready wit regarding questions on scriptures will readily come into the mind of a person who has taken a course of lessons to be able to tackle the questions relating to learning . In the same way , one who is accomplished with the knowledge of insight meditation will have a ready wit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualities of ready wit in so far as questions are concerned . One should be accomplished with the three kinds of ready wit as stated just now . Therefore , the motto says as follows : " Not flowing into the stream of pleasurable sensations , with pride dispelled and gentleness maintained , gaining wisdom ... " <h> Not Being Credulous <p> In the sixth verse it states : " Na saddho na virajjati . " This means : no faith has arisen because others have stated with a mistaken view is ready wit . If that is so , it would have amounted to saying that there is no faith . In fact , it means to say that one should be accomplished with wisdom after personal realisation of the Dhamma and not just by blindly believing what others say . The expression " na saddh o " if literally translated , conveys the meaning of " not having faith . " It has been taught thus , to differentiate between " believing in what others have said " and " personal realisation or knowledge . " If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what others say . To put it in another way , if it is known and realised personally , it will not be necessary to believe what others have said . The term " na saddho " has been used in the verse to make this clear . <h> Knowing Is More Noble than Believing <p> To give an example : even among people in Burma , those who have not been to the Shwedagon pagoda will have to believe by remembering what others have said in connection with the said shrine . If they have personally visited the Shwedagon pagoda and observed it closely , it will be unnecessary to take it for granted what others have told them is true . In the same way , a person who has no personal realisation of insight concerning the path , its fruition , and nibb ? na should believe what others would teach according to the scriptures . It is similar to the case of people who believe in the existence of satellites launched into space by rockets though they have not personally seen them with their own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths relating to insight , the path , its fruition , and nibb ? na does not accept mere hearsay . It is belief through personal achievement and realisation . This is not believing others , but knowing the truth . The Blessed One asked Venerable S ? riputta , " S ? riputta ! Do you believe that by developing the faculty of faith ( saddhindriya ? ) , one will reach the the ultimate goal of deathless nibb ? na ? " Venerable S ? riputta answered , " Venerable sir , in this regard , I do n't believe the word of the Buddha . " Ordinary monks who heard this answer misjudged S ? riputta . They imagined that Venerable S ? riputta being a Brahmin , belonging to the Brahm ? ? a caste , had not yet gained faith in the Blessed One . It would appear justifiable to think so . Those who have a bias towards the doctrine of the Brahmins , do not believe or have faith in the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha . It was therefore reasonable to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riputta belonged to the Brahmin caste . What it really meant was that Venerable S ? riputta had personally realised the fact that nibb ? na could be attained by developing faith . Therefore , in this regard , he did not believe just because the Buddha had said so , but because he had personally realised it himself . <p> Imagine the previous example of a man who had visited and reverently observed the Shwedagon Pagoda . If he were asked whether he believed that the main masonry structure of the pagoda was covered with gold plates , he would have replied that he believed so not because others had told him , but because he himself had witnessed it . Yes , indeed . Likewise , what Venerable S ? riputta said was stated was because he himself had personally found and realised the truth that developing the faculty of faith would lead the way to nibb ? na . In connection with this reply , Venerable S ? riputta had been extolled in the Dhammapada as stated below : <p> " The man who is not credulous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has destroyed all results , and expelled all desires , he is truly an excellent man . " <p> This verse , which has been recorded in the Dhammapada in reference to Venerable S ? riputt ? , is not contained in this Pur ? bheda Sutta . However , as it contains terms similar in meaning to the verse in this Sutta , I mention it for you to note and remember . Yo : a certain person , assaddo : has no faith , sa : , this person ve : actually uttama-poriso : is a noble and eminent person . This is a literal translation that might be given without knowing the real intention . As it stands , it will be entirely wrong and misleading . In the text of Ali ? k ? this kind of secret word is called " Paheli , " a conundrum . The real meaning of this verse is : Yo : a certain person , assaddho : who is not credulous , i.e. one who has personal realisation , sa : this person , ve : actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear enough . Then the literal meaning of what follows is : <p> Akata ? : a person who does not appreciate the debt owed to another . Or in other words , one who is ungrateful to another who has done good to him . This is the usual translation . According to this , it conveys the meaning of a person who does not appreciate indebtedness to others , and may , therefore , be called a wicked person , not a noble and eminent person . This is the opposite to the expected meaning . In fact , what it really means is " a noble person who truly knows the uncreated ( nibb ? na ) . " Sandhicchedo : is literally a burglar who commits house-breaking . This is not the intended meaning . The essential meaning is " a person who has brought renewed existences to an end . " In other words , " one who has cut off all links with the suffering of sa ? s ? ra . " This would mean , according to the Doctrine of Dependent Origination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isandhi vi ? ? a ? ) , which arises in the present existence due to good or evil deeds ( kamma ) of the past existence ( sa ? kh ? ra ) . <p> A second link is craving that arises because of feeling ( vedan ? ) in the present existence . <p> A third link is future rebirth that occurs because of the kamma of the present existence ( bhava ) . <p> Among these three links , since the past and present links have already arisen , joining together or connected with one another , it can not possibly be severed , nor does it need to be severed . What needs to be done is to sever the two links , namely , to break the link between feeling to craving , and to prevent rebirth in a fresh existence caused by the arising of new kamma . Of these two links , breaking the link between feeling and craving is the essential point . The meditators here are contemplating and noting at every moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practised continuously , progressive stages of insight and knowledge of the path will occur in sequence , and on attaining Arahantship , the links of continued existences will be severed . Hence , a person who has already cut the connecting link of existence is called an eminent or noble person . <p> The next word is hat ? vak ? so . ' Hata ' means ' destroyed , ' ' ? vak ? sa ' means ' opportunity ' in an ordinary sense . If it is said that opportunities for success and prosperity are destroyed , the meaning is wrong . The meaning in this context is a person who has destroyed the opportunity to be reborn is a noble and eminent person . <p> The next word is vant ? so . If this compound is interpreted as the food that is vomited ( vanta ) is eaten ( asa ) , it would be highly improper from the worldly point of view . The meaning required in this context is that desire is called ' ? s ? . ' Hence , some used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insatiable appetite or unfulfilled desires . An Arahant is totally free from all passionate or lustful desires , and has renounced all desires relating to mundane affairs and even to the fulfilment of Dhamma . With this intent , it has been taught as one who has rejected all desires ( vant ? so ) , like one who has rejected the food that has been vomited . Therefore , the Dhammapada verse has been translated to arrive at the appropriate meaning to say what is really intended . <p> Yo naro : a man or a certain person , assaddho ca : who is not credulous , having realised it himself , akata ? ca : who has seen the uncreated ( nibb ? na ) , sandhicchedo ca : has severed all the links and cut of rebirth , hat ? vak ? so : has destroyed the opportunity to be reborn in a fresh existence , vant ? so ca : has expelled all desires , sa : such a person , ve , is truly , uttamaporiso : a noble and eminent person . <p> The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying entirely on what others say , but investigating and knowing from one 's own personal realisation . It is vital to practise the Dhamma to achieve personal realisation . The arising and dissolution of mind and matter -- which are impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self -- is the Dhamma that must be realised . Phenomena must be investigated to become fully aware of their nature . Insight knowledge , the path , and its fruition are Dhammas that must be practised to be clearly known and acquired . A person who has realised these Dhammas , need not rely on or believe others . Neither should one depend on and believe in the scriptural texts of Dhamma . One need not even depend on the Buddha , because one has gained personal realisation with one 's own awareness . <p> The statement regarding practising meditation to know for oneself without depending upon others , refers only to matters which could be known and realised personally . In respect of other things that one can not know on one 's own , one should believe others who are learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddha in matters beyond his comprehension , and believed what the Buddha had taught . Some with meagre knowledge might refuse to believe even trivial things on the grounds that they have had no personal experience in the matter concerned . This is unrealistic . If an experienced traveller gives an account of a place that he has personally visited , others who have not been there should believe him . <p> Leaving aside people who have visited and seen certain places personally . Even what is learnt from newspapers or brochures , though these may be secondhand information , will have to be regarded as probably true by those who have read it . It will be ridiculous if one says that he can not possibly believe the information just because he has not personally seen what is says in the printed material . Regarding the Dhamma , it is the same . If a person who has personally experienced and realised the Dhamma tells another about it which the other has not yet known , it is reasonable to believe that person who does have experience and personal realisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wise to personally practise to achieve realisation . When realisation is gained through diligent practice , it would accord with the teaching not to be credulous . <h> Citta the Householder and Niga ? ? ha N ? ? aputta <p> During the life-time of the Buddha there was a rich man by the name of Citta who was a Non-returner . One day , Citta , paid a visit to Niga ? ? ha N ? ? aputta , the leader of a sect of naked ascetics , called Niga ? ? ha . This great teacher N ? ? aputta , was regarded as a Jina , a Buddha , with great reverence by the Jains . He had gained popularity well before our Buddha became an Enlightened One . On his arrival , N ? ? aputta asked Citta : " Do you believe that your teacher Venerable Gotama has attained concentration whereby he is free of initial application ( vitakka ) and sustained application ( vic ? ra ) , and is able to free his mind from reasoning and investigation which have thus ceased ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the point relating to the cessation of initial and sustained application , it is not that I have to recognize it for my having believed the Buddha . " This answer gave N ? ? aputta the wrong impression that Citta did not believe the Buddha . He therefore went on to say . " Hey , my disciples ! Look ! This Citta is very simple and honest . He says truly and candidly what he has in his mind that he does not believe . It is , indeed , not worth believing . It is impossible to make initial and sustained application cease . It is really absurd just as air can not be caught hold of by a net , or , as the running waters of the Ganges river can not be prevented from flowing by the palm or a clenched hand . " <h> Personal Knowledge versus Believing Others <p> Such being the case , Citta inquired , " Venerable N ? ? aputta , which of the two -- knowing and believing -- is more noble ? " N ? ? aputta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , Citta proceeded to say , " Oh , teacher ! I can at any time enter into the first jh ? na by virtue of which initial and sustained application are present , i.e. , the mind will reason upon and investigate the subject chosen for contemplation . I can also enter into the second jh ? na , at which stage the mind is free from reasoning and investigation while joy and tranquility remain . Then , I can also enter into the third jh ? na where joy is abandoned , and also I can pass on to the fourth jh ? na and abide in it , by which the mind , blessed and purified , is indifferent to all emotions , pleasure and pain alike . " He then retorted , " Would you therefore think it necessary for me to rely on and believe any other monk or a noble person in connection with the questioned raised that there is concentrated contemplation upon a single thought and getting into a profound trance , despite the fact that I myself have personally found , realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from this initial and sustained application ? " Then N ? ? aputta spoke in derision discrediting Citta : " Look , my disciples ! This rich man Citta is a fraud and a liar . Just a while ago , he stated that he did not disbelieve the Buddha . Now he expresses his belief . He is an extremely dishonest man . " <p> Citta did not submit to this jibe . He retaliated , " Venerable teacher ! You previously told your disciples that Citta is a very candid and honest man . Now you say that he is dishonest . Your statements are inconsistent . If what you stated first is correct , then the statement made by you later must be wrong , and vice versa . " <p> In the story about Citta just narrated , N ? ? aputta had openly expressed his opinion that he had not experienced or discovered the jh ? na free from initial and sustained application , and that he considered that there could be no concentration caused by mystic meditation by which one can free oneself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , by comparing with his own limitations . As regards Citta , since he had achieved and realised the attributes of jh ? na , he had spoken courageously , guaranteeing the refined qualities of jh ? na . This honest guarantee of his attainment of jh ? na and of his personal realisation was given with firm conviction . It is not because he just believed it . It was his own personal acquisition of knowledge through practice . It is therefore essential that the Dhamma that ought to be known , should be earnestly practised for one 's own personal realisation and achievement as done by Citta . <p> Referring to a person who has had his personal realisation , it has also been taught in this Pur ? bheda Sutta as : " na saddho , " which means , " not credulous , but having acquired personal realisation of the truth of the Dhamma , by one 's own effort . " <h> Should Be Free from Attachment <p> The last expression is : " na virajjati . " It means : " Not yet free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reasonable to hold the view that there is still an attachment . It is not so . In fact , " not yet free from attachment , " does convey the sense as " entirely free from attachment , " as it refers to ' sekha ' individuals and ' asekha ' individuals . The term ' sekha ' ( sometimes spelled sekkha ) , applies to wise and virtuous ordinary persons ( kaly ? ? a puthujjana ) who are striving after their spiritual welfare , and to those Noble Ones ( ariya ) who are still under training in the practice of the Dhamma ' Asek a ' individuals are Arahants who have fully completed the training and have eradicated all human passions . <p> Ordinary unwise worldlings ( b ? la puthujjana ) , who are those not yet practising the noble Dhamma , have attachment to all sensations flowing out from the six sense-doors , imagining them to be good and pleasurable . Then , if they think that some sensations are bad , they crave for what is good , and become attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be overwhelmed with attachments . They are rarely free from sensual attachment . <h> In the Process of Getting Free from Attachment <p> A wise and virtuous ordinary person , who realises by contemplating and noting that all phenomena arising at the six sense-doors are merely mind and matter . Due to their transient nature , these phenomena arise and pass away very rapidly , so he or she will be free from pleasurable attachment to the sensation that is noted every time contemplation is made with full awareness of their being mere impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . Wise and virtuous ordinary persons who are practising insight meditation by contemplating and noting , are thus deemed to be individuals on the path to eradicate attachment . While thus contemplating , concentration will gradually be developed gaining insight in serial order up to the path and fruition of Stream-winning . On reaching Stream-winning , one is free from pleasurable attachment that can drag one down to the lower realms . Then passionate desires that are eager to arise for more than seven existences will be eradicated . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sugati ) , this pleasurable attachment will not yet be extirpated . Hence , it can not be said that such a person is completely free from attachment yet . It may be stated that he or she is destined to be liberated from attachment . Similarly , even when one reaches Once-returning and Non-returning , one will still be in the process of getting rid of attachment . Only when one attains Arahantship , all these attachments will be expelled . Yet , at this point , it does not mean that attachment is totally exterminated . In other words , feeling of attachment is still clinging on and is still in the process of eradication . <h> Not in the Process of Getting Free from Attachment <p> Eventually however , only when Arahantship ( Fruition of Arahantship ) is attained and on becoming an Arahant , all such clinging attachments have been totally extirpated . As an Arahant , he is no longer in the process of eradicating the attachment . With this objective , it has been taught as : " na virajjati " i.e. , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been completely eradicated or rooted out . This has been stated in the motto as : " craving detached by clearing away . " <p> The meaning of the sixth verse has now been adequately explained . <h> Verse Seven <p> The above verse may be explained literally as : Yo : a certain monk , l ? bhakamy ? : expecting to receive remuneration , na sikkhati : does not follow the training . That is , he does not practise wishing to receive gifts in the form of a bribe . Some monks study the scriptures , acquire knowledge , or practise austerities ( dhuta ? ga ) , seeking praise and fame , or to receive offerings . A sage is not like that . He practises only expecting to gain liberation from the cycle of existences and to attain nibb ? na . This is one of the attributes of a sage . <p> Al ? bhe ca : for not achieving his objective , na kuppati : he does not feel angry . Some monks , on not having devotees and benefactors , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frustrated for not having adherents belonging to the same sect , or for not receiving approval or admiration , or for not receiving gifts of robes and so forth . A sage , as mentioned earlier , is neither disappointed nor resentful . This is also one of the attributes of a sage . Aviruddho ca : some individuals may be angry or irritated for having seen , or heard , or met with what is undesirable . Those living together may be at loggerheads . Some are inclined to bear a grudge against or quarrel with a stranger . An Arahant does not contradict anyone or come into conflict with anybody . He is tolerant and gentle without anger or hatred . This is a very noble attribute . <p> Ta ? h ? ya rasesu na anugijjhati : not greedy or craving for any tasty food . Some have a great fondness for delicious food and so plan and imagine how to get what is delicious . They will reminisce about and long for delicious food which they have once relished . A sage is not like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enjoyment or avarice . Neither is it taken to have a fair complexion , nor to become plump , nor to have good appearance and looks . In fact , nourishment is for the preservation of one 's own body , to appease hunger , and to be able to practise the holy life . While eating , he reflects wisely , contemplating and noting with mindfulness . He does not yearn for the taste which he has not yet tasted , and does not find delight or become infatuated with what has been tasted . Such a holy monk is said to be a sage , who possesses the attributes as stated in the foregoing . <h> Verse Eight <p> The above P ? ? i phrase means that a person who is constantly mindful views thing with equanimity . It implies that one should always be mindful and capable of viewing things with a state of mind that is evenly balanced . One does not think of oneself as being equal to others , nor does one consider oneself as being extraordinary . Neither does one regard oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be no conceit by comparing oneself with others . One will be free from all defilements that would prolong the cycle of existences . One should have no passion , anger , delusion , or conceit , which are cravings of wholesome and unwholesome states . This kind of a noble person is said by the Buddha , to be a sage who has extinguished the fires of defilements . The motto I composed in my discourse on the the Mah ? samaya Sutta about ten years ago , carries the sense contained in the present verse . <p> " Contemplating and noting systematically , reflecting with equanimity , and rejecting the three kinds of conceit , makes a person worthy to be called a sage . " <h> Being Mindful at All Times <p> Contemplating and noting systematically as in the above motto means always being mindful , day and night , without any break at all . If one goes into meditation for seven days , a fortnight , or a month , one should carry out the meditation exercises , continuously developing mindfulness without a break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of the time set apart for sleeping . <p> In the Mah ? niddesa it states that when contemplation of the body is done , one may be said to have gained mindfulness . Similarly , mindfulness will be achieved while practising the contemplation of feelings ( vedan ? ) , of mind ( citta ) , or mind-objects ( dhamma ) . Hence , one of the four foundations of mindfulness should be chosen to be developed as a fundamental basis . In general , it would be the most feasible to start with the contemplation of the body . So what is obvious in regard to bodily behaviours must first be contemplated and noted . In practising insight , everything that occurs at the six sense-doors , should be contemplated . At the initial stage however , not all such occurrences can be noted , so contemplation should be commenced with bodily behaviour , which is the most conspicuous . Contemplation and noting can be done continuously while sitting , with concentrated attention on the sitting posture , noting as " sitting , sitting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip of the nostril can be contemplated and noted with constant attentiveness , as " touching , touching . " Contemplation and noting can be done continuously as " touching , touching " with fixed concentration on the point of touch at any place in the body from the head to toe . <p> The best is to contemplate beginning from the movement of the air element ( v ? yodh ? tu ) , namely , the rising and falling movements of the abdomen , as is done by the meditators at this centre . Moreover , when contemplation and noting the rising and falling movements of the abdomen , other imaginations or thoughts that arise should also be noted . Thereafter , the mind should revert to the rising and falling . All feeling or sensations such as stiffness , heat , pain , and itching must be noted . All changes in the bodily postures should be noted , and then one should revert to noting the rising and falling . When walking , every step taken must be noted continually , beginning from the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When sitting after walking , the movements involved in adopting the sitting posture must be noted . In the same way , when lying down the movements that occur must be noted . In brief , whether shaking , moving , or remaining still , all physical behaviours involved must be noted . Mental behaviours and thoughts that arise must also be noted . All sensations must be noted . Seeing , hearing , etc. , must be noted as far as possible . In the absence of anything special that deserves to be noted , the rising and falling of the abdomen must be continuously noted . This is the salient point that serves as a basis in body contemplation in the process of developing the four foundations of mindfulness ( satipa ? ? h ? na ) . <p> By being always mindful , a stage will be reached whereby contemplation is made with indifference to pain and pleasure -- the mind being evenly balanced . However , I can not guarantee that one will reach that stage after only one or two hours at a stretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom is exceedingly keen and strong might reach the stage of equanimity within about seven days . It is rare to find such a person though , not even one in a hundred . We seldom find such a person even among those who have meditated for fifteen days . Of course , there are quite a number of people who have reached that stage after meditating seriously for a period ranging from twenty to thirty days . It takes time because of various stages that one has to pass through in the course of insight before the attainment of equanimity . Among these insight knowledges , the first is analytical knowledge of body and mind ( n ? ma-r ? pa-pariccheda- ? ? a ) . Even before reaching that stage , one needs to practise with great diligence to achieve purity of mind . <h> How Purity of Mind Is Achieved <p> A novice who starts meditating has to try hard with earnestness to note the rising and falling movements of the abdomen correctly . It is likely that the rising and falling will be missed as the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one carries on contemplating and noting with strong faith , will , and perseverance , one will be able to note properly within one or two days , or at least within five days . At that stage , the mind does not go astray . Noting will be continuous , concentrating on rising and falling , and on other sensations that ought to be noted . Sometimes , when imagination or thoughts arise , they can be noted at once . Thereafter , noting can proceed as usual without any interruption . When noting like this , the hindrances , such as sensual desire are expelled . The noting mind becomes purified , which is Purity of Mind ( citta visuddhi ) . <h> Analytical Knowledge of Body and Mind <p> When the mind is thus purified , mind and matter are distinguished even while noting , and at every moment of noting , the sense-object is found to be quite distinct from the knowing mind . In other words , mind and matter are found to be clearly distinct from one another even while noting . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pa-pariccheda- ? ? a ) , both of which are merely conditioned states . From that stage , if noting is continued , cause and effect are found to be occurring in conjunction . This is the knowledge by discerning conditionality ( paccaya-pariggaha- ? ? a ) . <p> Thereafter , if continuous contemplation is made , it will be perceived that sense-objects are occurring and vanishing . The manner of perception is that when noting as " rising " ( of the abdomen ) , the movements caused by distension will be found to recur repeatedly and then vanish . The same phenomena will also be noticed in noting the falling movement of the abdomen . It is more obvious when noting the mind that is planning and imagining . Sensations such as pain , heat , etc. , when noted with concentration as " painful , painful , " and so on , will be found to dissolve and vanish during the process of noting . The meditator will be satisfied to find these phenomena as impermanent , since they are incessantly arising and passing away . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering and are ungovernable in as much as mind and matter are appearing and disappearing according to their real characteristic of transience . This is knowledge by comprehension ( sammasana- ? ? a ) . <p> From then onwards , while contemplation is carried on further , the arising and dissolution of phenomena that are contemplated and noted will not only become accelerated , but also vivid . At this stage , brilliant lights may be visualized . Extremely rapturous feelings may occur , and calmness of the mind may become obvious . Both body and mind may become buoyant ( lahut ? ) , and supple ( mudut ? ) . Mindfulness with awareness and knowledge will be very keen and penetratingly strong . Ecstasy and bliss ( sukha ) will become extreme with mental clarity and fervent faith . One may then be filled with delight and pleasure regarding these unusual events . All of these delightful and pleasurable sensations should be rejected by contemplating and noting . <p> When rejection can be made successfully by so contemplating and noting , the sense-object that is noted and the knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly seen to be vanishing in pairs and dissolving in rapid succession just as one would see the pictures in movies without any shape or form . At this moment , all arising sensations and the mental processes of noticing them having been found to vanish incessantly , it becomes very obvious that these are all impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self . This is knowledge of dissolution ( bha ? ga- ? ? a ) . <h> Knowledge of Equanimity About Formations <p> If persistent and vigorous contemplation and noting is made , one will reach the knowledge of equanimity about formations ( sa ? kh ? rupekkh ? - ? ? a ) . At this stage , the knowledge that can view psycho-physical phenomena with equanimity is accomplished . No sensations arising from the six sense-doors are considered as pleasurable , but neither are they thought of as detestable . They can be viewed with equanimity , with a neutral feeling of neither love nor hatred . For having viewed as such with indifference , one who is accomplished with this knowledge is said to be fully endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It is described in the Mah ? niddesa P ? ? i text 15 as follows : <p> " Having seen a form with the eyes , there is neither happiness nor sorrow . Mindful and clearly comprehending , he remains equanimous . " <p> The meaning of the above is that there is an absence of happiness and pleasure no matter how pleasurable the sight may be . Ordinary worldlings will feel happy to see their loved ones -- parents , wives , husbands , children , friends , and so on . A person who has reached the stage of equanimity , however , finds no enjoyment or pleasure . Even if the worst happens and he or she meets unfavourable conditions , he or she will not be miserable . It is because he or she views things with equanimity and contemplates what has been seen as transient , arising and then passing away at once . It has become possible to contemplate thus by reason of having realised the truth . A meditator who has attained that stage feels the same as stated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion and without any inclination towards either good or bad sensations as mentioned above . Those who have reached that stage will certainly know that it really is so , and therefore , those who feel dissatisfied with this statement should practise insight . They will then realise the truth of the Dhamma . <p> The ability to view things with equanimity at every moment of seeing , hearing , touching , and knowing is the inherent attribute of an Arahant . It is called six-factored equanimity . An ordinary trainees is accomplished with that attribute only at the moment of acquiring this knowledge of equanimity during the course of contemplation . He or she may be said to be endowed with the attributes of an Arahant only momentarily when reaching that stage . This is really most encouraging and worthy of respect for oneself as well as for others . After attaining the stage of equanimity , the knowledge of the path and its fruition is not very far off . It is within easy reach , even within one day . A person who has perfections ( p ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four progressive stages of the path serially . It has therefore been taught to practise assiduously to accomplished this . On becoming an Arahant , since everything is viewed with equanimity , conceit will be totally eradicated . <h> Free From the Three Kinds of Conceit <p> An Arahant will never regard himself or herself as equal to others and will never mentally or verbally compare himself or herself with anyone . An Arahant has no pride , ego , or conceit . Neither will an Arahant consider himself or herself as belonging to a higher strata of society than others , nor as being pre-eminent . Nor will an Arahant regard himself or herself as being inferior to others , or lower in status . Conceit has the characteristic of haughtiness ( unnati ) . Conceit sets too high a value on oneself and gives one the idea to become haughty . This is what it really means . The kind of conceit that is stated just now may give an impression that there is no feeling of superiority since one has become humble . However , this conceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niv ? ti ) . Humility is one way of taking pride in low or vulgar behaviour . It may be put in this way : someone possessing no self-respect or dignity might boast , " I am more reckless than others , a real dare-devil ! I dare to kill others , I do n't care what anyone thinks , I dare to commit crimes and do as I please . " This sort of conceit is ignoble . Even among servants some might babble , " I 'm a low-born servant or a personal servant to my master , etc . " Taking pride in this way is really ignoble and base . That is why it is stated that one who is competing with others by considering himself or herself as inferior to others is a way of being arrogant , insolent , or presumptuous , with a bad attitude . <p> An Arahant is devoid of such kind of conceit . Before attaining Arahantship , these three forms of conceit abide in the mind of a person as may be appropriate . As such , a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting , any one of the three kinds of conceit , which are likely to occur . For instance , one may become conceited as being on the same level in status with another person for having achieved insight knowledge up to a certain stage as acquired by the other , or that he has far surpassed the other in his attainment of insight knowledge . A novice in meditation practice at the inception , may , however , have in mind , that being just a beginner himself , it will not be necessary for him to exercise with care and attention in contemplating and noting just like others who have made progress in meditation exercises . He might even think , " I can be care-free , and it wo n't deter the progress . " This dispirited feeling with apparent humility is also one kind of conceit that can occur . Whatever it may be , conceit that arises should be rejected by contemplating and noting . This feeling of pride or conceit is very potent just like craving . Even a Non-returner has some conceit . Conceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is therefore up to you to get to that highest stage . <p> On reaching that stage of Arahantship when becoming an Arahant , all defilements , craving , and kamma that proliferates ( ussada ) will be absolutely extinct . Such a person who is capable of viewing all three types of conceit with indifference , will have no passionate desire , anger , delusion , conceit , wrong views , or defilements that will perpetuate repeated existences . As long as these conditions remain , the cycle of existences will continue without end . These conditions are therefore called things that proliferate ( ussad ? ) . It has been stated that they are no longer in extant . This expression has been omitted in the motto stated earlier because of its nature of causative effect . The meaning of the said motto and the relevant verse is clear enough . <h> Verse Nine <p> The gist of this verse is that craving and wrong view , which may be relied upon by a person , no longer exist . Realising the truth of conditioned mental and physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dependent on any phenomenon that occurs within or outside the physical body . Wrong view is another thing on which one may rely assuming something to be ' I , ' ' he , ' ' she , ' or ' a living being ' , who is eternal or who will totally be annihilated after death . A person who has no craving and wrong view on which reliance can be made in this way is an Arahant . An Arahant is , therefore , a venerable person who , having truly realised the truth of conditioned mental and physical phenomena as impermanent , unsatisfactory , and not-self , will , it is stated , never think of any kind of mind and matter as being permanent , delightful , or , as a living being , a living substance , or self , and will have no attachment . <p> Yassa : an Arahant will have no attachment to eternalism ( sassata di ? ? hi ) -- the heresy that mind and matter are eternal for continued existences -- or to annihilationism ( uccheda-di ? ? hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , ordinary worldlings are likely to believe that what is called " I " or " he , " " a living being " or a " self , " is everlasting , and that although the crude form of material body may be destroyed , the living soul or self is not subject to destruction . They believe that it is transmitted to another place or existence to reside therein and that it can never be annihilated . A heretical view of this kind is called a view of existence ( bhava-di ? ? hi ) , or eternalism ( sassata-di ? ? hi ) . A heresy accepting that one passes into nothingness after death , that believes in non-existence after death , is a view of non-existence ( vibh ? va-di ? ? hi ) , otherwise known as annihilationism ( uccheda-di ? ? hi ) . Ordinary worldlings have a liking for one of these two view . An Arahant , who entertains no such beliefs , will not long for any kind of repeated existence . An Arahant is called a sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse . <h> Verse Ten <p> It has been taught by the Buddha as : " An Arahant who has reached the final stage of purity and who is fully accomplished with the noble attributes as stated before , without any attachment to sensual desires is as sage . Such an individual is said to have extinguished all the burning fires of defilements . " Tassa : this Arahant who is called a sage is not entangled in things that can tie him down . It is something like a string which , if tied at its ends with other pieces of string , knotted at the joints , will be linked to become a continuous chain of string without ends . In the same way , craving and wrong view , which serve as ties that link one existence to another at the end of every life , are known as bonds ( gantha ) . As these bonds serve as a connecting link , ordinary worldlings are drifting along in the endless current of existence . A Stream-winner will have seven existences to undergo at the most . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reborn in any one of the two existences , the realms of form or formless realms of Brahm ? . As for an Arahant , he or she has completely severed the link by eradicating these bonds , which bring about a continuity of existences . An Arahant has therefore prevailed over the entanglements of craving , and has utterly destroyed its linking mechanism . This should be clear enough . <h> Verse Eleven <p> The gist of the above verse is that a person who has become a sage will have no attachment at all , and will not cling to children or any tangible property , such as livestock , cultivated fields , land , or property , beginning from the time of attaining Arahantship , although he or she may have children and so on , before becoming an Arahant . An Arahant has also completely dispelled all heretical beliefs . This has been explained in the previous verses . It has been repeated to make people understand if spoken in one 's own plain language . <h> Verse Twelve <p> The above P ? ? i verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise devas and human being as well as wise hermits , monks and brahmins are alleged to be persons who are afflicted with the sores or sufferings of passionate desires , etc. , and who are infuriated with such afflictions . An Arahant , however , remains without mental distress not being dominated by such harmful and faulty passionate desires . As regards common worldlings and trainees on the path , they are slaves to the dictates of sensual desires and so forth . It amounts to selecting sensual desire and other defilements to be their guide who will lead the way for them . Furthermore , because of the presence of these defilements , the guide who leads them , ordinary worldlings and trainees may at time be driven by passion . That is why the ordinary worldlings and trainees have attachment . Sometimes , though they may not be influenced by passion and anger , but when circumstances so permit , they are ready by their own inclination to be overpowered by passion and anger . They are liable to be accused by others as being wrathful and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader . He or she is impeccable and therefore free from any such allegations . An Arahants is totally devoid of attachment and anger , and so is immune from any kind of accusations . He is unperturbed and tranquil . This is obvious . <h> Verse Thirteen <p> Muni : a monk who is a noble Arahant , v ? tagedho : is free from greed or avarice , amacchar ? : is not envious , na vadate : will not speak , na ussesu : of excelling others ( neither because of seniority since ordination , nor regarding knowledge in scriptures , nor in the number of disciples or devotees ) , na samesu : being equal in status , na omesu : nor inferior , akappiyo : having no intention to speak thus with craving or wrong view , and will get rid of such evil thoughts . <h> Verse Fourteen <p> The above P ? ? i verse denotes that an Arahant does not entertain any slightest feeling of attachment to property or any other substantial things whether it is the body , limbs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an Arahant has extirpated both craving and wrong view . Having been fully released or liberated from such feelings , he or she is free from worry and grief , and will not be dejected due to the loss of any limb or organ , or any personal property . Neither will an Arahant be destined for any unfortunate existence because of any incident that may occur in relation to conditioned mental and physical phenomena . This term has several shades of meaning and applies to all things , animate or inanimate , such as sentient beings , clothing , food , paddy , gold , silver , houses , monasteries , etc. , for human consumption or use , if viewed from the perspective of insight . Even then , these conditioned mental and physical phenomena are regarded as " I , " " he , " " she , " " self , " " mine , " and so on . These are all included in the term phenomena ( dhammesu ) . <p> Having been taught for the benefit of outstanding intellectuals who have profound wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to understand properly . Ordinary worldlings do things that should not be done regarding themselves or others , merely for gratification and benefit of physical and mental aggregates that are inherently transient . They may resort to committing evils due to hatred , malice , envy , anger , delusion , or ignorance . An Arahant is free from the four wrong courses ( agati ) -- acting through desire , hatred , delusion , and fear . He or she will avoid all demeritorious acts , including evil speech and thoughts . An Arahant who is pre-eminent and accomplished with all noble attributes as stated is called a sage with peace and tranquility of mind , fully emancipated from the burning fires of defilements . <h> Conclusion of the Discourse <p> The Pur ? bheda Sutta Dhamma ends with the fourteenth verse . It contains one verse in the form of a question and thirteen verses in the form of an answer , fourteen in all , as catechism . The question put was : " What kind of insight and moral conduct should a person possess to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be comprehensive with the first of the thirteen verses only . However , considering the varying degrees of intellectual accomplishment of the respective devas and brahmas who formed the huge congregation , the Buddha answered in thirteen verses with appropriate language in use at that time .

##916250 <h> How Does the LTTE End ? <p> This is a question , which resonates in the minds of many Sri Lankans , today . There seems to be many propositions about the ultimate end of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE . The most popular one is militarily defeating the LTTE . Perhaps , the less popular notion is ending of the LTTE through a political process at this crucial point in time . <p> However , before talking about a possible end of the LTTE , it is useful to look at ways in which a terrorist organization could reach its end . Of course , like many other things in this world , every terrorist organization would cease to be functioning one day . <p> According to the history many terrorist organizations have seen their ultimate death in many ways . They reached the end achieving a limited victory , joining the political process , when their central aims and objectives become obsolete , and due to successful military operations of the Government forces . <p> In this manner , many groups including IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nepal Maoist groups , and Free Aceh Movement ( Indonesia abandoned their terror campaign joining the political process . Most of the other groups such as Italian Red Brigade , Armed Islamic Group ( Algeria ) , Aum Shinrikyo Japan and Chechen Guerrilla Russia have seen their end in the hands of the law enforcement authorities . Interestingly , Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been continuing with the terror campaign even after gaining significant political power . Japanese Red Army died away due to non viability of their campaign . On certain occasions some groups have joined different other groups dissolving their original organization . More importantly , the military forces have become the main reason to end terrorist groups only in handful of cases , where the terrorist organizations continued to reject political settlements to the disputes . <p> In considering the above , analyzing certain aspects viz. central aim of the LTTE , use of military power to reach its goals , and use of political means to reach its ultimate goals , it would not be impossible to foresee the end of the LTTE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LTTE was the so called liberation of Tamils in Sri Lanka and creation of separate state for Tamils . Today , the LTTE has deviated significantly from the main goal and it behaves like a typical terrorist movement , which has been unleashing terror even on their own people for selfish gains . Its draconic rules and unending terrorist activities have made the lives of the Tamils in the North extremely difficult . This has resulted in growing rejection of the LTTE by the Tamils . On certain occasions , people have openly questioned the legitimacy of the LTTE as the sole representative of the Tamils . It is a fact that the most of the activities of the LTTE did not ensure a loud applauds from the Tamils . <p> Externally , only a handful of the Tamil Diaspora extends a helping hand to the LTTE largely due to ethnic affinity and their adherence to the concept of Tamil homeland . <p> In the war front , the LTTE has been unable to make use of its military muscles effectively to reach their central aim although it has been waging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funds collected mainly from the Tamil community around the world . The history of its military campaigns indicates that the LTTE is nowhere near in advancing its goals through military means . <p> Undoubtedly , even if it continues to fight for another decade , the LTTE would not be able to defeat the military forces of the Sri Lanka army and sustain the insurgency unless they could perform a miracle . The past events indicates that the LTTE is not capable of posing a significant threat to the Sri Lankan military forces consisting of superior manpower and better training , modern equipment , and able leadership . <p> It is also a fact that the LTTE has rejected the political process as a vehicle to reach their goals . The organization rejected to contest in any election . At the same time , it opposed all the proposals presented by the Sri Lankan Government . If the LTTE had been able to reach some sort of agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka in the past , by now they could have at least been able to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Sri Lanka . In this sense , the LTTE failed to make use of ample opportunities which were available to them in the past . Still it has not indicated willingness to look for any alternative other than war despite repeated losses . To be successful , the LTTE should have used more energy towards finding a political settlement to the conflict . This illustrates that rejection of the political process is a fundamental fault in the LTTE strategy . <p> With that in mind , it would be possible to evaluate the present status of the LTTE in order to find a clue about the end of the organization . Undoubtedly , the LTTE is nearing the end of its journey towards Eelam simply because it has not been reasonably effective , flexible , and people centric . The logic is simple . The LTTE would not be able to wage a protracted war without replenishing its wastage and losses . For that they need the support of the people . In order to obtain the support of the people they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second generation of the Tamil Diaspora is also less enthusiastic and fascinated about the conflict as opposed to their elders . <p> It appears that the LTTE is finding it very difficult to ensure adequate funds in the long run . In fact , the people have rejected the LTTE on the ground that it has not presented a good report card and achieved what it promised many decades ago . On top of it , when the LTTE continuously loses its military campaigns and fails to sit at the negotiation table and present a viable solution to the conflict , it will no longer be able to be functional as an effective organization . <p> Above analysis suggests that the only option available for the LTTE , if the group wants to prevent wiping out of its name from the history of the conflict in Sri Lanka , is to lay down arms in order to make a transition to nonviolence and talk to the Government with the blessings of the Tamil people , who are yearning for peace . <p> Laying down arms is a necessary component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is genuine in looking for peace . More importantly , the LTTE ? s probability of success in actually overthrowing a democratically elected Government in Sri Lanka militarily is zero at this moment in history . However , it seems that the LTTE does not wish to resort to this last option . 
##916251 <h> Open the gates of hell - and let my people go ... <p> I was not at all surprised to read the article by Dr. Nadesan in the ' Asian Tribune ' explaining why it was time to release the long suffering people from the clutches of the LTTE and their despotic leader . I applaud him wholeheartedly for writing what most Tamils wanted to say , but did not have the ' ticker ' to take the first step . <p> I , as he once was , was an ardent supporter of ' Eelam ' I came to this country by using the excuse of ' genocide ' by the Sinhala , Buddhist people when in reality , I left the country with a passport issued by the Sri Lankan Government , and boarded a plane from her international airport . <p> Before ' becoming a refugee ' I lived amongst the Sinhala people all my life , went to school with 99% of my friends from that community , enjoyed life with them and graduated from one of that country 's premier Universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was more difficult than back there , because of my so-called ' Indian accent ' ) in this country , because of the quality of education I received , free of charge , from that country . <p> As soon as I landed in Australia , I began working towards obtaining my Permanent Resident Visa by betraying and demonizing my best and dearest friends . I used the ' 1983 black July ' riots to justify my case and submitted may case though I knew very well that , no decent Sinhala person was even remotely involved in it . I knew it was not an ' ethnic problem . I knew it was a ' social ' problem whereby the people living on the fringes of society , made use of the situation to loot and grab whatever they could from wherever they could . They came from all ethnic groups including Tamils . I was frightened but I also knew that it was temporary . All this while the people whom I demonized ( when I came here ) were my ' guardians ' They lived in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of the day entirely for letting the situation get out of control , and I still do . <p> As time passed , I began reflecting on what I had done and was continuing to do . As a devout Hindu I could not justify my support for an organization that had decimated the Tamil population , eliminated its academics and leaders , taken our youngsters and turned them into killers but claimed to be our ' sole representative ' I read of young girls ( who had escaped from the Vanni ) being raped by senior LTTE cadres and later offered to foreigners as ' entertainment ' ( These girls would later volunteer as suicide bombers because they were not ' pure ' any more ) . <p> Then I realized why so many Westerners came to the Vanni for ' direct negotiations ' with the LTTE , and why they were backing the LTTE in Sri Lanka , while fiercely opposing terrorism in their countries . It was an ' erotic escapade ' in an exotic island , far away from wife/husband and family . I heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany , etc. , to collect funds for the ' cause ' I heard of some of them ' living it up ' with these funds . I realized , slowly and painfully , what was happening to our people in the guise of ' liberating ' them . <p> We had created a huge monster which was devouring our people but had no power to destroy it . A ' Global business ' with ships , credit card frauds , people smuggling , narcotic trading , arms smuggling , a band-wagon of NGOs and the ' international community ' to support the ' cause ' BUT the ' cause ' itself was now nowhere in the picture . The ' effect ' or the outcome of the cause was far better than the actual ' cause ' it was big money and living the good life in the West , as it also was for the Tiger ' big wigs in the Vanni . So who cared about the helpless people in ' Eelam ' we had taken the ' tiger by the tail ' <p> First the Tamil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing about them . Soon it will become be a huge roar . But will it be too late for our people ' back home ' <p> We need to act immediately . Let the people living in the Vanni decide their future . Let the ' international community ' the NGOs , church leaders , Human Rights organizations and everybody supporting the LTTE come and observe who decides to leave our ' Eelam ' Let the Government afford safe passage to anybody who wants to leave . Offer them decent living conditions in safe refugee camps , till they are able to go to their homes once the fighting ends . Let us add a little prefix to Dr.Nadesan 's article heading and say " Open the gates of hell - and let my people go 
##916252 <h> Caught in the Middle <p> " I am a school principal in Poonakary .... How can I teach children who are so afraid ? We have to spend so much time counselling them .... Last year my eldest daughter was taken by the LTTE to fight . She was 19 years old . In June this year she was given back to us , but she was dead " . Pillai ( IN Pictures : Fleeing Sri Lankan War -- BBC ) <p> Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse is not only the President 's brother ( in an administration which seems to place an unnatural premium on family connections ) ; he is also the military czar of the Rajapakse administration , the man who is directing the war effort . Therefore his public pronouncements , especially on matters of national security , must be taken extremely seriously . <p> Some time back Mr. Rajapakse tried to expel North-Eastern Tamils from Colombo lodges citing security concerns . This unconstitutional , anti-democratic and anti-civilisational act was widely denounced , nationally and internationally . The massive adverse reaction , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expulsion drive . In a recent interview Gotabhaya Rajapakse resurrected his old idea , arguing that such ' human control measures ' are necessary , indeed unavoidable , in the current context : " An alarming situation has been observed by the Security Forces as a large number of people have come to the Colombo Police Division in August alone without any valid reason ... In August 6,950 people have come to the Colombo Police Division and are temporarily living in lodges , houses and various other places . This is not normal . This is an abnormal thing . It causes a lot of problems . Among other things it causes a lot of security risks . I prefer most of these people who had come from other areas to Colombo and suburbs and who are staying here without any valid reason to go back to their areas because it is an immense problem for the Security Forces to provide security . The LTTE mingles with these people to infiltrate these areas ..... We must be prepared for this . That is why we are doing human control measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do these things " ( Daily News -- 13.9.2008 ) . <p> The inference is obvious ; Mr. Rajapakse wants all non-Colombo Tamils to leave Colombo . His remarks are probably in the nature of a trial balloon , to see whether the winds are favourable for a new expulsion drive . Constitutionally the government has no right to prevent the free movement of Lankan citizens within their own country . Any attempt to impede the free movement of Tamils will be unjust and discriminatory , according to national and international laws . It would provide the LTTE with a powerful politico-propaganda weapon and exacerbate our international isolation . Remarkably Gotabhaya Rajapakse is undaunted by the adverse consequences of what he disingenuously calls ' human control measures ' . Despite the failure of the first attempt he obviously he wants to give it another go . On Sunday there is going to be a special ' census ' to register Tamils from North living in Colombo . If a report in the website , Lanka Dissent is correct , the second expulsion drive has already begun with a group of Tamils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours . Perhaps this time the attempt will be made piecemeal instead of en masse , thereby lessening its shock effect and propaganda value . No consideration of justice or fair play will stop Mr. Rajapakse since he is obviously convinced he is doing the right thing ; he can be stopped only by another storm of protests ( nationally and internationally ) and the intervention of the judiciary . <p> Enemy Aliens ? Wars are sometimes unavoidable or even necessary . But there is nothing humanitarian about a military offensive , which endangers a large number of defenceless civilians . However necessary the war against the Tigers may be , it is important to remember the impact it has on the Tamil civilians in the zone of conflict , caught between a brutal terror outfit and a ruthless administration . They , after all , are Sri Lankans , and therefore can not be treated as enemy aliens , without justifying separatism . <p> The Fourth Eelam War is likely to continue until either Vellupillai Pirapaharan is dead ( most likely by his own hand ; he will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalemate is achieved . It is not in the nature of the LTTE to surrender ; further retreat is becoming increasingly impossible , geographically , politically and militarily . Therefore the Tigers are likely to continue with their resistance . In fact the LTTE has stepped up its attempts to conscript more civilian Tamils to serve as cannon fodder in the coming battles ; it is also preventing civilian Tamils from fleeing into the relative safety of government controlled areas , so that they can function as human shields . Corpses of Tamil men women and children , killed by aerial bombing and artillery fire , will be an important politico-propaganda weapon in the Tiger arsenal . The LTTE needs civilian causalities in substantial numbers to create a groundswell of opinion in Tamilnadu , which in turn will impact on Delhi , especially in an election year . <p> That the LTTE is not concerned about the safety and wellbeing of the Tamils is an axiomatic truth , borne out by its conduct , past and present . This fact , by itself , may not have been catastrophic , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treating Tamils as enemy aliens . Today Tamil civilians are caught in a vicious and inescapable trap ; the LTTE is deliberately placing them in danger while the Lankan government is indifferent to their fate . The civilian Tamils , especially the ones in the war zone , have no representatives or protectors . In this war they are the real victims ; they will be losers , irrespective of which way the war ends . <p> The government wants civilian Tamils in Tiger controlled areas to brave the wrath of the LTTE . What reason has the government given these people to believe that they will be treated with fairness if they do flee into government controlled territory ? Not only is there no political solution to the ethnic problem or credible investigations into human rights violations ; the government seems to be intent on treating Tamils everywhere as enemy aliens , suspect simply because they are Tamil . <p> Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse says , " If some people have come from the East or any other place to Colombo and if they are staying here without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course those who had come from Wanni have come here as they are facing problems " ( ibid ) . A regime that regards any Tamil as a potential Tiger is unlikely to treat refugees from Wanni and Killinochchi very differently . In fact they are more likely to be regarded with suspicion and treated with hostility , if not worse . After all they have lived in Tiger controlled areas for a long time . Most of them would have family members in the LTTE ; they would have had to cooperate with the LTTE in hundreds of ways , over the years they lived under Tiger rule . Given this reality what will happen to these ordinary people if they heed the call of the government and flee into cleared areas ? What guarantee is there that they will not be treated as enemy aliens , guilty until proven innocent ? <p> As far as the administration is concerned most Tamils are real or a potential Tigers , simply because all Tigers are Tamils . Such an attitude provides the psychological basis for collective punishment , the penalising of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or terrorists . This approach is evident in the way the regime is treating civilian Tamils holed up in Tiger controlled areas . The government has ordered the civilians to get out of Tiger controlled areas . Tigers are impeding the people of Vanni and Killinochchi from escaping into the relative safety of government controlled areas . According to the government the civilians want to get away but are being held back forcibly by the LTTE to be used as human shields and cannon fodder . Going by this argument civilian Tamils are still in Tiger controlled areas not out of choice but because they are being held captive by the LTTE . Is it then logical , let alone just , to use aerial bombardment and artillery fire in areas teeming with hapless men , women and children , many of whom refugees from earlier battles ? Is it not akin to punishing innocent people , simply because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ? <p> The war is not taking place in a political vacuum . The world and India will be watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parameters within which the war will have to be fought if Colombo wants to keep Delhi neutral : " We have already expressed our concern to the Lankan authorities . While taking action against the LTTE , steps should also be taken to protect the civilian Tamils in Sri Lanka and ensure their safety and security " . It is a fair enough position and one that should have been embraced by Sri Lanka of its own volition . After all , if we believe in an undivided Sri Lanka , the civilians holed up in Tiger controlled areas are our citizens and it is the duty of the Lankan state and government to protect them . <p> Incentives Human beings have a natural aversion to leave their habitats of long duration and take a leap into the unknown , even in the face of danger and terror . If the regime really wants to persuade civilian Tamils to brave the wrath of the Tiger , a strong incentive must be provided . The best method would have been to set up a series of camps in safe and proximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps are provided with basic minimum facilities , the people in Tiger controlled areas could have been asked to leave , with a ready made incentive as encouragement . In such a context the people would know they would be relatively safe and cared for and that could have given them the necessary psychological strength to defy Tiger orders . True the Tigers would have misused some of these facilities , infiltrating them posing as refugees . But that is a risk that comes with the context , and therefore unavoidable . And it preferable to forcing all refugees into internment camps , just to weed out a few Tigers . <p> Instead of such humanitarian treatment all the Tamils got was an ultimatum , which landed on them in the form of a leaflet by the regime . It told them to get out or face the consequences -- hardly the way to win hearts and minds . According to media reports civilians are fleeing deeper into Tiger controlled territory instead of fleeing out of it . The government has mishandled the entire issue . Heavy civilian casualties can well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the civilians in the war zone is not hard to imagine , especially in the current inclement weather . They live in fear of their lives and often lack even the basic minimum facilities . The UN and other humanitarian agencies played a considerable role in providing some of necessities to these people . For many ( especially for the more vulnerable segments such as children and the elderly ) this help may have meant the difference between life and death . Therefore , ordering these humanitarian agencies to get out of the Tiger controlled areas , without putting an alternative arrangement in place , is unintelligent at best and criminal at

##916551 <h> The Extremist Way <p> April has been an educative month , so far . In the first week of April , white-vanning reached new levels of omnipotence and omnipresence . <p> The sudden disappearance and the equally unlooked for reappearance of Premakumar Gunaratnam and Dimuthu Attygala has compelled even the generally soporific opposition to bestir itself , and ask for a parliamentary debate on abductions . <p> In the second week of April , on Sinhala and Tamil New Year 's Day , seven Tamil houses in Dilithura ( a village in Elpitiya , Galle ) were looted and burnt , because one young Tamil man did not call a Sinhala soldier on leave , ' sir ' . Instead of arresting the perpetrators of this orgy of arson and looting , the police arrested two Tamil youths .... <p> In the third week of April came the ' mosque-fracas ' in Dambulla , a political thunderbolt in a month known for its massive thundershowers . <p> " A society that has been centred on protecting , maintaining and furthering the oppression of another people produces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Israelis -- it 's human . " Emily L Hauser ( Daily Beast - 6.4.2012 ) <p> Ostensibly the issue was the ' illegal construction ' of a mosque on a land belonging to a temple . If this is the actual bone of contention , it is very much a law-and-order issue which could and should have been settled via courts of law . But instead of seeking legal redress , a demonstration with anti-Muslim overtones was organised , demanding the immediate demolition of the mosque . The day before the demonstration the mosque was patrol-bombed . No perpetrators have been caught and " when contacted , police spokesman SP Ajith Rohana said he had no information about such an incident " ( Sri Lanka Mirror -- 20.4.2012 ) . <p> The organisers decided to hold their demonstration on Friday , for maximum explosive effect . According to media reports , the demonstrators did not content themselves with demanding the removal of a supposedly unauthorised structure : " The protestors were calling for the demolition of the mosque claiming that Dambulla is a holy area exclusive to only Buddhists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Ceylon Today -- 20.4.2012 ) . If this contention is accepted and the mosque is demolished , it will create a deadly precedent which will embolden religious extremists across Sri Lanka . And ere long , Sinhala supremacists will insist on the removal of all non-Buddhist religious edifices from areas already declared ' sacred ' ; or demand that more areas be declared ' sacred ' as a prelude to removing Christian , Hindu and Muslim places of worship from them . <p> Was the mosque a new one ? Was it constructed illegally ? Does the land on which it stands belong to the temple ? None of these questions can be answered because there was no impartial investigation , no due process , no judicial inquiry , no legal ruling . There was just mob power with a pinch of terrorism ( what is the fire bombing of a place of worship but an act of terrorism ? ) , a supine police and an accommodating government . <p> According to media reports , the Masjidul Khaira mosque " had been in existence since the 1960s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area . Expansions and renovations to the mosque began recently .... " ( ibid ) . The demonstrators want the destruction of the entire mosque , and not just the recent extensions . They also intertwined the issue of ' religious conversions ' with their anti-mosque campaign , thereby giving the issue a political provenance of national significance . <p> Is this just a flash in the pan incident ? Or an omen , presaging another battle , against another minority ? . Sinhala Supremacism and Rajapaksa Supremacism <p> Sinhala supremacism and Rajapaksa supremacism are two sides of the same coin . Most Sinhala supremacists support Rajapaksa Rule while the Rajapaksas accepts the core beliefs of Sinhala supremacism . Sinhala supremacists need the Rajapaksas to stay in the game while the Rajapaksas need Sinhala supremacism to give their Familial project an acceptable raison d ' tre . Without the Rajapaksa Siblings , Sinhala supremacism will cease being politically relevant and Sinhala supremacists will find themselves relegated to the fringes of the polity . Similarly without the politico-ideological cover provided by Sinhala supremacism , the Rajapaksa project will become revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in power forever . <p> The relationship between Sinhala supremacists and the Rajapaksas is thus not just mutually beneficial ; it is also a necessary precondition for the political survival and prosperity of both perties . But maintaining that relationship requires each side to make accommodations , to concede , to take a step back , to support , condone or at least refrain from opposing measures which are outside its agenda ( and perhaps even somewhat deleterious to it ) . <p> The story of Gen. Sarath Fonseka is an excellent case in point . Gen. Fonseka was a Sinhala supremacist . Indeed he was the first Army Commander to advocate and justify a Sinhala First agenda openly . And as a true believer he played a key role , together with Mahinda and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , in giving the Fourth Eelam War a Sinhala supremacist shape , tone and tenor . For most Sinhalese he was a hero second only to President Rajapaksa . The Rajapaksa-Fonseka fallout was not beneficial to the Sinhala supremacist cause ; it was an internecine battle the Sinhala supremacists did not desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice between the Rajapaksas and Gen. Fonseka , the absolute majority of Sinhala supremacists opted for the former , forcing the latter to moderate his stance and locate himself in a more centrist position politically , in order to gain a degree of electoral relevance . <p> The Rajapaksas too would make minor concessions to satisfy their core-constituency , so long as these measures do not interfere with their political project or their personal lifestyle . Thus , in the contestation between a chief prelate and a Rajapaksa offspring on night races in Kandy , the Buddhist priest lost . But where the needs , interests , whims and fancies of the Family are not involved , the Rajapaksas would be quite accommodative towards Sinhala supremacists . <p> Though the relationship between the Rajapaksas and the Sinhala supremacists is of critical importance to both parties , it is not a relationship of equals . It is the Rajapaksas who are in command , who have the upper hand , who have the final say . In his epic poem Wavuluwa ( The Saga of the Bat ) , the outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that the relationship between a Sinhala ruler and Buddhism can take two forms : either the ruler uses Buddhism to further his own political project ; or the ruler , as a true believer , genuinely tries to be guided by Buddhism . Mr. Tennakoon 's example for the second model is King Sirisangabo who gave up his kingdom and eventually his life to remain true to his Buddhist principles , a course of action the poet so obviously disapproves of . He contrasts this with the conduct of King Dutugemunu who " rode the ( Buddha ) sasana to destroy Tamil power " ( " sasuna pita nega , Demala bala binda " ) . Here the ruler is the controller , the rider , the decider ; religion is merely the vehicle he uses to achieve his temporal objective . <p> That is the model the Rajapaksas seem to be pursuing vis--vis Sinhala supremacists . SWRD Bandaranaike tried it first with ' Sinhala Only ' but he was unable to control the forces he unleashed and was ultimately destroyed by them . Mr. Bandaranaike was a political liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Sinhala supremacism for his electoral ends , hoping that he would be able to rein it in once in power . He failed spectacularly . The Rajapaksas are not political liberals ; their despotic political vision dovetails perfectly with the revanchism integral to Sinhala supremacism . They both hark back to a past , to a county ruled by Sinhala monarchs with absolute powers . Thus Sinhala supremacism and Rajapaksa supremacism can and do work in tandem in general , even though when it comes to a choice , major or minor , Rajapaksa supremacism wins hands down . <p> Was last week 's Dambulla fracas a Sinhala supremacist project which the Rajapaksas acceded to , in a quid-pro-quo spirit ? Or was it part of a Rajapaksa effort to create new conflicts and new enemies to divert Sinhala attention from growing hunger pangs ? Or was it a bit of both , a project in which both sides have a stake , a project on which both sides can and do work together ? <p> Educating the Minorities <p> Sinhala supremacism presupposes the acceptance of Sri Lanka as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . According to this vision , minorities , including Sinhala Christians , are not co-owners of Sri Lanka but guests in it . They have no inalienable rights and their treatment depends on whether they accept their unequal status willingly or not . <p> Under Rajapaksa rule we are all subjects , including the chiefest of the Buddhist prelates . To be a good subject , Sinhala Buddhists have to submit to Rajapaksa dictats , willingly and unquestioningly . The ones who do not , like Gen. Fonseka , are immediately branded a traitor and hounded out of the patriotic community . <p> To be a good subject , non-Sinhala Buddhists have to submit to Rajapaksa dictats and accept Sinhala Buddhist dominance . <p> The Tamils have been put in their place . Now it is the turn of the Muslims . <p> Monsters can not be appeased , because they are maximalist by nature ; maximalism helps make a monster and no monster is complete without it . The Tigers began their bloody march towards sole-representative status in a gradualist manner , targeting one competitor at a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TELO was attacked because it was pro-Indian and wallowed in criminality ; the EPRLF was attacked because the EPRLF attacked first . There was always a ' reason ' , whether the target was an individual or an organisation . This approach prevented the Tamils from seeing the nature of the danger and creating a broad unity to defeat it in time . The future targets believed that they were safe so long as they avoided the mistakes attributed by the Tiger to the current victim . It was an illusion the Tiger did nothing to dispel and perhaps even encouraged deliberately . It was useful , because it effectively concealed a fundamental truth -- that under Tiger rule no other organisation or entity will be permitted to exist , except in the capacity of a LTTE appendage , that total and unquestioning obedience to every Tiger demand will be the basic precondition for survival . <p> The Rajapaksas seem to be travelling in an analogous direction . A Sinhala supremacist , Rajapaksa supremacist Sri Lanka might be marginally more accommodative than a Tiger Eelam -- it will not expel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tigers did . Minorities will be permitted to live so long as they accept their status as second class subjects who must submit to not just Rajapaksa dictats but also Sinhala Buddhist demands .

##918650 <p> Ancient houses most often have a grand past and a pervading charm of a by gone era which captures the heart and transports one back to a place not easily found amidst contemporary society -- urban , suburban or otherwise . The Godamunne Walauwa is very much one of these grand relics which provides a window to the gracious life style typical of an aristocratic residence . <p> Each area of the house is of purpose and together tells a story of life in the Walauwa . It is evidently a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of life ; structured to cocoon and sustain its inhabitants in its own intrinsic culture and way of life . <p> The Godamunne family is from the village that bears their name in the highlands of Hewaheta and was part of the queens establishment throughout the history of Kandy up until 1815 , when the Island fell to the British and the Monarchy was abolished . <p> The Godamunne Sakalasuri family came to own land in Ampitiya Sagamarata where the present Walauwa stands , in 1758 A.D. and 1765 A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Godamunne Mudali for " indomitable courage and skill in war against the Dutch during their invasion of Kandy . Hence the distinct architectural similarity of the Walauwa to that of the Dalukgolle temple Ampitiya , which was a gift by King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe to the Asgiriya chapter in 1772 A.D. <p> Ampitiya was a Katupurulle village i.e a village of the palace secret service . Hence the land granted by the king to have the family reside close to the palace - when the Royal residences were relocated to the buildings behind the present temple of the tooth . Then on the Godamunne Sakalasurya family maintained two Walauwas : the Maha Walauwa in Godamunne and the present one in Ampitiya . The family moved permanently to Ampitiya in 1818 , following their proscription and confiscation of their lands in Godamunne , Hewaheta by the British colonial Government ; for the role they played in supporting the Wellissa Rebellion : <p> Godamunne Sakasuri alias The Rebel , led forces of Hewaheta and Harispattuwa against the British imperial forces in 1818 together with Arawe Apa . The Walauwa was finally over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Frazer of the imperial forces who is said to have made an example of the Godamunne 's by the severe punishment meted out to the family . <p> While Arawe was banished to the Isle of France , Godamunne was proscribed and all lands in Hewaheta confiscated . All that withstood the ravaging forces of the Imperial army in the Godamunne Village were the Ambalama and the Sagama Rajamaha Viharaya , both of which today remain conserved and preserved . <p> The family having lost their lands in Godamunne as well as most of their Sannas when the original Walauwa was set a blaze in 1818 , was not able to prove owner ship to colonial government of the many other lands ; which thereby fell under the waste lands ordinance of 1848 . Since 1863 the paraveni lands in Ampitiya which were held intact were subject to partition among the various descendant of the family . And while many hundreds of acres in the surrounding area have been thus lost to the extended gardens of the Walauwa , the current owner remains absolute in his ownership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always of great orderliness . There was a time and a place for everything and every body and protocol sacred . Different clans of people were organized according to function and this system ensured a consistency of life style and tradition . Life at the Walauwa was structured in three parallel paradigms : The front area , the middle sanctum and the back area . These areas were further sub divided to the Udu Male , and the Palleha Male , which denoted the boundaries of servitude . <p> The front area of the house was reserved for matters of office and state . For instance the first president of Ceylon was a frequent visitor being a family friend . A young junior secretary ( at the time ) named Dingiri Banda Wijetunge who was often found a sleep on the front verandah bench waiting to see Mr. Albert Godamunne ; to convey messages to and from Minister A. Ratnayake must be fondly remembered ; as Dingiri Banda Wijetunge later became the 3 rd executive president of Sri Lanka . The grand son of Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe who came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim and restitution and the numerous political leaders of the time and Nilames of the Maligawa and Dewale 's who would visit were the likes of those who were met and entertained in the front area . <p> The meda kotuwa or middle sanctum of the Walauwa which was reached by passing several consecutive doorways which were all curtained , was strictly reserved for family and entertaining visiting relations . No more than 3 servants served in this area . They generally spoke only if they were spoken to and that too in a very hushed tone . The middle sanctum was a place of absolute peace . Those attending this area were all females of the Govi wansa . The appuhamy 's would serve at meal times only and otherwise enter the medakotuwa at 10.00 in the morning and 3.00 in the afternoon for cleaning and purification . They never entered the rooms off the middle sanctum . The meda kotuwa would be further purified in the evening by one of the women who would carry an incense burner from room to room . <p> The back area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a most structured and orderly manner . There was the domain of the men and the women . The kitchens were under the women who again were of four different groups . Those who attended to work in the upper kitchen and prepared meals for the gentry and the women of the lower kitchen who prepared meals for staff . Then there were those who were expert at preparing sweats and worked generally in the afternoon and the clan of women who attended to drying paddy , pounding and storing . These were the female staff of the back area . Then there were the chamber maids of the Udu Male . <p> Each clan had a clan leader . And all of them were kept in line including the chamber maids by the female hamy or the chief female attendant of the Udu male , who waited on the ladies and children . <p> The male workers consisted mainly of field staff such as the cultivator clans who would work the fields , the men who ran the dairy , those who drew water from the wells and tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picking of coconut , fruit or tapping Kitul etc . The drivers and helpers and the lamplighter who cleaned the lamps and polished the brass . There was also a village crew who on notice attended to all the repairs in the Walauwa . The Appuhamy 's kept all the male workers in line and attended to the gentry of the house . <p> Each group 's access was limited to certain physical boundaries of the house . And though not obvious these were never trespassed . For instance the clan who worked in the lower kitchen never ventured to any place at a higher level . The field workers went passed the back garden but not through any of the back doors of the Wallauwa . However , the head field worker would come everyday to the bottom of the back stairs and speak to the lady of the house who would sit at the top of the stairs and hold audience and take note of complaints issues and general progress . So did the heads of all the other working clans . They would climbs mid way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This entire system was held together by a symbiotic relationship which had come down from one generation to another . All those who worked for the family were the children of those who had played the same role over and over with each passing generation . So there was a deep sense of tradition , loyalty and mutual respect . Every generation of the Walauwe Handuruwos and those who worked for them had grown up together . All the workers and their children were looked after by the Walauwa . And the long arms of the Walauwa made sure they were not alone in sickness or in old age . And there was great sadness when an old hand passed away after serving the family for two or three generations . And to them especially the older ones the demise of a lady or gentlemen of the Walauwa was akin to the loss of a God Mother or Father . And similarly when changing economic times forced migration of the noble ladies and gentlemen to other cities and smaller dwellings , some of the staff moved with them . Some stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who were born to the Waluawa or worked and was looked after by it , the end of that era has left a vacuum thus far unfilled .

##925750 <p> by R. L. Lalprema At a television interview , in commemoration with the 109th birth anniversary of Dr. R. L. Brohier , his daughter , Mrs. Deloraine Brohier said how her father adored a profound love for humanity before everything else . Born on the 5th of October 1892 Richard Leslie Brohier , the Surveyor , turned out to be a celebrity in penmanship who gave expression to his life ? s experience of wide-ranging wanderings , in which , he maintained a rapport with the inhabitants whom he met in remote villages , even those veiled in thick jungles . <p> A culture and heritage symbolic of simplicity and virtue , he had been quite familiar with , enchanted him so much , that he delved into its 2500 year long history with great admiration accompanied by an undying thirst for knowledge . His readers , will , no doubt , see eye to eye with me to say that they were awakened to the beauty of several facets of their land and its people , sometimes for the first time , portrayed through his revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purview of his interests . In fact , the uniquely intriguing ? Blow hole ? or ? Hummanaya ? in Dickwella , is now a tourist attraction , after he had first seen its beauty and chosen it for inclusion in his books on travel . In a diversity of fields related to history , archaeology and anthropology , his discoveries and observations as found in his writings , confessed to his authoritative knowledge and the critical attitude , not accepting things at face value . <p> Born of parents of French ( Huguenot ) origin , he has a claim to an ancestry that made Sri Lanka its home from 1777 serving under the Dutch East India Company . However , his readers had been misinformed that he was of Dutch decent in view of the period under reference . The Portuguese and the Dutch rulers , perhaps , would not have known even the length and breadth of this land over which they exercised their sovereignty until the British founded a Department for surveying . As the time passed , it fell on Brohier , as the first Ceylonese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its length and breadth but also surveying the life and culture of its people from which he drew inspiration to form the backdrop of the bulk of his prolific writing . <p> This eventually brought him to limelight which culminated in his enjoying national recognition to earn an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Ceylon . His international reputation , just to mention one instance , made him an officer of the O.B.E. Having his education at the Royal Academy which was the founding name of Royal College he chose surveying as his profession , a trade then , neither familiar nor popular . He had the distinction to be the first Ceylonese Surveyor to join the Department run exclusively by the British Colonial officers . <p> Brohier says he roamed the country almost in its entirety for a life time with the theodolite and tape , but more so with a seeing eye , which I believe , many hundreds of his like had missed . Going further , with a discovering eye , he was animated by the singularity of a heritage of a people subjected to assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign powers . Eventually , the nomadic nature of his Public duty , enriched with authentic and authoritative information on what he had seen and discovered , made into books , had the pertinent names , Seeing Ceylon ( 1965 ) Discovering Ceylon ( 1973 ) which caught my eye in the old Library of the Survey Department where I too was employed much later . I felt honoured , that by a stroke of luck , I happened to work at the very place graced by so illustrious a man . There are many more books to add to his complete list of works , including posthumous publications . <p> It was a breath taking experience for I was amazed at his ability to understand in depth , the national heritage of a people whose influence on him could be overwhelming . He left no stone untumed to study every aspect of the life of those , then remaining , under trying conditions , in areas rarely visited by sluggish town dwellers . <p> Their simple existence and open attitude against the sophistication and presence of the urbane man fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the real claimants to a great heritage , evidently now in the form of relics . Crumbling ruins , debris of Dagobas and masses of brick and stone buried under the earth were his unsuspecting tools that helped him to dig up the past of a glorious civilization unparalleled in the history of mankind . <p> Unlike many other writers who wrote from their desks with the recorded information available , he had first hand data for him to write . He saw , he touched , he verified before he gave expression to his discoveries . He was so observant of the minute details of their beliefs and disbeliefs that he never forgot to touch even on the predictions of the cry of a gecko , they had reckoned to be a bad omen before starting off on any good work . <p> This broad knowledge of diverse people gleaned from many decades of travel , and his deep sense of the contrast between the urbanized Sinhalese and the freer nature of rural folk informed his writing . Apart from the academic approach to the subjects of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people and every living thing , reminiscent of a moving experience of fiction of realism , however minus fixed characters . I wish he were a fiction writer ! His books , that explored a legacy long left behind these people whom he held in overwhelming regard , emanated a charming style perked up with impeccable English . It easily conveyed to the English reader a faithful translation of the Sinhala idiom deep seated in the folklore , habits , and mannerisms . For instance , his translation of a familiar jingle Aturumithru dambadivathru reads , " The new bride which the merchant Rajakapuru brought , having taken a handful of rice , washed it and divided it between the upper and lower houses " <p> Mrs.Deloraine , she herself a writer , talked to me at her Bambalapitiya ancestral home , far down a lane closing at the sea , the outer walls of which bore the signs of unremitting assault by the rough blowing . The interior with a restrained array of antiques , old glass cupboards bursting with volumes , family photos , all emanated a serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surveyor General , then , Mr Johnson having met Mr.D.S.Senanayaka , the Minister of Lands who needed the service of a Surveyor as Sesretary to the first Delimitation Commission , introduced his Deputy Mr. Wilson as his ideal offer for the post . <p> The Minister ? s response was cut and dried , " I have already made my choice on Mr. Brohier . " A passing comment in general , made by Brohier on the outlook of officers of the generations that followed , was that they were lazy in making use of their experiences for widening their horizons . Endowed with the precious prospects of travelling far and wide , they were tensed with impatience in getting back home with the least possible delay , in order that they might make the most of a cocktail party or a card game in their club . On the contrary , wherever he visited , ruins of Rajarata or far away village settlements , for example , he had the humility to maintain a dialogue with the carefree villagers who rushed to see a gentleman in shorts and shoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temples , old patriarchs or children whom he met was a source of delight for him . <p> He documented all that for posterity , not to laugh at their idiosyncrasies but to study them , with respect , as symbolic of culture and humanity . Never did he make any attempt , as is practiced by some to write off them and their actions by the yardstick of the modern scientific thought or logic . " I have learnt to respect their beliefs and contemplate their self-mortification as an expression of penitence , with tranquillity . " he states . His unsettled urge made him probe into the origins of what is now practiced as custom and tradition to convince himself , beyond doubt , that they had been handed down to generations through tradition , convention or from the word of mouth . <p> This , he attempted to corroborate by comparing with the evidence born out of history , archaeology etc . Volumes of his books , confirm his great insight into the cultural life of Sinhala race , while his magnanimity comes with all his independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exams as is done generally . For me , Brohier is reminiscent of Martin Wickremasinghe , the greatest Sinhala writer of the century , in comparing what he has explored relating to life and culture . It had been a vacuum in the vast realm of our literature that his books were not available for the Sinhala reader . But now , a couple of translations have met with that need . However , I note with regret the English editions of many of his 
##925751 <p> Traders from all over the world were drawn here as she was renowned for its gems and spices . <p> Iron played a key role in the development of our Ancient Hydraulic Civilization and recording of our epigraphical rock inscriptions in the B.C Period , which was common place . <p> The Mahawamsa provides us with the first record Mineral Survey in the 2nd cent . B.C. , where it is recorded the location of precious minerals and gems with accuracy , as they are recorded in Polar Coordinates , of distance in Yojanas and angular direction based on the rising sun from the City of Anuradhapura . I have taken a Yojana as 8 miles and also corrected the Sun Azimuth for variations in their direction and indicated in a Map . <p> This gives a description of the places where precious minerals , gems and pearls were obtained from in building the Maha Tupa of Anuradhapura in the reign of King Dutta Gamini . <p> It says : - <p> " In a north-easterly direction from the city , a distance of 3 yojanas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land ) there appeared nuggets of gold of different sizes .... <p> " On the east side of the city , a distance of seven yojanas , the further bank of the river and near Tambapitta , copper , appeared ....

" <p> " In a southerly direction from the city , at a distance of eight yojanas , silver appeared in the Ambatthakola-cave .... " <p> " In a westerly direction from the city , at a distance of five yojanas , near the landing place , Uruvela , pearls .... " <p> " In a northerly direction from the city , at a distance of seven yojanas , in a cave opening on the Pelivapitagama-tank , above on the sand , four splendid gems had formed in size like to a small mill-stone , in colour like flax-flowers , ( radiantly ) beautiful .... " <p> The location corresponds to : Gold near Kabitigollawa/Ranbewa , Copper near Tamankaduwa east of the Mahaweli Ganga , precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kalpity Bay , large bright Blue Gems like flax flowers near Vavunikulam . Most of these have been discovered except for gold and flax flower like gems . It would be interesting to note that in 1969 when I mentioned this in my Presidential Address for the Engineering Section of the Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science though this was not taken seriously by the Geologists , barely a year passed when the Geological Survey Department announced with acclaim that they had discovered Copper ore at Seruvila on the eastern side of the Mahaweli Ganga . In fact this was the very site stated in the Mahawamsa called " Tambapitta beyond the river ( Mahaweli Ganga ) " . <p> Then there is the recording in the Mahawamsa of the war between two Naga Kings in Nagadipa over a Gem Set Throne in Nagadipa in the B.C. Period . Ptolemy has recorded Nagadipa in Eastern Ruhuna . While Ibn Batuta in 1340 on his pilgrimage to Adams Peak records the estuary of Rubies close to Ruwanwella/Kitulgala on his ascent along the Baba route , while on his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields records the valley of Rubies which correspond to Colambage Aru/Embilipitiya areas while on his way to Devinuwera . <p> It might also be interesting to note that the technique to converting iron ore to high quality steel was known and recorded by Ananda Coomaraswamy by a tribe of people called Yammano using middle eastern technology at Balangoda which was in high demand and was exported for the fabrication of prised swords ... <p> We also know that geology particularly rock outcrops played a key role in Ancient times in the location of irrigation structures like Dam sites , spill sites and diversion canals . For example two dykes of relatively soft rocks on the out crops on either side of the Sorabora Dam , were used for the sluices , while even today when we locate sluices in renovation of large dams , we rediscover old sluices at those very intended sites . The Ancients were also fully aware of unfavourable geology in the Miocene lime stone belt . <p> In the 17th Century with the introduction of Tobacco by the Portuguese ground water technology using the Well and Shadaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came to Jaffna from the Coramandel who used their technology to cultivate Tobacco . It was this introduction of ground water technology and made it possible to grow tobacco and produced the Jaffna Cigar which was as famous as the Cuban Cigar and made the Jaffna Peninsula prosperous . <p> I was fortunate to delve into the files of the Survey Department , where it is recorded that in 1895 Geological Surveys were conducted and had obtained the services of Mr. W. King one time Director Geological Survey of India , while in the beginning of the 20th Cent . Hydrogeological investigations were undertaken in the Hardrock areas of Vavunia by Mr. Shipton , Supdt. of Surveys . It was in the beginning of the last century that Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy was engaged by the Survey Department as Principal Mineral Surveyor , who worked in close cooporation with the Imperial College London and used their Laboratory services for chemical analysis . It was also during this period that an interesting episode took place between Ananda Coomaraswamy with the then Surveyor General , that resulted in the Geological Survey Department being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Ananda Coomaraswamy Lecture in 1999 . Further I would also like to recall what I stated in that lecture our claims to the Extended Exclusive Economic Zone where there is the potential for Petroleum and Minerals , has to be claimed before 2004 . Unfortunately nothing meaningful has been done so far . <p> It was because whilst being in the Survey Department I delved into the background of the exploitation of ground water in the last century that I was convinced that there was ground water in the Hard rock areas . This led me to compile the Hydrogeological Map of Sri Lankan in 1968 using Aerospace techniques and thereafter based on the experience of Ground Water Exploration and Exploitation in India , I was able to determine for the first time the first Ground Water Potential Map of Sri Lankan in 1973 which indicated that there is more ground water for extraction in the Hard Rock areas . This was accepted after my demonstrating this , using low cost tube wells , and now being exploited today by several institutions and agencies . As indicated in my book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions have to be taken to prevent over exploitation by not extracting more that the natural recharge , as it would cause environment problems due to over exploitation and lowering of the water table . While in places like the Jaffna Peninsula , Mannar and Kalpitiya there would be salt water intrusion and destroy the crops and environment due to over exploitation . Similarly in the arid Hambantota , as recharge is megre , over extraction brings in brackish water . <p> Concluding today the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau is the heir to the Geological Survey Dept . There are several other departments , corporations , universities agencies and individual researches dedicated 
##925752 <p> Text by Janaka Liyanarachchi Pix. by Susantha Wijegunasekera There are things that do not bear seeing , sights that lacerate the very core of our sensibilities . This was one . I have to force myself to hold my gaze . The pilima vahanse lay by my feet . Headless . Where the head ought to have been , there was a gaping hole . The disturbed earth around it appears to still retain its moisture . I am not sure how to put all this down in words . A price has been set for the severed head of Lord Buddha . A set of sinful brutes have plundered the Buddha ? s head out of a mad lust for easy money . <p> This sight speaks not just of another ravaged archaeological site , but the state of decline in the nation ? s sense of itself , its cultural heritage and the core values of its spirituality . This is how one has to write the " conclusion " of an age , an era where artistes steeped in the Buddha vachanaya lovingly transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us start from there <p> There are archaeological treasures that are yet to be excavated , examined and documented in the Menik Vehera Complex which belongs to the Polonnaruwa period . In one of the many mounds of this complex , there lay a massive Buddha statue , made of granite . It has been found that this statue belonged to the 10-11 centuries AD . Sculpted according to the Amaravathi tradition , this statue exuded nothing but peace . Found in 1978 , the statue lay where the first archaeological examinations were done . Even then the head was severed from the body . It was this head that vandals , belonging to a breed that is now legion , had removed on the night of August 10 , 2002 . <p> This is of course not the first or only time that a budu sirasa was stolen . Several years before this a group that had arrived in a pajero had taken away a granite figure head of the Buddha that was in the vicinity of the historical Kiribath Vehera in Anuradhapura . In Polonnaruwa itself the budu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kudagal Viharaya ( located near the Baddaseema Prasada ) had also been stolen . This particular figure apparently was almost identical to that of the main statue of the Galviharaya . Ven . Vanarathana opined that this statue was of the Amitabha Buddha , renowned as the greatest of the Panchadhyana Buddhas . Anyone who chances to visit Kudagalviharaya is bound to be disturbed by this wanton act of destruction . <p> There was more than enough evidence of rising vandalism . Not too long before this , two guard stones of the Pabalu Vehera had disappeared . It was after this that vandals broke into Attadigala , which is located within the archaeological reserve . There have been a number of attempts to break into the most ancient site in Polonnaruwa , Gopalapabbataya . <p> We have not been able to protect the remains of the golden age of our history , lying in these 7500 acres . The Archaeological Department , admittedly strapped for resources , has nevertheless failed to protect what they can . <p> The guard stones of the Pabalu Vehera were removed . Neither the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch of these guard stones . When the five guardstones of Medirigiriya disappeared , none of these important and learned gentlemen in the agencies were able to say anything about them . Although a decision was taken to photograph all the remains found so far in Polonnaruwa , this too has not been done . Apparently , there hadn ? t been enough money for the purpose . <p> These eminent persons have enough money for other things . They forget , these archaeologists , that these remains and not the fancy progress reports they compile to show how much they have done out of the money they have got , are what constitute their bread and butter . <p> The Department does not have a sketch or a photograph of the vandalised Buddha statue in the Menikvehera Complex . Fortunately for us and for posterity , a gentle human being by the name of Jayasinghe Balasuriya had taken a photograph of this statue . <p> We have to understand one thing . This act of vandalism is not a " one-off " thing . Everything that is written here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that everyone takes the trouble to follow the manner in which incidents telescope to produce a sad and tragic picture . <p> The vandals are not and can not be random , shady characters . Even the little children around Kaduruwela know about these acts and these vandals . There is in fact a history of cover-ups and of these destroyers of heritage operating under the shadow and indeed with the protection of the police and powerful local politicians . We are ready , in fact , to go public with the full list of names of these traitors at the first given opportunity . <p> One of these vandals is known to have been prowling around the Menik Vehera in a suspicious manner prior to the incident . Some of the good people in the area , being suspicious , had done some preliminary investigations had found that the head of the statue had been shifted a little . They had immediately informed the relevant persons in the Department . <p> Everything happened as one would expect . No investigation was carried out . No precautions were taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this from the Kaduruwela Police . <p> " Yes , we are carrying out further investigations , " a sombre , serious voice replied . <p> Unfortunately , we are forced to write a totally different version with respect to the way in which events unfolded . It was on the same day , i.e. , August 10 , that a valuable artefact from the Shiva Devala near the Naipena Viharaya was bundled into a vehicle and taken away while the security officers of the Cultural Triangle looked on . A crook , noted for stealing archaeological treasures , is openly roaming around the ruins of Polonnaruwa . One of his golayas is often seen on a brand new motorcycle among the ruins . <p> At the same time , the Preethidana Vinodana Mandapa rock had been " cleared " in a very suspicious manner . Who knows what has happened in that place or is happening in that place as you read this ? The Medavehera in the middle of the Parakrama Samudra is being openly excavated by some people . There only remains a mound of earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation is extremely complex . Earlier the thrust was to break stone inscriptions and statues in search of nidahan . Today there is a systematic pilfering of archaeological remains . The " vandals " constitute but one chain in an organised racket . <p> It is clear that the core artefats that speak of the Sinhala civilisation lie within a few square miles which encompass Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa . If we do not have it in us to even take care of this heritage , we are truly unworthy as a people . On the same night that the budu sirasa was stolen , two guard stones and a moonstone had been stolen from Vessagiriya . The thieves had arrived in a brand new vehicle . These touts also had the gumption to hold a party in the premises , indicating the power they enjoyed and speaking volumes of the immunity under whose cover they operate . The Department did not know anything of this until two full days had passed . There is no use crying over spilt milk , as the saying goes . We need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not protected for so many centuries because of the work of departments or experts . They were preserved by the courage and determination of ordinary people who cared about their heritage and knew how deep their roots went . The villagers always stood up if one stone was raised against the village temple . We have , as a nation , flushed from our hearts that sense of pride , that unshaken belief in self , community and nation . In other words , evicted from our hearts , the heart beat of the nation . <p> I repeat : we should be ashamed of ourselves . Without pride , without self respect , we will continue to suffer such ravages . We are a people with a history . We are fast becoming a nation without a history . We can rant and rave about the modern day Kalinga Maghas and their marauding troops , but this is in essence a cop-out . It is our fault , in the first instance . And unless we take responsibility , we lose the

##929551 <p> Sri Lanka 's power supply , already threatened by the drought and failing thermal power plants , is further hampered by the trade union actions of the state-run power monopoly Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) . <p> The CEB trade unions have launched an uninterrupted trade union action demanding salary increases at a time the country 's power supply is hampered with the shutdown of the thermal power plant and reduced hydropower due to prevailing drought . <p> The CEB extended the island wide daily power cuts by another two weeks as the attempts to restart the Chinese-built Norochcholai Coal Power Plant which supplies 300 MW to the national grid have been unsuccessful . <p> " Due to the unavailability of the two large thermal power plants , CEB is compelled to resort to limited Load Shedding to conserve the remaining Hydro resources for essential drinking water and Irrigation requirements , " the CEB said . <p> The engineers of the Lakvijaya power plant in Norochcholai have rectified the problems in the supply lines yesterday and started the generators with the hope of starting power production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials say that the generation of electricity was not started as expected by midnight yesterday and another two to three weeks would be required to reactivate the power plant . <p> Deputy Chairman of the CEB Anura Wijepala said that the power cuts will be imposed until Wednesday , based on the schedule released earlier . <p> " Unfortunately all our efforts to restore the power plant have not been successful . It needs about two weeks shut down for the repairs , " he told the reporters . <p> The power cuts are necessary since the hydropower generation capacity has fallen below 20 percent as the catchment areas of the hydropower reservoirs continue to experience the dry spell . <p> Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka has said the power crisis in the country would further increase if the monsoon rains do not commence by mid-September . <p> The power generation of Victoria and Randenigala reservoirs would be suspended outright unless the catchment areas of the reservoirs receive rain in the next few days , he said . <p> Meanwhile , the strike launched by the CEB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes of the power authority . <p> The Deputy Chairman told media today that CEB has hired 500 temporary workers to maintain the power supply uninterrupted as the strike of the CEB employees goes on . The retired and skilled workers will be working under a two month assignment . <p> The CEB has employed workers from man power agencies as well in case of the urgent needs . <p> The striking CEB employees gathered before the Colombo Fort CEB headquarters this afternoon and protested for several hours demanding to revoke the salary anomaly and suspend attempts to suppress trade union action . <p> The strikers blocked the road in front of the CEB headquarters creating a heavy traffic jam in downtown Colombo . <p> The daily losses to the power authority have risen to Rs. 200 million now due to the drop in hydropower and increased thermal power and with the continuing union action the government is to incur losses of billions . <p> Singapore-based Parkson Retail Asia Ltd has offered to buy the remaining shares of Sri Lanka 's ODEL PLC , following its purchase of a controlling stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandatory offer to the holders of ordinary shares of the fashion retailer today to acquire the rest of the shares at a price of Rs. 23.50 per share . <p> Parkson entered in to a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with the controlling shareholders of 22-year old fashion retailer last month . <p> The company 's founder and CEO Otara Gunewardene and her brothers Ajit and Ruchi Gunewardene sold 60,625,000 shares of Odel , representing 27.88 per cent , 13.6 per cent and 0.34 per cent respectively of the issued share capital of the company at Rs 23.50 per share for Rs. 1.424 billion . <p> However , following the acquisition , Ms Gunewardene will retain a 27.88 percent stake in Odel PLC and will continue to be the company 's CEO . <p> Sri Lanka 's major opposition United National Party ( UNP ) sources say that two legislators of the party will declare they will act as independent MPs in parliament in the next few days . <p> The two MPs were holding discussions with the government wishing to cross over and to assume deputy minister portfolios , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to grant them more portfolios , sources said . <p> Instead of crossing over , the government has proposed them to sit in the parliament as independent members , a UNP spokesman said pointing out that the party can take disciplinary action if the MPs take on that course as well . <p> MP Dayasiri Jayasekara 's name was mentioned widely in media as a person attempting to join the government . However , the MP has denied reports of his imminent crossover . <p> Minister Rajitha Senaratne recently said the government will make additional allocations for crossovers from the UNP , since they can not be given ministerial or deputy ministerial positions . <p> He has said that 12 MPs and regional politicians from the

##930150 <h> Full Menu <h> Mirissa Beach <p> Mirissa Beach is close to the most Southern tip of Sri Lanka and in fact the Indian sub-continent as well . In the morning time you are greeted by gentle colourful sunrises and then the sun crosses directly overhead throughout the day finally ending up give you a breathtaking and memorable sunset . Each evening at sunset Mother nature offers you something different , one night the sunset could be fiery red and then the next it can the most beautiful pastel pink . Many people grab a cool beer , bring restaurant chairs out onto the sand and sit and watch in awe at the array of colours as the sun sets behind the coconut trees on the hill . <p> The shoreline is blanketed with coconut trees and all the buildings and the places to stay in Mirissa are set back from the shore giving you the feeling that you are on a totally deserted beach somewhere . <p> Most people start off early on the beach and abandon it close to midday as the heat becomes intense around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the many beach side bars and restaurants to replenish your lost fluids with a cool beer or a snack . After about 2pm you will start to see people coming back for their afternoon tanning session . Most of the guesthouses in Mirissa have beach chairs on the sand outside their back gate . <p> Unlike Tangalle and the beaches further along the coast , the shoreline of Mirissa beach gracefully slides into the ocean and there is no dangerous shelving making it a great place to bring kids and to leave them alone without too much worry . You can walk out into the water for about 20 meters before the water becomes waist deep . Beaches further up the coast have sharp drops and hidden shelving in the sands . <p> Some days the water is completely flat and other days you are greeted by great waves originating from far out in the Indian Ocean . Nothing is more refreshing than hanging out where the surf breaks and getting a Mirissa Beach style Jacuzzi . <p> If you are standing with your back to the land facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of you . The center of the beach is the most popular as it is usually the calmest and it has easy access to some of the local restaurants should you need lunch or a drink . Ocean Moon guesthouse in Mirissa has free fresh water showers just inside the gate should you feel the need to wash the sand and salt off you . <p> About 95% of the beach is sandy and rock free . The rocky bits are at both ends so if its snorkeling or surfing that you like then head there . The area around Parrot Rock on your left side is particularally popular with snorkellers while the right side of Mirissa Beach is rapidly becoming a popular surfing hot spot . Be careful though of the above water life and keep an eye out for incoming surfboards especially on the right side of the beach . I definitely would not recommend swimming in the right side of the beach because of the rocks , waves and sea urchins that are just waiting there for YOU to stand on them . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Parrot Rock , be careful of strong currents and rip tides . Leave your belongings in your room because while you are underwater admiring the wonders of the Indian Ocean , the local kids will be admiring the wonders of your sunglasses and shoes and anything else valuble . <p> The right side of the Mirissa Beach is where the huge waves break and this area is extremely popular with the Surfing crowd , its not uncommon to see people here from all over the globe all satisfying their passion for riding the waves . Just listen for the Bob Marley music and you will know you are in the surf zone . <p> The sand as you can see from the photographs is a light tan colour and the width of the beach depends on a combination of the following : the tide , time of the year or the Moon but it is usually about 10 -- 20 meters . <p> Newtons Law : My Physics teacher would be amazed that I even remembered anything from his class and especially what Newtons Law actually was . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to lye under as they give great shade from the baking sun . If you squint and look up at them you will see that they have coconuts growing on them . When coconuts are ripe or there is a strong breeze they detach themselves from the tree and here is where Newton come into effect , they fall down to earth with a mighty thud . If you happen to be at ground zero where it hits then you will be going home in a box . Imagine what a 3 kilo rock hard coconut falling from 60 feet could do to your head . I am sure 
##932452 <p> On 27 th February , 2011 Some drunken police officers from the Negombo police station came to the house of Marasingha Arachchige Maithree N ? rada , took Maithee Narada into custody with regard of a cattle theft in Kadirana area , and took him to the police station and assaulted him inhumanly . <p> Narada was residing temporarily in a house at Kadirna area in Negombo . On 27 February , 2011 between 10.45 &; 11.00 p.m while he and his wife were sleeping someone knocked at the door of the house . As it was late in the evening he asked who it was prior to opening the door . A person answered and said that they were from the police station . Then , as Narada was opening the door , two persons in civilian clothes entered the house . One of the officers was known to Narada as Sergeant Silva of the Negombo police station . As they were entering the house Sergeant Silva asked whether Maithree Narada was there and Narada said that he was that person . Sergeant Silva told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shirt , " and come to go to the police " . <p> When Narada asked the reason for the statement Sergeant Silva simply repeated himself , " A statement to be taken , come " . Narada dressed and left the house with them . While they were taking him towards the cab of the Negombo Police Station which was parked about 40 to 50 meters away from the house , he noticed a police officer who was in civilian clothes , standing near the bathroom of the house and that he had a nunchak in his hand . There was another police officer close to the front door of the house . He was in uniform and was holding a blue coloured hose pipe . <p> Narada was told to get into the jeep . After the jeep had travelled about 150 or 200 meters towards Kadirana it suddenly stopped . Sergeant Silva who was sitting in the front seat , got down and ordered Narada to also get out of the vehicle . At that time he realised that the police officers had consumed liquor due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . When Narada asked why they had stopped Sergeant Silva replied , " You know why you were brought here . " Narada told Sergeant Silva he had no idea of why he had been brought to the place . Mr Silva then said , " Get down Cariya ( bastard ) . " <p> Narada still had no idea of why he had been brought to this particular place . Sergeant Silva told him , " It is from here that the cattle were loaded You know about that do n't you ? " Again Narada told them that he did not know anything about it . Then Sergeant Silva said , " You do n't know anything . You are a baby . I will do some good work on to you . Look " . Then again he was made to get into the jeep and ordered to lie down while putting his legs outside . The officer who was sitting at the rear side of the jeep got down with a stump in his hand . Again Narada asked why he was being treated in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the persons who robbed the cattle and the place where they were taken to , and now tell them to us . " So saying he gave three blows to soles of Narada 's feet with the stump . Later as he could not bear the pain Narada tried to retract his legs but another officer who was sitting at the back of the jeep grabbed them . Then again Sergeant Silva gave him six blows telling him , " Tell me now you devil ( Yakko ) speak , who got the cattle . " Sergeant Silva sat in the front seat and told him , " You know who got the cattle , we have received information that you are the accomplice . " <p> They took Narada to the Negombo police station and arrived at about 11.30 p.m . Narada was made to sit on a bench while the officers for the dinner at the rear the station . After 15 minutes Sergeant Silva returned with a stump in his hand and said to Narada , " We are not saying that you robbed the cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell us the truth and tomorrow morning I will put you out without filling a case " . Narada replied that he too went with the cattle owners to search for the lost cattle . He also said that if he knew anything he would tell the police in order to avoid being beaten . <p> He told Sergeant Silva that on the day when the cattle were lost his father stayed at his house . His father would be able to verify his whereabouts and movements . Sergeant Silva , however , became angry and shouted , " Yakko tell me who got cattle . " Then he assaulted Narada with the stump . <p> Narada tried to avoid the blows but Sergeant Silva grabbed his neck and pulled him to a table which was close to the crime section . He ordered Narada to lie on that table . Narada pleaded with the police officer not to assault him but Mr Silva told him , " We know that you did not rob the cattle but you know who did , tell us their names . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles of his feet . Narada continued to deny that he knew the identities of the thieves and Mr Silva told him , " You are not telling who the robbers are , Kariya get ready , I will hang you then you will tell the truth " . At that time he received a call on his mobile phone . Sergeant Silva told another officer to put Narada in a cell and left the station . <p> On 28th Feb. 2011 , at about 9.10 a.m . Narada 's wife S. Priyangani , and his sister Nilakshi Anuradha went to the police station to see him . At that time Narada was thoroughly scared and told them that Sergeant Silva had said that he will be hanged and assaulted . Upon hearing this his wife told him not to be afraid as they were going to lodge a complaint at the Human Rights Commission . After a short time they left the police station . <p> The same day between at 1.00 p.m . Sergeant Silva asked , " Which one from you went to the Human Rights Commission ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Rights ; saying that he went towards the crime section . <p> On that day at 1.30 pm. a police officer went to the cell and asked Narada to identify himself . He took Narada out of the cell and to the back side of the police station . Then this officer took him to the crime section and Sergeant Silva who was sitting there on a chair , made him kneel down . He got up from the chair and said " Cariya , your ones have gone to the Human Rights against me , I will not let you go easily . I will somehow send you to prison for 5 or 6 years by planting a bomb or drugs or ganja " . So saying he assaulted Narada on his face and body . When Narada fell down and he called an officer and mentioning the name of a book told him to bring it . Then that office brought the book and while Mr Silva was writing Narada 's name in that book said , " You better know I will put every cattle robbery on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights . So saying he wrote something in the book and without showing what had been written forced Narada to sign it . Then he said , " I will take you to the Negombo hospital , and the doctor will ask when you were taken in to the custody . Tell that it was today morning at 6.00 o'clock . If the doctor asks you whether you were assaulted , reply him ' No . ' Then I will send you home in the evening today .

##932550 <p> A double century in school cricket at the age of 14 and a partnership of 351 for the first wicket with Makin Salih for Moors was the highlight of his career . <p> He played for 3 clubs BRC , Moors and Saracens the longest being for 11 years . But he is best remembered as being an umpire of repute and one of the longstanding and outstanding umpires of yore . <p> An umpire , especially today , comes under a lot of fire . More so because of the television replays and the use of technology ! The armchair critic is ever ready to criticise the umpire and even the commentators take the " man in white " to task . He has to count the balls and have literally about ten eyes to watch what is going on . Sometimes he may fall asleep and wake up o the sound of a ferocious " Howzat " blasting his ear drums . He then considers the volume of the sound . Better to give the batsman out as then he leaves the crease than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And especially if one has a bowler of the ferocity of Dennis Lillee appealing one is tempted to raise the finger . <p> Well , enough of meandering . <p> We are talking of Herbert ( Herbie ) Clemen Felsinger . He scored a rare double century ( 202 not out ) in January 1948 when playing for Carey College against St.John 's Nugegoda at the Wesley College grounds . <p> In 1952/53 he was selected to play for Ceylon vs India under the late F.C . de Saram . In 1979 he umpired the 100th Royal-Thomian match at the SSC and in 1982 he stood once again with K.T Francis for the first Test match against England at the Oval . <p> Having umpired in England in 1985 he expanded his horizons . <p> One of his unforgettable experiences is having umpired with the legendary Dickie Bird in Sharjah . He even has a stump autographed by the great man . <p> He was selected to umpire the first World Cup to be held in Australia . <p> He was one of the 16 local umpires felicitated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January 2003 . He was awarded a medal of excellence and a certificate of merit by Chandra Schaffter , MD of Janashakthi Group . <p> Some of the outstanding players whom he watched as an umpire were Sunil Wettimuny , Roy Dias , Ranjan Madugalle , <p> Describing the First Test match vs England Felsinger said that Sri Lanka had a good side , with the Wettimuny 's , Madugalle , Dias , Arjuna Ranatunga and bowlers like John and Ashantha de Mel . Sri Lanka was in a winning way at one stage . I thought that Sri Lanka could save the match but they failed , " said a disappointed Felsinger . <p> For 20 years as an umpire from 1971-1991 , till a stroke overtook him , he was yet another umpire struck down by tragedy , the other being Ajith Perera . <p> As for the pre Test era , he mentioned that Sri Lanka had a good side . " Umpiring today is easy . All you do is that you watch the ball when it is in the air and see whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt you can refer to the third umpire . " <p> Celebrating his 75th birthday on June 4 and also coincidentally his 50th Wedding Anniversary on the smae date , Felsinger said that the umpires of his era were better . <p> Talking of good bowlers during his umpiring era he mentioned Ajith de Silva and Ravi Ratnayake , not Rumesh . " He could swing the ball a lot . " He added . He also described Sunil Wettimuny as a class bat . " There is too much of money in the game now " he lamented . <p> As for recent umpires he singled out S. Venkataragan and Asoka de Silva . Venkat played against me when I represented Ceylon . Steve Bucknor takes too much time to give a decision " he said . <p> " The standards of umpiring have deteriorated . The standards were of a high calibre at one time . He particularly referred to the late M.A.Jayasinghe as being an outstanding umpire . Others he mentioned were K.T. Francis and Basil Anthony . <p> As for cricketing standards he said that that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wicket keepers of note were Ben Navaratne and the two Fernando 's Ranjit and H.I.K. Fernando . Special mention was made of Mahes Goonetilleke and Russell Hamer . <p> In later years " Little Kalu " was good but the selectors have opted for Kumar Sangakkara , whom he does n't consider the best . <p> Recently Stanley Jayasinghe in an article that Felsinger was omitted from a list of umpires given recognition by Thilanga Sumithapala . Umpires are remembered after they are dead and not
