There are hiding spots but do n't hide there for too long or it would make the game unfair for others who are Foodzillas . <p> TIP TWO : <p> The zombies are quite hard to dodge without fuel in your jet pack . There are some hiding spots like the satellite dish and the green force field that zombies ca n't get in , instead they bounce off but ( sigh ) the force field does n't stay for long and the zombies are fast ! Make sure you have some fuel for your jet pack and you fly away from the zombies . Reminder : the zombies cant fly but they can jump high . <p> TIP THREE : <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All you need to do is find a squashed up space and jump ! It 's like you 're floating or swimming . 
##1719251 <h> May 29 , 2012 <h> Ship of the Week #003 <p> This week the judges were looking for ships that took them to the party zone ! There were some amazing ships nominated . <p> WINNER : Cooliome <p> The second you land in Cooliome 's ship it feels like a party ! You ca n't miss the spectacular dance floor in the center of the main room . <p> Cooliome has thought of everything for a pumping party . Lamps light up the dance floor , screens hang from all sides of the room and there are enough speakers to blast the music out into every corner . <p> There are stands of seats to watch the dancers so this would make a great location for a dance battle . Party goers can take a seat at the tables around the room or head over to the bar for refreshments ! <p> This week the judges would also like to give a special mention to Zainy for his creative planet rooms . Every room in Zainy 's ship represents a different planet - perfect for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This weeks spaceship theme is : Club Headquarters <p> Do n't forget to nominate ships you think have built 
##1719252 <h> June 12 , 2012 <h> Ship of the Week #005 <p> The best way to describe Taeja123 's ship is that it is a house within a house , a room within a room . Taeja123 is a masterful engineer ! <p> Taeja123 has used blocks and space in very interesting ways . In the middle of the room is a very cool tunnel system . <p> If you look up you 'll see there 's a secret viewing platform for watching everything that is going on down below . It is very masterful how Taeja123 has managed to suspend it in the air . There 's even a boombox so it also makes a great DJ booth ! <p> Each doorway out of the main room has been constructed out of different kinds blocks and lead to all sorts of rooms . We recommend a visit to Taeja123 so you can explore all the different spaces . Congratulations Taeja123 ! <p> This week the judges wanted to also give a special mention to

##1724351 <h> The Great Vigil of Easter <p> The Great Vigil of Easter , when observed , is the first service of Easter . It is celebrated at a convenient time between sunset on Holy Saturday and sunrise on Easter Morning . <p> This , our autumn festival , celebrates a tomb burst open like ripened fruit . When the world turns towards its coldest and darkest , we Christians in New Zealand are among the first to proclaim that Christ , the light of the world , is risen . The fire heralds our winter , it is a welcoming beacon to church , the campfire of pilgrims around which we tell our stories , the hearth of our home . <p> The Paschal Candle ( like a pillar of fire ) leads the pilgrim people into the dark church . The very ancient Exsultet is chanted by the deacon or other minister . Everyone can hold a candle - lights from the light of Christ . <p> The service normally consists of four parts : <p> 1 . The Service of Light . <p> 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renewal of Baptism . <p> 4 . The Ministry of the Sacrament . <p> The order of the service may be 1-2-3-4 or 2-1-3-4 . <p> People can be encouraged to leave their watches at home and enjoy the celebration - the party . <p> If the Ministry of the Word ( 2 ) begins the service , the many readings , psalms , and prayers can with imagination form a longer vigil , with the readings ( recounting our salvation history ) interspersed with commentary , music , lengthy silences , drama , dance , singing , and audio- visual presentations . Then in the dark , with the church lights out , " the new fire " may be kindled . <p> Liturgical colour : White , gold , or " best . " <h> The Service of Light <p> In darkness , fire is kindled . The presider may then greet the people and address them in these or similar words . <p> Dear friends in Christ , on this most holy night when our Saviour Jesus Christ passed from death to life , we gather with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the passover of Jesus Christ . Through light and word , through water , bread and wine we celebrate the new life that Christ shares with us . <p> The presider may say the following prayer . <p> Let us pray . <p> Redeeming God , source of life and light , bless this new fire , and grant that we who are warmed by the celebration of this Easter feast , may share in the everlasting festival of your radiance , through Jesus Christ , the light of the world . Amen . <p> The presider may trace a cross in the Paschal Candle , Alpha and Omega , and the numerals of the current year , saying , <p> Christ yesterday and today ( tracing the vertical arm of the cross ) the beginning and the end ( the horizontal arm ) Alpha and Omega ( these letters , above and below the cross ) All time ( the first numeral , in the upper left corner of the cross ) and all ages belong to Christ ( the second numeral in the upper right corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numeral in the lower left corner ) through every age for ever . Amen . ( the last numeral in the lower right corner ) . <p> If grains of incense are inserted into the candle in the form of a cross , the following may be said : <p> When the Paschal Candle is lit from the fire , the following may be said : <p> May the light of Christ , rising in glory , illumine our hearts and minds . <p> The deacon ( or another minister if there is no deacon ) bearing the lit Paschal Candle , leads the procession to the chancel , pausing three times , and with the candle raised , sings , <p> The light of Christ . Thanks be to God . <p> If candles have been distributed to the congregation , they are lit from the Paschal Candle at a convenient point during the procession . <p> The Paschal Candle is placed in its stand . <p> The people are greeted . <p> Alleluia ! Christ is risen . He is risen indeed . Alleluia ! <p> The deacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings or says the Exsultet . <p> Rejoice , all creation ! Let the heavenly chorus sing ! Jesus Christ , our light , is risen ! Sound the trumpet of salvation ! Rejoice , O earth , in shining splendour , the light of Christ will warm our autumn night . Christ has conquered ! Glory fills you ! Darkness will vanish for ever ! Rejoice , O church of God ! Exult in glory ! The risen Saviour shines upon you ! Let this place resound with joy . Echoing the mighty song of all God 's people ! <p> The Lord is here . God 's Spirit is with us . <p> Lift up your hearts . We lift them to the Lord . <p> Let us give thanks to God . It is right to offer thanks and praise . <p> It is truly right that with full hearts and minds and voices we should praise you the eternal God , and your First-born , our Saviour Jesus Christ . For Christ is the true passover lamb who at this feast has set your faithful people free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel from their slavery in Egypt and led them through the Red Sea on dry land . This is the night , when the pillar of fire brought light to your wandering people . This is the night when all who believe in Christ are delivered from gloom , and are restored to grace , and grow together in fullness of life . This is the night when Jesus Christ broke the chains of death and rose triumphant from the grave . Night truly blessed when heaven is wedded to earth and we are reconciled with God ! Therefore , Holy God , in the joy of this night , accept our evening sacrifice of praise , your church 's solemn offering . Accept this Easter candle , a flame divided but undimmed , a pillar of fire that glows to your honour , O God . Let it mingle with the lights of heaven and continue burning to lighten the darkness of this night ! May the Morning Star find this flame still burning among us . Christ is that Morning Star , who rises to shed your peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorified with you for ever and ever . Amen . <p> After the Exsultet , hand-held candles may be extinguished . Only those electric lights necessary for reasonable vision need be turned on . The Paschal Candle will burn at all services from now through the Day of Pentecost . <h> The Ministry of the Word <p> The presider may introduce the readings with these or similar words . <p> E te whanau a te Karaiti/ People of God , we have begun our solemn vigil , let us now listen to the word of God , recalling the acts throughout history by which God set people free ; and how , in the fullness of time , God sent Jesus Christ to be our redeemer . <p> The following readings and psalms are provided from the Old Testament .

Amen . <p> Glory to God in the highest ( NZPB page 405 ) or some other suitable song of praise is sung , all standing . Bells may be rung during this hymn . In some places it is the custom not to use the organ until this hymn . The altar candles may be lit at this point and any additional electric lights may be turned on . The following or another Collect of the Day is said prior to the epistle reading . <p> Let us pray . <p> Silence <p> Eternal Giver of light and life , this holy night shines with the radiance of the risen Christ ; renew your Church with the Spirit given to us in baptism , that we may worship you in sincerity and truth , and shine as your light in the world ; through you in the unity of the Holy Spirit , one God , now and for ever .

If there are no candidates for this , the presider leads the people in the following . <p> A Renewal of Baptism <p> I invite you ( to stand ) to affirm your commitment to Christ and your rejection of all that is evil . <p> Do you believe in God the Father ? <p> I believe in God the Father almighty , creator of heaven and earth . <p> Do you believe in Jesus Christ , the Son of God ? <p> I believe in Jesus Christ , God 's only Son , our Lord , who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , died , and was buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he rose again ; he ascended into heaven , is seated at the right hand of the Father , and will come again to judge the living and the dead . <p> Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit ? <p> I believe in the Holy Spirit Church , the communion of saints , the forgiveness of sins , the resurrection of the body , and the life everlasting . Amen . <p> Those who are baptised are called to worship and serve God . From the beginning , believers have continued in the apostles ' teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread , and in the prayers . <p> Will you commit yourself to this life ? <p> I will , with God 's help . <p> Will you forgive others as you are forgiven ? <p> I will , with God 's help . <p> Will you seek to love your neighbour as yourself , and strive for peace and justice ? <p> I will , with God 's help . <p> Will you accept the cost of following Jesus Christ in your daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . <p> With the whole Church will you proclaim by word and action the Good News of God in Christ ? <p> I will , with God 's help .

The water may be in the font or in a special vessel . <p> The section between brackets may be omitted . <p> Let us give thanks to God . It is right to offer thanks and praise . <p> We thank you God for your love in all creation , especially for your gift of water to sustain , refresh and cleanse all life . <p> We thank you for your covenant with your people Israel ; through the Red Sea waters you led them to freedom in the promised land .

##1733252 <h> The RUGBYCAN <p> I have been asked to rewrite Monsieur aesop 's fables with a distinctive rugby flavor and have accepted the request . However , there are a few disturbing thoughts insitu that must first be queried . Planetrugby has rightly noted that the All B acks are favored by 15 points over England . No problem with that spread . But is it not possible that England could win . Only perhaps and for all the wrong reasons . If England were to wo ... <p> Did Napolean at Waterloo ? Did Custer at the Little Bighorn ? Did Goliath against David ? Funny . It all sounds like a bridge too far . The All Blacks are not that great as the rugby world would have you believe . Honestly , France had them by the balls in the 2011 RWC finale And we 're the better team that day . No . The AB are not THAT good ; the rest of the field is mediocre That includes an England ... <p> Things do n't look good for Horrible Hore I should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in All Black history going back to Keith Murdoch . The All Blacks have had some suspect characters , We all can not be perfect . But so far , outside of a few nutty notables like dipsomaniacal naked ZACH the All Blacks have been hazy but pretty clean in the public eye , more so than their other Southern Hemisphere culprits , ... <p> That ' s what Warren Gatland said about finding a coaching job in New Zealand at the Super League . Now that Andy Robinson has resigned and vanished from the Scottish scene , the other vanquished will be queuing up and is n't it just honky dory that the complete coaching arse of John Mitchell should be properly exposed ? I can hardly wait . Oh , the usual suspects will be standing in line but Scotland wo n't chance another Englishman to ... <p> Welcome to England and Ireland and Wales and Scotland where I am finding it difficult to understand if the rugby is ad or my expectations are simply too high .

What makes it so difficult is the ... <p> I had the opportunity to miss all games last week because something important came up in the USA , so important that I went without a second thought . Three weeks ago my former wife called me from North Carolina and told me that the police had found the body of her sister missing since 1975 . I was invited to the family homecoming and I traveled there without blinking an eye . The whole thing was strange and ... <p> I must say that only a month ago I would not have put such importance on a coach or captain as I do know . My reason for the change is simple . The cluster of rugby players in the professional era are either zombies or trained seals walking through mat matches doing absolutely no thinking . I am aghast at how any creative decision is ripped apart regardless of a win or a loss . England , Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had very good reason not to watch any matches but the NZ/Italy which was a complete bore . All the matches went pretty much except the England match and I am now giving patriotically because they appear to know less than I , and that is dangerous .

##1733350 <h> Flying Blind <h> Learning to deal with the devastating . <p> The instinct to be there for the ones we care for is drilled in to us from birth . Be it the coach who yells about the sacred bonds of teamwork or the mother who makes you hold your sibling 's hand when they cross the street , we all know the importance of looking out for each other . Sometimes , that 's easier said than done . <p> Let me explain . Since I was young , my mother ( who is amazing , by the way ) has been going blind.Years of cataracts and glaucoma in both eyes took their toll slowly but surely . It was n't that noticeable in the beginning . She 'd wear special glasses to read and had to be told where the stairs began and ended if we went anywhere at night . Over time , one eye lost nearly all sight and the other began to cloud . She could n't make out figures on our 52-inch television or see my face clearly from two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slow-but-debilitating condition , and because of her determination to remain as independent as possible , I was blindsided by two realizations . <p> The first was how much complacent I had become . The state of her vision was something we had lived with for years , and its creeping , gradual pace had meant that I was n't noticing when things were getting worse . I stopped asking what the ophthalmologist had said , or how she had been feeling , and remained in an oblivious fantasy world where her blindness was as newsworthy as the colour of her hair . It was selfish , clueless , and a self-defense mechanism . <p> The second realization came earlier this year , when after a lifetime of denial , the inevitable happened . Our doctor confirmed that there was nothing more we could do to slow the deterioration , and total blindness would not be far off.What surprised me most was my reaction to it . Despite knowing , subconsciously , that it was coming , I was devastated , and it was because I had never allowed myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of helping others avoid my mistakes , my contribution to the opinion issue is a brief checklist pertaining to family and friends whose whanau are going through similar circumstances . <p> Be aware , but not overwhelmed <p> As unhelpful as total denial is , obsessing over a disability can be worse . It 's important to incorporate the disability and everything it entails in to the regimes of your everyday life , but not to the point where you cry in the shower every morning . <p> Be united <p> When illness strikes someone in your whanau , it 's not uncommon for reactions to be mixed . Some might take it upon themselves to be the ' strong ' ones , while others can fall to pieces . Family cooperation is vital in helping newly-disabled people come to terms with their conditions , but make sure to keep an eye out for how everyone else is coping . <p> Get informed <p> Knowing the facts about the condition will show that you care and will help you to anticipate future challenges.These can range from knowing where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stay respectful <p> Telling someone to look on the bright side after they 've suffered a permanent physical impairment is sanctimonious and douchy .

##1734751 <p> We are woken by the ominous sound of blustery winds . I 'm slightly apprehensive we might have cold headwinds . <p> A quick breakfast and we are on our way and are surprised with a pleasantly warm tail wind . Combined with the downhill run to Ranfurly , we make very fast progress . We meet a cyclist who said he averaged over 30kph , which is pretty good going on a gravel road . It was a blast . We also see the first of the stunning cloud formations over the hills to the North . The area is known for lenticular clouds and spectacular skies and we are n't let down . The photos do n't do them justice . <p> After the first coffee of the day in Ranfurly , we see the bike shop from where we rented our bikes - well , its remains . It burned down only 3 weeks before . The family bike and auto business had an old fridge in their lunch room catch fire in the wee hours of the morning . <p> A statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that Surveyors played in the early days of white settlement . The early engineers and surveyors really had an interesting life and achieved some amazing things . <p> The number of bikes starts to build quickly as we are about to leave . <p> Heading off down the Ranfurly straights we encounter a farmer driving on the rail trail . It turns out he is looking for some cows reported loose on the trail . We catch up with him later , with the cows cornered in a paddock - his dogs doing a pretty good job of controlling them ( not the young dog which kept getting in the way ) . We watched the " eye " dog for a while as he was very good and really had the measure of the cows . The cows jump back onto the trail and into another paddock out of harm 's way . One wonders how such large animals can jump so high . <p> The residential population thins out - though not the cyclists - and the land becomes quite barren past Waipiata . There 's a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darn ! <p> The tail winds are still mostly with us and we admire the persistent lenticular clouds that form and re-form over the ranges to the North . To the range on our right , the " Taiere Pet " hovers above the whole day and points to our destination for the day . A few more innocuous towns come and go , traces of an older time - rusting farm implements and fragments of the old railway are to be found and then we climb to Prices bridge and tunnel . We are almost blown off the mountain as we walk over to see a bypass tunnel that the miners dug for the river . This made it easier for the gold miners to fossick the now dry river bed . I wonder if they had their money 's worth out of the expensive tunnel ? <p> After the tunnel , we commence the descent to Hyde , only to be met with strong headwinds . Fortunately , there are only three kilometre to go and these were the least pleasant . I would hate to be riding uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cyclists . Hyde is another place that looks like it has been rescued by the Rail Trail . The cafe has city prices and the hotel is quaint . We are lodged in a little loft only slightly bigger than the bed . It has windows on all sides and will do nicely after the 50km covered today . <p> A buffet dinner has been organised at the old school . We turn up for dinner and the stories of Hyde start to be revealed . Ngaire ( I never hear if she has a last name ) is in her 60 's and spotted an opportunity on the rail trail . There were few facilities between Middlemarch and Ranfurly , so she purchased the closed school which took years of negotiation , restored it , built cabins and provided food .

##1743150 <h> Narration <p> All narrative has a narrator . A story has to be told to be a story , a story which is not told to us is not a narrative but a play , film or whatever . ( The connection between narrative and narrator is so strong that some films and plays even have a narrator , despite the actors who perform the narrative ! ) <p> In studying narrators we need to distinguish three relationships to the story . <h> Authors <p> The first of these is the author , the real flesh and blood person who composes the words . Texts are often attached to their authors ( and - but less often - to their readers ) : <p> a letter for example ends with a signature , <p> a modern book has a title page , <p> an article often carries a " by-line " . <p> Biblical books are often anonymous , sometimes the reader suspects that they are pseudonymous , or the work of several people . Yet all texts have authors , for without them there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . The biblical authors are indeed long dead . What we in fact meet is the text the author has written . <h> Narrators <p> This text contains , sometimes explicitly , sometimes in a hidden way a character who tells the story , " someone " who recounts the events . This someone is the narrator . <p> In the Bible narrators are not usually explicit characters . Ezra and Nehemiah are exceptions with their autobiographical style . We will devote some attention below to the styles of narration used by biblical texts , and later in the course we shall study the narration of our two stories . <h> Implied Authors <p> Even where the narrator is not a character in the story at all , nevertheless as we read we build up a picture of the author . This picture may be more or less like the real author . This " person " implied by the text and inferred by the reader is often called the implied author . <p> This sounds difficult , but we recognise the notion of the implied author in everyday life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " present themself well " they will not get the post . The " person " I present in my application is the " implied author " ! <p> This implied author corresponds in some way to the real author . In a job application they usually correspond perfectly - at least in the facts presented ! <p> In fiction this may not be the case , but almost always there is a close resemblance between the real and implied authors of a work . This would be so even if the narrator were someone totally different . <p> As we have seen implied authors are the , conscious or unconscious , creations of authors . Yet not only of authors , for they come to " life " when the text becomes discourse . That is when it becomes communication in the relationship between text and reader . For it is , in some way , as we read that we build up our implied author . Of course this process is guided by a program built into the text by the author , and good readers are faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unobtrusive , seldom being characters in the story , seldom addressing their readers directly and seldom revealing the process of composition . <p> However asides to the reader are not uncommon . For example the use of the phrase " to this day " in Gen 35:19 , such an attempt to bring things up to date is perhaps the most common form of narratorial presence on the surface of the text . <p> The use of the reverse reference e.g. the phrase " in those days " is a more discrete yet still clear way of marking off " their time " from " our time " ( which is in fact the narrator 's and no longer ours ! ) . <p> Such asides may contain information which the narrator supplies to help the reader understand ( the most well known example is probably 1 Sam 9:9 ) or remarks which invite the reader to share the narrator 's judgment on the characters or events ( 2 Sam 8:15 ) , though as we shall see such evaluation is more often expressed by a character . The aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , but could simply assist the reader with an explanation ( Gen 13:7 ) or by sharing the narrator 's omniscience about his characters ( Jdgs 13:16 ) . <p> Even an unobtrusive narrator provides such cues to his hearers/readers . One common way is by using an evaluative word or phrase ( 1 Sam 9:2 " handsome " ) or one whose emotional tone suggests the evaluation ( Jdgs 8:33 " prostituted " ) . <p> The narrator may also draw our attention to something which a character sees using the expression " behold " hinneh , though such narratorial direction is often obscured in modern translations ( cf. 1 Kings 18:7 in NRSV " As Obadiah was on the way , Elijah met him ; Obadiah recognized him ... " with RSV " And as Obadiah was on the way , behold , 
##1744450 <p> Every day you enter into contracts without realising it . Every time you buy an ice-cream from the dairy , or a coffee from a caf , you are entering into a contract . For the contract to exist , something of value has to be exchanged , and the contract may exist if you agree to pay the money in the future . A contract is when you offer to buy something and the seller accepts your offer . It can be spoken ( verbal ) or in writing . Although a contract does n't have to be in writing to be legally binding , some consumer contracts do <p> hire purchase contracts <p> door-to-door contracts <p> contracts agreeing to act as a guarantor <p> contracts for the purchase of a motor vehicle from a dealer <p> contracts for the purchase of real estate <p> It 's a good idea to have contracts in writing to serve as proof of exactly what has been agreed . This helps prevent or resolve any disagreements in the future . <p> It is really important to take your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand exactly what you are agreeing to . This may save you a lot of grief later on because you wo n't be caught out by any terms or conditions you did n't know about . If you need someone to go through a contract with you , you can ask your local Citizens Advice Bureau for help . <p> Can I cancel a contract part way through its completion ? <p> Normally you ca n't cancel a contract when the other party can still provide their side of the agreement . But this can change : <p> if the contract has a " termination " clause or term which gives you the right to cancel in certain circumstances with notice -- check your contract for this <p> if the other party agrees to accept your cancellation -- for example , this may happen if they have another customer waiting for the same goods and services ( but you may have to pay a cancellation fee ) <p> if you have been given incorrect information about part of your contract <p> if the other party breached an important term or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Can I cancel my membership ? <p> This depends on whether it 's still reasonable for you to use the facilities and whether the gym has breached its contract with you . So if you signed up to a gym in town , and it has now moved out to the suburbs , you can argue that an important part of the contract ( their location ) has now changed . You would not have signed up to the contract if the gym was in its new location . <p> I hired a strobe light for my party , but it did n't work when I tried it out just before the party . Can I get my deposit back ? <p> When you agree to pay a deposit , there are conditions . You should have decided with the trader whether to pay a deposit , how much for , and under what circumstances it would be refunded . So basically , the terms for getting your deposit back depend on the terms you agreed to in your contract . <p> However , when a trader fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide you with the goods or services you have ordered ( and they are not ' fit for purpose ' as in this case ) you may have grounds for getting your deposit back . <p> I paid for my new dishwasher by EFTPOS . Now , the retailer is trying to make me pay more because they say I have n't paid what the dishwasher is worth . Can they do this ? <p> In most cases , once you have bought and paid for the goods the contract of sale is completed . This means the trader ca n't ask you to pay any more than you have already paid . But a trader can ask for more money if they can show that they made a genuine mistake that led to you paying much less than the average person would think the item is worth . So if you paid $120 for a new dishwasher , the trader can argue that you should have known this was not a fair price . If you disagree , the trader can take their case to the Disputes Tribunal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay any more . <p> More information on this type of situation is available in our Consumer section . <p> A moving company damaged my bed when moving out . What can I do ? <p> If any of your goods arrive damaged , you need to immediately give written notice of the damage to the moving company you had the contract with . You will then go through the company 's process to sort out your claim . <p> As you are moving your furniture to a new location , you 're covered by the Carriage of Goods 
##1744452 <h> Diversion <p> The Police Adult Diversion Scheme gives people a chance to avoid a criminal conviction for their first criminal offence . It is usually only available for first-time minor offences , and people still face some consequence for their actions . There is a similar scheme for first offenders who are under 17 ( see What is Police Youth Aid diversion ? ) . Diversion is available when : <p> It is a first offence <p> You have admitted to committing the offence <p> The complainant agrees with diversion as the penalty <p> The offence is n't very serious <p> when you have had your legal rights explained to you <p> The types of offences usually considered too serious for diversion include : <p> Burglary or dishonesty offences <p> Violent offences including family violence <p> Sexual offences <p> Drink-driving and serious drug offences <p> purely indictable offences ( serious offences which must be tried by a jury ) <p> offences where there has been a breach of trust , <p> offences for breaching a Court order e.g. a protection order , and <p> some other categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further information about circumstances where diversion is not available ) <p> Before you 're prosecuted , a PPS prosecutor will look at your case . The prosecutor thinks about the views of the victims , the officer dealing with the case , and you , the offender , as well as the nature and circumstances of your offence . The prosecutor then lets you and the Court know whether you can get diversion or not . <p> What will I have to do for diversion ? <p> You will need to meet with the Police Diversion Officer for him or her to get a better understanding about the offending and the circumstances of the incident . You will have a chance to explain what happened and why . The meeting also gives you a chance to take responsibility for what happened . <p> A written agreement about changing your behaviour , preventing re-offending and making reparations can then be made between you and the Diversion Officer . A typical diversion agreement can include : <p> Making an apology to the victim <p> A referral to counselling , education programmes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hours of community service <p> Making a donation of a specified sum to an approved group <p> Being part of a restorative justice process <p> Making reparation to the victim <p> When you draw up the agreement you 'll agree to a deadline for completing the conditions of your diversion . It is up to you to complete the requirements of your diversion , and when you 've done them all , the prosecutor will let the Court know your diversion has been successfully completed . If you do n't comply with the conditions of your diversion , then prosecution continues . <p> What is Police Youth Aid diversion ? <p> The diversion scheme for children ( aged 10 - 13 ) and young people ( aged 14 - 16 ) , also known simply as ' police diversion ' , is similar to the adult diversion scheme , but is handled by Police Youth Aid ( PYA ) . Most Police areas have one or more PYA officers . Authorised under the Children , Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 , their job is to deal with children @ @ 
##1745951 <p> " Tolerance of other views is one of the pillars of postmodernism . However , there is one group of people to whom this tolerance is not extended , those who believe truth to be important ! " <p> Postmodernism is the term used by sociologists and others to describe a way of thinking that has become very pervasive in the Western world over the last generation . It is an approach to reality that is having a significant effect on literature , theatre , art , education , psychotherapy , law , science , architecture , the study of history and people 's view of religion . Some significant writers who have promoted postmodernism are de Man , Geoffrey Hartman , Harold Bloom , J. Hillis Miller , Jean-Francois Lytard , Michel Foucault , Jacques Derrida and Richard Rorty . Its origins are found in the philosophies of Nietzsche , Heidegger , Marx and Freud . On some points , particularly its attitude to truth , it is similar to New Age thinking . As a way of thinking it can hardly be described as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no longer any one big story that is able to make sense of our little stories . In other words , " worldviews " are out ! <p> Reality <p> We all create our own reality . God tends to be ignored . Should he ( she , it ? ) exist , he certainly has nothing to say about what we should believe or how we should behave . <p> Truth and reason <p> There is no absolute truth . New Age guru Shirley MacLaine holds a typical postmodern perspective . In Out on a Limb she asks David , her spiritual guide , if he believes in reincarnation . He replies , " It 's true if you believe it and that goes for anything . " As Wheaten College professor Roger Lundin explains in The Culture of Interpretation , in postmodernism " all principles are preferences - and only preferences . " As a result , " they are nothing but masks for the will to power . " Postmodernism is distrustful of all authority and dogmatism . It often recasts the Enlightenment 's sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feminist scholar Sandra Harding complains that science embodies a male-centred view that is " culturally coercive " . <p> Emotions , feelings , intuition , reflection , magic , myth , and mystical experience are now centre stage . " I know " has been replaced by " I feel " . There is a blurring of the difference between ourselves and the real world out there . <p> The postmodern aversion to truth is well expressed by Allan Bloom in The Closing of the American Mind : <p> The danger ... is not error but intolerance . Relativism is necessary to openness ; and this is the virtue , the only virtue , which all primary education for more than fifty years has dedicated itself to teaching . Openness - and the relativism that makes it the only plausible stance in the face of various claims to truth and the various ways of life and kinds of human beings - is the great insight of our times . The true believer is the real danger . The study of history and of culture teaches that all the world was mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that led to wars , persecutions , slavery , xenophobia , racism and chauvinism . The point is not to correct the mistakes and really be right ; rather it is not to think that you are right at all . <p> Sigmund Freud had described this outcome with glaring precision nearly one hundred years ago : <p> Fundamentally , we only find what we need and only see what we want to see . We have no other possibility . Since the criterion for truth - correspondence with the external world - is absent , it is entirely a matter of indifference what opinions we adopt . All of them are equally true and equally false . And no one has the right to accuse anyone else of error . <p> Someone has said that we have now moved from the conviction that everyone has a right to his own opinions , to the notion that every opinion is equally right ! <p> Religion <p> Postmodernism does not rule out religion as did modernism , with its emphasis on human reason . However , the religions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want to . Go for what makes you feel good . Religion is cafeteria style . You choose what you like from what is spread in front of you , and put a meal together that suits your taste . There are strong links with paganism . <p> " Where modernism was a manifesto of human self-confidence and self-congratulation , postmodernism is a confession of modesty , if not despair " Os Guinness <p> Morality <p> All moral values are relative . Each person or culture develops their own moral values . The important question is not " Is it right ? " but " What will it do for me ? " There is a strong emphasis on the fact that we are shaped by our culture , and a consequent diminishing of personal responsibility . <p> Tolerance <p> Tolerance of other views is one of the pillars of postmodernism . However , there is one group of people to whom this tolerance is not extended , those who believe truth to be important ! This intolerance is especially directed to those who think others might be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Future of the Gods : Notes Towards a Postmodern Religion , calls for tolerance and syncretism ( mixing different religions together ) . Yet , in the same article he calls evangelical Christianity a " junk religion " ! <p> Individualism <p> There is a strong emphasis on individualism . In the American court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , in justifying the abortion licence , the court declared that it is up to each individual to determine " the concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe , and of the mystery of human life . " <p> History <p> There is much rewriting of history . What really happened is either unknowable or unimportant . A sad symptom of this is seen in a survey indicating that 33% of Americans subscribed to the view that the Holocaust , the killing of six million Jews by the Nazis during World War II , may never have happened . <p> A good summary of postmodern thinking is given by Os Guinness in Fit Bodies , Fat Minds : <p> Where modernism was a manifesto of human self-confidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not despair . There is no truth , only truths . There are no principles , only preferences . There is no grand reason , only reasons . There is no privileged civilization , only a multiple of cultures , beliefs , periods , and styles . There is no grand narrative of human progress , only countless stories of where people and their cultures are now . There is no simple reality or any grand objectivity of universal , detached knowledge , only a ceaseless representation of everything in terms of everything else . In sum , postmodernism ... is an extreme form of relativism . <p> William Dever , in an excellent article in Near Eastern Archeology on some writer 's approach to history , and archeology in particular , says : <p> Such " post modern " thinking has affected nearly all disciplines since about 1950 , both in the natural and social sciences , to such an extent that 
##1747550 <p> We live at Curio Bay in the southern area of the South Island of New Zealand , in 1983 we had a amazing supernatural encounter with God and were baptised in the Holy Spirit . My wife and I were radically changed by this event . About six months later , Dean my 12 year old son said to me " Dad the toilet is full of bright red fluid " . I asked if he had just been there and he said he had . <p> We took him to Invercargill Hospital and were informed that he had a kidney disease called nephritis which had caused him to urinate blood and had left his body full of urea . We had noticed he was looking as if he was putting on weight and thought this was good as he was a light child , but instead he was quickly being poisoned by the urea in his blood . <p> Our doctor told us there was nothing they could do except keep him under observation in hospital and see if he improved . After three weeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still much too high . Every month for the next four months he was tested but his condition showed no change . <p> Suddenly after five months we were told by the hospital they were going to fly him and his mother to Christchurch Hospital for tests and the hospital would pay the airfare . We knew almost nothing about praying for the sick , so the night before their flight I got a bottle of oil and poured it on his head and it just ran down through his hair , we put our hands on him and prayed for God to heal him in Jesus Name . <p> Celia his mother took him to Christchurch Hospital the next day and was informed there that she was going to be taught about how to handle him on a dialysis machine until they could find kidnesys to do a transplant . This totally shocked her as we had no idea he was so ill . He was given tests for three days and on the fourth day had a kidney biopsey which showed his kidneys were fine except for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal healthy boy with perfectly functioning kidneys with the instructions to have a check once a year . We were elated and gave Praise and thanks to our Mighty God . Once a year for the next three years I took him for a check and the results were always good and I would tell the Doctor that God healed him and was given a blank stare in return . <p> He is now 37 years old has spent a number of years with Youth With a Mission and three years on OM ship Dulous , is now married and lives on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall and has two healthy kidneys thanks to God . <p> Some people have said to us well he could not have been sick or the Doctor made a mistake . But my response is " would a hospital fly people across NZ free of change and start looking for kidney donors for no reason ? " I do n't think so ! <p> In April of 1977 while pregnant with my second child I developed chronic asthma and was hospitalised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nowhere and for the next 6 years it ruled my life . I was on a preventative inhaler daily and relied on a Ventolin inhaler whenever necessary through the course of the day . <p> In 1983 after six years of many frightening experiences , I was woken one Sunday morning with a clear word from God telling me to go down to a house church and ask for prayer for healing of my asthma . Fortunately my husband agreed as this was not where we usually fellowshipped . <p> As the service came to a close I asked for prayer - to this day in 2010 I can still remember the heat and vision of Jesus as I lay on the floor . It was an instant and permanent healing when God in His Mercy touched me . In the 26 years since then I have been completely free of asthma . <p> HEALING OF A MAN 'S MIND BY PRAYING IN TONGUES <p> This article was written by Paul Watson ( pastor for this church ) <p> In 1983 my wife and myself were filled with the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local fisherman came to these studies , one day he told me a story about a friend of his who had been put in a mental institution because his mind had totally failed . He asked if I would go with him to this hospital and pray for his friend so he could be healed . We went to the Hospital together . <p> We found the man just walking the corridors with no focus on anybody near him , we were told he had been walking like this day and night for 3 weeks never going to bed and without any food . The nurses considered because he had lost so much body weight and was continuing to lose weight that he might die . <p> The only communication coming from his mouth was " they are coming to get me " . The fisherman pulled him into a chair , and stopped him getting up , and because I had no experience with such a condition I found myself at a loss of what to pray . So I put my hand on his hand and just prayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never prayed in English , only the language from the Holy Spirit . <p> After about 20 minuites of praying the patient slowly relaxed and sat back in his chair and then went into a quiet sleep . We felt we had done as much as we could do and went back to the mans home . We were met by his wife who said what were you doing at 5 past 8 tonight , because the sister of the man you were praying for rang up and said her neck which had been locked up for 20 years was suddenly healed at that moment . <p> We told her that at that time we were praying for her brother in the hospital . That healing was one I did not understand , but showed God 's workings are more wonderful and mighty than we can ever understand . <p> I went back to the hospital twice a week for a number of weeks and prayed in the same way , he soon started sleeping and eating again and putting on weight . <p> One day I asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh its when you pray for me in your eetsy weetsy teetsy language , I REALLY LIKE that " . <p> After 2 months he was released from hospital and not long after went and built a house for a relative .

Sometimes in the middle of my crying I would start laughing at how pathetic I was to just be sitting around in an old ratty bathrobe sobbing . Then I felt so bad about laughing that I just started crying again and harder than before . Then I lost the house - I felt my whole world unraveling . You know ? Like a sweater when you have one piece of loose thread and you pull it . Then you keep pulling it and suddenly you have a sweater with no right arm . That ? s what my life felt like .

I just stared at him for what seemed like forever . He then said , ? Why do you think that room is always unlocked ? ? I must ? ve turned seven shades of stupid . This man knew that I had been sneaking into that same room every few days to take a shower . What happened next absolutely blew my mind . He handed me a ring of keys . I asked what on Earth that was supposed to mean . His response ? ? Seven fifty an hour , Tuesday through Saturday , plus that room is yours until you can find a suitable place to live ? . How do you like that ? I steal showers and get a job in return for a repossessed car . I had been praying . I had been praying so hard . I asked you for a sign ? for a reason ? for anything ? I thought you were ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really pray hard when they are in deep trouble ? It must be frustrating . Anyway , here it is almost a year later ? I have a small apartment of my own ? Harvey , that ? s the guy from the motel , we just got married ? People think it ? s too soon , but when it ? s right , it ? s right . He was a widower ? Apparently , he had been praying for a friend seeing as how he lost his best one to cancer the year before . Everything just fell right in to place for the first time in a long time . That ? s how I knew you had your hand in it . I still don ? t have all the answers , you know . Why did you need Michael in the first place ? I really could ? ve used him a little bit longer - but ? uh ? you ? ve probably got him doing some amazing thing up there ? because he was amazing and I thank you for that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way too short . I want to thank you for Harvey ? for bringing him into my life when you did ? Most of all ? I want to thank you for this Erica places two hands on her stomach , she is pregnant . If it ? s a boy , we will name him Michael , if it ? s a girl , she ? ll be Charlotte ? that was Harvey ? s wife . Tell Michael I am doing okay , and tell Charlotte I am taking good care of Harvey . And again , God , thank you . I wouldn ? t have been able to survive as long as I did without you . <p> Erica takes a couple more bills out of her pocket and places them in the change box . <p> Just in case someone out there needs it . <p> Erica exits through the audience in the same direction that the carolers did . Harrison walks up to where Erica had been standing . <p> HARRISON : Seven fifty an hour ? She would make so much more if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week . ( to baby in manger ) I ? m sure Oprah could produce or something . Do you see what people have resorted to ? They talk to you like you are there . Like you mean anything . You are just a stupid plastic doll in a cheap display . I admit that it ? s great marketing . Heck , have everyone pour their hearts out to a poor child in a barn . Who was the brilliant person behind ? A Waif In a Manger ? ? And listen to me ; here I am talking to you like you can hear me . You are just a doll . A symbol of a good idea that never came to fruition . It ? s a great and humbling notion , isn ? t it ? ? I can ? t deal with the problems in my life , so I ? ll pray to a baby , that he can fix my problems that I am too much of a coward to fix myself. ? It ? s such a great idea they built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He throws his flask at the manger and it lands in with the baby Jesus doll . Harrison exits stage right . <p> Scene 3 : A homeless man has passed out next to the manger . He is wearing a jacket with a hood and some old jeans and run-down tennis shoes . Jacob enters stage right with a cardboard box full of bags with food on it . He is passing out the food to homeless people on the street . He also has extra scarves around his neck . He sees the man lying next to the manger and stops . He puts down the box and crosses over to the man . <p> JACOB Hey buddy ! You need to wake up ! Buddy ! <p> MAN Huh ? I didn ? t do it ? ( groggy ) I promise . <p> JACOB No buddy ? Do you want some food ? <p> MAN I don ? t have any money , but if you ? ll spot me ten spot I can get something to eat - <p> JACOB No man . <p> MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . <p> The guy perks up . Then looks a little nervous as he realizes who is talking to . <p> MAN Oh , man , I ? m sorry . People don ? t get nice to folks like me - <p> JACOB Not a big deal . <p> Jacob crosses over to the box and takes out a sack with a sandwich and some chips and a bottle of juice in it . He then crosses back over to the man and gives him the bag . The man is visibly thinking about running . <p> JACOB You cold ? <p> MAN No , this is like a vacation in the Bahamas . You should try sleeping by the waterfront - that ? s cold . <p> JACOB Here , take this . <p> Jacob takes off one of the extra scarves and gives it to the man . <p> MAN You didn ? t have to do that . <p> JACOB I know- but since I have an extra , there is no reason not to . <p> The man begins eating the sandwich . <p> JACOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MAN It ? s food . Right now , that ? s good enough . <p> JACOB Alright . Um ? I ? ve got more food to give out . I normally give out presents to the children I find too . There is no reason for children to be upset on Christmas . But <p> Jacob picks up the box . The man has an epiphany . <p> MAN Hey ! <p> JACOB Yeah ? <p> MAN Over on 23rd Street , you know that highway overpass ? <p> JACOB Yeah ? <p> MAN There is a woman who stays there ; she has two kids - a boy and a girl . They sleep in an abandoned security shack down there . They could use some food ? and I am sure the kids would like a toy or two ? it is Christmas . <p> JACOB The food I can deal with ? The bags of toys I bought were stolen this afternoon from right over there . Those were the toys I was going to give out . So <p> MAN Rising to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? let ? s just say ? um ? I found these earlier today <p> He reaches behind the manger and pulls out the bags that were stolen from Jacob earlier . <p> JACOB Where did you find them ? <p> MAN Listen , man , I need to go . Thanks for the food , but I need to go . <p> The man rushes off stage left but leaves the scarf . The flask is still sitting in the manger . <p> JACOB Merry Christmas <p> Jacob collects the bags and his box of food but doesn ? t get the scarf . <p> JACOB He ? ll be back for that . <p> Jacob exits stage left . <p> Scene 4 : The scarf is where it was left . The flask is still in with the manger with the baby Jesus doll . The homeless man enters from r . He is looking around to see if anyone is watching . He crosses to the scarf and picks it up . <p> MAN Glad it ? s still here . Looks at manger Thank you Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reaches to picks it up . This is ridiculous ? have people no sense of decency . <p> He tosses the flask off stage l <p> HARRISON From Offstage Aaah ! Dangit ! What on Earth ? ! <p> MAN That ? s my cue to exit . <p> The homeless man rushes off stage right , away from Harrison . As the man is leaving , Harrison enters stage l holding the flask and rubbing his head . <p> HARRISON I ? ve heard of raining dogs and cats ? but silver flasks He shakes the flask ? it is empty It ? s empty . <p> He crosses to in front of the manger scene . <p> I suppose you have something to do with this ? What ? s the problem Jesus , don ? t you approve of alcohol ? Well then , I have sinned a whole lot tonight ? let me tell you . I hate this time of year . I absolutely hate it . And do you want to know why I hate it so much ? I hate it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is okay this time of year and they spend all their extra money buying gifts for people who wouldn ? t give them a plug nickel . I hate this time of year because it reminds people how lonely they are . It reminds them how much they ? ve lost over the previous twelve months . People put themselves in so much debt they declare bankruptcy in April . But do you want to know why I really hate Christmas ? Do you really want to know ? Huh , Jesus ? I hate Christmas the most because it celebrates your birth . You ? ve done nothing for me . I have prayed and prayed and what do I get ? Nothing ! Please God , heal my daughter - she doesn ? t deserve this . Please relieve her pain ? and you don ? t answer . No wait ! You answered . You killed her ! You took away my baby . I looked to you for help . I looked to you for hope and I got nothing . I still went to church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose for her and how I should be thankful for the time I had with her . My wife and I stopped talking . We seemed to have nothing to talk about . And when we did have words to say to each other ? it was just yelling . We haven ? t had a civil conversation since March . I got home from work yesterday ? the apartment was empty . She had taken everything . Except she left me the answering machine and the phone . She didn ? t even write me a goodbye note . She let her attorney deliver that in person this morning with the divorce papers . I lose my whole family in a matter of months and I am supposed to celebrate your birth ? What kind of sick God are you ? <p> Harrison starts crying . <p> I didn ? t deserve this . I spent my whole life praying to you . Believing you cared . What about me , God ? What about me ? <p> He throws the flask back at the manger . He crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I DIDN ? T DESERVE THIS ! <p> In his anger he pushes over the figure of Mary . <p> I HAVE GIVEN MYSELF AND GOT NOTHING ! DO YOU HEAR ME ? NOTHING ! <p> He throws the Joseph figure . He looks at the baby Jesus . <p> And you ! You have done nothing but cause me pain and misery . I put my faith in you ! I put my trust in you . You said you would be my strength and shield ! You were nothing ! Nothing to me . Do you even know my name , let alone , the number of hairs on my head ? You don ? t ! You don ? t know me ! <p> He picks up the baby with one angry hand and holds it clenched tightly . He squeezes the Jesus doll in anger . <p> What child is this ? Who lay to rest on Mary ? s lap sleeping ? That child was a joke ! That child never happened ! Not in the way everyone else wants to believe . I needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were none of those things . You were none of them . None of them ! And I hate you for it ! <p> He holds the baby above his head as if he were going to throw it . <p> I hate you ! Hate you ! <p> He begins to really break down and sob . He falls to his knees . <p> I ? m sorry . <p> He begins to rock back and forth on the ground . He clutches the baby in his arms as if he were real . <p> I ? m sorry . I am just so lost . I am just so lost . Dear God , forgive me . Forgive me . I can ? t go on feeling this way . I can ? t . Please God , give me strength . I just don ? t know how to believe anymore - <p> He sobs into his arms with the baby . <p> I ? m sorry . I ? m so sorry . He keeps repeating ? I ? m sorry ? ? <p> The homeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . <p> MAN Sir ? Excuse me , sir ? Are you alright ? <p> HARRISON I ? m sorry <p> MAN Sir ? Are you okay ? <p> HARRISON Regaining composure I think so <p> As he stands up he places the doll on the ground . <p> MAN Did they hurt you , too ? <p> HARRISON Who ? <p> MAN Whoever tore up the nativity . Did they hurt you , too ? <p> HARRISON He wipes his eyes and stands up . No , no one hurt me . No one but myself , anyway . <p> MAN You sure you ? re okay ? <p> HARRISON Yeah . I guess so . Why don ? t you give me a hand and we will clean this mess up . <p> They cross to the nativity and each pick up one of the large figures that have been toppled . Harrison places the baby Jesus doll back in the manger . They finish cleaning up the mess that Harrison made during his rampage . <p> MAN It ? s a funny thing , you know <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wounded ? hurt ? bleeding ? and dying . In their hearts and souls they are dying . And they hide it all with ? Ho-ho-ho ? and ? Happy New Year ? <p> HARRISON If you only knew <p> MAN I know more than you think . <p> HARRISON I can imagine . <p> MAN People sleepwalk through their emotions , trying to hide what they are really feeling from everyone ? including themselves . <p> HARRISON And hide behind plastic smiles . <p> He gives a fake smile . <p> MAN That depends on who they ? re looking at . <p> HARRISON Or how you look at them ? <p> MAN I wish everyone could learn that . <p> HARRISON Unfortunately ? not everyone learns things that easily . <p> MAN Well , it is the time of year for miracles , isn ? t it ? <p> HARRISON If you say so . <p> MAN It ? s Christmas . <p> HARRISON What is Christmas ? <p> MAN Man , if I have to explain the meaning to you <p> HARRISON No , really . Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Nothing else . Everything else is added hoopla ! A baby was born ? it happens everyday . <p> MAN It ? s more than that . It ? s a gift . It ? s about renewal and hope ? but sometimes that ? s just too hard to see . <p> Harrison picks up the baby Jesus doll and lays it in the manger . He stands there a moment and stares at it . <p> MAN But that , that ? s just a doll . <p> HARRISON You don ? t think there is more to it ? <p> MAN No , that ? s just a doll . The real thing is in here He motions to his heart . <p> HARRISON But how do you know ? No offense , man , but you live on the street . <p> MAN And ? <p> HARRISON How can you believe in someone that allows you to be a failure and lets you suffer the indignities of your everyday life ? <p> MAN It ? s called faith . <p> HARRISON I don ? t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that . <p> HARRISON Why should I have faith ? <p> MAN If I didn ? t have faith , facing tomorrow would be impossible . But I know in my heart that I am here for a reason . I remain obedient and faithful , and I know one day I will be rewarded . <p> HARRISON I wish I had that kind of faith . <p> MAN You will , in time . I have faith in that . <p> HARRISON I ? m glad someone does . Harrison looks around and seeing that everything is cleaned up I really need to be getting home now <p> MAN Be thankful you have a home to go to . Not everyone is as blessed as you . <p> HARRISON Yeah . Well , that ? s one thing to be thankful for . Goodnight <p> MAN Goodnight . <p> HARRISON And ? um ? Merry Christmas . <p> MAN Merry Christmas . <p> Harrison exits stage left . The homeless man stands there for a moment . <p> MAN It ? s been so long since someone asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian . <p> HARRISON It ? s nice to meet you , Christian . <p> They cross towards each other and shake hands . <p> MAN You too , um - <p> HARRISON Harrison . <p> MAN You too , Harrison . <p> HARRISON Um ?

I don ? t have much , but I am willing to share . <p> MAN Thank you , but I hate to cause you any trouble . <p> HARRISON It would be no trouble , really . Consider it a Christmas gift . <p> MAN Slightly sarcastic I ? m sorry , but I don ? t have a gift for you . <p> HARRISON You ? ve already given me one <p> MAN Alright then . <p> Man turns to manger and whispers ?

##1749550 <p> The Tuatara ? s closest relatives are other subspecies of Tuatara , as no other species from the same ? order ? survive today . <p> Three different species of Tuatara in New Zealand : <p> - Northern Tuatara ( Sphenodon Punctatus Punctatus ) <p> - Cook Strait Tuatara ( Sphenodon Punctatus ) <p> - Brothers Island Tuatara ( Sphenodon Guntheri ) <p> The scientific name of the species means ? spotted Tuatara ? , with the maori name interpreted as ? spiny back ? . <p> DESCRIPTION : <p> Colour : grey , olive or occasionally brick red <p> Size : males are up to twice the size of females and may grow up to 60cm in length and weigh up to one kilogram . <p> Distinctive Features : scaly , dappled skins with a soft spiny crest ridge extending from the head , down the back to the tail . <p> Tuatara are egg laying and cold blooded <p> The Tuatara has a legendary ? third eye ? , part of a complex organ situated at the top of the brain . This organ contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is covered by opaque scales early in its growth . The function of this ? third eye ? is not known , but it possibly acts as a light sensor . <p> STATUS : Rare <p> Tuatara are recognised both internationally and in New Zealand , as a species at risk . Once plentiful , the Tuatara has declined since the arrival of humans in New Zealand due to loss of habitat and food supply and the introduction of predators . GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION : <p> Islands provide sanctuary for mainland dwellers . In order to preserve this formerly mainland species , the Stephens , Trios and Brothers groups of islands , as well as selected islands off the North Island coast line between the Bay of Islands and Tauranga , have now become their translocated home . With no predators here , they may breed and feed undisturbed.Link to our Poor Knights Islands web page for more information on a typical Tuatara island home . <p> HABITAT : <p> Where there are burrows you might well find Tuatara . <p> Tuatara need to be in areas where burrowing seabirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide ready made burrows and large deposits of droppings around which insects gather and breed . They also enjoy coastal forests and clearings ? cool areas to which they are specifically adapted . <p> FOOD : <p> Nocturnal carnivores . <p> Tuatara are night-time foragers , sometimes climbing trees to do so . Being meat eaters , insects such as beetles , spiders , crickets and weta make up the main proportion of the Tuatara diet . Sometimes small seabirds , frogs and lizards make their way onto the menu . <p> With two rows of upper teeth fitting neatly around one row of lower teeth , the jaw can move backwards and forwards , a neat tool for ripping apart prey . Holes in their skulls give extra power to their jaws , allowing them to hold prey until it dies . <p> ABOUT THE TUATARA : <p> The living dinosaur . <p> Although often thought of as a lizard , the Tuatara is a reptile and the sole survivor of an ancient line of reptiles known as Sphenodontia . With the exception of the Tuatara , this line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , died out about 60 million years ago . It may once have lived in the sea as it has no outer ears and vertebrae similar to those of a fish . <p> Being nocturnal , Tuatara are mostly active at night , staying hidden from predators under rocks , logs and in burrows during the day . If apparent in daylight hours , they will most likely be seen sunning themselves on rocks or outside their burrows . Despite their sleepy appearance , they will probably be waiting for prey to walk unwittingly by . <p> Like many lizards the Tuatara is able to shed its tail , the regrowth differing in colour from the shedding and shorter in length . <p> Mating takes place in late summer and early autumn and eggs are laid the following spring . The female will lay between 1-18 soft-shelled eggs in a small burrow , covering them with leaves and soil for protection . She will check the eggs for 2-3 nights , then leave , never to return . Only 2% of the eggs will hatch ! Young Tuatara cut their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 12-16 months . They will be about 10cm long and take a lengthy 13-20 years to mature and 60 years to reach full growth . A Tuatara may live to 100 years old , given the opportunity , maybe up to 300 ! <p> THREATS : <p> Rats , poaching and habitat destruction threaten our unique endemic reptile . All island groupings of Tuatara face common threats . Norway rats , ship rats and the native kiore may be the single greatest threat to both eggs and young , as Tuatara can not seem to persist when these predators are present.Fires destroy Tuatara habitat , although they may not lead to extinction of populations . Poaching , however , does pose a threat . The extent of its impact is not known , but Tuatara fetch a considerable price on the rare species black market . <p> Despite legal protection ( see below ) , Tuatara numbers and habitats continue to decline . Since Polynesians arrived in New Zealand , the habitat occupied by Tuatara has fallen to probably 0.5% of its original range . Within the last 100 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations have become extinct . At least four of the remaining 30 populations are likely to go the same way within approximately 50 years . The Brothers Island Tuatara is particularly vulnerable , existing on one tiny island in the group and consisting of only a few hundred individuals . <p> WHAT ? S BEING DONE ? <p> The unique status of this reptile was no doubt instrumental in its protection by law . Way back in April 1895 a warrant gave absolute protection and in September 1898 , it ? s eggs were given protected status as well . <p> The New Zealand Department of Conservation monitors the tuatara breeding programme on offshore islands , keeping these islands free from introduced predators and protected from loss of habitat . Supervised breeding programmes keep specimens under controlled heat to ensure that they thrive . Behaviour and survival skills are carefully watched to develop an understanding of this creature necessary for its management in the wild . <p> Most offshore island Tuatara refuges are cliffbound and difficult to access . All but one have ? nature reserve ? , ? scenic reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to visit . The exception is Moutoki , which is Maori owned and requires owner permission to visit . <p> WHAT CAN YOU DO ? <p> Be aware and take care . <p> Keep predators off the islands ! Be aware of those islands that are Tuatara sanctuaries and keep your boat at a distance . One rat , cat or dog can do an enormous amount of damage to Tuatara populations . <p> Support wildlife initiatives by conservation organisations .

##1749750 <h> CHAPTER 49 Public Goods and Free Riders <p> Suppose you own a store in a major shopping district . After two break-ins , you meet with the owners of several other nearby businesses who have had similar problems . You propose that you all band together to hire a watchman to patrol the neighborhood after dark . For the five businesses attending , including yourself , the table below reports how much each is " willing to pay " for this police protection : <p> YOU <p> BUSINESS A <p> BUSINESS B <p> BUSINESS C <p> BUSINESS D <p> $7000 <p> $5000 <p> $6000 <p> $4000 <p> $8000 <p> It turns out that a watchman can be hired for $15,000 . If the costs are equally divided across the five businesses , each would pay $3,000 apiece . Since everyone 's " willingness to pay " is more than this amount , hiring a night watchman would make each person better off . That is , this resource transfer would increase society 's happiness . <p> But would you expect each businessperson to agree to this plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knows his or her own willingness to pay . Despite the fact that we have reported the other businesses ' willingness to pay values in the table above , in reality , this information is hidden--unseen and unknowable . Second , each business knows that they will enjoy an external benefit if the other businesses hire the night watchman . This external benefit arises because once burglars know that the neighborhood is being patrolled at night , they will divert their attention to other parts of town . A business that did n't pay for the night watchman could still derive benefits from the other stores ' having hired a night watchman . <p> As a result , the owner of Business B might say to his colleagues , " Hey , I really have n't had any problems . If you guys want to go ahead and get a night watchman , that 's fine . Just do n't expect me to pay . " The truth is that the owner of Business B values a night watchman 's services at $6,000 . But by lying to his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of a having a night watchman in his neighborhood . The owner of Business B is what economists call a " FREE RIDER . " You may call him a leech . <p> The problem with free riding is that if the other businesses follow the same strategy , the watchman will not be hired . And that is a shame . It is in the interests of society 's happiness to hire a watchman . <p> Everyone has had experience with free riders . If you have ever worked on a team project in school , you 've probably seen the problem up front and dirty . Suppose a team consists of one conscientious student and three slackers . These three may be slackers , but they are certainly no dummies . They know that the conscientious student will work hard no matter what . As a result , the slackers can sit back and goof off , and still receive an acceptable grade for the project . They experience a positive externality from the work of the conscientious student . As a result , they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graded on their own efforts , and the project suffers . <p> Another example of free riding occurs every Sunday morning in houses of worship all across America . People sit in the pews at church , listen to the sermon , enjoy the fellowship of the congregation , and take advantage of the many services the church has to offer . Yet when the collection plate gets passed around , does everybody pitch in a contribution to help pay the costs of the services ? Those who do n't are free riding on the contributions of the others . <p> From these examples , one can see how difficult it is to get the private sector to produce the quantity of a public good which maximizes society 's happiness . Whether because of the impracticality of collecting revenues or the free rider problem , for-profit enterprises will find it difficult to collect revenues commensurate with the happiness society receives from public goods . As a result , the private sector will tend to produce too little of the public good . When this happens , there is a role for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us would feel uncomfortable about having the government take over the production of church services . On the other hand , most would agree that government should play a role in the provision of public goods like city streets , the criminal justice system , and national defense . But how does the public sector decide how much of these goods to produce ? And will the public sector allocation necessarily be better than the private sector allocation ? To answer these questions , we will need to examine just how the public sector makes allocation decisions 
##1749751 <h> CHAPTER 5 The Incredible Information Contained in Prices : Part I <p> Up to this point we have spent most of our time arguing that willingness to pay represents our best hope for guiding resources to their highest valued use . This might strike you as somewhat strange since our only concrete example of this approach--a bidding or auction market--would surely be a grossly impractical way to distribute the hundreds of millions of goods and services that must be allocated every day in a large economy . However , there is another way to distribute goods and services with which you are already very familiar . It incorporates the best features of the willingness to pay approach with a minimum of administrative maintenance . It is the organizing principle behind the allocation of resources in free market/capitalistic economies . It is currently on display at your local supermarket , laundromat , and music retailer . It is the price system . In this chapter we will begin to explain the connection between the price system and the willingness to pay approach . <p> We defined willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain a good . We also could have said that your willingness to pay for an item is the happiness , measured in dollars , that you expect to receive from the item . This definition may sound a bit strange to you , but it is really just a restatement of our previous definition , and you probably use it every day . <p> Each time you purchase ( or do not purchase ) a good , you compare your willingness to pay to its price . Say you eat a fine meal at the best restaurant in town . After eating broiled cod , crab legs , a T-bone steak , stuffed mushrooms , and a Caesar 's salad , you find yourself a tad full . When the waiter brings around a tray of tempting desserts , you refuse . Though the French chocolate silk pie looks quite delicious , you decide that your $4.75 can be better spent elsewhere . NOTE : In this case , the price of the pie exceeds your willingness to pay . After dinner , you join your friends at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $31 because your old pair suddenly was feeling a little bit tight . ( You suspect they were shrunk in the dryer again . ) NOTE : In this case , you decided that the $31 for the jeans could not be better spent elsewhere . Your willingness to pay exceeded the price of the jeans . We take this sentiment one step further by declaring that your willingness to pay for a good ( the absolute most you would spend on it ) is the happiness , measured in dollars , that you expect to receive from consuming it . At some price level , you would refuse to buy a pair of designer jeans . This price level is your willingness to pay , or the amount of happiness you expect to receive from your purchase . <p> Max , one of the authors , is no slave to fashion and would at most be willing to pay $30 for a pair of designer jeans . When Max goes to The Gap and discovers that jeans are $31 per pair , he decides that spending his money on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of cheap slacks at Target . Bob , the other author , loves being a snappy dresser . He would be willing to pay up to $100 for the same jeans . At $31 a pair , he thinks that he is getting a great deal . From our previous work with willingness to pay , we know that Bob expects to receive more pleasure from the jeans than Max because he is willing to pay more . In fact , Bob expects to receive $100 in pleasure from a pair of designer jeans , while Max expects to receive only $30 in pleasure from them . Notice that even though Bob paid $31 for his jeans , he receives $100 in happiness ( his willingness to pay ) from them . Armed with this knowledge of willingness to pay , we can begin to draw an amazing insight . <p> Unfortunately , we can not take credit for this amazing insight . It goes back at least as far as Adam Smith . It is the fundamental insight of economics , the foundational building block of the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABOUT WHERE RESOURCES WILL PRODUCE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF HAPPINESS IN SOCIETY . To understand this point is going to take a little bit of concentration on your part , but stick with it because this insight is worth working for . Here we go . <p> Let 's suppose we have five consumers . Being the creative people that we are , let 's call them Consumers A , B , C , D , and E , respectively . Let 's also suppose that we have some " inside " information on each consumer . Literally . We are going to imagine that we could look deep into the heart and soul of each and know exactly how much that consumer would be willing to pay for one more T-shirt . Not how much the consumer thinks he will have to pay it . Not how much it 's " worth " to them according to some nebulous standard of worth . When we say " willing to pay " we mean the maximum amount of their own money they would really be willing to give up in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our auction example , each consumer 's willingness to pay value represents the maximum amount they would be willing to bid in order to win that T-shirt in an auction . In other words , we are going to imagine that we know how much happiness--as measured by willingness to pay--an extra T-shirt would generate for each of our consumers . <p> Of course , in real life this information is known only by the consumer . Nobody can know just how much somebody else is willing to pay for something . But we are going to pretend we know this information in order to see something we otherwise would miss . The table below reports each consumer 's personal willingness to pay value for the T-shirt . <p> Willingness to Pay Values for the Five Consumers <p> Consumer A <p> Consumer B <p> Consumer C <p> Consumer D <p> Consumer E <p> $3.50 <p> $11.75 <p> $13.15 <p> $5.60 <p> $7.90 <p> Suppose these five consumers each walked into a town where the going price of T-shirts was $10 . At a price of $10 , only two consumers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consumers B and C each anticipate receiving more than $10 of happiness from owning the T-shirt . Purchasing the T-shirt clearly makes them better off . The other three consumers would not choose to buy a T-shirt ( Consumers A , D , and E ) . While they each would receive some happiness from the T-shirt , the amount of happiness they anticipate receiving is less than $10 . <p> Let 's stop for a moment to see if we really understand what 's going on here . Answer the following one-question , multiple-choice exam . <p> QUESTION : Assuming that his expectations are correct , how much happiness will Consumer B gain from owning the T-shirt ? <p> The answer is not ( a ) . While it is true that Consumer B paid $10 for the T-shirt , this only tells us that he anticipated receiving at least $10 of happiness from the T-shirt . Consumer C also paid $10 for the T-shirt . But his greater willingness to pay value indicates that he anticipated receiving greater happiness from the T-shirt than Consumer B. <p> How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumer B gained something from which he anticipated receiving $11.75 of happiness . In return , he gave up $10.00 . Does n't that trade make him better off by $1.75 ? Yes it does . But that 's not the question . The question is n't how much better off Consumer B feels he is as a result of purchasing the T-shirt . The question is , how much happiness will Consumer B receive from owning the T-shirt . That 's an important distinction . And one that is difficult to keep straight at times . <p> We will say this many times over in the course of this book : people get happiness from the consumption of goods and services , not from money itself . Money is merely the means that enables consumers to get goods and services . In evaluating the happiness that society receives from consuming goods and services , it is important that we remember to keep our eyes on the goods and services , and not the money . Forgetting this simple truth is the source of a great many economic fallacies , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to our question ? The answer is ( c ) , $11.75 . The consumer 's willingness to pay value tells us how much happiness he expects to receive from owning the particular good or service . With this firmly in mind , we can continue with our 
##1749752 <h> CHAPTER 8 Information and the Fundamental Problem in Economics <p> It is commonly stated in economics textbooks that the fundamental problem in economics is scarcity . We beg to differ . The fact that resources are finite , or scarce , is n't a problem--it 's just a fact of life . When allocating resources , choices must be made among competing options . Economics can no more solve the problem of scarcity than it can invent a perpetual motion machine . Rather , THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN ECONOMICS IS A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE . Not just any kind of knowledge , but the knowledge of where resources have their highest valued use . This is the primary obstacle that keeps an economy from achieving its purpose of maximizing social wealth . This is the fundamental problem that economics , and economies , must attempt to solve . <p> Another way of looking at this knowledge problem is to note that people are heterogeneous , that is , they have different preferences . To see the connection between this and the knowledge problem , suppose all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music , cars , etc . Then the economic planner would n't have to look any further than himself to know what people wanted . All he would have to do is ask himself what would give him the most happiness . In answering the question for himself , he would be answering it for all of society , since his preferences were representative of everybody else 's . <p> Of course , people are not all alike . For example , it is incomprehensible to us why some people do n't like economics . We love economics , and we 're reasonable people . So how it can be that there are people out there who do n't like this stuff ? Go figure ! People have different likes and dislikes--a fact that becomes painfully obvious to most of us at Christmas time . Indeed , anybody who has had to shop for a Christmas present for a distant relative is fully aware of how difficult it is to buy what others want . Imagine going Christmas shopping for the entire economy ! Millions of people whom you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois Def Leppard 's new CD ? Gee , what if he already has it ? What if he does n't like Deff Leppard ? ( Is that possible ? ) Maybe he only likes classical music . Maybe he does n't have a CD player ! <p> Different preferences are merely a nuisance at Christmas . They are a fundamental problem when allocating society 's resources across millions of consumers . A person who does n't think that lack of knowledge about people 's preferences is a serious problem is a person who thinks that people have essentially the same preferences . On the other hand , if people do have significantly different preferences , then the information produced by the price system is incredibly important . Thus , the appreciation one has for the information produced in prices is directly proportional to how different one thinks people are . <p> Let 's return to the Soviet planner of Chapter 3 who was trying to decide where and what kind of apartment complex to build . He could do a fine job of allocating resources if everyone was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted , and then order the same thing for everyone else . Of course , if the economic planners ' preferences are different from his consumers ' preferences , and the consumers have differing preferences amongst themselves , then the planner faces an impossible task . Should he order an extra apartment complex to be built in Moscow or St. Petersburg ? Should he build family units or singles ? Luxury apartments or efficiencies ? He can only make these decisions correctly ( i.e. in a way that maximizes happiness ) if he knows how much each consumer in his market values housing . Some of his consumers might prefer more automobiles or trips abroad instead of luxury apartments . If they get luxury apartments instead of their heart 's desire of a trip to Disneyland , society is made worse off . <p> In contrast , let 's consider how a private building contractor answers these questions in a free market or capitalistic society . It seems safe to assume that the private contractor does n't spend much time thinking about directing resources to their highest valued use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods and services which he sells . When examining where to build a new apartment complex , his first consideration is the price of housing . If the market price for apartments is $300 per month in Tulsa , Oklahoma , but $500 per month in Kansas City , Missouri , the contractor will decide to build new apartments in Kansas City ( assuming that costs are the same in each city ) . And this is precisely what we would want the contractor to do if we wanted him to maximize happiness ! Consumers in Kansas City would get around $500 a month in extra happiness from having a new apartment in their city , while consumers in Tulsa would derive only about $300 per month in happiness . 1 <p> How can we say this without first doing a study on where an apartment complex is most " needed ? " And how can we compare the happiness of consumers in Tulsa and consumers in Kansas City ? We can , if we adopt the willingness to pay approach to measuring happiness--and recognize the incredible information contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Missouri would generate a greater increase in society 's happiness than one in Tulsa , Oklahoma . The planner 's dilemma is solved--almost . <p> OPTIONAL SECTION FOR ECONOMISTS <p> : It has been our experience that when students with prior economics training are first exposed to the ideas in this book , their immediate reaction is " Where did these guys get this stuff from ? ! " We want to demonstrate that there is nothing in this book that is " new . " The ideas in the preceding chapters--and in the chapters to come--are all implied by standard microeconomic theory . <p> For example , consider a standard demand and supply graph . Generally , the demand curve is interpreted " horizontally . " That is , holding price constant , the demand curve reports the maximum quantity of the good that consumers in the market would purchase at that price . However , one can also interpret the demand curve " vertically . " Specifically , holding quantity constant , the demand curve reports the maximum amount of money that the marginal consumer would be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quantity were supplied to the market . In other words , the willingness to pay value of the marginal consumer for every given level of quantity is indicated by the height of the demand curve . 2 <p> The graph above represents the T-shirt example we have been discussing for the past three chapters . At a price of $10.00 , the equilibrium quantity of T-shirts sold in the market is Q 0 = 1,000,000 . All of the consumers who have willingness to pay values greater than $10.00 are represented on the horizontal axis as lying to the left of quantity Q 0 . In contrast , those consumers with willingness to pay values less than $10.00 are represented as lying to the right of quantity Q 0 . If one more T-shirt is supplied to the market , the price drops negligibly--from $10.00 to $9.99--and the consumer who ends up with this T-shirt is one who has a willingness to pay value between $10.00 and $9.99 , or " right around $10 . " <p> How about our statement that willingness to pay measures happiness ? Economists do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they use a word called " utility . " However , if you ask your economics instructor what she means by " utility , " most often the response you 'll hear is " happiness , " or " pleasure . " <p> Of course , the relative costs to building in each of these cities also plays into the contractor 's decision and is just as important economically , but we leave the exploration of this topic for a later chapter . <p> 2 <p> That the height of the demand curve represents the amount of money the consumer is willing to pay in order to get one more unit of the good is easily derived from standard microeconomic theory . For an easy-to-understand , graphical derivation , see Figure 3-4 on page 74 in Edgar K. Browning and Jacquelene M. Browning , Microeconomic Theory and Applications , Second Edition 
##1750150 <p> What is the difference between brown and white eggs ? Shell colour varies with the breed of hen and is not related to quality , nutrients , flavour or cooking characteristics . <p> What is the best way to store eggs ? Keep eggs or egg products ( mayonnaise etc ) refrigerated at 4C or below when you 're not cooking or eating them . These foods should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours , including the time you use to prepare and serve them . <p> Eggs are porous , which means smells and liquid can be absorbed by the tiny pores on the eggs shell . Storing eggs in their cartons in the fridge helps prevent this . Place egg cartons on a middle or lower shelf rather than in the door of the fridge so the temperature is more consistent . <p> How long do eggs last ? The best before date on a carton of eggs tells you how long the eggs inside it stay ' fresh ' if they are kept refrigerated after purchase . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the nutritional value of the egg , but the appearance and qualities of the egg may change as the egg ages . Poached or fried eggs hold their shape better the fresher the egg , but hard boiled eggs are much easier to peel if the eggs are at least one week old . <p> Temperature , humidity and handling all contribute to freshness . A one week old egg kept in ideal conditions can be fresher than an egg left at room temperature for one day . Most commercially produced eggs reach supermarkets within a few days of being laid and in New Zealand it is also possible to purchase eggs which are guaranteed to be sold the same day they are laid . <p> How can I store leftover egg whites and yolks ? You can refrigerate raw whites for up to 4 days and unbroken raw yolks , covered with water , for up to 2 days in a tightly sealed container . If you ca n't use the yolks quickly enough , hard cook them just as you would cook whole eggs in the shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed container for up to 4 or 5 days . For longer storage , freeze raw whites , sugared or salted yolks and cooked yolks for up to 1 year . <p> To freeze egg whites , break and separate the eggs , one at a time , making sure that no yolk gets in the whites . Pour the whites into freezer containers , seal the containers tightly , label with the number of egg whites and the date and freeze . For faster thawing and easier measuring , first freeze each white in an ice cube tray and then transfer to a freezer bag or container . Substitute 2 tablespoons thawed egg white for 1 Large fresh white . <p> Raw egg yolks require special treatment because the yolk 's gelation property causes it to thicken or gel when frozen making it almost impossible to use . Beat in either 1/8 teaspoon salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar for each 1/4 cup egg yolks ( 4 Large yolks ) . Label the container with the number of yolks , the date and whether you 've added salt ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and freeze . Substitute 1 tablespoon thawed egg yolk for 1 Large fresh yolk . How can I tell if an egg is still fresh ? A quick test for freshness is to check if the raw egg in the shell sinks in a basin of water . Fresh eggs stay at the bottom of the bowl while older eggs float because of the large air cell that forms in its base . <p> How do I check whether an egg is boiled or raw ? To tell if an egg is raw or hard-boiled , spin it.If the egg spins easily , it is hard-boiled but if it wobbles , it is raw . <p> I 've had a carton of eggs in my fridge for a few weeks . Can I still use them ? You can use your oldest eggs for baking cakes , quiches and frittatas.Fresh eggs are ideal for poaching and frying because they may not hold their shape . Older eggs can be useful for hard-boiling , scrambling , and making omelettes . If hard-boiling , it is best to use eggs a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely the white will stick to the shell <p> How safe are eggs ? The risk of getting an illness from eggs is very low . However , the nutrients that make eggs a high-quality food for humans are also a good growth medium for bacteria . In addition to food , bacteria also need moisture , a favourable temperature and time in order to multiply and increase the risk of illness . In the rare event that an egg contains bacteria , you can reduce the risk by proper chilling and eliminate it by proper cooking . When you handle eggs with care , they pose no greater food-safety risk than any other perishable food . <p> What are some food safety tips when it comes to storing eggs ? <p> Like all perishable foods , eggs need to be handled carefully . Follow these suggestions to ensure that you handle and prepare eggs properly : <p> Always buy shell eggs that are clean and keep them refrigerated at home <p> When storing eggs in the refrigerator , keep eggs in the carton and at a reasonable distance from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods allow no more than two hours at room temperature for preparation and serving <p> Eggs should be cooked until the white is completely firm and the yolk begins to thicken <p> For best quality , use fresh eggs within the ' Best Before ' date as stated on the carton . Avoid cross-contamination by washing hands , cookware , and counter-tops with hot , soapy water after preparing raw animal products , including eggs . <p> Is it safe to eat raw eggs ? It 's best not to serve raw or lightly cooked dishes made with eggs . The risk of food poisoning from eggs is highest with raw and lightly cooked dishes . <p> What causes blood spots ? Small spots of blood are occasionally found in an egg yolk . These do not indicate a fertile egg ; they are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel on the yolk surface during formation of the egg . Such eggs are suitable for consumption and the spot can be easily removed with the tip of a knife . <p> Why are some hard-cooked eggs difficult to peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best eggs to use for peeling are more than a week old . <p> Why is an egg white sometimes cloudy or has a yellow of greenish colour to it ? Cloudiness of raw white is due to the presence of carbon dioxide , which has not had time to escape <p> Why do some hard-cooked eggs have a greenish ring around the yolk ? The harmless greenish ring is due to an iron and sulfur compound , which forms when eggs are overcooked or not cooled quickly . <p> What are the stringy white pieces in egg whites ? These edible rope-like strands of egg white , called chalazae ( ka-LAY-zee ) keep the yolk centred in the thick white . <p> What are the different farming housing methods ? <p> Cage Systems : Birds in cage systems are housed in cages within a shed . <p> Barn Systems : Birds in barn systems are free to roam within a shed which may or may not have vertical levels . The floor may be based on litter or other material such as slats or wire mesh . <p> For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NZ Egg Production Industry visit eggfarmers.org.nz <p> Are eggs good for you ? Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse providing 11 different vitamins and minerals , high quality protein , healthy fats ( including omegas-3 ) and important antioxidants . Along with their nutritional value , eggs are tasty , convenient and good value for money making them an excellent part of a well balanced , healthy diet . For more information go to **26;8144;TOOLONG <p> Are eggs an economical food ? Eggs are one of today 's best food buys . Eggs supply high-quality protein and a variety of important vitamins and minerals at a very low price . <p> Bloom Egg shells are covered with a natural coating that seals its pores . This helps to prevent bacteria from getting inside the shell and reduces moisture loss . Wiping or washing eggs removes the protective coating and reduces the lifetime of the egg . <p> Chalaza e The yolk is anchored to the white by tiny strands of egg white called chalazae . The more prominent the chalazae , the fresher the egg . <p> Colour Egg shell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hen . Colour variations have no effect on the quality , flavour , or nutritional value of the egg . The breed of hen determines the colour of the shell . Hens with white feathers and ear lobes lay white eggs ; hens with red feathers and ear lobes lay brown eggs . Egg white ( albumen ) is actually clear when raw and only becomes white in colour when beaten or cooked . Using fresh eggs and cooling them quickly after cooking helps prevent darkening of the egg white . <p> The egg yolk The yolk or yellow portion makes up about 33% of the liquid weight of the egg . It contains all of the fat in the egg and a little less than half of the protein . The yolk contains all this goodness because in fertilised eggs the yolk is the site of embryo formation . With the exception of riboflavin and niacin , the yolk contains a higher proportion of the egg 's vitamins than the white . All of the egg 's vitamins A , D and E are in the yolk . Egg yolks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the sunshine vitamin ) . The yolk also contains more phosphorus , manganese , iron , iodine , copper , and calcium than the white , and it contains all of the zinc . The yolk of a Large egg contains about 59 calories . It is the yolk which is responsible for the egg 's emulsifying properties in cooking . <p> Yolk colour - raw Yolk colour depends solely on the diet of the hen as artificial additives to enhance yolk colour are not permitted . If she gets plenty of yellow-orange plant pigments ( xanthophylls ) , these will be deposited into the yolk . Hens fed mashes containing yellow corn lay eggs with medium yellow yolks . Those eating wheat or barley lay lighter-colour yolks . Golden yolks are preferred by most New Zealanders . <p> Yolk colour -- cooked A greenish ring around a hard-cooked egg yolk may be the result of sulphur and iron compounds in the egg reacting at the surface of the yolk , overcooking or a high proportion of iron in the cooking water . The eggs are still wholesome and nutritious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be avoided by using the proper cooking time and temperature , and by rapidly cooling the cooked eggs in cold water . <p> Double-yolkers Double-yolkers are created when a hen releases two yolks at the same time . This is quite common in young hens whose cycles may not be perfectly synchronised . Older hens will sometimes produce a double-yolker in an Extra Large egg . Occasionally a hen will produce double-yolker eggs throughout her egg-laying career . It is rare , but not unusual , for a young hen to produce an egg with no yolk at all Blood spots Occasionally small blood spots may be found on an egg yolk . These are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel on the yolk surface during egg formation . Less than 1% of all eggs produced have blood spots as they are normally removed during the candling process . The egg can be eaten as normal or the spot can be removed with the tip of a knife .

For food safety these foods should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours , including the time you use to prepare and serve them . <p> The nearest mathematical description is an oblate or prolate spheroid - depending on which way you look at the egg . <p> The word spheroid means that the egg is like a sphere , but is n't exactly a sphere . That 's because an egg is n't perfectly symmetrical . The word oblate means that the poles of the egg are flattened or depressed . <p> So , an egg is a ' not-quite-round sphere ' with flattened sides .

The next site of activity is the isthmus where the two shell membranes are formed in about 1 hours . The egg has now reached it full size and shape . It passes along to the uterus to acquire , after 19 hours , its shell , shell colour and bloom , or protective coating . After a few minutes pause in the vagina , the uterus inverts the cloaca ( the junction of the digestive , urinary and reproductive systems ) and the vent and the egg is laid.All in a days work so to speak . <p> Some interesting facts : <p> A hen requires between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty minutes after laying an egg she starts all over again . <p> Most female animals have two functioning ovaries , but hens only use one , their left .

Thank you for your prayers , and may God bless you everyday . With prayer and thanks Pastor Randy and Marilou Licayan ( Vencer , Mindanao , Philippines ) . <p> Hello Brother Rodney , <p> I just want to thank you a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you could have imagined what the impact of it could be . It is God who led you to send me , because I am now in a series of teaching new converts on " The Holy Spirit and His work in Man 's Life . " So thanks a lot for it . May God bless you so much . I still remember the great days we had together here in Tanga . <p> Keep praying for us , as we do for you . Love and Blessing Pastor Raphael &; Loveness Mhando ( Tanga , Tanzania ) . <p> Thank you very much for your ministry blessings . We are receiving so many blessings from your ministry . We are giving thanks to you in the name of our lord Jesus Christ . We are constantly praying for your wonderful ministry . I thank God for your family and your ministry . Please continue to pray for our ministry . <p> May you be greatly encouraged as you continue to serve the Lord there in New Zealand . Love in His Ongoing Service Pastor Bhaskara Rao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank God for your ministry . I have been thinking about what your ministry has meant to me over the past nine months and this is my attempt to put it into words . <p> Last week , after The GFM , the words that came to my mind were that " I hear words that my ears want to hear . " That may sound simplistic but it is something I have been looking for , for a long time . For so long I have only heard words of condemnation and accusation about my past . <p> When I first started coming to The GFM Equipping Station in Hamilton I felt that I did n't fit in ... these people were so tuned into God . I could never attain to such holiness and Satan gave me such a hard time after each meeting . But I was drawn to keep coming back week after week ; in fact , I never wanted to miss a session . <p> Just a short while ago God dropped into my heart that my past has been fully paid for on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil reminds me about my past I must remind him of Jesus ' past . The only reason I can come before God is because of what Jesus has done . In my head I have known this for a long time but it was not a reality in my life . I am experiencing a freedom now that I have never known before . <p> The prophetic words that have been spoken over me have given me new hope . I desire that the spiritual realm becomes more real than the physical I can see . My sisters and brothers here inspire me to keep pressing in to God . We are all just submitted vessels wanting to be used by God , are n't we ? <p> I praise God for the opportunity to practice the prophetic gifts in a safe and loving environment . I am also grateful for the opportunity to serve on the letter writing team ( part of the free Bible Correspondence Courses ) . I believe God is sharpening me in the gift of encouragement . <p> Thank you so much for 
##1757550 <h> You have a choice . You can compete on price or you can compete on value . <p> If you do not compete on value , you will have no choice but to compete on price . And in the last issue I explained why you definitely do n't want to do that . <p> Value is not what people want , or expect or desire . Value is what people are prepared to pay for . Unfortunately , most of us do n't much about that . I asked a senior bank manger whether his bank competed on price or value . " We compete on value , " he replied gruffly . <p> " What do you have that your customers value ? " I asked . <p> He thought for a moment . " I have n't got a clue . " . <p> Most of us would have to say the same thing . If we did know what our customers valued we could price more effectively , sell with more confidence and resist the pressure to discount . <p> The Marriott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , discovered this . A few years ago , Marriott Lodgings wanted to grow their business by opening a chain of budget motels . Market research told them the going price for a budget motel room was US$49 per night . They put together focus groups , showed them a picture of a basic motel room , and asked them whether they would pay $49 for that room . People in the focus groups said they would . They were then shown a list of extras that could be put in the room and asked which extras they would like . " We 'll take the lot , thanks , " came the answer . <p> Now that presented a problem to Marriott Lodgings . How could they give people all those extras , in that room , charge only $49 per night and still make a profit ? <p> They could n't . <p> Marriott 's marketers started again with new focus groups . This time they gave them $49 in play money . When people said they liked the room they were shown , the marketers told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their play money on the table . Then the marketers presented a list of extras that could be put in the room , showing the cost of each . An extra large bathroom might cost $9 , but a daily newspaper only $1 . People were asked how they wanted to spend the remaining $28 . At the end of that exercise , Marriott Lodgings understood what people were prepared to pay for , not just what they wanted . Within two years , their budget motel chain was the most profitable in America , earning profits 27% higher than the industry average . <p> You could do the same thing . Just put together small focus groups and ask people to list what they expect when they shop at your store . Then give them $50 in play money . Tell them the product they purchased cost $20 , and ask them to put that money on the table . Then ask them how much they would pay for each of the other things on their list . Make sure they understand that if they do n't pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that like the Marriott , you will learn some important lessons about what your customers are prepared to pay for , and that will help you to compete on value rather than on price . <p> In the next issue , I 'll explain how you can create even more

It is caused by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide , due largely to the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation . The response has been negotiated internationally following the development of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 . The Kyoto Protocol to the Convention was negotiated in 1997 to set legally binding targets for emissions reductions . The latest in the series of meetings , the 6th Conference of the Parties ( COP6 ) in the Hague , promised to provide clarity on a number of issues ( for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and provide the way forward for implementing the Kyoto Protocol . Sadly this was not to be . <p> One of the key issues on the table at COP6 was how to deal with activities in the Land Use , Land Use Change and Forestry sector . This was an important issue for bioenergy , since decisions could have had major implications for the biomass supply side of bioenergy systems . Bioenergy systems can offer a number of benefits in terms of greenhouse gas removal or avoidance , as clearly outlined in the IEA Bioenergy Position Paper produced by Task 25 ( **39;3369;TOOLONG ... While there are fairly clear messages that carbon stock changes during the commitment period ( 2008-2012 ) resulting from afforestation , reforestation and deforestation activities since 1990 will be included , there is still a lack of consensus on other issues . These include some definitions , whether additional activities since 1990 will be included ( and how ) , and the question of claiming credit for land management activities in other countries , particularly developing countries . <p> In the final hours of the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tabled a proposal as a basis for compromise . It suggested that 15% of the carbon uptake in managed forests , and 70% of the carbon uptake in croplands and grazing lands , could be accounted for by industrialized countries . The text also included afforestation and reforestation as allowable projects in developing countries . Even though countries began to show some flexibility , no final agreement could be found on the issue of land management . It was agreed to suspend COP6 and continue negotiations in May 2001 in Bonn/Germany . <p> What would the compromise have meant for bioenergy ? Observers have compared the compromise paper with a line that was drawn in the sand which can not easily be removed , and this line will likely serve as the starting point for new talks . The agreement would have included full credit for the carbon stock increases associated with establishment of new plantations on non-forest land , eg for biofuels . It would also have accounted for increases in soil carbon when non-tree crops are grown for biofuels . Greater removal of biomass from existing forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the short term while providing continued greenhouse-gas benefits through fossil-fuel substitution . Counting only 15% of the carbon stock changes in existing forests would have been a modest incentive for increasing or preserving carbon stocks in forests . Fifteen percent is also low enough so that it does not compromise the incentive for using biofuels , provided that they are efficiently converted into useful energy such as heat or power . Another pending decision to be taken under the UNFCCC next year is how to account for carbon in harvested wood products . This will be the focus of an informal workshop in New Zealand in February 2001 , at which several Task 25 participants will be present . Task 25 will also launch an e-mail discussion list on wood products and address the issue at its next workshop in Canberra/Australia at the end of March . <p> Let us all hope that there is more progress at COP6 part II in May and June 2001 in Bonn , so that countries can proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol . An effective international climate-change regime will

The information provided can be used by national and international governmental organisations to develop bioenergy-related policies , industrial stakeholders for focussing their RTD and deployment strategies on the most promising ( i.e. sustainable ) Biomass Value Chains , NGOs to be included into their renewable energy scenarios , and research institutes and universities to focus their applied and strategic research programmes . <p> The work will be carried out in two parts : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry focused view on the working field . 2 . Building a network on biorefineries in participating countries with industry , governments , NGOs , and researchers . Expand the focus to a European and global level , develop best practice guidelines , and test them regarding their ability to support the long-term objectives . <p> Work programme 1 . Developing a biorefinery complexity index , similar to what they use in the petroleum industry ( Nelson complexity index ) , based on the Classification System . 2 . Identifying the most promising bio-based products -- i.e. food , feed , added-value materials ( a.o. fibre-based ) and chemicals ( functionalised chemicals and platform chemicals ( building blocks ) ) to be co-produced with bioenergy. 3 . Assessing the current status and development potential of both Energy-driven Biorefineries ( incl. biofuels ) and Product-driven Biorefineries based on a Full Value Chain approach . 4 . Providing a review of approaches and developing a guidance document for sustainability assessment , including economic , environmental and social acceptance aspects of biorefineries. 5 . Preparing a Summarizing Paper concerning " Adding Value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to be used by a.o. national/international governmental organisations for their policy developments . 6 . The organisation of bi-annual Task Meetings , workshops inviting national stakeholders , and visits to running pilot/demo and commercial facilities . External knowledge dissemination in general will be done by : i ) set-up and management of the Task website , including linkage to many other national/international websites , and ii ) preparation and distribution of a Task newsletter ( at least 2 times a year ) . Internal knowledge dissemination will be done by means of an intranet-site coupled to the Task website. 7 . Update of the Country Reports on Biorefinery Mapping and Biorefinery-related RD &D; Programmes to help national governments to define their national biorefinery policy goals and related programmes . 8 .

##1760752 <h> Halal Food <p> Thirty years ago , halal slaughtering became a divisive issue in our nation 's sheep and beef slaughter houses . The meat companies had lost their markets in Europe and wanted to expand their sales in the Middle East , so they decided to have all livestock slaughtered using halal practices ( the word halal means lawful ) . I wrote and article called Dangerous Compromise in Meat Industry opposing their actions . <p> This was an issue of freedom and liberation . Moslems are free to pray to whoever they wish . They are free to kill their meat in any way they choose , provided it is humane . What they are not entitled to is to force Christian farmers to pay to have a Moslem slaughterman to pray a Moslem prayer over their livestock . Meat companies mostly owned by farmers were forcing their clients to submit to Moslem religious practices . I was very encouraged to read recently that many Southland farmers are still resisting the meat companies that have given in on this issue . <p> Eventually , halal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they should eat this meat that is labelled has halal . My response was as follows . <p> For a Christian , halal slaughtered meat falls into the category of ' meat offered to idols ' . The Bible teaches that , while it is wrong to offer meat to false gods , it is not wrong for Christians to eat this meat if it comes onto the market . <p> Everything God created is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving , because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer ( 1 Timothy 4:4,5 ) <p> Provided Christians give thanks for what they eat , they should have no fear of such meat . Even though it has been offered to a false god , it has been consecrated by their prayers . The only situation where eating halal killed meat would be wrong is where it may cause a brother to stumble . No food is unclean in itself . But if your brother is distressed by what you eat , it is better not to eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Many imported food stuffs now have halal labels on them . In the following pages , I will provide some more scriptures that support this view and discuss some scriptures that seem to advocate a stricter standard . <p> Meat that is halal killed meat has been offered to idols . The Bible teaches that , while offering meat to false gods is wrong , it is not wrong for Christians to eat this meat if it is available for sale in supermarkets . The clearest statement is in 1 Corinthians 10:25 : <p> Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience , for the earth is the Lord 's , and everything it . <p> This statement is very clear . Christians can eat any meat that it available in their supermarket , regardless of where it comes from . Christianity is not an external religion , where we get closer to God by doing or not doing things . We are saved by faith and get close to God by having a pure heart . ( Islam is an external religion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The only reason for not eating meat would be to avoid offending the conscience of another Christian and causing them to stumble . We must have the right heart-attitude to our brethren . <p> The same message is repeated in 1Corinthians 8 . There is one God and one Lord in whom we live . We can not be contaminated just by eating meat . <p> Food does not bring us near to God . We are no worse if we do not eat , and no better if we do ( v.8 ) . <p> Food can not separate us from God , if our heart is right . <p> Paul warns believers to be careful about how they exercise this freedom . <p> Be careful , however , that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak . For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol 's temple , wo n't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols ? So this weak brother , for whom Christ died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They should not eat meat in an idol 's temple , if this will be a stumbling block to someone with a weaker conscience Building up another Christian is more important than exercising our freedom . <p> These clear statements that eating meat offered to idols is not wrong raise the issue of the meaning of scriptures that appear to contradict them . <h> 1 . The Jerusalem Council - Acts 15 <p> On of the requirements imposed on the Gentile Christians by the so-called Jerusalem Council was that they should : <p> Abstain from food sacrificed to idols ( Acts 15:29 ) . <p> I have discussed this passage in a different context . The truth is that James and his mates made this decision without consulting the Holy Spirit . Fortunately , the churches in Asia Minor had the sense to ignore this decision . <h> 2 . The Church at Pergamum - Revelation 2:12-17 <p> Jesus words to the Church at Pergamum were not a warning about being enticed into sin , not a warning about eating meat . <p> You have people there who hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entice the Israelites to sin by eating meat sacrificed to idols and committing sexual immorality . <p> The problem was that Balaam was able to entice the Israelites to sin . Numbers 25:1-3 describes how this happened . The Moabite women invited the men of Israel to join them in their sacrifices . There was nothing wrong in talking and eating with the Moabites . Talking is not a sin . The problem was that while talking , the people " bowed down before these idols " and worshipped Baal Peor . This caused the anger of the Lord to burn against them . <p> The key word in the passage is " entice " ( the NASB translates this as " stumbling block " ) . The passage is not saying that talking and eating meat is sinful . The problem was that the Israelites led themselves into a place of temptation , where they were not strong enough to resist going further and worshiping idols . <p> Pergamum was a strong church . However , even strong Christians must be careful , about entering into a place of temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the meaning of Jesus warning . Christians must avoid situations of compromise , where they can be tempted into sin . <p> Consider a modern example . Having a massage is probably not sinful , but having a massage in a Massage Parlour would be foolish , because it could lead into sin . Similarly , television is not evil ; it is just a communication system . However , some television programs can produce sinful thoughts that eventually lead to sin . <p> Pergamum was said to be close to " Satan 's throne " . The passage does not say what the Christians in the city were doing , but they must have been doing going somewhere involving food and idols that was very tempting and placing them in danger of falling into sin . Jesus warned against stumbling blocks that could cause strong Christians to fall . <h> 3 . The Church at Thyatira - Revelation 2:18-20 <p> Jesus gave a similar warning to the Church at Thyatira . <p> You tolerate that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess . By her teaching she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed to idols . <p> The key word in this passage is " misleads . " The NKJV has " seduces " and the NASB has " leads astray " . This woman was also seducing Christians and leading them into sin . In some way , which is not clear , she was getting them into a situation where they would face temptation that they were not strong enough to resist . Although , the Christians in Thyatira were strong in faith and service , some were falling into sin . Jezebel was encouraging them to do things which were not sinful , but which would be dangerous for Christians who had recently come out of them . <p> The issue of food and idolatry is well explained in 1 Corinthians 10 . Paul describes the history of Israel as a warning from which we should learn . He then warns us to be careful about falling into temptation , because we will all face it . <p> If you think you are standing firm , be careful that you do n't fall ( v.12 ) <p> No Christian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation . <p> The key verse in the chapter is v 23 . <p> All things are lawful for me , but not all things are helpful ; all things are lawful for me but not all things edify ( NKJV ) . <p> There are some things that are not sinful , but they are dangerous , so a wise Christian will avoid them . A Christian can go into a pagan temple and pray against the spiritual forces without sinning . However , if the Christian is not fully free from those forces , it can be dangerous . The sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons . A person who was previously in bondage to them , might be unwise to go back into their presence . They should follow Paul 's advice flee from idolatry . <p> Food offered to idols fits into this category . In the ancient world eating meat that had been sacrificed in a pagan temple was an integral part of the religion of the day . The New Testament was addressed to people who had come out of these religions . Eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , for some Christians going back to one of these temples and eating meat ( perhaps for a social function ) could be the start of their falling away from new life in Christ . They would be better to stay away from these places . <p> Similarly , eating meat that has been halal killed is not sinful for most Christians , as it would not entice them into further sin . This is especially true if it can not be distinguished from other meat in the butcher 's window . However , for Christians who have been converted from Islam , it might be the first step back into the legalism ( and the spiritual forces ) of their old religion . Eating meat that has been halal killed is not sinful , but it may not always be helpful or edifying . <p> If the Book of Revelation were being written today , it would make the same point about watching television . Watching television is not sinful , but it is one of the forces at the heart of the modern sinful world . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entices and seduces them into sin . In our world , halal killed meat is not harmful , whereas television leads many astray and some have fallen . <h> Businesses <p> Christians can not be harmed by eating halal food , unless their conscience is weak and it leads into other sin . <p> Businesses should be careful about getting their food halal certified . When going through this certification process , they have to submit to Moslem authorities . When people submit to any human authority , they give them open themselves up to the spiritual forces , behind that authority . Therefore , businesses getting their products halal certified , are opening themselves up to the spiritual forces behind Islam . <p> If the managers of the business are Christians , they might have sufficient protection in place to keep themselves safe from any spiritual attack , but they would need to be very careful . If they have any spiritual vulnerabilities in those areas , they could come under serious attack , and it could harm the business . <p> The Christian manager would also need to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing it to provide food to people who need it , that would be okay . However , if they were getting certification just go 
##1761250 <h> Teenagers and birth <p> This article Teenagers and Birth explains some of the issues that are common amongst teenagers when they are at the end of pregnancy or giving birth . <p> Many teenagers do extremely well during pregnancy and birth . They are fit and healthy and look after their bodies and their growing babies well . Feeling well supported and being well informed helps enormously . <p> Every pregnant woman in New Zealand is entitled to a lead maternity carer , who will care for and support them during the pregnancy , birth and for 6 weeks afterwards . Usually this is a midwife ; occasionally it may be a doctor . Ask your Lead Maternity Carer ( LMC ) about special antenatal classes for teenagers or support groups in your area . If you live in a city it is more likely that these will be available , but some rural areas may also offer teenage classes . <p> The key to a healthy pregnancy and birth is looking after yourself and your baby ! Please visit our article Teenagers and Pregnancy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making good decisions . <p> Teenagers are more likely to have problems around the birth , statistically speaking , and these are discussed below . However , if you eat a balanced diet , exercise throughout your pregnancy and avoid drugs , alcohol and smoking , you are massively increasing your chances -- and your baby 's -- of a healthy outcome ! <h> Pre-eclampsia in teenage pregnancies <p> This condition can affect any pregnancy , particularly your first pregnancy and is more common amongst teenagers . <p> It causes - <p> swelling of the hands , feet and face <p> protein in the urine , which is a sign that the kidneys are not working well ( kidneys are like a sieve and should not let ' large ' protein molecules through them ) <p> high blood pressure <p> The effect on the mum is that she can feel unwell , with blurred vision and headaches and , rarely , may even have a fit . <p> The effect on the baby is possibly not growing so well , they are more likely to be born early and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pre-eclampsia can not be prevented as there are many aspects of the disease that doctors do not understand . Eating a healthy diet with lots of fruit , vegetables and fibre , avoiding takeaway food and exercising gently will certainly help to keep you well . <h> Premature births and teenagers <p> A pregnancy lasts on average 266 days or 40 weeks . If a baby is born before 37 weeks this is classed as premature and the baby will be small , may not feed well and may also have breathing problems -- particularly before 34 weeks . <p> Prematurity is more common amongst teenagers , due to a link also with smoking , drugs and alcohol . In order to give your baby the best chance of growing to a good size and staying inside your womb until at least 37 weeks -- cut out smoking , alcohol and drugs altogether . <p> Some people think that labour will hurt less if the baby 's small -- actually this is not true at all and if you are afraid of pain you can have an epidural ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> In addition make sure you eat well -- 3 good meals with nutritious snacks in between , to keep your energy levels high . Excellent foods include - <p> Fruit and vegetables and salads <p> Bread , rice and pasta <p> Lean meat and fish <p> Dairy foods , such as milk and yogurt <h> Low birth weight babies born to teenagers <p> This is linked with premature babies -- obviously if babies are born early they have not had as long to grow ! <p> The advice to prevent this happening to your baby , which could result in your baby needing to go to the special care nursery after the birth , is the same as above - <p> Cut out smoking <p> Do n't drink alcohol or take drugs while you are pregnant <p> Eat well <p> Keep fit <p> Keep an eye on your baby 's movements -- they are the best sign of a well baby . If there is any reduction in the number of movements , inform your midwife immediately . Your baby may be in distress . <h> The birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , they will be friendly and informal . <p> Chat with family and friends -- not for horror stories , but for a bit of advice on what worked well for them . <p> Think about who you want with you at the birth . I would really advise you to keep this to a minimum . Mums do not ' labour well ' with an audience . You will feel more relaxed with 1 or 2 supportive , strong people who are going to rub your back and encourage you every step of the way ! <p> Be aware of your options . Most people will advise you to have your baby in hospital , but if you are wanting to birth at home , ask for a fair opinion of how healthy you are in pregnancy and how likely you are to have problems . <p> Many teenagers are resilient and strong and are well through their labour before they come to hospital asking for pain relief . Others are very frightened at the first pains . These are all completely natural reactions . Just keep an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mum in labour you may have a straightforward , normal birth .

##1761251 <h> The first 24 hours after caesarean <p> Caesarean section is now very common in New Zealand -- read about the first 24 hours after Caesarean section and pick up tips to speed your recovery . <h> Caesarean sections today <p> As many as 23% women in New Zealand give birth to their baby by Caesarean section . Some of these are planned in advance , this is called elective ; some are unplanned and are carries out as an emergency during labour . For more information about this operation and what to expect , please follow the links in the articles listed below . <p> All women who have a Caesarean section have undergone major abdominal surgery and as a result have to expect a recovery period while their body heals , strengthens and gradually returns to normal . The majority of childbearing women are strong and healthy and therefore heal remarkably quickly , but it is important to acknowledge the healing process and the resources that your body needs to do this successfully -- whilst also caring for a new baby and possibly a toddler or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have a Caesarean under a spinal or epidural anaesthetic and are therefore awake during the entire operation . When the operation is complete they are totally conscious and able to be cared for in the theatre recovery area with their baby and support person present . Different hospitals around New Zealand follow different procedures at this time , depending upon their resources , but the norm would be for mother and baby to stay together whenever possible , so that breastfeeding can be initiated without delay . At this time you will be nursed by theatre staff , but you may also have your own Lead Maternity Carer present or a hospital midwife , whose role will be to assist you to feed your baby . <p> Here is a bit about what to expect -- <h> Mums <h> Pain relief after Caesarean <p> You may have an infusion of pain relief . Some units use ' Patient Controlled Analgesia ' which , as its name suggests , allows you to control how much of the pain killer you receive . As your anaesthetic wears off you will become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your abdomen . It is advisable to have pain relief sooner , rather than later , or the pain may become harder to control . If you have ' been to sleep ' under general anaesthetic you may feel groggy at this time also . <p> If there are no contra-indications , such as asthma or allergies , you may also have had a diclofenac ( voltarin ) suppository inserted into your rectum in theatre , which will also reduce swelling and provide background pain relief for 8-12 hours . <p> There is no reason for women to suffer pain after an operation . Your recovery will be impeded by pain and complications from reduced mobility may occur.You will have an intravenous drip in one or both arms , ensuring that you are well hydrated and possibly an infusion of syntocinon to keep your uterus well contracted after the operation . <h> Other things to expect in the first 24 hours after a Caesarean section <p> It is not uncommon for women feel nauseous at this time .

Usually this is along your bikini line and is around 10cm long . It will be covered by a dry dressing . <p> Occasionally women have a drain next to the wound , if there is a risk of fluid collecting within the wound . <p> As you will be unable to get up to pass urine you will have a urinary catheter , which is a thin plastic tube inserted into your bladder , through the urethra next to your vaginal opening . This is attached to a bag which collects your urine . It usually stays in for around 24 hours . <p> Your vaginal blood loss will be like a heavy period at this time and the theatre staff will also check that this is normal . <h> Baby care after a Caesarean <p> In the midst of all of this is your new baby , who will usually be very alert after the birth and keen to have the first feed . <p> Immediately after the birth your baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is routine after a Caesarean in some units . <p> Usually your baby will be wrapped and passed to mum or dad for the period after the birth while your wound is being stitched up . Operating theatres can be cold and if mum is not feeling well it can be difficult to keep baby skin to skin and warm in mum 's arms . <p> When the operation is complete you will be taken to a recovery area and at this time you will be assisted to hold your baby and initiate breastfeeding . As babies have an alert period after the birth it is important to feed baby at this time . Follow the links below to learn more about baby 's first breastfeed . <p> The best way to initiate breastfeeding is by placing baby ' skin to skin ' on your abdomen or beside you and allowing natural rooting and sucking reflexes to occur . Once staff are satisfied that your initial recovery is satisfactory and that you are comfortable and pain free , then an unhurried time for you and baby to feed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's colour , alertness and responsiveness at this time , but this should not interfere with your breastfeed . <h> The postnatal ward -- the first 24 hours <p> Most women stay in hospital on average 3 nights after a Caesarean section . That has greatly reduced over the last few years as previously women would have stayed in hospital for a week or more . <p> Once you are ' stable ' ( your blood pressure and pulse are normal , you are pain free and the wound is not bleeding ) you and your baby will be transferred to the ward together . This is usually after a couple of hours . If there are any concerns about the baby , for example if your baby was premature , then the baby may go to the neonatal care unit , to be cared for by specialist nurses and doctors . <p> In most units in New Zealand ' rooming in ' is practised -- the mother and baby are not separated night or day . On the first day you will only be able to move around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Staff will lift your baby and assist you to hold your baby while you feed . But as your anaesthetic wears off you will quickly regain your mobility and by the second day most women are up for a shower and lifting their baby from the cot when they need to feed . <p> A lot of women have a constant infusion of pain relief , which is patient controlled . In some units oral pain relief or regular injections may be offered . It is vital to remain pain free in these early days , or you will be less inclined to move around , which can lead to severe complications : <p> Deep vein thrombosis can occur , where a clot forms in your blood vessel in your leg , due to sluggish blood flow . <p> Chest infections are another complication of poor mobility . <p> Some women require additional medication , for example : <p> Antibiotics if they have an infection or are perceived to be at high risk <p> Anti emetic drugs if they are nauseated <p> Drugs related to an existing medical condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in hospital the ward staff will administer you medication . If it is still required when you go home , they will obtain a script with instructions for you . <p> It is vital to eat and drink well in the early days after a Caesarean section . Initially you will be offered a light diet and once you are eating and drinking normally ( usually by the end of day 1 or the start of day 2 ) your drip will be removed . <p> Normally women do not move their bowels for a few days after childbirth . Meanwhile ensure you eat lots of fruit and fibre and most importantly that you drink a lot of water . Constipation is pretty miserable , especially whilst you still feel bruised and sore , so let your midwife know if you have not moved your bowels by the third day .

##1761252 <h> Breakfast is the most important meal <p> Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and the meal most often skipped . This article explains the importance of breakfast for children and offers information on healthy breakfasts . <p> Adults skip breakfast for a wide range of reasons , including not feeling hungry , lack of time , and a dislike of " breakfast foods " . <p> Establishing the habit of eating breakfast in childhood is very important . A good example should be set by the whole family in order for our kids to develop good habits , just like any other behaviour . ( You ca n't expect your child to develop the breakfast habit if you do n't eat breakfast yourself ) . <p> Have you heard the expression : <p> " Eat breakfast like a king , lunch like a prince , and dinner like a pauper " Adelle Davis <h> Why is breakfast so important ? <p> There are many reasons why we promote breakfast as being the most important meal of the day : <p> Generally there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of this meal comes from the long period without food -- i.e. you are " breaking your fast " from dinner the night before . At this time it is important to refuel your body to kick-start the day . Overnight glucose ( sugar ) stores tend to be depleted and to ensure your energy levels are back on track it is important to eat breakfast . Children need to refuel to help them cope with their energetic day ahead . <p> Studies show that breakfast helps with weight control . Eating breakfast means you are more likely to snack less during the day . Children who do n't eat breakfast may graze during the morning , eating more energy than they need . Also at school they may be more inclined to eat all of their lunch at morning break leaving them with nothing to eat at lunch time , leading to hunger and more snacking after school . <p> It is also a well documented fact that breakfast is important for concentration and mental performance . We all want our children to be able to concentrate and perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breakfast is also one of our three main meals each day . If you skip this meal then you are at higher risk of not getting adequate nutrients from your diet . Breakfast foods typically tend to be a great source of fibre , carbohydrate , and a wide range of vitamins and minerals . <h> Helpful hints to encourage a good breakfast <p> What can you do if your child does n't eat breakfast ? Remember new habits do not always happen overnight , so do n't give up if this is proving difficult . <p> Always make breakfast part of the morning routine -- if you miss it sometimes , then it will not seem important . <p> Avoid distractions -- DO N'T turn on the TV ! <p> If you have the time it may help to sit at the table while your child is eating -- they are less likely to get distracted if they have your company . <p> Some children may need some time between getting up and having breakfast -- do n't rush them straight to the table . It can actually be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to sit and enjoy the meal . <p> Encourage eating something small -- the important thing is to eat something at this time , perhaps a piece of fruit . Once the routine is established it is easier to increase the range or volume of foods eaten . <p> If your child only eats a small amount of food at breakfast they may need an early morning tea -- choose a filling , satisfying food ( such as a small sandwich , a pottle of yoghurt , fruit , crackers and cheese ) rather than something like sweet biscuits . <p> If you are really struggling to get your child to eat before school , try a fruit smoothie or consider giving them something to eat on the way to school , such as an extra sandwich or breakfast bar and a piece of fruit . <h> Breakfast choices <p> Breakfast choices can include a wide range of things . Using foods that are quick and easy to prepare helps with the morning routine -- it also encourages older children to prepare their own breakfast . <h> Breakfast cereals <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to a breakfast cereal , so this becomes a good balanced choice -- <p> the cereal gives some energy in the form of carbohydrate and can also be a source of fibre <p> You can add yoghurt and/or fruit to the cereal as well , to add some natural sweetness . ( Remember sugar does not need to be added , as often the breakfast cereal , yoghurt or fruit has more than enough sugar content already ) . <h> Suitable Breakfast menu choices include : <p> Porridge , weetbix , cornflakes ( whole grain ones are available and suitable for children under 5 ) , fruit bix , rice bubbles , natural muesli ( for over 5 year olds , as the fibre content is too high for younger children ) . <p> Save the sweet cereals such as Coco Pops , Nutragrain or Fruit Loops for treat type choices -- no more than once a week . <h> Bread-based choices at breakfast time <p> Again there is a wide range of choices . If your child does not like the wholemeal or wholegrain options consider using fibre-enhanced white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as margarine or butter , is spread thinly , or avoided entirely . <p> Suitable choices include : <p> Bread , toast , fruit toast , crumpets , bagels , English muffins . <p> Top with a spread of your choice , or consider : <p> chopped or mashed banana , <p> sliced tomato , <p> avocado , <p> liverwurst , or <p> a thin slice of cheese . <h> Fruit for breakfast <p> This can be raw or canned ( look for the ones canned in natural juice to keep sugar levels down ) and do n't forget about the lovely range of frozen berries available all year round from the supermarket . <p> Fruit on its own may not provide very long lasting energy , therefore consider serving it with a breakfast cereal , piece of toast , or with a pottle of yoghurt . <h> Yoghurt <p> This is a great source of calcium and protein . For a quick and easy breakfast turn it into a smoothie with some fresh , frozen or canned fruit added to it . <h> Cooked Breakfast options <p> Great if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fast , economic options include : <p> Baked beans or spaghetti on toast <p> Egg -- scrambled , poached or boiled <p> Creamed corn on toast <p> Pancakes -- can be made ahead of time and heated through ( also available ready-made at the supermarket ) . Top with fruit and yoghurt , or add a little maple syrup for a treat ( no need for extra butter / margarine ) . <h> Do n't forget a drink in the morning <p> Such as milk , water or diluted fruit juice . <p> Enjoy ! <h> Other Useful Articles <p> For some great ideas on refuelling your kids at lunch by filling up those lunch boxes see our Kiwi Families article School Lunches <p> Fiona Boyle 's article on Drinking Fluids reminds us that this 
##1761450 <p> The note of panic in the child 's high-pitched cry had Kymora scrambling to her feet , the half mended shirt falling from her hands to the ground . Her fingertips brushed over the coarse textured , wattle and daub wall of the croft until she found her staff . Sweeping the staff in front of her , she stepped out from the shade into the biting warmth of the afternoon sun . <p> " Evie , over here ! " she called , recognizing the voice . Three strides and the hard sound under the heel of her boot told her she stood in the middle of the pathway among the row of huts lining either side of it . <p> At the edge of her mind , the young shepherdess 's aura flared , brushed hers , but she was too far away for Kymora to read it accurately . The rapid thump of boots on hard packed ground grew louder as they came in her direction . <p> A hollow wooden scraping came from her left , the door to the house being pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air . The odor varied Na'Chi to Na'Chi but the rich base note of the half-human , half-demon race was always the same . <p> " Kymora , what 's wrong ? " <p> She shook her head . " I do n't know , Lisella . " <p> The door creaked and a hand touched her elbow . The half-blood woman 's gesture let her know she was there beside her , a courtesy all the Na'Chi had learned in the weeks she 'd been living with them . <p> " Temple Elect ! They 're killing the flock ! " <p> The child 's aura was a seething mass of darkness edged with the roughness of barely contained terror . Had she been able to see , Kymora had little doubt Evie 's face would have borne a wide-eyed , fearful expression . The ability to read auras compensated for the absence of that sense . <p> She stretched out her hand to the child , tempted to hurry to the girl but the ground was too uneven . Each row of huts had been built half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic but with young children using the pathways as play areas , even the smallest hole or hollow dug by little hands made traversing the thoroughfares hazardous . <p> Such a small thing challenged her independence and left her feeling vulnerable , a sensation she disliked . A lot . There were times , like this , when her blindness left her feeling like she was a child again , learning to cope with her disability when she 'd first lost her sight . For now , it stopped her from rushing to comfort the child . <p> She grunted as the ten-year old barreled into her . Small arms reached around her waist and squeezed tightly . She smoothed a hand over the girl 's trembling body ; the harsh sound of her gasping only reinforced the terror she could feel beneath her hands . <p> " Shh , you 're safe , " she crooned . " Tell me what you saw . " <p> " Rahni and I were watching the fl-flock from the rocks when we s-s-saw men coming over the hill . " The girl shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wince . " They were so qu-quick ... we could n't stop ' em . They started k-killing the bleaters ... " <p> Lisella moved closer . " Geanna and Eyan were the watchers today , " she murmured . " Why did n't they spot them first ? " <p> A cold knot of unease curled in Kymora 's stomach . Na'Chi senses were three times as acute as humans . Disregarding that , the scouts were highly skilled warriors and never derelict in their responsibilities . What had happened to them ? " How many were there , Evie ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , maybe ten . They 're c-coming this way ! " <p> Kymora 's stomach knotted . With the appearance of the Na'Chi in human territory , the myth associated with their rumored existence had been dispelled , shocking many . After five hundred years of war with the Na'Reish many had assumed they were just like the power hungry demons , especially when it became known that they possessed traits similar to their Na'Reish heritage -- particularly the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a physical attack on the Na'Chi ? Surely these renegades had read the missives sent out by the Blade Council explaining that the Na'Chi had received the blessings of the Lady , their deity ? <p> Why would anyone risk censure for breaking the laws of sanctuary by attacking the Na'Chi ? <p> " And Rahni , where 's he ? " Lisella 's soft voice came from down low , as if the Na'Chi woman had crouched to be on eye level with the child , and drew Kymora 's attention back to the present . <p> " He 's gone to warn those gathering berries . " <p> Relief surged through Kymora with that news . The young Na'Chi teenager tended to act first and think later . For him to err on the side of caution meant a large number of men were making their way towards the village . She inhaled a steadying breath , frowned , and then drew in a deeper one . A faint acrid odor stung her nostrils . <p> " Lisella , do you smell smoke ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the side of the house . <p> " Mother of Mercy , I can see it ! " A tremor of anger threaded her voice . " They 're burning the crops ! Evie , find Giron . He 's working in the crafters ' hut . Tell him to find Varian . He 's in the Sharvadan Forest training with the Light Blades . " <p> " Yes , Lisella . " <p> Kymora released the girl and listened to her run off into the village . A hot breeze caressed her face . The odor of smoke grew stronger . <p> " Lisella , the children . " Goosebumps lifted along her arms . Today there were more of them than adults in the village . Would there be enough time for them all to escape ? " They 're going to take longer to get up the mountain path and to the caverns . " <p> Months of work were being destroyed by the flames , and not just with the crops . She 'd been working for weeks to convince the more reluctant members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race accept one another . To establish that bond , she 'd convinced crafters and Light Blade warriors to live with them and share their skills with one another . <p> With the ranks of Light Blade warriors at an all-time low , and the Na'Reish border raids for blood-slaves increasing , the Na'Chi 's expertise was needed . With their own limited numbers they 'd spent the last twenty years learning to hide and ambush the Na'Reish -- techniques the Light Blades needed now . She knew her brother , Kalan , hoped that by having them learn these specialized skills it 'd prove an advantage in any future confrontation with the Na'Reish . <p> She grimaced . This attack would only reinforce the Na'Chi 's fears and misgivings now . The Na'Reish demons outnumbered them all two to one . Humans and Na'Chi needed one another if they were going to survive any conflict with them . <p> The breeze picked up strength . The scent of smoke saturated the air . It took very little to imagine the flames engulfing the houses . <p> Kymora tightened her grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warn everyone . " <p> " Kymora , your brother would n't like you left unguarded . " <p> " The children should be seen to first . " <p> " As leader of the Temple you ca n't risk your safety . " A twinge of guilt raced through Kymora at Lisella 's gentle censure . The Na'Chi 's hand patted her shoulder . " Let 's warn people together . We need to move fast and you 'll do that better with someone beside you . " <p> Kymora grit her teeth . She might be blind , and it would hamper the speed of her escape but it did n't mean she was helpless . Why was Lisella ignoring the fact that she could defend herself , and had done so since her early teens ? While she was a good friend there were times Lisella was as overprotective as some of the other Na'Chi were disdainful of her disability . A trait inherited from their Na'Reish heritage . <p> " We do n't have time to argue . Nor will I need your help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know this is n't just for decoration . Get everyone to the safety of the caverns . I 'll check the houses around here and follow with whomever I find . " <p> " You 're as stubborn as Varian . " While the woman grumbled , she could hear a tolerant smile in Lisella 's voice . " Be careful . You know what he 'll do if you come to harm . " <p> Duty and honor formed the backbone of the Na'Chi warrior-leader ; something she 'd realized from almost the first time they 'd met in the Lady 's Temple and Varian had claimed sanctuary for his people from her . When it came to protecting those under his care he was ruthless , and in the last few months he 'd informed her in no uncertain terms she fell within those boundaries living with them in the rugged foothills overlooking Sacred Lake . She inhaled a steadying breath . <p> " I can take care of myself . " She made a shooing motion . " Go warn the others . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand , Kymora moved as swiftly as she could , calling out as she reached each house , warning those within so they could begin their escape . The scuff of boots along on the pathway and the occasional curt instruction assured her the exodus was progressing . <p> The Na'Chi had spent all their lives hiding from patrols in Na'Reish territory . Escaping detection was their specialty , and achieving it was done in silence . While they 'd enjoyed much more freedom inside human territory , they 'd limited their contact with humans and now were forced to fall back on ingrained survival habits . Something they should n't have to do . Her jaw tightened and her temper flared . It was n't right . <p> A soft sob caught the edge of her hearing . Kymora turned and felt her way along the wall of one house . " Is someone there ? " <p> " Temple Elect ! Everyone 's gone ... " <p> Kymora tried to place the very young voice . " Why did n't you go with them , Tovie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The six-year old Na'Chi boy hiccupped . " Henna did n't wait for me ... " <p> " Search the houses ! Kill any Na'Chi you find ! " <p> The nearby shout drew a whimper from the child and a chill coursed through Kymora . Who were these attackers ? She pulled Tovie closer , her arm tightening around his shoulders , the danger to his life stark and immediate . He had to flee . Now . <p> Stranger 's voices , all men , called to one another . They had n't wasted any time , covering the distance between the crops and the village in just a few minutes . <p> From the hails and chatter , the search seemed methodical , organized , rather than haphazard and random . Not something expected of farmers or townsfolk , more like disciplined warriors . Light Blades . <p> Renegades . Kymora 's pulse leapt . Surely not . If they were Light Blade warriors , how could those sworn to serve the Lady do something like this ? It went against the tenet of protecting the Lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Light Blades were supposed to stand against injustice not instigate it . <p> " The bad men will they hurt me , wo n't they ? " the boy asked , his solemn question too worldly wise for his age . <p> " I wo n't let them . " Kymora found his huddled form and ran a reassuring hand over the side of his face . The wetness of tears coated her fingers . <p> Precious seconds bled away as she tilted her head . The warmth of sunlight hit her right cheek . At this time of day that meant Tovie needed to go right to find the uphill mountain path that would lead him to the others . She prayed the Na'Chi and everyone else had made it to safety without being seen . <p> " Tovie , you need to get to the forest then make your way to the caverns . Keep behind this row of houses and use all the boulders along the edge of the gully to stay out of sight . " <p> " Like Rissa taught us in hidey-go-seek ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Na'Chi children that game . Kymora smiled . " Yes , exactly like that . Ready ? " <p> A small hand gripped hers . " But what about you ? " <p> Her stomach knotted . As tempting as it was , she could n't risk his life by expecting him to help her . There was no way she was going to be able to keep up with the boy , not without both of them being spotted and caught . <p> Pottery shattered nearby , the violent sound seemed too deliberate to have been an accident . Wood splintered , the noise just as startling and shocking . Under her hand Tovie flinched . She hugged the boy tightly . <p> Were the intruders looting or destroying the Na'Chi 's possessions ? Belongings they 'd made by hand with the crafters . Kymora regretted the loss . Hours of painstaking work destroyed in less than a heartbeat . Through the wattle and daub wall of the house next to them someone uttered a curse . <p> " I 'll be all right . When you see Lisella tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she whispered , mouth close to his ear . " Keep low and run ! " <p> The child took off . <p> A small spurt of unease curled in her stomach at her decision to remain behind . Should she stay hidden or reveal herself ? Surely the renegades would be less likely to harm a human than a Na'Chi ? Regardless , Tovie needed time to make his escape . <p> Sweat prickled the sides of her face and under her arms as she fingered the amulet around her neck . The indented circle etched into the middle represented the sun and cycle of life , the wavy beams the symbols of strength , a gift of life the Lady bestowed upon them all . <p> " Mother of Mercy help me stand against the ignorance of hatred , " she murmured and made her way back to the main pathway running through the village . <p> " Faral , have you found any sign of the demons ? " <p> Kymora tightened her grip on her staff . The man was no more than a stone 's throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating he was near the animal enclosure . The gravelly voice was n't one she recognized but then there were thousands of Light Blade warriors and she did n't know them all . <p> A muffled reply in the negative came from a distance . Taking a fortifying breath she tapped her way from the cool shade of the house and used the heat and angle of the sun on her face to guide her down the pathway . <p> " The Na'Chi are all gone . " She mustered all her confidence to keep her voice raised and strong . " These people have been given sanctuary within human territory . You 're breaking the Chosen 's covenant . Who are you ? " <p> A door hit the wall of the house as if someone had flung it open and hasty footsteps scuffed the ground . " Veren ? " Another male voice , higher-pitched . Even without sensing his wavering aura , the tremor in it betrayed the man 's nervousness . " Is she one of them ? " <p> " I 'm Kymora , the Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converged from several directions . Lady 's Breath , how many of them were there ? Surely her title as leader of their religious order would protect her ? She swallowed against a throat suddenly gone dry . " The destruction you 've caused is intolerable . " <p> " The Lady 's Handmaiden ? " The nervous man 's sudden intake of breath came from her left . " Veren , we were n't told there 'd be any humans here ... especially not her ! " <p> The darkness in his tone made her shiver . Kymora opened her mouth to rebuke him . Something struck in the face , hard enough to buckle her knees and send her to the ground . She lost her grip on her staff , heard it land at her feet . <p> Stunned , she sprawled there . Tears burned in her eyes . Small pebbles and debris pricked through the material of her dress but the sting of them poking into her was nothing compared to the pain throbbing in her cheek . It radiated into her jaw , paralyzing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady 's ideology consolidated her suspicion . There was a chance these were Light Blade warriors . <p> Fingers tangled in her hair and jerked her head upwards . She cried out , one hand reaching up to relieve the pressure , the other clawed over hot dirt and rough bladed grass , searching . She found the end of her staff , closed her fingers around it . With a cry , she swung hard . It cracked against something soft and a howl of pain rent the air . She was released . <p> " Lady of Light ! " Veren 's hoarse curse shook with anger . <p> She scrambled away from him . Her boot caught on the hem of her dress , it tore , and she stumbled before righting herself . <p> " You dare attack a Handmaiden ? " Adrenalin gave her strength even though she was n't able to disguise the quaver in her voice . She lifted a shaking hand to her aching jaw . " You swore to serve the Lady by protecting the innocent and those in need , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done here today is wrong ! " <p> " The only thing wrong is allowing those half-bloods to live among us ! " another voice retorted behind her . She swung around . " Councilor Davyn warned us ... " <p> " Shut up , Bennic ... " Veren hissed . <p> So these men were supporters of Davyn ? The ex-Councilor had manipulated others for years , driven insane by his need to avenge his daughter 's death at the hands of the Na'Reish . What twisted , venomous lies had he told them ? Her brother and the Blade Council needed to know about this . <p> " Faral , does your family know you 're a part of this ? Would they approve of you attacking defenseless children ? Of killing those who 've done you no harm ? " she asked . Were they all fanatics or could she count on the support of some of them ? " Are you willing to sacrifice your honor and bring shame to your family by defying the Lady 's will ? The Chosen 's mandate ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's the honor in a leader and priestess who ally themselves with a race who will use us as blood-slaves , " the third man declared , his deep voice rich with righteous anger . <p> Frustration burned through Kymora 's veins at the accusation . Annika 's feeding from Kalan had saved her life after being stabbed by Davyn , his plot to prove she was the animal he assumed her to be thwarted . Despite trying to keep that incident low key , neither Kalan nor the Blade Council had been able to stop gossip . Bless the Lady only a select few knew how the Na'Chi suffered the blood-addiction rather than the usual enslavement of human to demon . She inhaled a calming breath . <p> " The messages you sent out to every town and village ... is it true all Light Blades have demon blood in them ? " Faral 's question held such confusion and uncertainty . His emotions were so tangible his aura throbbed . <p> " The history annals of Chosen Zataan revealed that truth . Copies were sent with the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Lies ! The messages held lies ! " Scorn and derision laced Bennic 's deep voice . " If Light Blades or those with Gifts are supposed to be of demon-get then where are the body markings on our skin ? Why do n't we crave blood ? " <p> Kymora shivered , the stark confirmation of their Light Blade identity established with his words . She turned towards him . " Master Healer Candra believes the traits have weakened over time , or that some never inherited them . " <p> " Dominant traits and inherited features ? Passed on through bloodlines ? You make us sound like livestock , " he hissed . " Our Gifts are Lady -given and have nothing to do with demon blood ! " <p> " Then how do you account for Annika being able to heal and kill with a touch ? " she argued . " Sensing human emotions , connecting with animals , manipulating energies ... the Na'Chi all possess skills as varied and as similar to our own Gifted . " Their auras swirled and contorted with dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the Lady 's words ? She 's accepted them as Her children as much as you or I. " <p> " Veren ? You told us Kalan made up that lie , that the Lady would never utter such blasphemous words . You said Davyn declared the Na'Chi were as dangerous to us as the Na'Reish and had to be killed so our people would no longer be divided ... so the Blade Council could focus on the Na'Reish threat across the border . " Faral 's bewilderment held a hint of anger . " What 's the truth ? " <p> Kymora 's heart pounded on hearing the lies told to Faral . How many other Light Blades had been led astray by Davyn 's deception ? <p> " What does your heart tell you ? " she countered . " Think of your families , your homes . The Council will place sanctions on anyone who supports you because of what 's happened here today , but I can speak on your behalf if someone has misled you . " <p> " Do n't listen to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's trying to divide us . " <p> " The truth , Faral , is that the Na'Chi will turn on us . No alliance will hide their true nature . They 're just like the Na'Reish , " Veren stated . His rasping laughter sent a shiver along her back . " As for the Council placing sanctions on us , you need to bear witness and that 's not going to happen , priestess . " <p> Despite the heat of the sun beating down on her , coldness spread throughout Kymora . Dear Lady , was he going to kill her ? Would the others stand by and watch ? Slowly she repositioned her feet to widen her stance , and brought her staff across her body in a relaxed but ready position . <p> Her heart hammered in her chest . Five was the best she 'd ever managed to defend herself against and then only for a short time . Her breathing quickened . Why had n't she listened to Lisella and accepted her help ? <p> She kept her voice firm and steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it means I 'm not helpless . " <p> Kymora swallowed hard and drew on every shred of strength she possessed , determined to face the impossible . Lady willing , she would survive . She had to . The Blade Council needed to know of the threat to the Na'Chi . <p> " Veren , no ... " <p> " If you ca n't stomach this , Faral , then leave . " Her attacker stepped closer . She sensed others closing in on her . " Let those loyal to the cause deal with this . " <p> Goosebumps prickled over Kymora . The cause ? Davyn 's cause ? The ex-Councilor 's influence was a greater threat than the Blade Council had anticipated . Veren 's use of the term cause suggested more than the few gathered around her . How many others were there committed to seeing the Na'Chi dead and the alliance fail ? <p> " Lady protect Your servant , " she murmured . <p> If Veren believed her blindness made her an easy target , he 'd soon discover just how thorough @ @ @ @ @ @

##1768850 <h> New Zealand Embassy Washington , United States of America <h> Case for a model FTA between the US and NZ <p> Prepared for the US-NZ Council by Dr Fred Bergsten &; Professor Robert Scollay . Institute for International Economics , 1750 Massachusetts Ave , Washington DC . <h> Executive summary <p> There are strong economic , political and trade policy reasons for the early launch of negotiations to devise a free trade agreement ( FTA ) between the United States and New Zealand . Such an agreement would presumably be pursued alongside , or together with , an FTA between the United States and Australia since New Zealand and Australia have had their own FTA for almost twenty years and their economies are by now closely integrated . <p> New Zealand is very small compared with the United States so the economic impact of an FTA would be quite modest for the United States and considerably larger for New Zealand . However , US merchandise exports to New Zealand would rise by about 25 percent and virtually every US sector would benefit . The inclusion of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports would rise by about $3 billion . The adjustment costs for the United States would be minimal : production in the most impacted sector , dairy products , would decline by only 0.5% and any adverse effect on jobs would be very small . <p> The largest gains , especially for the United States would come from the strategic benefits of such an FTA with New Zealand . It would help restart and accelerate the momentum of trade liberalization . It would help induce other trading partners to participate effectively in that renewed liberalization process . It would contribute toward the accomplishment of APEC ? s goals of achieving ? free and open trade and investment in the ( Asia Pacific ) region by 2010 , ? with their important political as well as economic implications . By doing so , it would reduce the risk of polarization of the Asia-Pacific region between competing blocs in East Asia and the Americas , a development that would push the world toward a tripolar configuration that could be extremely dangerous in security as well as economic terms . <p> An FTA with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s innovative and sweeping economic reforms of the past two decades , and thus offer incentives for other countries to do likewise . In addition , the excellent record of New Zealand ? s ( as well as the United States ? ) prior FTAs suggests that such a bilateral pact could develop creative new ideas to pave the way for broader multilateral agreements , in APEC and especially at the World trade Organization , on some of the difficult issues that will be on the agenda for their major upcoming negotiations . <p> There is thus a compelling case for the early launch of negotiations for an FTA between New Zealand and the United States . The government of New Zealand has indicated its strong desire to pursue such a pact . The 
##1768851 <h> New Zealand Embassy Washington , United States of America <h> Five Good Reasons to Support a US-NZ Free Trade Agreement <h> 1 ) It is a natural next step in the US/NZ relationship <p> The close relationship between New Zealand and the United States has been fostered over many years . Our countries share commonbeliefs and interests , as well as democratic values and ideals . <p> New Zealand and the United States have been trading with each other for nearly 200 years . Today the trading relationship is close , extensive , mature and cooperative . <p> New Zealand would like to deepen the relationship by negotiating an FTA with the United States . A high standard agreement would enhance bilateral trade to the benefit of both countries , and it would encourage even stronger links between our business communities . <p> An FTA would continue the close partnership the two countries have long enjoyed in leading world trade liberalization efforts . Both nations work closely in the World Trade Organization , particularly in the current negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda . Regionally , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for the United States <p> A study by the Institute of International Economics has demonstrated that an FTA would bring economic benefits to both the United States and New Zealand . <p> An agreement would offer exciting possibilities for United States companies to expand their trade and investment with New Zealand . <p> An FTA would be an opportunity for United States businesses to make progress towards resolving any trade issues they might be currently experiencing in New Zealand . <h> 3 ) New Zealand has unique strengths <p> New Zealand is an open , innovative and competitive economy . Its people and companies are eager to do business with the United States . New Zealand 's commercial and legal environment is similar to that of the United States , and this strengthens our ability to do business . <p> International trade is essential to New Zealand 's prosperity . The country is a leading advocate for the removal of barriers to international trade and improving the conditions under which trade takes place . <p> New Zealand has world-class achievements and cutting-edge research capabilities in almost every field of endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , the arts , economic reform and leadership of world forums , New Zealand is a key partner for future collaboration . <h> 4 ) It would complement the United States/Australia FTA <p> A United States-New Zealand FTA would be a natural complement and extension to the United States-Australia FTA . It would avoid the risk of harmful trade and investment diversion that could otherwise result from the Australian agreement , given the close integration of the Australian and New Zealand economies . <p> A United States-New Zealand agreement would increase the trading potential of all three countries . An FTA with New Zealand would increase the size of the economy United States businesses have access to under free trade arrangements with Australasia by 16 percent . <h> 5 ) An FTA already enjoys wide support <p> There is strong backing from United States corporations and business organizations , as well as broad bipartisan and bicameral support from Congress for beginning FTA negotiations with New Zealand . <p> A large percentage of 
##1768852 <h> New Zealand Embassy Washington , United States of America <h> The Trans Pacific Agreement <h> Background to the Trans-Pacific Agreement <p> The Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement ( or " Trans-Pacific Agreement " ) is a model free trade agreement . As the first trade agreement with a membership spanning Asia , Oceania and the Americas , the Trans-Pacific Agreement bridges the Asia-Pacific Region . <p> The Trans-Pacific Agreement achieves a benchmark equalled by few bilateral trade agreements in having a commitment by all members to eliminate tariffs on all traded goods , and at the same time adopts a high-quality approach to trade in services and other sectors . US participation reinforces the Trans-Pacific Agreement as a possible pathway to advancing broader Asia-Pacific regional economic integration objectives pioneered by like-minded countries committed to high-standard agreements . These objectives align with the APEC goal of promoting free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region . Membership of the Trans-Pacific Agreement provides an opportunity to support and influence the evolving regional trade and economic architecture . <p> At the same time , New Zealand remains committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in current discussions within APEC on a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific ( FTAAP ) and on a FTA covering the 16 member countries in the East Asia Summit process . These initiatives offer exciting prospects in the longer term , involving greater numbers of countries of the Asia Pacific region . They will also build on the ASEAN/Australia/New Zealand FTA just concluded , and several bilateral FTAs either in force or being explored -- China , Thailand , Singapore , Malaysia , South Korea , India and Japan . <h> US Participation <p> USTR Ambassador Susan Schwab announced in February 2008 that the United States would join negotiations on investment and financial services set to begin in March 2008 among New Zealand , Chile , Singapore and Brunei . These four countries are the signatories and founding members of the Trans-Pacific Agreement , which entered into force for all countries in 2006 . The Agreement 's Investment and Financial Services chapters were left to be negotiated separately , with agreement that negotiations on these chapters would commence within two years . <p> USTR Ambassador Schwab also announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States would begin a detailed exploratory process to determine whether it should participate in the full Trans-Pacific Agreement . <p> Two meetings between Trans-Pacific partners and the US to discuss the Investment and Financial Services ( IFS ) chapters of the Trans-Pacific Agreement were held in the first half of 2008 , the first in Santiago , Chile , and the second hosted by New Zealand . A third round took place in San Francisco in mid-September . <p> On 22 September , the United States , New Zealand , Chile , Singapore and Brunei announced the launch of negotiations for the United States to join the comprehensive Trans-Pacific Agreement . Ministers emphasised the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a vehicle for Asia-Pacific-wide economic integration , indicating that the first round of negotiations between Trans-Pacific partners and the US would be held early in 2009 . <h> Strategic benefits of Trans-Pacific engagement <p> The Asia-Pacific region is a key driver of global economic growth , representing nearly 60% of global GDP and roughly 50% of international trade . The average GDP growth rate in the rapidly growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with the world average of 3.9% . Since 1990 , total goods trade by the Asia-Pacific economies has increased by 300% , while global investment in the region has increased by over 400% . <p> The United States is the world 's largest economy , with over 270 million consumers with a very high average income . The US is New Zealand 's second largest individual export destination , third largest source of imports , and a major source of foreign direct investment and inbound tourism . <p> Significant commercial and strategic benefits will accrue to members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , both in the shorter term through the elimination of trade barriers , and exponentially well into the future through the increased productivity and growth that will result from regional liberalisation . The Trans-Pacific Partnership promotes the APEC goal of free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region . The Trans-Pacific Agreement is one potential way to build towards the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific ( FTAAP ) . <p> Liberalisation of trade through the WTO is New Zealand 's most important international trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that process .

##1772950 <p> Floating around our waters are small microscopic celled plants called phyto plankton ( plant plankton ) which are the base of the ocean 's food chain . Just on the edge of the oceans there grows a much larger macro algae commonly known as seaweeds . <p> Like plants on our land have a purpose to full fill , like sustaining life on earth . These seaweeds possess the ability to use sunlight as fuel to change water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates , the building blocks of life in the sea as well as on land . <p> Not just the ocean around New Zealand but all the worlds oceans are well over several kilometres deep , yet it is the relatively small layer of plant life at the surface that eventually feeds almost all marine animal life . <p> Like land plants , seaweeds need light , nutrients , a place to grow and a reasonable climate . Any or all of these factors can govern their growth and distribution . Sunlight is very Important because the depth limit for seaweed growth is set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very difficult for the sunlight to penetrate . One third of it is usually soaked up by the top metre of water , and there is less than one percent of this light hitting the surface that penetrates to below 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . <p> When you have constant sediment or dirty water these seaweeds may not be able to grow below 15 metres , but in clear subtropical water they can grow much deeper . The deepest growing seaweed in New Zealand waters was found at the depth of more than 70 metres near the Kermadec Islands . <p> There are three major groups of seaweeds , these being red , green and brown . <p> Seaweed Groweth : <p> Seaweeds do not usually grow on sand or soft papa rock because the unstable surface does not provide an adequate hold . Most seaweeds need to attach themselves to a solid surface such as rocks , wharf piles , even boats will do ( some surfaces are not always stationary ) . <p> Seaweeds have no need for roots or internal canals to conduct water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact serve only as an anchor , called the holdfast . <p> Seaweeds simply absorb minerals , nutrients and water directly through their surface tissues from the nutritious sea around them . <p> Sensitiveity : <p> The temperature of the sea has a significant influence on where many seaweeds grow . The most common type of kelp , Ecklonia radiata , for example , is found North of cape Reinga at the Three Kings Islands , down to as far as the Snares , south of Stewart Island . Seaweeds in the southern parts of the country tend to be larger than in the north . Warm sea currents from Australia mixing with cold currents from the south mix and send cool water right up the east coast of the South Island to the Hawkes Bay in the north . <p> Seaweeds get their colour from the pigments they use to gather light for photosynthesis . Like land plants , all seaweeds contain a green colouring matter ( chlorophyll ) contained in the flattend body essential to their growth by photosynthesis . They possess an additional range of pigments to harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because not only is there less light under water , but its spectrum differs considerably from daylight . <p> Sea water absorbs red light the most , then green and finally blue . ( It is the absence of this red light that makes everything look a bluish colour after a couple of metres . <p> Some seaweeds need to be able to survive the constant pounding surf conditions , so they ned to be able to bend with the pressure generated by large waves and then bounce back . The bull kelp stalk is particularly strong and elastic , to cope with these harsh physical forces . Individual plants can survive for up to seven years , but after a while they lose their grasp on the wave battered rocks when their huge holdfast bases are weakened by worms and molluscs that shelter there . Bell kelp fronds torn off in a storm are known to drift for thousands of kilometres , ensuring widespread distribution of the species around the southern oceans . <p> Like many seaweeds , bull kelp is slimy to the touch . This surface helps protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improves the streamlined flow of water over the fronds , helping reduce whiplash and tearing . <p> The largest seaweed that grows around our coasts and maybe around the world is the Macrocystis pyrifera . It can grow faster than bamboo , infact it grows up to half a metre a day . It can reach length of 35 mts ( 115ft ) in only three months , thats about as high as a mature kauri tree . This seaweed does not like exposed waters like bull kelp and is most common the Wairapa coast down to Stewart Island . Large beds of this kelp are found off the north Otago coast , in Foveaux Strait and around the subantartic islands like the Auckland islands . <p> Brown seaweed starts from the soft brown algae fuzz that makes seaside rocks slippery , and include the largest plants found in sea water . One of the most dramatic is bull kelp , It grows on the most rougth exposed coasts in both the North and South Islands . Bull kelp is a massive plant with thick yellow brownish stem though sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 ft long that float on the surface , swirling back and forth with the waves . This species is a classic example of how a seaweed has adapted to living in an extremely stressful environment . Its huge fronds receive maximum light by floating above the surf , using their own internal buoyancy in place of the air bladders found on some other species . Break open a frond and a hollow honeycomb structure is revealed that is tough , flexible yet buoyant . <p> Large brown kelps provide shelterd canopys of the marine habitat , giving shelter , providing surfaces to settle on and holdfasts to burrow under . The most common brown kelp canopys is Ecklonia radiata , a species which grows up to a metre tall . It has a round firm stalk with a cluster of flat fronds on top and lives from the low tide mark down to 15 mts ( 50ft ) . Ecklonia forests are an important habitat for juvenile fish and crayfish , and provide a food source for kina and other gastropods . <p> There are fewer green seaweeds than reds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are able to survive much higher on the shore . <p> The green Sea lettuce , stands out on most shores because of its lime green colour . Thick masses of this type can be found along the shores around Tauranga Harbour . It becomes a nuisance when thick masses wash up on beaches . <p> click to see a larger image <p> There is another species that looks like a carpet of 
##1772951 <p> But in reality there are actually more than 400 different shark species alive today , and they vary considerably in size and appearance . In fact did you know that roughly 50 percent of the shark species are less than a meter long . <p> GENERAL FACTS <p> In fact sharks all around the world come in all shapes and sizes . One of the smallest sharks is called the spined pigmy , this shark is only 150cm or 6 " long when fully grown . <p> The largest shark in the world is called the whale shark , This shark only feeds on plankton but can grow to more than 40 ' long . Sharks are mostly found in the warmer waters , they are large , fierce fish , that usually eat animals . They usually live in the surface waters of the sea . <p> Sharks are versatile , fast swimming , and keen-sensed fish , many species of which are able to hunt and eat nearly all the larger marine animals in both shallow and deep seas.When they swim close to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the water . <p> Sharks usually have five to seven gill slits that lie just behind the head . <p> Sharks have large mouths on the underside of their heads , and may have several rows of sharp teeth in the mouth . These teeth can bite through almost anything . These teeth , which are frequently lost in the flesh of prey , are quickly replaced by other teeth that shift into position to replace the lost ones . <p> Sharks , to a large extent , are scavengers , eating injured fish , carrion , rubbish and other waste from ships , as well as animals such as seals , turtles , birds , whales , crabs , and a wide range of other fish . Some also prey on smaller sharks . They have also been known to attack and eat people ( though this is very rare ) and it is believed that they were mistaken for seal lions part of a sharks diet . <p> The sharks that are considerd the most dangerous to humans would be the great white shark , the hammerhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sharks in general are solitary animals . They typically live and hunt by themselves , joining up with other sharks to form schools only in certain circumstances , such as mating and sometimes feeding . <p> Some camouflaged bottom dwelling sharks blend in with the ocean floor waiting for its prey . When a fish gets close enough the shark opens its mouth wide and swallows the fish whole . <p> Other sharks such as the Great white that hunt bigger animals proceed very cautiously when approaching their prey . Once it has found a potential meal , the shark will circle at some distance sizing up the situation . When it is ready , the shark moves in quickly taking a large bite before the animal knows what 's happening . Often this first attack is sufficient to bring down the prey . <p> As I stated earlier on rare occasions sharks will cooperate together in a hunt . When these sharks hunt for food like seals , they rely on strength in numbers much like a pack of wolves . One large fur seal is too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks circle around a single seal and slowly move in closer and closer . When they get close enough one shark will suddenly attack and the rest will follow . <p> The highly active sharks tend to be shaped like a torpedo , but many less active sharks are smaller and flatter . <p> Sharks have two identical sets of fins on the sides of their body , in the same general position as the main wings and tail wings of a aeroplane . <p> The shark is able position these fins at different angles changing the path of the water moving around them . When the shark tilts a fin up , the water flows so there is greater pressure below the fin than above it . This creates upward lift . Much the same when the shark tilts the fin down , there is greater pressure above the fin than below it . This pushes the shark down . <p> The shark also has between one or two vertical dorsal fins on its back and sometimes a vertical anal fin on its underside . These fins work like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shark keep its balance as it moves through the water and they can be moved from side to side so the shark is able to turn to the left or right . This fin arrangement gives sharks amazing maneuverability . <p> Sharks can also swim very fast and stop suddenly , or make sharp turns in every direction . This is one of the reasons they are such effective hunters . Most of the time they can move more quickly and with greater control than any of their prey . A lot of the time a shark 's prey does n't even know what hit them till it 's too late . <p> Sharks are also very different in their habits and habitats . <p> They are not only found all over the world and at every ocean depth . The larger more active sharks tend to hunt in the surface areas of the ocean , while many of the smaller sharks stay near the ocean bottom . <p> Some sharks swim long distances every day , while others tend to stick to a small area . <p> Sharks also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large prominent scales found in the normal bony fish . Instead they 're covered with smaller scales called ( denticles ) much like sandpaper . These tough , protective denticles are aligned so that they channel water over the shark 's body , minimizing drag due to friction . <p> Sharks breathe like other bony fish by extracting oxygen from water . Most pelagic sharks extract oxygen using ram ventilation . The water enters through the mouth and passes through the gills and is expelled through gill slits behind the head . In bony fish these slits are covered , but in most sharks you can see them clearly . <p> As the water flows through the gill opening , it passes tiny gill filaments . These filaments are covered with microscopic blood vessel capillaries , which have a lower oxygen content than the water around them . This causes oxygen in the water to diffuse ( disperse ) into the shark 's bloodstream , where it is distributed throughout the body . These highly active sharks depend on ram ventilation almost entirely , which means they constantly stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gill pump . This is a set of muscles that suck in water and push it past the gills . This works something like our lungs . This type shark can continuously gather oxygen while it is in a still position . <p> One of the main reasons sharks are such effective predators is their keenly attuned senses . Many people think that Sharks have and use their one and only keen sense of smell . Sharks actually have several acute senses , and that they depend on all of them working together . When you take one away , it significantly restricts the shark 's hunting ability . <p> The shark 's nose and sense of smell is definitely one of its most impressive features . <p> As the shark swims , the water flows through the two nostrils positioned along the sides of the snout . This water enters the nasal passage and moves past folds of skin covered with sensory cells . In some sharks , these sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water . Some sharks eg : The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an large swimming pool . Infact most sharks can detect traces of blood from many miles away . <p> Another amazing thing about a shark 's sense of smell is that it is directional , this is to say that a shark can figure out where a smell is coming from and head in that direction . <p> Another shark sense is the eyes . This eyesight varies from species to species . Sharks that stay and live at the bottom of the ocean have very large eyes that let them see in almost complete darkness . At the same time some less active sharks that stay near the surface do n't have particularly acute eyesight . Almost all sharks have a fairly wide field of view however since their eyes are positioned on each side of the head.The Hammerhead shark is an extreme example of this because it 's eyes actually protrude out from the head . <p> Sharks also have a very acute sense of hearing . Some researchers suggests they can hear low pitch sounds well below the range of human hearing . Sharks may detect and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to listen specifically for distress sounds from wounded prey . <p> Another unique sense organ is the shark 's lateral line . The lateral line is basically a set of tubes just under the shark 's skin . The two main tubes run on both sides of the body , from the shark 's head all the way to its tail . Water flows into these main tubes through pores on the skin 's surface . The insides of the main tubes are lined with hair-like protrusions , which are connected to sensory cells . When something comes near the shark , the water running through the lateral line moves back and forth . This stimulates the sensory cells , alerting the shark to any potential prey or predators in the area . <p> As I stated earlier in this section about the sharks senses . If you took one away it would significantly restrict the shark 's hunting ability . By themselves , none of a shark 's sense organs would be adequate for effective hunting . But the combination of all these senses make the shark a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basking shark that do not have teeth , Sharks are carnivores and these sharks have teeth suited only for eating flesh . The teeth in sharks are very sharp and pointed . <p> Many sharks have combinations of long pointed teeth and wider serrated teeth , so they can hold their prey in place while they cut into it . <p> Other sharks have wide serrated teeth . These teeth act something like a hunting knife biting off large pieces of flesh and easily cut through flesh and bone . <p> In most fish and animals the lower jaw moves , and the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull . In sharks however the upper jaw rests below the skull and can be detached when the shark attacks its prey . This lets the shark thrust its entire mouth forward to grab onto its prey . This is a very unique jaw structure that makes a sharks mouth an especially effective weapons . <p> The sharks teeth are attached to the jaw by soft tissue and they are constantly falling out all the time .

In some sharks , such as the great white , these teeth are arranged in several rows . <p> Sharks only mate occasionally and give birth to a small number of young at a time . These young are called litters , and the individual young called pups ( just like dogs ) Female sharks are extremely particular about choosing a mate , and males may have to contend with tough competition . This helps ensure that the young will be fit and healthy . <p> The birthing process varies from species to species . Some sharks lay eggs in protected areas on the ocean floor . When the young shark is fully developed , it breaks through the tough egg casing and heads out on its own . <p> However most shark species the young shark develop inside the womb and are fully formed at birth like us humans .

##1774752 <h> Our Story <h> 1992 - INNOVATION FROM THE BOOT OF A CAR <p> Scott Unsworth , a former New Zealand age group triathlon champion , had to stop competing due to a chronic back injury . Whilst working as a swim coach , and from his first hand experience in competing in triathlon , Scott realised that the wetsuits used at the time were completely inadequate for swimming . <p> In 1992 Scott started up a company called Performance Speedsuits Ltd , based out of his parent 's house in Auckland , New Zealand . He began to develop his " Speedsuits " , which featured greater flexibility and buoyancy than other existing wetsuits . The business started with Scott selling his Speedsuits from the back of his car at swim meets and triathlon events . <p> The Speedsuits quickly gained a following amongst athletes and the business started to grow . Scott was taking his first steps towards introducing what would become Orca , to the world . <h> 1994 - DESIGNED BY ATHLETES , FOR ATHLETES <p> A young New Zealand triathlete named Hamish Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company that is now Orca . Over the next 13 years Hamish Carter went on to become one of the best known triathletes in the world - culminating in a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens . <p> Hamish is one of a number of athletes that Orca has had a long term relationship with . Orca does not simply supply athletes with their apparel ; it uses their knowledge and expertise during the research and development of new products . <p> Many of Orca 's most innovative new designs and features are the direct result of working with professional athletes - who else could provide the insight into what really works on the race course ? <h> 1995 - AN ORCA EMERGES FROM THE WATER <p> Performance Speedsuits Ltd is re-branded " Orca " after Scott Unsworth discusses potential new names in a chance conversation with a friend . The Orca is a perfect example of natural design . With every inch of its sleek , powerful body minutely attuned to the sea 's rhythms , it roams the world 's oceans as undisputed ruler . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging environments , it 's hard to envisage a better source of inspiration . <p> Scott chose the World Cup Triathlon event in Auckland in 1995 to launch the brand - saturating the course in Orca branding and flying one of the fastest swimmers in triathlon at the time to the event , to ensure an Orca Speedsuit is first out of the water . He also supplied Orca Speedsuits to as many competitors as he could - these bold tactics prove successful , with Orca stamping its mark on the triathlon world . <h> 1996 - BRANCHING OUT FROM WETSUITS <p> Such was the success of Orca 's wetsuit range ; a demand amongst athletes for other sporting apparel quickly grew . By 1996 Orca had developed a range of new products in keeping with the innovation inherent in the heritage of its wetsuits . <p> Athletes were soon running and cycling in Orca gear and the brand 's reputation for innovation and world-leading design continued to gain momentum <h> LATE 90 's - GROWING THE BRAND <p> Through the mid to late 1990s Orca developed its retail capabilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was immediately obvious that it was n't only athletes competing at the highest level who sought out a product that provided a competitive edge . <p> Orca opened its first retail store , close to its base in Auckland , New Zealand . As with its products , the Orca store was design-led , seeking to challenge traditional retail sports outlets . <h> 2000 - 0-60% IN FIVE YEARS <p> In five short years since Orca launched in 1995 the brand had firmly established itself as a favourite amongst the world 's elite triathletes . At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the first to feature triathlon as an official Olympic sport , two thirds of all triathlon competitors wore Orca Speedsuits in the swim leg . <p> An athlete wearing an Orca Speedsuit was the first out of the water , providing the Orca brand with incredible visibility to an international audience of millions . <h> 2001 - DESIGN-LED SUCCESS <p> Orca products are designed and tested on athletes , not computer models . The design , materials and production techniques are always at the cutting edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the business world began to recognise Orca in the early 2000s . <p> 2001 New Zealand 's Best Design Led Business Award 2002 Winner of the University of Otago Small Business Award at the New Zealand Marketing Magazine Awards 2002 Scott Unsworth , Service and Retail category winner in the Ernst &; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Awards 2002 Recipient of an Industry New Zealand Government Grant to assist with product research , development and innovation 2003 Winner of Trade New Zealand Export Award in the Design and Creative category 2002 World 's best products and athletes The growth of the brand beyond wetsuits was evident by the 2002 Commonwealth Games , where eight national triathlon teams wore Orca apparel . Orca signed agreements to supply sporting apparel with major sporting groups such as Bike NZ . In addition , Orca was providing the world 's best products to the top athletes . <h> 2004 - ATHENS - A GLOBAL STAGE <p> In 2004 Orca entrenched itself as an iconic New Zealand brand when it provided apparel for the entire New Zealand Olympic team . A small New Zealand company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whole new group of people . <p> The Orca brand was seen on the medal dais , and in particular long-standing Orca-sponsored athlete Hamish Carter won gold in the triathlon event . <p> The demand for Orca 's competitive edge was such that eight different sporting disciplines at the Olympics competed in Orca gear . <h> 2006 WORLD-FIRST INNOVATION <p> Orca 's track record of innovation in triathlon continued with the introduction of a world-first fabric called KillaSkin . The material was more densely woven , lighter and more water-repellent than any other fabric used in triathlon . In addition , Orca introduced a world-first and exclusive neoprene called AirLite in its Apex 2 wetsuit . AirLite features air cavities within the neoprene , making it lighter , more flexible and 20 percent more buoyant than normal neoprene . In the same year 70 percent of triathletes wore Orca apparel at the Commonwealth Games , including competitors from the New Zealand , Canadian , English and South African teams . <h> 2007 SETTING NEW BENCHMARKS <p> With more than a decade of innovation in triathlon design under its belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a unique " AirRelease " system for wetsuits .

##1778050 <h> Stretching <h> What is Stretching <p> In every day language we talk about moving about after being fixed in one position as " stretching " . This is not the same as stretching in dance where the purpose is to increase the muscle length . <p> Stretching is a sliding elongation of the overlapping protein fibres in the myofilaments resulting in a lengthening of the myofilaments past their current resting length . <p> Muscles stretch . Connective tissue tends not to . If you pull on connective tissue you may end up tearing it . These tears cause permanent damage . <p> Contracted muscles tend to tear rather than stretch . Do not try and stretch a contracted muscle . If muscle is suddenly stretched the reflex is to involuntarily contract . This is why bouncing is harmful . Muscles also contract to maintain stability ? eg when you are standing . This means you can not stretch your hamstrings while standing - the feeling in your legs is your hamstrings " working " not " stretching " . <h> Before you start : <p> Find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideally this means an individual assessment by someone like a sports physio . However , such expertise is sometimes difficult to find or expensive . Other ways are to look at your posture type for clues or try a series of range of motion tests . <p> Find safe and effective ways to stretch each area . <p> Ideally each stretch should be specifically targeted ? avoid complex stretches until you can handle the parts that make up the stretch . For instance , the splits targets nine muscle groups . Using the splits as a primary stretch will just mean the looser bits never get a chance to stretch . <p> Not everyone finds every stretch effective . For instance many stretches assume a certain amount of turnout is available . If you don ? t have it you will not be able to target the required muscle . In this case you will need to find an alternative method or leave this until the underlying problem is addressed . This is where an informed professional is useful for guidance . <p> Avoid unsafe stretches such as toe touching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches that overload other structures ( muscles , joints , ligaments , cartilage ) either by their very nature or because of the configuration of your body . <p> Do not try and stretch a contracted muscle . <p> Learn to do the stretch correctly . For instance many stretches require a neutral pelvis . Doing these stretches without the pelvis correctly aligned may mean no stretch occurs . <p> Be aware that along with increased mobility you may need to increase your stretch and control . For instance if tight back muscles are the only thing that is holding your spine in position ( say , due to damaged ligaments ) , then loosening up 
##1778051 <h> Alpacas <h> A Minority Breed of South American Origin <p> Alpaca ( Photo by Gail Simons ) <p> The Alpaca is the smaller of the two main breeds of domesticated camelids from South America . It exists only in a domesticated state and was bred by the Incas and other " Indian " tribes in the Andes , prior to the sixteenth century Spanish Conquest of that country . <p> Alpaca yarn and knitting ( Trotter/McCulloch photo ) <p> For some years Alpacas were believed to have evolved from the wild Guanaco of South America but recent DNA testing has shown that the Alpaca elvolved from the wild Vicua . ( For details see Origins and Relationships ) . Nevertheless , Alpacas and Llamas can interbreed and produce fertile offspring . <p> Although occasionally eaten , Alpacas were kept mainly for their long , lustrous fleece . They were highly valued and even revered by their owners . Until 1863 they were very difficult to obtain outside their country of origin , with South American governments , especially that of Peru , banning their export . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpacas were first imported into New Zealand in 1865 by the Provincial Government ( in Wellington ) , which found them unproductive and sold them to the Rhodes Brothers at Purau on Banks Peninsula in 1869 . Initially there were five Alpacas at Purau , and although they bred , the total number never exceeded fifteen . One account notes that " they never mixed with the sheep and always stuck to the part of the run where they had been first turned out . They would not work for a dog ; so the shepherds mustered them with stockwhips , like cattle . They were brutes to shear . Their legs had to be tied to stop them kicking and their heads bagged to stop them spitting green slime . The shearers refused to shear them ; so the shepherds ( or probably more often the manager ) had to do them . " This early introduction appears to have died out . Another two that were imported to Oamaru , North Otago , in 1878 , did not breed . <p> In the mid 1980s the New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported direct from South America . This was the start of a new farming venture in New Zealand with hopes for commercial success in the production of camelid fibre . Today there are six to ten thousand Alpacas in this country . ( The entire world population is no more than about two million . ) <p> Alpaca fibre comes in a range of colours ( 22 different shades are recognized ) , and it is used for high quality cloth and textiles as well as being incorporated in hand-knitting yarn . Each animal produces between 3.5 and 6 kilograms of fleece annually . ( See also Suri Alpaca . ) <p> These attractive animals are often highly priced but have some advantages over other farm livestock , especially on smallholdings . They require a low level of care and are easily maintained animals which can survive on grass and water . Unlike sheep , they do not get footrot or flystrike and do not require docking . They defecate in selected areas and their padded hooves are easy on fragile pastures . Alpacas are modified ruminants , not only eating @

##1778750 <p> 1 The Convention Relating To The Status Of Refugees of 28 July 1951 ? in the following : Geneva Convention ( GC ) ? is not immediately valid in Germany . Rather these obligations under international law are converted in national statutes . Refugee status is stated or refused in a recognition procedure . In this procedure it is checked whether the asylum seeker is to be recognised as entitled to asylum pursuant to article 16a para . 1 ( before 1993 : article 16 para . 2 ) of the German Constitution ( Grundgesetz - GG - ) and whether he fulfills the prerequisites of article 51 , para . 1 of the Auslndergesetz ( Foreigner Law ? AuslG ) . Article 16a para . 1 GG provides : " Persons persecuted on political grounds enjoy the right of asylum " . Article 51 para . 1 AuslG provides : " A Foreigner may not be deported to a country , where his threatened because of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . " The legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal consequences of recognition according to article 51 AuslG are different in the detail . <p> 2 It is obvious that article 51 , para . 1 AuslG incorporates article 33 of the Geneva Convention of 1951 in the German law . Against this , article 16a , para . 1 GG does not tie to the wording of the Geneva Convention . However the Bundesverfassungsgericht ( BVerfG ) 1 has decided , that the concept of political persecution must be determined in accordance with the Geneva Convention and thus also presupposes a definite ground of persecution . 2 In most cases this ground is also a ground according to the Convention . <p> 2 . Jurisprudence concerning the Convention ground " membership of a social group " <p> 3 The German jurisprudence on the Convention ground " membership of a particular social group " is very sparse . In numerous cases , in which this question would have been relevant , the courts have held the question irrelevant because the asylum claim failed for other reasons . As to this it must be taken into account that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BVerwG ) 3 which has ruled that the prerequisite for recognition under both article 16a GG and article 51 para 1 AuslG is the constituent fact of " political persecution " . 4 However , political is persecution only where it is to be classed with the state . The persecution has to be classed with the state , if either the state is persecutor itself or if the state accepts the persecution by third parties , because it approves the persecution or it tolerates it for political reasons . <p> 4 Therefore the question of persecution because of membership in a particular social group does not surrender in all countries in which the persecution does not stem from the state and is not tolerated by the state . In addition , political is the persecution only then , if it stands ? in connection with the arrangement of the general order of the living together of people and therefore has a public regard ? . It must be the purpose of the measure to exclude the person affected from the public peace order . <p> 5 However as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the actual or suspected political opinion of the victims of persecution or because of the religion , race or nationality . In other cases , if e.g. the persecution consists of genital mutilation , often the state does not exist ( Somalia ) or the state prohibits the genital mutilation by law , but is not able to enforce the law ( Nigeria ) . The few cases in which the courts do make a statement concerning the question of the social group ground are not illuminating . Mostly , it is only a single sentence without further detailed reasonings in writing . In other cases it is not clear whether the observation concerning the social group Convention ground is part of the leading reasons of the decision . <p> 2.1 Hessischer Verwaltungsgerichtshof ? 13 . Senat <p> 6 In a decision about provisional legal protection the 13th senate of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof ( HessVGH ) 5 has held that the " group of women who are not willing to observe the Islamic clothes regulations " in Iran represents a social group according to the Geneva Convention . 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that persecution . Though the court thinks a political persecution has only then to be suspected , if the Iranian state sees in the rejection of Islamic clothing regulations an expression of a hostile attitude to the regime and therefore wants to inflict the political opponent with the punishment . It is unclear why the court at all subsumes the facts under the " social group " - ground . If it is decisive whether the Iranian state understands the rejection of Islamic clothes regulations as an expression of a political opinion , one can subsume the facts also under the " political opinion " ground . <p> 2.2 Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt/M ? 5 . Kammer <p> 7 The 5th chamber of the Verwaltungsgericht 7 Frankfurt am Main has noted in a decision from the year 1996 that single women in Afghanistan form a social group because single women are without rights and must face at any time maltreatments and rapes. 8 Though the court also states , that Afghanian authorities assume that women who show themselves alone in public hurt the moral code for reason of political opposition . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ( imputed ) political conviction and not because of their membership in a particular social group . <p> 2.3 Verwaltungsgericht Magdeburg <p> 8 Some decisions deal with the topic of genital mutilation of girls . So the Verwaltungsgericht Magdeburg has held that girls and women from Cte d ? Ivoire , who are threatened with genital mutilation , are politically persecuted , because the state tolerates this . 9 But the court says nothing about the question of the relevant Convention ground . It is unclear whether the following sentence touches the question of the Convention ground : ? Persons affected by genital mutilation are degraded to a bare object in disregard of their religious and personal right of self-determination. ? It is unclear , how far a persecution because of religion can be accepted here . It is difficult to see any connection with the religion of the women who are been maltreated . <p> 2.4 Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main ? 9 . Kammer <p> 9 In a verdict of 1999 the 9th chamber of the Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main also affirms the political persecution of women from Cte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However this decision is particularly interesting because the court applies the above described concept of political persecution as persecution by the state only on the right of political asylum in accordance with article 16a GG but not on the right of political asylum in accordance with the Geneva Convention ( article 51 AuslG ) . Therefore it would be expected that the court would deal with the question of the substantial Convention ground in this decision . Unfortunately , this question is not addressed . The court affirms the asylum claim in accordance with the Convention alone because a life-threatening intervention threatens the plaintiff which she can not escape in her own country . <p> 2.5 Verwaltungsgericht Trier <p> 10 Opposite to this jurisprudence the Verwaltungsgericht Trier denies that threatening genital mutilation in Nigeria is relevant persecution but mentions that the " Convention ground of membership of a particular social group " comes into consideration . 11 <p> 11 The 10th senate of the HessVGH has inferred due to the fact that homosexual intercourse and the repetition of other homosexual practices in Iran are punished with death that homosexuals in Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 Also here nearer grounds are missing . <p> 12 The BVerwG has confirmed this decision , but left open the question of the Convention ground . 13 But the court doubted whether the case concerns the Convention ground of social group . Unfortunately , the federal judges did not explain clearly on what these doubts are based . They left the question open , because they have the opinion that in accordance with the German right of political asylum ( articles 16a GG ) a Convention reason is adequate but not necessary . Rather the right of asylum will always be granted in accordance with article 16a GG , if somebody is persecuted because of a personal characteristic which is unalterable for him . This must be a characteristic that is ? with regard to the unalterability ? comparable with that of race or nationality ( or religious belief ) . Because the German right of political asylum would be based on the idea that no state shall have the right to impair a person ? s body , life or liberty because of qualities attaching to her unchangingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of homosexuality is an asylum ground under German asylum law . But the BVerwG does not answer the question whether homosexuality is also an asylum ground under the law of the Geneva Convention . <p> 3 . Literature to the Convention reason " membership of a particular social group " <p> 13 The following section refers to the most important commentaries on the right of political asylum but not to the complete judicial literature . The statements on the question of " membership of a particular social group " in German juridical literature are also very sparse . <p> 3.1 Gnter Renner <p> 14 Only a short note is found in the commentary of Gnter Renner . This author is of the opinion that a social group is what is defined as a social group by the state of persecution . 14 <p> 3.2 Peter Schnbele <p> 15 Peter Schnbele holds the opinion that it is possible to subsume all essential cases under the Convention ground of political opinion . Therefore the Convention ground of membership of a particular social group is not defined or discussed more exactly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hailbronner does not deal with the social group ground in his commentary generally . He mentions it only in connection with the question whether women form a social group in woman specific situations of persecution . He denies that they can because members of a social group seem to him to be only persons ? with the same social background , habits or social status ? . However , woman specific violence can be an instrument of political persecution because of another Convention ground ( race , religion , nationality , political opinion ) . 16 <p> 3.4 Reinhard Marx <p> 17 In greater detail Reinhard Marx deals with this question in context with woman specific persecution . 17 He also holds the opinion , that in the majority of cases of persecution aimed at women it is possible to subsume the case under another Convention ground , so that it does not require the case to be considered on the ground of membership of a social group . Sexual violence against women is used as an instrument of persecution on the grounds of race , nationality or religion . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of their men and sons . History shows that sexual force is a war strategy . Also coercive kidnappings never aimed at women as such , but against Christian or Yezidian women etc . Marx sees problems in cases of female non-conformism against the commandments of the Sharia . Marx primarily has an eye on the situation in Iran . He comes to the conclusion that the disregard of clothes regulations is punished essentially because it is considered as an outer sign of a political conviction which is critical of the regime . Therefore the argument about the appreciation of woman specific persecution is shadow-boxing . Marx does not show any examples of a classification under the " social group " ground . He does not mention the question of genital mutilation in Africa . He seems however to hold the opinion that one can only speak of a social group , if the members of this group see themselves as group , i.e. , if they are connected to each other by a consciousness of a common identity and a common practice . <p> 4 . Summary <p> 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty as to the meaning of the Convention ground of social group . It is therefore attempted if possible to subsume cases under another Convention ground . In cases in which this is not possible the Convention ground of social group is consulted , however without close analysis . Therefore one may state : There is no established interpretation of the Convention ground of social group in Germany . Since most courts are of the opinion that political persecution can only be persecution by the state , no great need exists in Germany to clarify the meaning of the particular social group ground more thoroughly . <p> 5 . Own considerations <p> 19 The different remarks show that one can understand the concept of particular social group in two ways namely according to a ? participant theory ? 18 or according to an ? observer theory ? . 19 In accordance with the participant theory a social group is defined as a common group-consciousness of its members . This interpretation regards the point of view of the participants of the group as important . " Social group " is here understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social group is defined from outside , that is not by its members but by observers of the group . The observers assign persons to a group who show a common characteristic . This interpretation regards the point of view of the observers as important . Substantial observer is the cause of the persecution . " Social group " is here understood as a quantity in the mathematical sense . <p> 20 To be able to decide whether cases like that of genital mutilation come within the Convention ground of social group , one must decide in favor of one of these two interpretations . Provided one follows the participant theory women threatened with genital mutilation in their country of origin , do not constitute any social group . Because these women do not have the consciousness of special attachment . Women who are not circumcised are regarded by their tribe as outsiders who are disdained both by the other women and by the rest of the tribe . They do not have a feeling of identity but rather the feeling of exclusion and separation . From the participant point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women threatened by genital mutilation . <p> 21 From the observer point of view a woman , who still has not been circumcised , is assigned ( by the observer ) the quality of women who show this ? defect ? ( of not being circumcised ) and who therefore are the object of purposeful treatment which consists of damaging them by heavy bodily injury and to mutilate and to handicap them for life . <p> 22 We must ask now which arguments speak in favour of the observer theory and which arguments speak in favour of the participant theory . If we have collected all arguments , we can evaluate and weigh them and get a result . <p> 5.1 Arguments in favour of the observer theory <p> 23 In favour of the observer theory there are certain features of so-called soft law . Pursuant to article 35 of the Convention the Contracting States are obliged to cooperate with the UNHCR . The UNHCR thinks that this cooperation extends also to questions with regard to the determination of refugee status . This opinion has followed the Council of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to the definition of the term " Refugee " in article 1 of the Geneva Convention . 20 The Council describes there the Handbook of the UNHCR as " a valuable aid to Member States in determining refugee status ? . Therefore the point of view of the UNHCR is an important factor . <p> 24 The UNHCR holds the opinion in the Handbook ( para 77 ) that persons with similar background , habits or social position can form a " particular social group " . A group consciousness of the group members does not matter . The UNHCR apparently supports the observer theory . <p> 25 Still more clearly than the UNHCR , the Council of the European Union itself supports the observer theory . Pursuant to article 15 ( article J.5 ) of the Treaty on the European Union the Council adopts " Harmonized Applications " ( HA ) . In HAs the strategy of the Union is to give meaning to the definition . Member states take care that individual state policy stands in harmony with the HA . HAs oblige the governments if necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the HA . However , HAs do not have the quality of immediately binding law . Though they can be helpful in the interpretation of the law . <p> 26 In HA of 3-4-1996 21 the Council has dealt with the refugee concept in article 1 of the Geneva Convention . In point 7.5 it speaks also to the concept of the " social group " . In agreement with the Handbook of the UNHCR ( para 77 ) it is noted here , that persons with similar background , habits and social position are a social group . Therefore this Convention ground partly overlaps with other Convention grounds like those of race , religion or nationality . Then follows an essential statement ? Membership of a social group may simply be attributed to the victimized person or group by the persecutor . In some cases , the social group may not have existed previously but may be determined by the common characteristics of the victimized persons because the persecutor sees them as an obstacle to achieving his aims. ? With that the Council declares itself clearly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participant theory <p> 27 I find two arguments in favour of the participant theory : <p> 1 . The wording of the Convention , particularly the adjective " social " . Sociality means a kind of alliance . If " Social group " would be thought as a bare quantity in the mathematical sense , there would not be any reason for the adjective " social " . The Convention then also simply could have spoken about " membership of a definite group " . <p> 2 . The purpose of the Convention reasons . Apparently not every persecution , that is every threat in life , liberty and other human rights , leads to refugee status . Otherwise the Convention could have done without the enumeration of special grounds of persecution . If one however understands " social group " as a quantity which can be defined by the persecutor , this leads to the conclusion that every persecution falls into the application field of the Convention . If the originator of the persecution persecutes people because they eat bananas or drive Porsche , then bananas eaters and Porsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arguments <p> 28 It would be helpful , if we knew , what the drafters of the Convention thought when they inserted the ground of social group into the Convention . The first draft of the resolution A/RES 429 ( V ) , which was already accepted by the Plenum of the 5th UN General Assembly , did not contain this ground . 22 The General Assembly appointed a meeting of delegates to give further advice . In this meeting Sweden made the suggestion to include membership of a particular social group in the enumeration of the grounds of persecution . The suggestion was agreed to without discussion because all participants at the meeting were of the opinion that it would be without influence on the definition of the term ? refugee ? . It would be interesting to know which reasons Sweden gave for its application . Unfortunately , we have only very sparse information concerning this question . <p> 29 The Swedish representive Sture Petrn , gave only the following short reasoning : ? Such cases ( persons , who might be persecuted owing to their membership of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well to mention them explicitly . ? 23 Before the Swedish representive pointed out , that Sweden was a country of asylum in the past . He continued : ? ... but the fact must be taken in account that its capacity for absorbing large numbers ( of refugees ) was limited and that , particularly in the present serious state of world affairs , considerations of national security must play a certain part . ? <p> 30 It seems to be clear , that the Swedish idea was not , to open refugee status for all kinds of refugees . The limited capacities and the interest of national security demanded a restriction . On the one hand the social group ground should include a definite kind of refugees but on the other hand this ground should not devalue or cancel the limitation to definite grounds of persecution anyway . Nevertheless the official documents about the consultations concerning the draft of the Geneva Convention let the question open : What is meant by membership of a particular social group ? What we can see is that the Swedish delegation did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 31 Unfortunately the internal documents of the Swedish government bring also not so much more clearness . What we know is that the Swedish proposal was motivated by the draft of the national alien act , which was just been drawn with the Geneva Convention simultaneously . 24 Among the Swedish documents concerning the considerations and drafts of the convention as well as the national alien act there is a letter from the Swedish representive Sture Petrn to the minister of foreign affairs dated of 28th June 1951 . In this letter Mr. Petrn wrote that his proposal to introduce the social group ground in the draft of the Convention was motivated by the reason that the definition of the term ? refugee ? in the Convention should be in accordance with the definition in the planned national alien act ( which came in force 1954 ) . The considerations of this later alien act were given in a expertise which was published on 21st Nov. 1951 . In the considerations to the later art . 47 of that alien act is written , that the definition of the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This practice included that the Swedish government gave protection also to such people who were persecuted because of their membership of a particular social group . But unfortunately the Swedish documents of the 50ies seem not to give any example of that what was meant by a particular social group . <p> 32 But what we know is that there is a very close connection between the Swedish proposal and the Swedish national alien law . If we have now a look at the present Swedish alien law , we can discover that the Swedish concept of membership of a particular social group was never based on the observer theory.This result is confirmed by the current Swedish alien act . This statute includes in chapter 3 art . 3 , para 3 25 besides a definition of refugees as people persecuted because of membership of a particular social group a special regulation concerning people who are persecuted because of their homosexuality or because of gender . Such regulations would be superfluous , if these persons were included by the concept of the particular social group . Homosexuals as such are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not define them as members of a social group . The Swedish practice and legislation seem me to show , that the Swedish understanding of a particular social group means a group whose members have a consciousness of their common identity . Therefore the history of the making of the convention speaks for the participant theory . <p> 33 Examples for membership of a particular social group are : aristocratic origin ( memberhip of a aristocratic family ) , membership of a lingual minority or other minorities or membership of an association . Perhaps we can think on associations like trade unions or freemansions . <p> 5.4 Arguments in favour of a modified observer theory <p> 34 However , perhaps we can find a ? middle way ? between the participant theory and the observer theory . Perhaps we can understand the remarks of the UNHCR and the Council of the European Union also according to a " modified observer theory " . In favour of this point of view is the fact that both authorities point out that the Convention ground of social group is able to overlap with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with this , both authorities do not mention the possibility of a coincidence with the Convention ground of political opinion . From this one can perhaps deduce , that the definition of a social group is not arbitrary ; that it must be a characteristic which similarly like race , religion and nationality is not freely selectable or changeable by the person affected ; that it must be a personal characteristic , which attaches to the person affected " without own assistance , so to speak fateful " . This criterion would be identical with the one which regards the BVerwG as relevant for the German right of political asylum pursuant to article 16a GG. 26 <p> 35 In accordance with this criterion Iranian women who refuse to wear the chador and who therefore are persecuted , are not members of a particular social group . However , the women from African countries where genital mutilation is threatened form such a group . The advantage of this interpretation matters in that the Convention grounds keep their restrictive function and are not made irrelevant by the Convention ground of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the modified observer theory demands a new interpretation of the Convention grounds : not as a closed enumeration but as a collection of examples . Perhaps we can notice that the practice of the states has in this respect led to an amendment of the meaning of the Convention grounds . <p> 24 I owe the following information to a report of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which has been sent to me by the Swedish embassy in Berlin with letter of 10-12-2000 . Special thanks to Mr Tommy Lindberg , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Stockholm for this informations and for his effort . <p> In English : The term alien in need of protection otherwise used in this act refers to an alien who in cases other than those referred to in Section 2 has left the country of his nationality because he 1 . has a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , 2. due to an external or internal armed conflict he needs protection or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to his country of origin , or 3. because of his/her sex or homosexuality , he/she has a well-grounded fear of persecution .

##1779352 <p> Virtually every culture has theories concerning the movement of the Earth , the Sun and of the planets . Before the beginnings of modern science nearly all such theories were geocentric in that they put a stationary Earth at the center of the universe with the Sun , Moon and planets moving around the Earth . Given that the Earth people stood on appears to be fixed and unmoving , and that the Sun moves across the sky , it seems obvious that the Earth was not moving and that the Sun and other heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth . <p> The first people who left us with a systematic and detailed description of the behavior of the heavenly bodies were the ancient Greeks . The system was called the Ptolemaic system after the Greek astronomer Ptolemy who lived around 200AD . The Ptolemaic system had the Earth at the center of the universe with the moon , sun , and planets orbiting the earth in circular orbits . Only five planets , not counting the Earth , were known to the ancient Greeks and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as epicycles . Epicycles were circles which planets were considered to move in when orbiting the Earth as shown by the diagram below . <p> The Ptolemaic system required epicycles to explain the irregular movement of the planets which from observations made from Earth , which was moving around the sun , the other planets appeared to periodically change direction . The planets move in accordance with the broken line in circles that are identical to the epicycle around an overall orbit following the approximate line of the deferent . The ancient Greeks considered circles to be a perfect shape and that as everything in the heavens was perfect the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits . <p> The Ptolemaic system with an unmoving Earth at the center of the universe seemed superior to the idea of the Earth and other planets orbiting the Sun as : <p> -common sense-suggested everything moved around the Earth while the idea of the Earth and planets orbiting the Sun is contrary to common sense <p> -awareness of motion-we are not aware of any motion so the Earth appears not to be moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth was moving they would fall to the ground in a different place <p> -stellar parallax-if the Earth was moving , at different times the stars would appear to be in different positions relative to each other-such changes were not observable to the ancient Greeks ( due to insufficiently powerful instruments and the great distance of the stars from Earth ) so it was assumed the Earth was not moving <p> -planetary orbits-with deferents and epicycles the Ptolemaic system was more accurate than simple circular orbits around the Sun <p> The evidence available to the ancient Greeks was very much in favor of the Ptolemaic system with the Earth at the center of the universe . Not surprisingly the suggestion that the Earth orbited the Sun and spun on its axis was not accepted as the evidence was very much against that system . <p> The Ptolemaic system was challenge in the 16th century by the Polish astronomer and mathematician Copernicus . Copernicus proposed that the Sun was at the center of the universe and the Earth and planets orbited the Sun in circular orbits . The apparent movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caused by the movement of the Earth , both spinning on its axis and orbiting the Sun , rather than the movement of the Sun , stars and planets . Copernicus still had to use epicycles to describe the planets orbits . Copernicus 's system did not really get adopted as it did not fit the observations any better than the already well established Ptolemaic system . Kepler using observations made by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brathe came to the conclusion that the Earth and planets orbited the Sun in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one foci of the ellipse . This enabled Kepler to get rid of the epicycles so as to create a simpler system . Kepler system worked , it fitted well with Tycho Brathe 's observations and also with observations that began to be made using the telescope which was invented about 1600 . <p> It was the invention of the telescope that allowed Kepler 's system to be confirmed . All astronomers were able to study the Sun , planets and stars with the telescope and observations were made which matched Kepler 's theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmos with a telescope . He found the Moon was heavily crated , whereas previously it had been believed it was a smooth perfect sphere . He also discovered the moons of Jupiter showing not everything in the cosmos orbited the Earth . Galileo also made observations of the phases of Venus which were consistent with the Copernican theory and were inconsistent with the Ptolemaic theory . The new system which was to replace the Ptolemaic system was completed by Sir Isaac Newton and is normally known as the Newtonian system . Newton 's invention of the law of gravity and his three laws of motion described why the planets and the Earth moved as they did . In particular the first law of motion that a body in motion will continue in motion unless a force acts upon it describes why the Earth keeps turning on its axis and why it and the planets keep orbiting the Sun . Gravity explains what holds the Earth and planets in orbit around the Sun and stops them heading off into outer space while the Earth and planets motion stops gravity causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gravity also explained the old problem of why objects not attached to the Earth , such as clouds and objects thrown into the air moved with the Earth . They were held in place by the Earth 's gravity . Newton 's system was dependent upon the prior invention of calculus , independently invented by both Newton and Leibnitz , which enabled accurate calculations to be made of moving objects such as planets , when the starting position was known . <p> The Newtonian system was confirmed when Uranus was found not to be behaving in accordance with the Newtonian system which lead to the discovery of Neptune . The telescope had lead to the discovery of Uranus , in 1781 by William Herscel , the first planet discovered since ancient times . Observations of Uranus made it clear the planet was not behaving in the way predicted by Newton 's laws . Calculations were made independently by both Urbain Leverrier and John Adams that suggested the gravitational effect of another planet could explain the behavior of Uranus . This lead to the discovery of Neptune in 1846 , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune was taken into account the whole solar system corresponded exactly to Newton 's theory . <p> In the 19th century the development of spectroscopy which enables the identification of elements from the light they reflect revealed that the Sun had the same chemical make up as the stars and that the Sun was just another star . It only appears to be different to people due to the Sun being so much closer to us than the other stars . <p> Newton 's system had been well established for several hundred years when it was discovered , with new and more accurate measurements that the planet Mercury did not move in accordance with Newton 's calculations . In 1905 Einstein published his special theory of relativity which described the universe but did not involve gravity . It dealt mainly with light and how the universe would look to observers traveling close to the speed of light . The special theory of relativity suggested the space occupied by an object would shrink in line with the movement of the object relative to the observer . It also predicted an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed of light and time dilation which involves clocks that are moving running slower than stationary clocks . It also states that no object moving less than the speed of light could accelerate pass the speed of light . The special theory states that all motion is relative to the observer and that an observer not in a state of acceleration ( i.e. in a constant velocity ) can consider themselves at rest and are able to measure motion relative to themselves . The speed of light however was the same for all observers . The special theory of relativity has been confirmed in many experiments for example involving particles accelerated to close to the speed of light in particle accelerators . Special relativity was developed further when Herman Minkowski suggested special relativity meant space and time should be combined and understood as a four dimensional geometry of space-time . <p> The general theory of relativity was published in 1916 and was a development from special relativity in that it deal with accelerations , while special relativity applied only to objects moving at constant speeds and in straight lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity . Einstein provided a set of equations that shows that gravity and acceleration were equal to each other . The mathematics were based on non-Euclidean geometry which dealt with the geometry of curved surfaces and had only been developed in the 19th century . The general theory concerns the interaction of four dimensional space-time and matter . It states that matter produces a curvature in space-time and that all objects including electro-magnetic radiation move in accordance with the curvature of space-time . The curvature of space-time is caused by the presence of massive objects such as the Sun . The planets traveling around the Sun move in accordance with the curvature of space-time caused by the Sun . Due to this general relativity considers the planets move in circular orbits in four dimensional curved space-time rather than in elliptical orbits in three dimensional space as was assumed by the Newtonian system . Gravity according to general relativity is the curvature of space-time , a quite different concept from Newton 's idea of gravity . Newton 's concept of gravity was that everything with mass exerts gravity and the gravitational force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its distance from another object . <p> The calculations involved with general relativity exactly explained the orbit of Mercury which was something that the Newtonian system could not explain . General relativity has been confirmed by some other experiments and observations and is now the generally accepted explanation of the universe . One problem with general relativity was that it assumed the universe must be either contracting or expanding at a time when Einstein and other believed the universe was stable . To solve this problem Einstein invented a mathematical device called the cosmological constant . However in the 1920 's Edwin Hubble discovered the universe was expanding , the galaxies were moving further and further apart and Einstein was able to drop the cosmological constant . Eventually the expanding universe lead to the big bang theory that all the matter in the universe once occupied a single point in space which then exploded scattering matter over the entire universe . <p> The changes in the view of the universe from the Earth centered Ptolemaic system , to the Sun centered Newtonian system to General Relativity were inevitable . Every pre-scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it . It is the obvious and common sense view of the universe to people who could only view the universe with the naked eye . The Ancient Greeks who had a highly sophisticated knowledge of geometry developed with the Ptolemaic system a comprehensive and heavily geometric explanation of the universe that was to survive nearly 1,500 years . It was only to be displaced when a new means of observation , the telescope , became available to produce new information about the universe that was inconsistent with the Ptolemaic system . The Sun centered system had been previously suggested by the Ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus but had not been accepted as the evidence before the invention of the telescope supported the Earth centered view of the universe . When Copernicus proposed a Sun centered universe and Kepler using Tycho Bathe 's observations improved it with the elliptical orbits , the Sun centered system was still not accepted . This is because before the invention of the telescope , there was no way of confirming the correctness of the Sun centered system . Kepler 's system was based on accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until the invention of the telescope there was no way of confirming their accuracy . Without the invention of the telescope Copernicus and Kepler 's system would probably have been rejected in the same way as Aristarchus system had been rejected . It was only when the telescope was used to see : <p> -the phases of Venus which were consistent with the Sun centered system and inconsistent with the Earth centered system <p> -the moons of Jupiter which were inconsistent with the Earth centered system as everything was meant to circle the Earth <p> -imperfections on the Sun and Moon , as the Ptolemaic system considered everything in the heavens to be perfect <p> and Newton 's law of motion and gravity which explained : <p> -why objects thrown in the air dropped straight down <p> -why the planets continued in orbit around the Sun <p> that it became rational to believe in the Sun centered system . The invention of the telescope was dependent upon prior discoveries of the refraction of light as it moves through different mediums , particularly glass and how to manufacture glass of sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the establishment of the Newtonian system . The telescope was to lead to the discovery of Uranus and a combination of telescope and calculus was to led to the discovery of Neptune . <p> Observations inconsistent with the Ptolemaic system caused the abandonment of that system and observations consistent with the Newtonian system lead to the adoption of that system . The same process can be seen with the adoption of general relativity . The orbit of Mercury was inconsistent with the Newtonian system but was perfectly explained by general relativity . General relativity was also confirmed when it was discovered that during a total solar eclipse light passing close to the Sun was deflected by the Sun 's gravitational field to an amount exactly as predicted by general relativity . The initial results of observations of a total solar eclipse in 1919 were somewhat ambiguous but were confirmed by subsequent eclipses . New observations were made either as the results of new instruments such as the telescope or improved instruments revealed Mercury 's orbit failing to conform to the predictions of the Newtonian system . New mathematical systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the universe . As new knowledge became available it would either support the existing explanation of the universe or conflict with that explanation . When new knowledge conflicted with the existing explanation of the universe it would lead to the development of new theories to explain the universe . It was ever increasing knowledge of the universe that lead to the abandonment of the Ptolemaic system and its replacement by the Newtonian system and the abandonment of the Newtonian system and its replacement by general relativity . Each of the three systems was an historical inevitability as the Earth centered Ptolemaic system was the common sense and obvious system for societies dependent upon naked eye observation . The Newtonian system with the Sun at the center of the universe was the inevitable replacement for the Ptolemaic system given the accuracy and power of 17th , 18th , and 19th century telescopes . It was not until the 19th century that it was realized that Mercury did not orbit the Sun in accordance with Newtonian theory . This was because the variation from the expected Newtonian orbit was extremely small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were telescopes capable of discovering the variation . If the variation had been significantly larger then the Newtonian system may well have been replaced by general relativity somewhat earlier and with someone other than Albert Einstein being the inventor of the new system . If telescopes , when invented , were much more powerful and more able to show Mercury and other planets did not orbit the Sun as predicted by Newton then the Newtonian system may not have existed at all . Possibly a system such as general relativity may have directly replaced the Ptolemaic system or maybe there would have been a period of confusion at least until the invention of non-Euclidean geometry . It is the structure of nature that determines the power of telescopes when invented and their rate of improvement is effected by the structure of 
##1783350 <h> The Quintessence of Airhead America <p> Behold , I give you the personification of Airhead America . Everything about this loathsome creature , including what she 's being paid to say and how she says it -- exudes militant moronry , which , when preponderant , spells dictatorship . The Tyranny of the Tawdry via the Despotism of the Demagogue will take hold long before Peikoff 's Goblian theocracy does : <p> Its cute , but it is still from the perspective of a feminist-centric view ; ie Dunham 's add was bad for woman . Who cares ? The add was another example of equating pro-free market ideas with misogyny , racism , hate-mongering , and evil . Dunham 's add was what the Left always does , demonize anyone who disagrees with them as evil monsters . The Left NEVER argues in good faith . That is because it does not want to argue ideas . It wants to ELIMINATE its enemies . Soon that will be by murder . <p> This is what very few Objectivists understand . The Left is moving towards outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dunhams of the world are the Left 's useful idiots . This funny video does not get that . But yeah , its entertaining . <p> Here is an interesting comment from a Conservative blog I read . Its context is that it is commentary on the murder of a NY liberal couple 's beautiful children by the family 's Dominican nanny Yoselyn Ortega . She stabbed them an insane amount of times and left them in a pool of blood in the kitchen and then tried to kill herself . This is the type of brutal crime that is COMMON these days especially from non-whites . Here is the comment . Read it , its insightful . <p> I think Michael Savage 's reaction to this crime is a normal one for a person of age 60 or greater . His generation remembers the time when America was a low crime country . A time when people would come to the aid of their neighbors . I first recognized our country had changed when the black thug Winston Moseley murdered Kitty Genovese in plain sight of her neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contrast to the America of the 19th century . Ordinary citizens would risk their lives fighting criminals . For example , when the Dalton Gang tried to rob two banks in Coffeyville Kansas in 1892 , the citizens of Coffeyville spontaneously grabbed guns and stopped the robbery . I think this spirit is still alive in Israel . A friend of mine spent several years living there , and told me that someone tried to break into a house . The men of the neighborhood instantly ran into the street ( some in their underwear ) with guns and gave chase . When I visited Israel in 1986 , a tour guide told me that in the whole history of modern Israel only one child was murdered ( not including Arab terrorism and war ) . <p> This is in line with Airhead America . Its the consequence of the destruction of all moral standards which is due to the destruction of objectivity which is due to the philosophical legacy which none other than Manny Kant set loose on us . This is post-modernism in action ; Slayer for music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies for " entertainment " , sluts for women , black and Hispanic **34;11213;TOOLONG areas in every major city , whites being routinely killed by non-whites while the New Pravda ( ie the media ) forbid you to ever mention that there is a low level race war going on , government involved in every fucking thing you do , Sharia being enforced by the political elite , etc .. And idiocy being glorified and moral decency being mocked . America , the land of the stupid and the home of the self-loathing . Yeah America ! ! <p> Really , on my darker days I root for the whole fucking thing to collapse . Fuck it , let hundreds of millions die . Then maybe the next time humanity will get it right . If not , then fuck the human race . Maybe we really are little more than stupid fucking apes who can talk . <p> Agreed Richard , although I 'd already converted over almost solely to wine . As much as I love a crafted beer , and I still do have the odd tipple over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , or rather , my Woolworth 's bladder , anymore : 2.00pm to 8.00pm supping beer , means 2.00am to daybreak in the toilet <p> We were drinking a bottle of wine a night , each , so decided we had to get a grip before the booze got a grip on us . For last five weeks , no wine Monday through Thursday , binge ( a bit ) Friday , headache Saturday , bottle of wine Sunday , then the looong nights to Friday again . <p> That explains it . No wine Monday through Thursday . That 's what I call a drinking problem . This requires an intervention . Get a grip , man . Pick yourself up , dust yourself down , and get back on the wagon . See what awful things happen when you succumb to wowserism , of which I refuse to be an enabler . First you must recognise you have a problem . I hope you realise that abstention Monday through Thursday is addictive , and a gateway to far more serious conditions such as Babsism , constipation , Goblianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some younger Republicans appear open to moving in that direction . Republican activist Margaret Hoover , for instance , is calling for the Republican Party to repudiate the religious elements of its agenda and to unite the party platform under the principle of " American Individualism . " <p> We were drinking a bottle of wine a night , each , so decided we had to get a grip before the booze got a grip on us . For last five weeks , no wine Monday through Thursday , binge ( a bit ) Friday , headache Saturday , bottle of wine Sunday , then the looong nights to Friday again . <p> Where did I write off every individual in Russia ? Or even mention music ? <p> My point is , the abominable airhead in this video is the best ( worst ) symbol yet of the fact that the freest country on earth is being dragged down to a Russia-style dictatorship . You diminish the enormity of this . Proselytize about Russia by all means , but do n't use an existing dictatorship as an excuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is the perfect poster-girl for The Filth , who is turning America into the USSA . <p> The plight of the Russian punk airheads is par for the course for Russia , and your pin-up bimbos want an environmentalist tyranny of their own in any event . Meanwhile , Airhead America , riding a Gramsci-ist wave ( while probably thinking Gramsci is a rapper ) , is taking down the greatest , freest nation on earth before our very eyes , and everyone 's in denial . Pointing it out has nothing to do with misogyny : it 's a fact that Airhead America is predominantly female , and the unspeakable *thing* in this video is representative thereof . <p> Back at you my friend . <p> I know for you this partly turns on music , but I 'm going to come back to that . <p> You can not simply write-off every individual in an entire country : ' part of the course for Russia ' . The street protests against Putin there , and the crowds look to be pretty equally mixed between the genders , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge sized crowds any freedom issue can inspire in New Zealand . And these Russians are truly risking every damned thing protesting for their freedom from Russian State tyranny . Indeed , because of the dreadful totalitarian history of that country , thus they know how tangible the risks are , that makes every individual in such a protest , probably braver than every untested Kiwi ( and I certainly include myself in that ) . <p> Regarding Pussy Riot - you see punk , and the red mist comes down And I do n't know what their environmental stance is : I just know that they stood up in an Orthodox Russian Church , specifically because that would shake up the God Theocrats , and used that venue to voice there dissonant dissent - and yes , it was dreadful head-banging , that was their political point - against the chief State Theocrat . The fact that is more than ballsy , is proven by how they now are forced to exist in remote state gulags , enduring extremes of cold , bullying and a life which no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian State is making ) . That is HUGE . <p> Consider what they have done , politically , including drawing the eyes of the world to Putin 's tyranny , compared to what , politically , opera , to take one instance of high culture , has ever done . I love listening to opera , it does add to the height of living and the reason for doing so , but until I see a te Kanawa , a Carreras or even , to turn the screw on musical monomaniacal you , Hayley Westenra , or an equivalent Russian opera star , disabusing themselves of the more normal state fawning and feting , and standing in a Russian church denouncing Putin then I will wo n't accede to your view . If there is art completely enthralled and captured by the Establishment , because it is that Establishment , it is the high art forms such as opera . <p> Name me an operatic freedom advocate ? Not on a symbolic level of showing us the heights and beauty a human being can attain , but one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so important to get the state out of his or her life ? <p> And returning to the women issue again , and this despicable video , well , for every airhead female in the US , I could Google you an airhead male . Luke 's points below on this are perfect . <p> Further , despite the good sense shown by the woman in Marcus 's article reproduced below , let 's look at just how dreadful the two party politics in the US is . Romney has trouble with the female vote : I 'm wholly unsurprised , for its the Republicans Achilles Heel : Bible bashing , conservative christian morons . What option do women voters have there : the socialist who will destroy them philosophically then economically , or the Moron Mormon who wo n't even give them control of their bodies . I do n't see how a freedom loving , libertarian woman in the US can even vote in this US presidential election . I differ from the woman in Marcus 's article because volition over your own body is so important : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand not having civilised euthanasia laws , pointing out we 're more likely to get that from Maryan Street ( good on her ! ) than any bloody National Christ freak . <p> The Contemptible Doug <p> I grew up with four sisters , with whom , despite not managing to get together all that much anymore , I am still close . For the purpose of this argument , we 'll take one out given she 's intellectually handicapped , however , regarding the remaining three , line us up and try and tell us what we believe , or how we would vote , based on gender , and we 'll laugh you out of our house . It would be hard to think of four more different people . At one extreme I have a sister who is an orthodox Christian probably at home in the Russian church , but at the other extreme is a self employed atheist freedom lover , similar , but quite different to me . And in the middle a middle of the road christian , state-suspicious home schooler . Your analysis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now see you 're even into engineering women into your own image , or something equally ludicrous . Well you do n't need to , it 's been done already , it 's called a fuck-doll . It has no brain , I understand is made of plastic or rubber , so ca n't hurt your feelings or ego in anyway , you can simply buy one , probably online , and take it off to Planet Doug , where I wo n't be taking my space ship anywhere near . The only point to your engineering is to remove the ' wo ' from women . And in doing so , you will sheer off beauty and replace it with Doug . So I 'm running ... <p> Footnote about misogyny <p> Quoting Hitch ( Hitch 22 ) , who I 'm assuming was early on bi-sexual , toward solely homosexual from his public schooling : <p> " I find now that I can more or less acquit myself on any charge of having desired Marin Amis carnally . ( My looks by then had in any case declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . ) " <p> That bit in brackets , and he wrote it in brackets , is ' interesting ' on a sub-conscious level . He basically lived his mid to later life in heterosexual relationships and marriages , however , and I ca n't quite put my finger on it , but perhaps for Doug , there is definitely a real ( not joking ) misogyny that attaches itself in a certain strand of homosexual thought . There 's a mechanism or unthinking reflex that is operating , somehow . And I 'll leave it that , because I only read that Hitch chapter this morning , and it threw me a bit , but at the same time reminded me of a thread on SOLO many years ago , where Olivia said a similar thing in a ' debate ' she was having with that flamboyant bloke that used to post here , ca n't remember his name , and I liked him , but he made a point of being camp , but also , unfortunately , racist . He was a gold dealer or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out in his threads . <p> " Angela Shaw does not believe it , but she is in the frontline of a war . The 42-year-old Florida lawyer is in a crucial swing state and thus represents what is emerging as a decisive factor in America 's 2012 election -- the female voters set to determine the race for the White House . <p> As the bitter contest enters its final week , President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck and their campaigners are now doing everything they can to persuade voters that their party would best serve women 's interests . <p> Television ads appeal directly to them ; at campaign stops both Obama and Romney speak about them ; and surrogates from Bill Clinton to Cindy McCain are wheeled out to tout for their support . Yet Obama has seen a strong lead among women almost disappear , making it feasible that they might vote on 6 November to put a Republican back in the Oval Office . <p> That is certainly what Shaw wants to see . " I think Obama has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she said at a campaign stop in the central Florida town of Winter Park , where Romney 's spouse , Ann , was holding a rally . Shaw said she had been largely out of work for the last four years , as had her husband , an estate agent . That , she said , was more than enough to make her want Obama to lose . " If Romney wins , I think there will be an economic uptick . It would be not be overnight , but the economy will be finally moving forward , " she said . <p> That sort of sentiment is a nightmare to the Obama team . For months the Democrats have enjoyed a huge lead among women . It helped them weather much of Romney 's rise after Obama 's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate . <p> Now there are signs that this usually solid bulwark of support is crumbling . A poll last week from AP-GfK had Obama and Romney level among women at 47 points each . Only a month ago the same survey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall national polls has Romney edging into a two-point lead . " Obama must do very well with women voters or not get a second term , " said Professor Robert Watson , an expert in American studies at Lynn University in Florida ... <p> Yet , for all the attention now focused on them , some female voters say the equation is actually simple . They do not like being singled out as a demographic , when they represent the majority of the electorate . Nor do they appreciate such things as abortion being pitched as " women 's issues " that will solely decide their allegiance . <p> " Obama says that Romney has a war on women . I do n't agree with that , " said Shaw . " By saying that , he says that all women are concerned about is birth control and abortion . It demeans us . It says we do n't have a brain , " she said . Shaw says she has other , more pressing concerns when it comes to an election that is now just over a week away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead reflecting the deep and abiding economic woes that still mark the American electorate . " We have n't lost our home , but so many people I have worked with have lost everything , " she said . <p> Doug , please reconcile for us your high disregard for women with your self-declaration as a " lothario . " <p> Apparently sleeping with sluts does not leave you feeling tainted . <p> As others have noted , I find your sweeping negative generalizations about women disturbing . <p> I know I have made wisecracks myself about the differences between the genders in the past , especially on the old SOLOHQ site , but they were intended as good-natured jabs rather than attempts to subjugate women . <p> The harsh truth is that men and women have equal capacities for stupidity and evil or for reason and good . It was a man named Karl Marx who cultivated Communism . It was a man named Adolf Hitler who cultivated Nazism . By contrast , it was a woman named Ayn Rand who cultivated Objectivism . <p> Please do some reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... this is not even that bad . Have n't you seem all the Obama clips I have posted recently , including a black woman who can barely speak in sentences talking about getting her free Obama phone which tells her when to vote . Also Samuel L Jackson yelling " wake the fuck up " and vote for Obama . Compared to those this clip seems positively intellectual . <p> Of course I 've seen the clips you 've posted ( I 'd already seen that scum on Fox ) . You 're missing the point . Those dregs are not part of Obafilth 's campaign . This ad *is* . It 's " not even that bad " ? Jesus ! What was that I said about everyone being in denial ? ? ! ! <p> Though their punk music is dreadful - in this case I think it 's partly their point ... <p> Pussy Riot 's certainly not something you 'd want to stick on the stereo when you come home from a hard day 's work and it 's time to put up your feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Have n't you seem all the Obama clips I have posted recently , including a black woman who can barely speak in sentences talking about getting her free Obama phone which tells her when to vote . Also Samuel L Jackson yelling " wake the fuck up " and vote for Obama . <p> As to the girl .. complete bubblehead .. America is fuxored if that is what is breeding these days .. <p> Yes that is what it is breeding . But the word is that things are n't much different in England or Australia . I think American Feminism along with the Feminism of the Netherlands are the worst in the world . But sadly , America is exporting this shit everywhere . No one is safe . <p> Altruism is all over Dunham 's plea . Altruism is the motivator of all this to be sure . Its the old altruism-egalitarianism one-two punch that the Left wields with such power . And they succeed because of the legacy of Christian altruism but more importantly they succeed because of Kant 's Categorical Imperative which *is* secularized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kant made this Dunham creature possible . And if he were brought back to life today to see what he hath wrought , he would kill himself . <p> As for women , their nature just makes them susceptible to altruism and egalitarianism *and* pro-feminist welfare-statism . Also , their lustful , emotionalist natures make them vulnerable to amoralism ( actually outright evil ) and Machiavellianism . Women are dangerous ; in love and in politics . <p> Now , if Objectivism should get its act together , correct its errors and dominate the culture , it would be interesting to see if it would result in moral , mindful women . I really want to believe that but part of me sees women as hopelessly defective at the population level . There will always be individual exceptions . <p> Really , humanity 's ultimate salvation may not be philosophy but genetic engineering . Women were an evolutionary mistake . Perhaps genetically re-engineering the whole damn species and women in particular may be necessary before any ideal society can be achieved . <p> I think you *are* taking away from Airhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plight of the Russian punk airheads is par for the course for Russia , and your pin-up bimbos want an environmentalist tyranny of their own in any event . Meanwhile , Airhead America , riding a Gramsci-ist wave ( while probably thinking Gramsci is a rapper ) , is taking down the greatest , freest nation on earth before our very eyes , and everyone 's in denial . Pointing it out has nothing to do with misogyny : it 's a fact that Airhead America is predominantly female , and the unspeakable *thing* in this video is representative thereof . But so is The Filth ( male ) on whose behalf she is gyrating and quacking . The same treasonous Filth who is now lying through his teeth in Benghazigate . <p> Though their punk music is dreadful - in this case I think it 's partly their point - but where in your weird world do you place these two brave women from Pussy Riot ? They 've stated categorically they 'll continue their campaign against Putin on getting out of the gulags they 've been carted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that post up ( clicky above ) on SOLO , but getting the pictures here is too hard ) . <p> * The tattoo . I " m stating to wonder if tattoos are inherently nihilistic . I do n't know but there is something about the way that people wear them today . Its as if uglification is their goal . Its part of the war against beauty which is part of the war against standards which is part of the Left 's war against everything which is Kant 's gift to the West . Thanks Immanuel . <p> * Look who she is appealing to : single liberal women ( mostly white ) who are the biggest sluts on this earth . <p> * This is just more evidence that no one under 30 should be given the franchise and possibly under 40 . <p> * It associates voting left with sexual liberty further cementing the hatred by young women for the entire Right . Why ? Because in their minds ( or what passes for minds ) the entire right stands for oppression : oppression of blacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Muslims , oppression of women , etc . <p> I think no greater case can be made for temporarily disenfranchising women than this video .
