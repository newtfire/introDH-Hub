We will initially start with $4 million as seed money , " he pointed out . <p> He was speaking at Lusaka 's Mulungushi International Conference Centre ( MICC ) , when he opened a three-day SMEs workshop organized by the ZDA and Paramount Transitions Limited under the theme : ' Empowering Entrepreneurs beyond 2011 ' recently . <p> A preferential procurement Statutory Instrument will be launched shortly to encourage local businesses to provide more jobs in the country . <p> The MCTI will provide a conducive business environment by ensuring that the fund and preferential procurement instruments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter of 2011 . <p> SMEs play a critical role in Zambia 's economy as they provide 85% of employment in the country . However , entrepreneurs are facing difficulties in accessing finances from banks . <p> On the performance of SMEs in 2010 , Mutati said they have reduced their default levels in repaying loans as opposed to corporate who are now culprits with a high default rate . <p> " The banks should build a relationship with the SMEs in the country in the coming year to ensure that accessibility of finances is easy , " he elaborated . <p> Mutati urged SMEs to learn how to invest in and grow their business as opposed to expanding their capital on wasteful ventures . <p> And ZDA director for micro and small enterprises Windu Matoka said the agency will coordinate the venture capital fund with the 
##3652151 <p> Growing numbers of children in SA are going to private schools -- 50 percent more children were attending these schools in 2009 than in 2000 , the South African Institute of Race Relations said . <p> This could be an indication that parents are losing faith in the public school system , where enrolment grew 1.6 percent over the same period , institute researcher Marius Roodt said . The research documents are to be released next week . <p> In 2009 , there were 11.8 million children in public schools , up from 11.6 million in 2000 , Department of Basic Education statistics show . Department statistics for independent schools in the same period show enrolment increased from 256 283 to 386 098 . <p> Department of Basic Education spokesman Granville Whittle and Free State education department spokesman Howard Ndaba were not available for comment . The institutes 's research is corroborated by research by the Centre for Development and Enterprise ( CDE ) , released last year , that showed " massive " growth in the low-fee private school sector over the past 15 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organic , sociological response to the failure " of SA 's school system . There is widespread acknowledgement that SA 's public school system is in crisis , with at least one study indicating 80 percent of public schools are " dysfunctional " . <p> The number of public school pupils dropped 15 percent in the North West , 14 percent in the Free State , nine percent in Limpopo and five percent in the Eastern Cape , said Mr Roodt . All provinces except KwaZulu- Natal and the Free State saw increases in the number of children attending independent schools , with the growth topping 10 percent in all except the Western Cape ( 6 percent ) . <p> The decline in public and private school attendance in the Free State had researchers scratching their heads because the province has seen a 9.2 percent growth in the population aged 15- 64 over the same period . Institute researcher Tamara Dimant said despite this growth , the Free State 's labour force had increased only 1.6 percent over the period and unemployment had increased 43 percent , from 224 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabine Strassburg said these statistics might be explained in part by the practice of families sending their children elsewhere to school . Nationally , the incidence rate of this in 2007 was 6.3 percent , she said . <p> The Free State sample was too small for any province-specific trends to be drawn from it . Statistics showed a negative population growth rate for the ages 0- 14 in the Free State , which meant the birth rate was lower than the migration and death rates together , Strassburg said . <p> The CDE 's research in six areas of SA showed the proportion of private schools charging an average annual fee of R6500 could be as high as 56 percent , Bernstein said . Other research by the institute showed 55 percent of SA 's public schools were now no-fee schools . The ruling African National Congress 's election manifesto committed it to working towards free and compulsory education for all children , 
##3652152 <p> Recent protests over food prices underline a key message from a new report about the potential dangers of neglecting agricultural research . <p> The ousting of Tunisia 's president last week , and unrest in other nations such as Algeria and Sudan , has many causes -- but rising food prices have been one of the underlying themes . <p> At one level , the problem of food scarcity can be told simply . There are seven billion of us on Earth , of whom probably two billion are underfed . Two billion more people are due to join the planet by 2050 . Food security is not just a huge problem -- some now argue it is the central problem facing humanity . <p> Hunger has a daunting array of causes . These include the scarcity of water and other agricultural inputs ; soil erosion and the spread of salinity ; and the tightening grip of climate change . <p> But one important part of what shapes the story of food and hunger is agricultural research -- or the lack of it . The Green Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat allowing India , for example , to become a net exporter of grain , was a high point in the history of such research . <p> Many feel that a low point has now come , and that we are reaping the harvest of a tragic two decades of neglected agricultural science . This situation needs to be reversed . <p> Hunger 's global reach <p> International reports on food security have been appearing in abundance over the past two months . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 <p> Most recent is a report , ' The Future of Food and Farming : Challenges and choices for global sustainability ' , launched this week by the British government and written by its Foresight think tank , in consultation with researchers from 34 countries from across the developed and developing worlds . <p> The report provides a uniquely broad view of what causes food scarcity , identifying the factors that make up a complex political , social , economic and scientific web . <p> And it includes less obvious causes of hunger , such as the distressing fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted , for example by spoiling through poor storage . <p> It also conveys the sheer scale of the problem , demonstrating that food scarcity will eventually affect us all , even those of us whose bellies are full . Because , as we have seen in Tunisia and elsewhere , hunger leads to civil unrest and migration , and because farming , as it is currently practised , is destroying key resources and emits too much greenhouse gas . <p> Guilty by omission <p> In the sphere of research , many omissions have contributed to hunger . The report points out that existing innovations have not reached many of those who could benefit from them . In Africa , if these alone were implemented , productivity could rise as much as three-fold . <p> But three-fold , in only a few regions , is not enough . <p> New knowledge is essential . Yet for most countries , research into agriculture and fisheries is a low priority , says the report , and studies have now correlated the previous two-decade apathy with today 's slowdown in productivity gains . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking obvious scapegoats for hunger , such as the failure to adopt genetically modified crops , or the politics of food distribution . There is no single cause to rail against , and there is definitely no single solution . <p> And it makes clear that every approach must be harnessed in the quest for a new food system that " needs to change more radically in the coming decades than ever before , including during the Industrial and Green Revolutions " . <p> Investing in research is one of the report 's " key priorities " . It points out that modellers agree that the science and technology yet to be done will be " one of the most critical drivers " of future food supply : " These challenges will require solutions at the limits of human ingenuity and at the forefront of scientific understanding , " it says . <p> A priority for research <p> To achieve the required levels of research investment , says the report , more incentives must be provided for research into public goods that benefit low-income countries . New models of research funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and third sectors should sort out their differences and coordinate better . <p> The question is : can this report , and the others , propel hunger to the top of the political agenda ? Calestous Juma , professor of international development at Harvard University , and author of a recent book on African food production 4 , argues that the crucial step is getting heads of state to wantto solve the problem . <p> But achieving this degree of political will is hard , if only because hunger has the biggest impact on those who are in the weakest position to influence policy . <p> Agriculture , of course , competes for research funding with health , and other pressing problems , some of which have celebrated champions . But the need for research into food supplies supersedes every other need , since successfully producing and distributing food is a precondition for tackling other social problems . <p> Funders must reconsider their priorities . Researchers have a lot of catching up to do . And whatever its political justification , the unrest

##3666252 <h> Wednesday , March 25 , 2009 <p> It seems that even though men think kissing is okay , they looked at it more as a necessary evil to get to the good part .

Avoid bad breath.If you want to ruin a perfect kiss then bad breath is your best possible solution . Now no need to say that you should avoid spicy foods , garlic and onions just before .

Who is Kissable ? <p> Men and women both thought the idea of kissing someone who was clean , had beautifully full and shapely lips , who was attractive , and who possessed a great smile and nice teeth was a " 10 " on the kissable scale . Guys also felt that if a woman seemed open and friendly , she was more likely to be the recipient of a romantically spontaneous kiss than a woman that seemed uptight . <p> Kissing Faq-6 . Who Likes Kissing the Most ? <p> It seems that even though men think kissing is okay , they looked at it more as a necessary evil to get to the good part .

No one will know it 's the first time unless you say so . Try a gentle lip kiss and keep your lips closed . If you open up , you 're inviting a tongue kiss famously known as a french kiss <p> Here are what I believe tobe the top worst seven kissing techniques ever . <p> 1 . The Katrina Kiss . <p> It is a kiss with entirely too much water . Remember Hurricane Katrina ? Yes , just like that . You are drooled on , slobbered on and when the kiss is over , you feel the need for a towel and maybe a shower . Too much saliva everywhere ! Hm ! <p> Tip:If you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drool with lust , try swallowing before you kiss ! <p> 2 . The Iguana Kiss . <p> This is a true case of lizard lips ! Crusty , crunchy and dry . If you run your lips gently across your lovers neck , cheek and lips , they should n't be left with what looks like paper cuts . <p> 3 . The Prozac Kiss or Fast and Furious <p> Fast , furious , darting or high-speed swirling motions of the tongue reminiscent of a washing machine on the rinse cycle . Hm ! Is it too much lust ? <p> 4 . The Cave or Black Hole <p> In this instance your partner 's mouth is open so wide that your tongue meets nothing but air on all sides ! There is no exchange of sensation . It 's like you 're kissing in a wide whole ! <p> 5 . The Dirty Tom <p> Shave or grow the beard . You do n't know what it feels like to have sand papery stubble pierce the skin around your eyes or cheeks ! With half her face scraped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to get up to seek medical treatment than she is to get busy . <p> 6 . Trolling for Tonsils . <p> A little restraint on the depth of the kiss might be in order . If you have a tendency to extend your tongue to its full length in your partners mouth , how do you expect him/her to breathe <p> 7 . The Kiss of Death . <p> Ever kissed someone to be met by a smell of decomposition ? How awful ! Brush your teeth ! Use one of the vast selections of mouthwashes on the market . Get a new toothbrush every 3 months ! Visit your dentist and check for gum disease and cavities , both of which contribute to bad breath . <p> Have you discovered any more worst kissing technique ? Leave us a comment <p> If eyes tell the sectrets of a person , then lips are the informers of our consciousness . Our lips respond to happy thoughts by smiling , they express our deepest emotions with words of love and hope , and kissing is the only way to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on the following tips to make your kissing a fabulous experience . <p> During kissing , just gently press your lips against hers . You can move your lips a bit back and forth against hers or in a small circular motion at your will . When you meet her lips at slight angle , it is the best type of kiss . This gives more opportunities to explore , it feels nicer , and will give you a chance to French kiss if you wish . <p> Keep your eyes closed once you are into the kiss . You might want to keep them open until you have actual lip contact . But when the kiss has started , eyes closed , is the way to go . It can really help you shut out the world and focus only on the kiss . It is generally considered as guys who kiss with their eyes open are usually thinking of something else besides you . If you catch your partner kissing with eyes wide , be careful - he might not be good material . <p> You might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who perpetuate bad kissing styles . Take Tom Cruise Method ( as seen in Top Gun ) , for example , whereby his tongue is already slithering out before he 's met her lips . It is referred to as the Lizard-King Style . Most women do not like the idea of kissing a large snake , which is what this must be similar to . The only response possible is for the woman to open her mouth wide and remain motionless while he finishes his routing , a posture that calls to mind trips to the dentist . <p> About opening your eyes , there is one more view . Some people find to keep open their eyes open to be an impossible task ( like sneezing with your eyes open ) , but while the customary belief is that we must try to block out all other sensations , you may find that kissing with your eyes open is the very much equivalent of making love with the lights on . And if you 're going to be kissing for several hours in a make-out bar , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> How to get him/her to kiss you ? Many times people find themselves nervous sending out mixed signals . You might want him or her to kiss you , but your nervous behavior might be saying " just stay away . " <p> First of all you and your posture should be open . Sit or stand close to the person whom you want to kiss . Face him or him . Look in his or her eyes , not at the ground . Do n't cross your arms or lean away ; or , instead of " kiss me " you 'll be saying " go away ! " <p> Smile is also important . Here is something for women . Get close to him . Do n't fear to hold his/her hands . Ask him to help you remove an earring , or undo the clasp of that gold chain you 're wearing . To do that he 's got to put both hands on your neck . Now turn your head , and look in his eyes , and be quiet . Smile . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll kiss you for sure ! <p> Kissing and sex There is a lot of fun in kissing . Its not like just because you are kissing a guy you have to do anything more . <p> On the other hand , once you 're kissing passionately , you might both feel like going further . <p> I think best way to avoid going further is to kiss him or her in a semi-public place . Theatre is the best place according to me . If you kiss him in a movie theater or on your front porch , sex is not likely to happen right there I hope . <p> On the other hand , if you 're sitting on your bed when your parents are n't home , there 's not really anything to stop you , so it 's something you might want to avoid . <p> The following is a list of kisses you should avoid : <p> You must avoid the Lizard kiss in which your tongue darts in and out of his or her mouth like a reptile probing for something . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which your tongue ventures so far down her throat that it actually begins to choke her . <p> Another is when you operate your tongue much like a swordfish , and use your nose in a blunt and violent manner . <p> The one kiss in which you rarely come up for air . <p> Avoid the freezing condition in which you never change the position , posture , or angle of your head . Its really boring . <p> You seem to emit an awful smell and taste . All she can think of is how to slip you a breath mint . <p> Kissing your lover should be an everyday affair , an expression of your love for him or her . You should not use every kissing session as a prelude to sex . The kiss is the single most intimate display of affection . The kiss is the key that opens the door to both her heart , and her body . It has been found that most women based their decision of whether they would sleep with a man , on his kissing abilities ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Quest <p> Most men if given a chance to kiss a woman thinks while kissing that when can we get to step two ? And three and four ? Is she aroused yet ? Can I put my hand on her breast now ? A man sees kissing as the next step on a quest . Many men take kissing as a step to get down to the good stuff . As a result , they rush through the kissing and do not get to fully enjoy the delightfulness of a long , passionate , kiss . <p> The Kiss Should Not Be a Step but a Destination In Itself <p> Actually the kiss is not a step , it is the the destination itself . A man kisses a woman like he will never do anything else with this woman , as if he never wants to do anything else with this woman . But this is when the woman decides there will be other activities on the agenda . <p> Kissing- Keep It Simple and Sexy <p> You want to be a great kisser ? Then keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly kiss . Instead , indulge yourself in a simple , sexy and intimate kiss . Rid your mind of any kissing performance thoughts , and instead , realize that she 's opening the door to her soul and body . Enjoy the moment ! <p> Kissing Says Something Words Ca n't <p> If the eyes tell the secrets of a person , then lips are the informers of our consciousness . Our lips respond to happy thoughts by smiling , they express our deepest emotions with words of love and hope , and kissing is the only way to say something that words ca n't . <p> The First Kiss ? <p> A first kiss ! ! It should always be done while the two of you are alone . ( Do I need to tell that ? ) This will help to avoid any unnecessary nervousness and embarrassing situations . The best type of kiss is one that uses different variations ... such as starting with a small kiss , working into a French kiss , maybe sucking on your partner 's upper or lower lip ... <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole face . This can be very seductive and romantic . <p> Kissing is an Art Form <p> Kissing is an art form . The kissing experience is different for each of us.The first step to kissing is known as finding her comfort level . Make sure she is ready for a kiss and do not start anything until she is comfortable . <p> Give a Memorable Kiss <p> The best kisses are those that are memorable , but leave you pantingly wanting more . The language of a kiss is communication without words . At various times you want to communicate attraction , affection , love , passion , lust , and I 'll miss you , baby . Pay attention to what your mate responds to , and what seems to turn him or her off , then adjust your techniques accordingly . <p> If you are a bad kisser , what a woman will never , ever say to you she was going to have s*x with you until just that moment . This is one of the ways in which men and women differ . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a bad kisser and if he is presented with the opportunity , he 'll probably have s*x with her anyway . A woman ca n't get past a bad kiss . After all , if he has n't mastered kissing and fails to see its sensual possibilities , what hope is there for anything else ? <p> After you 've kissed him/her once , you know he/she wants to kiss you . But what if you two have never kissed ? The first kiss is the hardest . <p> Couples should not limit kissing merely to times like making out , or as the conclusion to a date or a prelude to something more . Kissing your lover should be an everyday affair , an expression of your love for her . You should not use every kissing session as a prelude to s*x . <p> Good and Bad Kissing <p> If you are a bad kisser , what a woman will never , ever say to you she was going to have s*x with you until just that moment . This is one of the ways in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted to a woman but discovers she 's a bad kisser and if he is presented with the opportunity , he 'll probably have s*x with her anyway . A woman ca n't get past a bad kiss . After all , if he has n't mastered kissing and fails to see its sensual possibilities , what hope is there for anything else ? <p> Kissing Techniques <p> The secret to being a great kisser is to keep it simple and sexy . Forget about impressing her with that Casanovian kiss . Instead , indulge yourself in a simple , sexy and intimate kiss . Rid your mind of any kissing performance thoughts , and instead , realize that she 's opening the door to her soul and body . Enjoy the moment ! <p> You could ask him/her to kiss you , but that takes a lot of courage . But you can tell , without reading his mind . Here are some ways . He could have worked on the science project with someone else , but he asked you . He could have called somebody else to chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have sat anywhere in the cafeteria , but he sat next to you . It all means he likes to hang out with you . <p> And what about when you 're with him . Does he sit close to you ? Does he smile and look happy when you 're together ? These are all signs that he likes you and might want to kiss you . <p> Dos and Don'ts for Kissing <p> 1 . Do n't drool all over her mouth while kissing . Women do n't like wet or sloppy kisses . <p> 2 . Do n't keep your lips stiff and rigid . You 've got to keep your lips soft and sensuous . She needs to be able to feel your lips . <p> 3 . Do n't keep your lips closed . Open your lips ! Women do n't enjoy kissing just a slit on a guys face . If you do n't know how to kiss properly , try to practice on the back of your hand . Pretend that you are kissing a hot &; sexy beautiful woman that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice kissing yourself on the mirror . In short , if you really want to succeed with single women in the love and romance department , you must be a good kisser . <p> A great kiss should always be when you 're alone with her . A movie theatre is a good place because it 's dark and people wo n't be paying attention . Try to sit near the back , though , for privacy . But I do believe that a first kiss should be the good-bye kiss . When you 're dropping her off at her place or saying good-bye from seeing one another until the next time , ask her if it 's okay if you kiss her . It 's not childish or geeky to ask a woman that . It 's respectful and kind . <p> Daniel Day-Lewis belongs in the kissing hall of fame for Best Use of Hands . He gently caresses his costar 's face and touches her hair , a model of how hands can increase the erotic pleasure of the moment . <p> Bear in mind the hands should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to clamp her head into one uncomfortable position . Remember most women like men to toy gently with their hair . After decades of bad press about sticky hairsprays and helmet hair , most of us have been using products to enhance " touch ability " and are favoring hairstyles that look good a bit tousled . So go ahead and touch hair . And quit using all that sticky hairspray and goo so we can go back to touching yours . <p> Keep in mind that using your tongue is not required for kissing ... if you are not experienced , save the French kissing ( kissing using your tongue ) for later . Lots of the greatest kisses are all about the lips . When you are comfortable kissing your partner , experiment with different ways to taste and nuzzle his lips .

##3837450 <p> MTN Group has scored yet another major feat in telecoms when it announced yesterday that its $90m ( R602m ) investment in the West Africa Cable System ( Wacs ) will land in the Western Cape later this month . <p> The telecoms giant said the 14,000km submarine cable will land at Yzerfontein in the Western Cape . <p> Karel Pienaar , MTN South Africa 's MD , lauded the cable , saying it will be a catalyst to economic development . <p> " Wacs will provide millions of MTN subscribers across Africa with much-needed bandwidth and will go a long way towards catapulting Africa into the digital age . <p> " Lack of bandwidth on the continent has arrested the development of Africa and has constrained the continent from achieving its full potential , " Pienaar said . <p> The Wacs submarine cable is an ultra high capacity fibre optic submarine cable system that links southern Africa and Europe , spanning the west coast of Africa and terminating in London , UK . <p> This $650m ( R4.3bn ) cable system is the biggest to ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations that anchor along the western coast of Africa , including countries where MTN has operations such as Republic of Congo , Cameroon , Nigeria , Ghana and Ivory Coast . <p> The pan-African telecoms giant , as the single biggest investor in Wacs , MTN will receive an initial capacity of 11% when the cable becomes commercially available in the second quarter of this year . <p> Pienaar explained that as a multinational corporation with a strong presence in 16 African countries , MTN 's multi-million rand investments in undersea cables is also underpinned by the critical role that telephony has played in contributing meaningfully to gross domestic product ( GDP ) and alleviating poverty . <p> This massive $90m investment Wacs is an addition to other cables where the operator has invested . <p> MTN has made a cash injection of $50m ( R334m ) in Europe India Gateway , the submarine cable that connects Europe and India , and another $40.3m ( R269.5m ) in the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System ( Eassy ) , which is an undersea fibre optic cable system connecting countries of eastern Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also poured $10m ( R66.8m ) in SAT-3/SAFE linking Portugal and Spain to South Africa , with connections to several West African countries along the route . <p> The MTN boss said the low broadband penetration on the continent has acted as motivation for the investment . According to International Telecommunications Union mobile penetration in Africa is the lowest worldwide at 41% , and Africa still lags behind when it comes to fixed broadband . <p> " Although subscriptions are increasing , a penetration rate of less than 1% illustrates the challenges that persist in increasing access to high-speed , high-capacity internet . <p> " We believe these investments MTN have made will afford subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond the ability to be part 
##3839451 <p> Liverpool were condemned to their worst start to a season for half a century as Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla gave Arsenal victory at Anfield . <p> On what would have been Bill Shankly 's 99th birthday , the Reds equalled the record of his newly-promoted side in 1962-63 by collecting just one point from their opening three games . <p> Coming on the back of Friday 's deadline-day transfer debacle , when they failed to secure a replacement for Andy Carroll who had joined West Ham 24 hours earlier , the situation has provided huge cause for concern on Merseyside , with both owner John Henry and manager Brendan Rodgers in the firing line . <p> have been in the same position had Arsenal lost . <p> However , with Cazorla capping an excellent display by profiting from a Jose Reina blunder after summer recruit Podolski had opened their account for the season before half-time , the Gunners chief can start looking forward with confidence . <p> A summer of optimism has given way to a sobering reality at Anfield . <p> Henry did spend big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suarez of those expensive purchases started against Arsenal , the wisdom of Dalglish 's work has to be questioned . <p> So much now rests on Suarez and for the first half at least , he almost seemed to be trying too hard . <p> Fabio Borini and Raheem Sterling had Liverpool 's best chances before the break . <p> The latter continues to catch the eye and his excellent turn onto Steven Gerrard 's knockdown created the half-chance he belted against the outside of a post . <p> That worrying statistic of potentially becoming the first side to start the season with three successive scoreless games hung heavy for a while . <p> But after Cazorla 's shot had been saved by Reina , the Spain midfielder was instrumental in Arsenal breaking their duck for the campaign . <p> A wayward Gerrard pass allowed Thomas Vermaelen to set up a break from the edge of his own box . Podolski fed Cazorla , then kept motoring . By the time Cazorla was in a position to play the killer pass , Podolski had arrived in support and the German drilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have doubled their advantage almost immediately . <p> Diaby 's surging run out of his own half was reminiscent of Patrick Vieira in his pomp . He released Olivier Giroud inside the Liverpool box , but the finish was poor and Reina watched it fly wide . <p> Liverpool emerged with more purpose after the break , and once Stewart Downing was introduced they had more penetration too . <p> The winger had a shot deflected wide by Vermaelen not long after Per Mertesacker , who had been booked very early on , had sent Suarez to the deck with a
