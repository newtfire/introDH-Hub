Get started now . <h> South Africa : ' The Soil ' Spreading Across The World <p> By Apex on October 18 , 2012 <p> Acapella singing sensation The Soil has taken root in SA -- and is now set to charm international audiences with their distinctive brand of ' kasi soul ' . <p> They refer to their sound as " melodic medication " -- harmonies that are good for mind , body and spirit . And it seems The Soil 's unique sound is having the desired effect , with the acapella group racking up growing recognition locally and abroad , including two Ovation awards at the Grahamstown Festival ; securing a 2-minute spot for their track ' Sedilaka ' in a Halle Berry film ; and achieving gold sales status for The Deluxe Edition of their self-titled debut album . <p> But success did n't take root overnight for the singing sensation from Soweto . " It took seven years of working at it before we got our big break , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our turning point came when Sipho Sithole -- our friend , ' father ' and mentor -- offered us a deal live on air during a radio interview . " <p> So in joint venture with Sony Music , the group signed with Native Rhythms , having blown away Sithole with their ability to connect with audiences during their performances . <p> " Our music comes from a sacred place . It 's pure and meant to be for people 's souls , to given them goose bumps because it 's something they can relate to , " says Ntsika . " That 's why we refer to it as ' kasi soul ' ... " . <p> And " coming from the kasi " has been a definite influence on both their sound and what the group chooses to sing about . " This whole sound came from high school where we did n't have instruments , so we had to make our own harmony , " shares Buhlebendalo Mda , aka Buhle , the only female of the group . <p> She adds : " Where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids we once jammed with are stealing and begging to feed their addiction ... It 's social issues like these that are close to our hearts , and something we try talk about through our music . " <p> Inspired by their musical heroes , the likes of Miriam Makeba , Ladysmith Mambazo and Simphiwe Dana , The Soil say they also strive to share positive and powerful messages though their songs . " Take Simphiwe Dana , " says Buhle , " I like how she tackles politics , creates awareness and shows that everything is not always rosy in our country ; she shows the real deal through the stories she tells through her songs , which help to heal at the same time . " <p> But it 's not just local musicians that inspire the young group . In fact , if they could travel anywhere in the world , it would be to the UK to meet some of their international influences : Duffy , Coldplay and The Script . " We also relate a lot to the soul sound of Amy Winehouse , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still at school . <p> Their greatest influence , however , remains their family and the community where they grew up . " Where we come from -- Meadowlands , Zones , 4 , 6 and 10 -- we used to sing and play music all the time , at home and at Church , " says Luphindo Ngxanga , aka Master P , brother of Ntsika and the so-called ' humanitarian ' of the group who likes to keep everyone happy . <p> " In African homes , the elders sometimes get you to sing songs -- and this can turn into a type of competition to see who sings the best , " adds Buhle . It 's also family who have always been the group 's number-one fans . " Yoh ! They love us ... Our mothers brag everywhere , " she laughs . " They supported us from day one and kept us going and still support us ! " <p> And while Buhle admits it can sometimes be overwhelming being in the public eye , she says it 's also a dream come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone , and that you are making your mark . Most importantly , it means people are liking our way of praising God -- the first member of our group . " <p> With a new year round the corner , the group is looking forward to gaining new fans overseas with their unique style of rhythmic vocal bass lines and constant beatboxing , starting off with a trip to New York scheduled for early 2013 . <p> " One of the reasons we called our group ' The Soil ' is because the soil is basic and raw , just like the acapella we sing and never went to school for , " says Ntsika . " Another reason is that it covers a lot of ground , just like we want to do . Our goal is to share our

##3628452 <p> Diego Milito opened the scoring from the penalty spot before strike partner Antonio Cassano doubled the Nerazzurri 's advantage on 34 minutes . <p> Romulo netted just before the break to drag the Viola back into the game but Gonzalo Rodriguez 's dismissal for a second bookable offence on the hour mark ended the visitors ' hopes of denying Inter a first home win of the season . <p> Andrea Stramaccioni sent out the same three-man backline that served him well against Chievo earlier during the week , the Nerazzurri ' s formation mirroring the 3-5-2 sent out by their visitors . <p> Philippe Coutinho , handed a rare start in place of regular playmaker Wesley Sneijder , really relished his chance to shine early on , some promising link-up play down the left with Yuto Nagatomo allowing the Brazilian to deliver Inter 's first ball of the night into the Viola box , only for Facundo Roncaglia to intervene and clear . <p> Cassano also began brightly , bombing down the left flank to create an opening for Coutinho , although Rodriguez stood strong in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero to villain shortly after , though , as a cross from compatriot Javier Zanetti came off the Argentine defender 's arm , leaving referee Antonio Giannoccaro ? with no choice but to point to the spot . <p> Evergreen striker Milito stepped up to bury the ball into the bottom left corner of the net with aplomb , sparking wild celebrations from Zanetti and Co in the 17th minute . The goal visibly eased the home side 's nerves , as Inter began looking increasingly likely to seize on the mistakes made by Fiorentina 's creaking defence . <p> Viola talisman Stevan Jovetic kept opposing custodian Samir Handanovic on his toes with a free kick that came off the post in the 21st minute but , for the most part , it was one-way traffic in the direction of the Fiorentina goal , which was summed up by Milito conspiring to miss not one , but two , easy chances to double his team 's lead . <p> The 33-year-old flicked a searching Cassano pass over the head of Roncaglia only to volley against the crossbar , then had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the imposing Emiliano Viviano , after being slipped through one-on-one by his strike partner . <p> Cassano ensured his team-mates would not have to wait long for a second goal , though , as his 90th Serie A strike , and fourth in his five Nerazzurri appearances , sparked emphatic cheers from onlooking spectators . A beautifully-executed dummy from midfield lynchpin Esteban Cambiasso allowed the ball to roll across to the Barese , who made no mistake by wrong-footing Viviano from close range . <p> A fine header from Romulo in the 41st minute , after a David Pizzaro cross , proved scant distraction from the fact the season 's surprise package so far had been comprehensively outplayed in the opening half . Consequently , Montella elected to introduce Matias Fernandez in place of the ineffective Adem Ljajic . <p> The substitution appeared to galvanise the visitors , as they controlled the opening minutes of the second period . However , a silly second booking on the part of Rodriguez , for a clumsy challenge on Nagatomo , undid all of the visitors ' good work . <p> Milito missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six yards out , as Inter began shoring up their lead with the introduction of workhorse Gaby Mudingayi . As Fiorentina started to run out of steam following the sending-off , the match slowed to walking pace , with Inter reluctant to take any risks going forward , and their opponents unable to summon up the energy for a grandstand finish . <p> Consequently , the hosts were able to coast to a victory that lifts them to third , just four points behind 
##3632750 <h> Advertisement <h> Junior nurses and midwives threaten nationwide strike <p> The Junior Nurses and Midwives Group is on the verge of embarking on nationwide strike if its demand for improved conditions of service is not met by next week . <p> According to the group , they are still on a student allowance ( GH290 monthly ) since they graduated from school in 2010 instead of taking regular salary from the Ghana Health Service . <p> Members of the group said they had explored every avenue for redress but their efforts had not been fruitful . They are giving government one week to address their plight , failure of which would lead to a demonstration and subsequently , a general strike . <p> At a news conference in Accra Thursday , Courage Kwame-Kumah , National Coordinator of the group said that Diploma 10 and 11 groups were the most affected . <p> He said attempts to halt what he called the " backdating of appointments of junior nurses ' was the root cause of the issue . <p> " The attempt by the government not to backdate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invariably the Diploma II by putting the latter on a phantom internship allowance with which case they have been denied the right to remuneration as diploma nurses and midwives will not be tolerated " , he said . <p> He said attempts to fight for what was due them started as far back as 2011 resulting in a strike action adding that " after several calls from the good people of Ghana and promises from the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) , we were forced to call of the strike action on October 14 , 2011 hoping our demands would met but unfortunately , exactly a year down the line , it has been a total disregard and insult to the junior nurses and midwives . " <p> " How does anybody expect us to live on GH290 monthly and survive " ? Those or us in the cities for instance have had to find our own accommodation , fees , transport , food and clothing , " he complained . <p> Mr. Kwame-Kumah said further currently the core of work in state health facilities was being handled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were in management positions . <p> " I can state on authority that our condition of service is not the best as they want everybody to believe . We are still not on payroll two years after graduating from school and nobody is listening to us . " <p> Another issue the group complained about is the mandatory national service which they said was destroying smooth integration of new professionals into the health system . <p> They cited irregularities in national service postings where graduands who volunteered to service in rural areas were posted to Accra . <p> " In the postings for instance 10 of our colleagues volunteered to service in health facilities in the Krachi district but when the postings came out only two were sent there . The rest had been assigned to serve in Accra . " <p> " We have been patient enough . We are concerned about the lives of patients who visit the hospitals that is why we have remained silent for a long time . We think we are being shortchanged 
##3632751 <h> Advertisement <h> K'bu sells sperms ? <p> The sale of sperm to women desirous of having children is now brisk business at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra , the Ghanaian Times investigations have revealed . The times gathered that more than 60 women , including some from Togo , Benin , Nigeria and Cameroon visit the hospital every month to purchase the sperm for fertilization . <p> A source at the hospital who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity , said many women called at the hospital daily to enquire about the sperm and arrange for its purchase . <p> A syringe-sized container of sperm is sold between GHC2,000 and GHC3,000 and this has attracted a lot of young men to the hospital who serve as donors . These donors are between the ages of 18 and 45 years . <p> The business , the source said , started unofficially about five years ago and had become lucrative for young energetic students and others who are eager to make money . <p> Although the hospital is under resourced , and do not officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use their ingenuity to perform successful sperm fertilization . <p> Speaking to the Times , a medical expert at the hospital , who asked not to be named , said the donors were taken through series of blood test and sperm analysis to ensure that their sperm did not contain any disease that could be passed on to the customer . <p> " We further check the hereditary of the person to ensure that the family did not suffer from diseases such as epilepsy , deafness and other serious medical ailments before the sperm is donated , " the source said . <p> It further noted that , most of the women who want to purchase the sperm were concern about the ethnic background of the donor , explaining " that a woman who has a Fanti husband would like the sperm from a Fanti man " . <p> " Other women also prefer a sperm from a Northern , Ewe , Ashanti or Ga because they are married to men from those ethnic backgrounds , " it added . <p> The source said single women and foreign women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors . <p> It said others also like to look at the background of the donor , such as profession , physical appearance and status in society . <p> The source noted that , though most women come alone for insemination , others are also encouraged by their husbands to undergo such exercise due to their inabilities to make them pregnant . <p> Other men , the source said , look for donors for their wives to be sure that the specific sperm would be used for fertilization . <p> When contacted , the Public Relations Officer of Korle Bu , Mr. Mustapha Salifu , said the authorities were unaware of such practices in the hospital , and added that it would not be surprising that some doctors would engage in such practices . <p> He said it would be illegal for doctors in the health profession to use the hospital to engage in such illegal activities . <p> He indicated however that , the hospital had plans of establishing a sperm bank and that until that was done , such activities would be regarded as illegal at the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and Vatican City , however in Ghana it could raise numerous religious , social , health and legal debates . <p> Some religious leaders had agitated in the past that , a married woman who purchased sperms from another man could invite the intrusion of the other man 's seed into herself . <p> This act they consider as adulterous , even if the husband consented to the purchase . <p> Health and safety issues associated with sperm donation have also been raised . This is because donors are generally required to present extensive family and personal medical data about genetic disorders , as well as medical evaluation including screening for sexually transmitted diseases . <p> Legal issues could be raised as well . That is , if the sperm donor has access to the woman 's identity by claiming to be the biological

##3635852 <h> Landlord Of Collapsed Mall In Torrid Water <h> Saturday , 10 November 2012 <p> The man at the centre of the raging controversy over the collapsed six-storey Melcom Mall at Achimota in Accra , Nana Nkansah Ayeboafo Boadu , yesterday turned himself in to the Bureau of National Investigations ( BNI ) after speculations became rife that he was wanted by the security agencies . <p> The owner had been missing for the past three days . <p> Nana Boadu is said to be the chief of Ashanti Nzema in the Ashanti Region <p> A number of bodies were retrieved from the debris of the building , with the latest being the General Manager of the branch , Gerald Berhene . <p> Accra Mayor Alfred Vanderpuije moved to court early yesterday morning to secure an order of interlocutory injunction to be placed on four other properties owned by Nana Boadu , in the Achimota area suspected to be in a similar condition as the collapsed building . <p> That , he said , was to enable the Accra Metropolitan Assembly ( AMA ) to assess the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The court has issued a three-day ultimatum for occupants of the said properties , which are in the same enclave with the collapsed building including one occupied by Fidelity and Standard Chartered Banks , to vacate . <p> Mr Vanderpuije told journalists that the collapsed six-storey building was put up " without any approval and without any permit " . <p> Contrary to claims by government that Nana Nkansah did not have a building permit covering the collapsed building , he insists he has one and other relevant documents relating to the other properties in question . <p> Rising Death Toll <p> On the third day of the disaster , which occurred in the early hours of Wednesday , there were conflicting reports about the death toll , with official figures being pegged at 12 persons , with four others either gone missing or dead , whilst 78 others were said to have been rescued so far . <p> But it later emerged that the General Manager and Neils Lutterodt were indeed dead whilst Sandra Owusu was alive but Eric Bio , Samuel Gyaman and Ruth Atinga were still missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to have gone missing were off duty on that fateful day . <p> Rescue workers claimed yesterday they heard the voices of some persons believed to be still alive but trapped in a mangled elevator in the collapsed building , with pungent smell beginning to emit from the debris . <p> Four people were identified as still being alive under the wreckage . The rescue mission denied that 18 people had died , even though initial reports suggested that nine more bodies were discovered on Thursday evening . Four of the victims , including a pregnant woman , were buried under slabs of stones . <p> The Israeli rescue team has been using a sniffer dog to help locate those buried under the rubble . <p> Nana Boadu 's Rebuttal <p> Nana Boadu , who spoke on various radio networks yesterday , accepted responsibility but expressed utter dismay at the claims that he did not have a building permit covering the building . <p> He has since indicated his preparedness to tender the needed documents as evidence . <p> " I have a file full of documents and receipts showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that we do n't have a permit is just trying to play mischief , " he said , insisting , " It is not my wish for the building to collapse .

##3809152 <h> Volta Unparalleled Welcome For Nana 7 November 2012 <p> The flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo yesterday , got what can be described as an unprecedented and overwhelming welcome ever in the history of the Volta Region as far as Ghana 's Fourth Republic politics is concerned . <p> The Volta Region and its capital , Ho has , since the beginning multi-party democracy in Ghana , been the stronghold of the ruling National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) . <p> However , yesterday 's display of love for the opposition NPP and its flagbearer Nana Akufo-Addo would go down in history as unprecedented . <p> The large crowd , boldly clad in NPP T-shirts and paraphernalia , threw the schedule of the tour of Nana Addo out of gear as they stampeded him right from Anyirawase , where he made a whistle stop through to Dzodze , where he addressed a mammoth rally . <p> Scramble for Nana 's T-Shirts <p> Scores of young men and women were seen scrambling for T-shirts of Nana Akufo-Addo , Presidential Candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the GNA , the youth , as early as 6:00 a.m. besieged the Campaign Office of the NPP in Ho making loud noise in anticipation of the arrival of Nana Addo . <p> While they waited impatiently , about 100 youth took over the Assemblies of God-Stadium Road and moved from one end of the road to the other jostling party officials for NPP souvenirs . <p> Another group was seen at the Ho Jubilee Park , mostly motor riders and taxi drivers scrambling for T-shirts and flags . <p> Most of them chanted " we are dying and need Nana Addo ! " <p> In both instances , those who were unsuccessful in securing a T-shirt and other party paraphernalia expressed their dissatisfaction while those who were successful decorated their motor bikes and private and commercial vehicles with them . <p> The town came alive around 0800 hours as motor riders rode through the town announcing the arrival of Nana Akufo-Addo . A similar incident happened at the zonal office of the party at Awudome-Tsito where residents , mostly women , besieged the party office for t-shirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business and social activities in the regional capital virtually came to a standstill when Nana Addo and his entourage were moving from the residence of Togbe Afede to the Ho Polytechnic . It took close to two hours for them to cover the 10-minute distance , as hundreds of resident besieged them . <p> People carried placards with the inscriptions : " Free quality education now " , " Nana , the man of vision " , " NDC , Volta is awake , never again " , " Volta Region No more NDC World Bank " and many others . <p> Workers were also seen dashing to the streets to wave and urge Nana Addo on . <p> Studies in some schools halted , as pupils and their teachers also bust out of their classrooms waving and chanting in support of Nana Addo . <p> Rapturous Welcome at Ho Polytechnic <p> Nana Addo then proceeded to the Ho Polytechnic , where he received another rapturous welcome . The 1500-seater auditorium which the Regional Chairman Kenwuud Nuworsu described as " the handiwork of the NPP , " was filled to capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Students and other party sympathizers were seen standing on the gallery and wings of the auditorium peeping through the glass windows , while many others stood outside monitoring on radio .
