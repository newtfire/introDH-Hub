##3475650 <h> when will be A/L result in 2011 out ? <h> I appeared for A/L 2011 and waiting for results . There are rumors about the results date but I have not heard from a reliable source . I would be thankful if some body can tell me when A/L 2011 results will be out . <h> email <h> In the year 2011 more first timers have sat for the advanced level examination , 51.33 percent from the new syllabus that is in the first attempt and 48.67 percent from the second and third attempts . All facts regarding 2011 examinations seem to be clear and straightforward . Universities have conducted several scientific research studies to assess the performance of university students . Research evidence clearly indicates that students who qualify in the first attempt at the advanced level examination perform better than the second and third attempt students . Selection criteria need to be productive and cost effective for the government and universities . <h> Results ready . Examination department has completed marking . there is a delay in releasing . Z score has been used effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only way to present marks regardless of differences in degree of difficulty in two examinations is though standardization on the basis of Z score . Whatever the other arguments made and trying to convince one examination is difficult and the other one is easy is not valid and such arguments are not acceptable on evidence based scientific analysis . All subjective arguments made on two different examinations becomes invalid when the Z score is taken instead of marks for selection criteria . Universities have conducted several scientific studies to assess the performance of university students on the basis of their number of attempts they had to sit for the advanced level examinations . Z score standardizes marks and place two exams on an equal setting . Z-score is a scientifically proven yardstick to standardize different examinations and their marks . Each z-score corresponds to a point in a normal distribution and that can be described as a normal deviate , z-score describes how much the marks deviate from a mean . It is a matter of getting the z scores from both examinations and releasing the results that would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardize data , there were no discrepancies since then . What is the delay , it is only a matter of releasing Z scores . If the mean and standard deviations were already given from the examination department , no need to have any delay in releasing results . Using the Z score is the standardard and universily accepted t procedure . That is the statistically accepted procedure in analyzing results . If the authorities stick to the accurate and internationally accepted standard procedure results can be released without any delay without having to face criticisms made on examination papers . Examinations are difficult , there are ambiguous questions in all examinations that is the exact reason why Z score is used to determine performance . Only solution is to release results on the basis of Z score . <h> No need to have further delay , whatever statistical methodology used more or less equal proportions from each examination qualify for university education at the end .

Statistically more or less equal numbers of students from each examination needs to enter the universities . Nearly 50 percent from old syllabus second third attempts and new syllabus that is first attempt have to qualify for university education according to Z score methodology at the end .

##3480950 <p> Sri Lanka 's state-run oil company has lost a $60 million hedging case against Deutsche Bank after a U.S.-based arbitrator ruled in favour of the bank , officials said on Friday . <p> A source familiar with the ruling said Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( Ceypetco ) would have to pay Deutsche $60.3 million plus interest for non-payment of dues . <p> " It 's against us , " Sri Lanka 's Attorney General Palitha Fernando told Reuters . " Now we are considering what actions to be taken to annul this . " <p> Oil Minister Sisil Premajayantha told Reuters he was not aware of the ruling but would appeal if the case went against the company . <p> Three foreign banks , Standard Chartered , Citigroup and Deutsche , took legal action after Ceypetco refused to make hedging payments of more than $460 million , including to two local banks . Deutsche had asked the Washington-based International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to arbitrate . Ceypetco , which imported some 26 million barrels at a cost of $2 billion in 2007 , needed to hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international market . <p> It was exposed to the oil rally of 2008 , when oil hit a record high above $147 a barrel in July before crashing to less than $40 a barrel in December . <p> In July , Ceypetco lost an appeal against a London court ruling which ordered it to pay nearly $162 million plus interest for non-payment of dues to Standard Chartered Bank linked to hedging deals . Standard Chartered argued that Ceypetco had always been aware that a fall in oil prices would have made it liable to make payments to the UK-based bank . <h> Comments <p> what are these politicians doing to our country ? they are irresponsibly playing with public money .. thus money taken from taxing the people for mobile usage , vehicle imports , sunlight , crude , rice , vegetable imports etc are going to be paid to close these hedging loses ... aney people why are you still voting MR ? are you really wise ? <p> Why the culprits who were responsible for these huge hedging losses were not brought before courts or bribery commission like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this what called selectivity ? ?

##3480952 <p> The C olombo Chief Magistrate directed the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital Director to submit a report on the sections of the skull that were removed during the surgical operation on Mr. Duminda Silva 's head , which had gunshot injuries during the Mulleriyawa shooting on October 8 , 2011 . <p> Magistrate Prasanna Alwis gave this order when Mr. Silva 's bodyguard in his evidence said Mr. Silva was operated on at the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital after the shooting , which killed presidential adviser Baratha Lakshman Premachandra . <p> You know What ?

##3483051 <p> LTTE assasinated Lakshman Kadirgamar on August 12 , 2005 ( exactly 3 years earlier for today ) . This is a perfect example for the claim -- " LTTE is NOT the sole representative of Tamils " . <p> I can still remember how well , he faced a hostile interview with BBC . Also I remember the following after-dinner speech , one of the great speeches I came across . At the end of this blog you -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> Captain Atapattu and members of the Sri Lankan team ; <p> Members of the Sri Lankan community ; <p> Friends of Sri Lanka ; <p> Ladies and Gentlemen . <p> Some historians say , I think uncharitably , that cricket is really a diabolical political strategy , disguised as a game , in fact a substitute for war , invented by the ingenious British to confuse the natives by encouraging them to fight each other instead of their imperial rulers . <p> The world is divided into two camps -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are totally baffled by it , who can not figure out why a group of energetic young men should spend days , often in the hot sun or bitter cold , chasing a round object across an open field , hitting it from time to time with a stick -- all to the rapturous applause of thousands , now millions , of ecstatic spectators across the world . <p> The game has developed a mystical language of its own that further bewilders those who are already befuddled by its complexities . <p> In the course of my travels , I have a hard time explaining to the non-cricketing world in America , China , Europe and Russia that a googly is not an Indian sweetmeat ; t hat a square cut is not a choice selection of prime beef ; t hat a cover drive is not a secluded part of the garden ; t hat a bouncer is not a muscular janitor at a night club , t hat a yorker is not some exotic cocktail mixed in Yorkshire ; t hat a leg-break is not a sinister manoeuvre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , let me see whether politics and cricket have anything in common . Both are games . Politicians and cricketers are superficially similar , and yet very different . Both groups are wooed by the cruel public who embrace them today and reject them tomorrow . <p> Cricketers work hard ; politicians only pretend to do so . Cricketers are disciplined ; discipline is a word unknown to most politicians in any language . Cricketers risk their own limbs in the heat of honourable play , politicians encourage others to risk their limbs in pursuit of fruitless causes while they remain secure in the safety of their pavilions . Cricketers deserve the rewards they get ; the people get the politicians they deserve . Cricketers retire young ; politicians go on for ever . Cricketers unite the country ; politicians divide it . Cricketers accept the umpire 's verdict even if they disagree with it ; politicians who disagree with an umpire usually get him transferred . Cricketers stick to their team through victory and defeat , politicians in a losing team cross over and join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed . <p> It is said that the task of a foreign minister is to lie effusively for his country abroad . That may be true , but it is certainly true that he has to fight for his country and defend it at all times . Our cricketers may recall that in the run-up to the 1995 World Cup Australia refused to play a match in Colombo , citing security reasons . Shane Warne said he would n't come to Colombo because he could n't do any shopping there . The press asked me for a comment . I said : " Shopping is for sissies " . <p> There was a storm of protest in Australia . A TV interviewer asked me whether I had ever played cricket . I said I had played before he was born -- without helmets and thigh guards , on matting wickets that were full of holes and stones , and I had my share of broken bones to show for it . My friend the Australian foreign minister was drawn into the fray . He phoned me . We decided to cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombo at very short notice to play an exhibition match in place of the Australian match . It was a magnificent gesture of South Asian solidarity . Against strong security advice I went on to the field to greet and thank our friends from India and Pakistan . When the whole episode was over I sent a bouquet of flowers to my Australian counterpart . Flowers are also for sissies . <p> I remember vividly the incident that occurred in Australia when Murali was called for throwing and Arjuna led his team to the boundary , in protest , but cleverly refrained from crossing it . I was watching TV in Colombo . As a past captain I asked myself what I would have done in Arjuna 's place . In my mind I had no hesitation in supporting his decision . A few minutes later the phone rang . The President of the Board called to ask for advice . I said Arjuna was right because a captain must , on the field , stand up for his men and protect them , but the consequences must not be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reasonable compromise must be reached . That was done . <p> During that tour I paid an official visit to Australia . My friend the Australian foreign minister in the course of a dinner speech invited me to go with him the next day to Adelaide , his home town , to watch the final day 's play . I knew what the result was going to be . In my reply I said that at the end of the match I did not want to be the one to tell him that Australia had " won by a Hair , ' . Accordingly , I went back home , as planned , to maintain the good relations that we have with Australia . <p> Foreign ministers sometimes find themselves in very difficult situations . Take pity on the Foreign Minister of Uganda . President Idi Amin had told him that he wanted to change the name of Uganda to Idi . The minister was told to canvas world opinion and return in two weeks . He did not do so . He was summoned to come . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He said : " Mr. President , I have been informed that there is a country called Cyprus . Its citizens are called Cypriots , If we change the name of our country to Idi our citizens would be called ... Idiots " . Reason prevailed . <p> A shark was asked why diplomats were his preferred food . He replied because their brains being small are a tasty morsel , their spines being supple I can chew on them at leisure -- and they come delightfully marinated in alcohol . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , as I approach the close of this brief address I wish to speak directly to our Sri Lankan team . Today we lost a match . But you lost to the rain and M/s Duckworth and Lewis . You did not lose to England . <p> Only a few weeks ago you had a resounding victory against South Africa . You will win again tomorrow . What is important is to keep up your confidence and spirits . <p> All of us , your fellow countrymen , and countrywomen , have been enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athleticism and determination that you have displayed in the field . The people are with you . We all know that you try hard . All of you , each and every one of you , are constantly busy honing your skills . We can see that you are maintaining a high standard of physical fitness . When the people see this it gives them not only immense pleasure but the moral uplift that Sri Lankans are capable of rising to the challenge of sustained performance . <p> Every team loses . It takes two to play a game . One has to lose . It is the manner in which you play the game which gives the promise of success to come . It is a great pleasure to see how youngsters are being drafted into the national team . Our team is united ; it reflects all the races and religions of our country . Cricket , like all international sport today , is highly competitive ; and so it must be , and so it must remain . <p> It must always be regarded as a very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of you are role models for our youth . They will be looking to see how you take defeat . To exult in victory is easy , to remain well balanced in defeat is a mark of maturity . <p> Do not allow yourselves to be disturbed by the arm cha ir critics who will no doubt engage in a display of theoretical learning on how the game was played . Many of these critics have never put bat to ball . It makes them feel good to indulge in the pastime of amateur criticism . They do not know what it is to face fast bowling in fading light ; to engage in a run race against daunting odds ; to find the stamina and sheer physical endurance to spend concentrated hours in the field of play . They know nothing of the psychological pressure that modern sportsmen are subject to . Therefore , my advice to you is -- ignore them . Go your way with customary discipline and methodical preparation for the next game , the next series in different parts of the world under different conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an honour to be here with you tonight . When I was invited to be the Chief Guest at this occasion on my way to New York for the General Assembly of the United Nations , I accepted with eager anticipation of meeting our cricketers and relaxing for a moment . Nobody told me that I had to make a speech , until last night . It came home to me then that -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> About Lakshman Kadirgamar . <p> Extracted from Wikipedia , <p> Sri Lankabhimanya Lakshman Kadirgamar PC ( April 12 , 1932 -- August 12 , 2005 ) was a Sri Lankan diplomat , politician and lawyer . After a distinguished career as a lawyer and international humanitarian , he was appointed as foreign minister of Sri Lanka in 1994 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga . He achieved international prominence in this position due to his wide ranging condemnation of the LTTE and his efforts to have them banned internationally . He served as Foreign Minister until 2001 , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was carried out by an LTTE sniper team . <p> Can the world , the nature , fate , whatever , be so cruel . We lost him .

##3484352 <h> Tuesday , December 27 , 2011 <p> Got the chance to have a chat with a tuk tuk driver from " Budget Taxi " company who had been with the service for a long time . Following is a brief situation analysis of such a company gathered from his words about the history and from what i learnt from customers of the service ( Special thanks to Hasitha ayya - who shared his experience in using metered tuks ) - The post is for the benefit of entrepreneurs in taxi business , for customers and business/marketing students like you and me to know . <p> Apparently the metered three wheel services had started about 3 years back . At that time which was only a differentiation factor from " badly looked upon " normal three wheelers . After that the " on call " tuk tuk companies started forming like Taxi services in the past Sri Lanka ( There was a joke in a paper so many years back that if you dialled any pattern in a Sri Lankan phone - a taxi will come to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has build a very sustainable customer segment who travels daily . The driver said there are people who goes to office , travel during office hours , come home , go around for home needs all in the same tuk tuk . This is the biggest strength of the service as it protects the business , assures survival and creates growth specially by word of mouth marketing . <p> Pricing model - is a big strength as it is a key factor when differentiating their service as compared below with the normal three wheel pricing mechanism ( Bit of humour ) . <p> Weaknesses <p> The current technology used to track tuk tuks is beneficial to the drivers side as he can switch off location tracking and go on private hires . This happened to me where i called the service &; there was no tuk tuk but on the road i could find one who had switched off location tracking . <p> No geographical presence is a weakness because you can not find a taxi instantly . <p> Opportunities <p> Well seriously the economy is improving and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living standards are increasing and thus people prefer to travel by tuks than in the past . <p> Technological advancements have enabled tuk tuks to have meters , have location tracking ( Even manual tracking ) . But the advancements are great that companies can go for better technologies such as GPS tracking of tuk tuks . Even the customer end can be improved by better CRM systems such as an improved Taxico android app . <p> Threats <p> There are low cost cars like NANOs coming to the market , making travel by car less costly . And this can effect the appeal for tuk tuks . ( Apparently NANO is only about Rs.10 more expensive ) . <p> Threat of new entrance is very high . Already there are half a dozen tuk tuk services with the key word Budget , For e.g.Budget Lanka , Budget Three wheel.etc . <p> Threat from the non-metered three wheels are very high as they are high in quantity and strong with their associations and influential networks . <p> Overall - It is a booming market as @vidic8d tweeted - NANO is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget Taxi . On the other hand the market is becoming fragmented and it is tough to battle out . <p> Recommendations It is recommended to move on to better technologies for tracking location and to come up with offices ( Geographical service points ) to fight normal three wheel services better . <p> Please feel free to comment below with your ideas and your points to be added to the SWOT . I will update the post with your name . <h> 6 comments : <p> Nice post bro . All of above are so damn True.Mostly I 'm also using Metered Taxi but unfortunately Metered taxi so hard to find out on evening ( Office Time ) and also they are locating their taxis near by so crowded towns . : / P.S : Dude can you remove this Word Verification Please : ) <p> Anjula - Ca n't you call them up and ask them to come at office time ? I heard it works ... I have removed it bro ... Tell me if it still there . Plus i need some advise on the template . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @hajara - Thanks for the comment ... True that some charge Rs.35 . Rising cost of living is nt it ? <p> after 10PM No metered tuk tuks are available . I ve called many times .. even though they answer phone they dnt have any taxi to send . even Nano .. soo i guess even we dnt like it , the only option left is .. NORMAL TUK ... : ) <p> Dear Anonymous - Thanks for your insight - Its true . I 've heard lots of people travel in Tuks after 10PM most if not all of them had booked in advance . So what do you think can be a solution ? Increasing no.of tuks ? Or as i have given above - Have geographical locations - in popular cities 
##3485850 <p> In the aftermath of the screening of the Killing Fields on Wednesday 14 March millions across the world will be stunned and horrified by the images of the bloody massacre of Tamil people in Sri Lanka . Most will draw the conclusion that what took place is nothing short of genocide . And , once the shock fades , every viewer will ask : what can be done now ? <p> Tamil Solidarity continues to stand out as a campaign that has exposed the horrendous nature of what took place , both during and since the so-called end of the war in Sri Lanka . But Tamil Solidarity is not a commentating organisation -- we are about fighting to defend the rights of all oppressed people in Sri Lanka . <p> The Killing Fields documents how tens of thousands of Tamil people were cornered in a tiny area in the north of Sri Lanka , bombed , then chased away to another place , and bombed again . They were hunted down while fleeing , deprived of food and denied medical supplies . Forced starvation alone claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense torture were meted out to those who surrendered .

All this took place under the watchful eye of the United Nations ( UN ) and its member states . <p> The second part Channel 4 's ' Killing Fields ' documentary by Callum McCrae captures some of this horror . To find out about more about how events unfolded please also read the review of UN spokesperson Gordon Weiss 's book The Cage here . <p> The documentary includes UN footage , and eye-witness reports from UN officials . The UN refused to take any action . In the interest of finishing off the LTTE many kept their silence on the massacre by the Sri Lankan government . And now they are all complacent in the covering up of the continued killing , repression and trampling of democratic rights by Sri Lankan government . The reprehensible resolution that has been put forward by the US in the UN exposes this continued complicity . The Indian and Chinese states , which both supported the Sri Lankan government with these horrendous killings ( fundamentally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , are still protecting the genocidal regime . <p> The documentary also exposes the poor role played by the Red Cross which claimed that the government 's action to ' save the people ' was enough . The film footage also details powerful evidence of war crimes ; the unconceivable cruelty revealed in the murder of Balachandran Prabhakaran is one example . The 12 year-old boy was shot seven times at close range after he was forced to watch the torture and execution of others . A huge amount of video and photographic evidence proves beyond doubt that summary killings and torture took place . <p> The Killing Fields also attacks the ridiculous counter-documentary produced by the Sri Lankan government . The only basis for that ' documentary ' is doctors speaking against the LTTE under duress ! <p> ' British interest ' in former colony The programme concluded by asking how , in the midst of this wealth of bloody evidence , Sri Lanka has been chosen to host the Commonwealth Games in 2013 . This highlights the conciliatory role of the British ruling class in the whole affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current Con-Dem government and the Labour government before it refused to take any action in defence of the Tamils . The Tories ' role was partly exposed in the Bell Pottinger scandal ( http : **26;6759;TOOLONG ? p=1971 ) . Disgraced former Tory Defence Minister Liam Fox was a close friend of Rajapaksa ( http : **26;6787;TOOLONG ? p=1907 ) . <p> Furthermore Tamil Solidarity has evidence in relation to the position of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office . There are secret talks taking place to seek out investment in Sri Lanka , even now . The work of Paul Murphy MEP for Dublin , Ireland , ( http : //www.paulmurphymep.eu/ ) , a Tamil Solidarity supporter , in the European Parliament has been systematically opposed by Tory and the rest of the right wing MEPs . <p> At times Tory MEPs have argued in the interest of the Sri Lankan regime more vigorously than the Sri Lankan officials . There are a number of Tory MEPs who still deny the scale of the massacre that took place . Of course they try to give the impression that the British government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is an absolute lie . To advance UK big business 's interests they seek a kind of peace ( and might even contemplate a change of president to achieve this ) . They have no interest in solving the national question of the Tamil-speaking people or even improving their lives in general . The cold cruelty they display towards the suffering inflicted by their cuts on the vulnerable in Britain is not spared the Tamil masses in Sri Lanka . <p> Defence spending Three years has passed since the so-called end of the war . But , with IMF support , the Sri Lankan regime is now spending more money on defence than ever before . The military 's role is linked to the bigger question of strategic and business interests in the region -- not the wellbeing of ordinary working and poor people . <p> Miliband Tamils and other human rights activists were , no doubt , shocked to see the prominent role given to former Labour MP David Miliband in the Killing Fields documentary . Miliband was the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position himself as on ' our ' side . But it was his Labour government in power during the massacre . Desperate chants of " Gordon Brown , Gordon Brown , Save the Tamils " rang through the streets of London on demonstrations numbering over 100,000 . Tamil Solidarity had to sadly warn that this chant would fall on deaf ears . Nonetheless a number of Tamils clung to their illusions that Labour would act , at least in the interest of human rights . But the experience of police repression of peaceful Tamil protests in Parliament Square proved the opposite . <p> Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes came to talk to hunger strikers in Parliament Square and made various vague pledges . We have seen no action yet . Miliband now accepts that the Sri Lankan regime is full of liars and acknowledges the horrendous scale of the massacre . But what opposition does he put forward -- even in terms of opposing the Commonwealth Games in Sri Lanka or openly supporting the call for an international investigation into war crimes ? Why did n't he act to expose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he and Labour genuinely want to win the hearts and minds of Tamil-speaking people strongly opposing the cuts and attacks on the NHS would also be a good start . <p> Unite the struggles Miliband recognises that things are changing . Labour can not continue to take the electoral support of the Tamil population for granted , as it has done . The impact of this documentary and the ongoing debate among Tamils is not an isolated process . Tamils ' understanding of the the ' them and us ' nature of society and how the oppression of Tamil-speaking people is part of that is increasing . <p> Tamil Solidarity has always explained that any government that oppresses or attacks its own people can not be trusted to take any interest in challenging oppression elsewhere . Time and again it has been shown that corporate interests lie behind government actions . <p> How can any serious activist , for example , hope that the Indian government , which continues to viciously crush the right to self determination of the Kashmiris , would act decisively for democratic rights elsewhere ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypocrisy of the UN resolution . Please read the Tamil Solidarity contribution to the debate opened up by Tamilnet , which we warmly welcomed , here . <p> To watch the Killing Fields documentary , particularly when you can speak the language and listen to horrific helpless cry out in Tamil , is nothing short of heartbreaking . Its impact will stay with us forever . No human should be reduced to this level . <p> We should not , however , be silenced by the genocide . In the aftermath of George W Bush unleashing the ' war on terror ' the Sri Lankan government is trying to make the massacre into an internationally renowned example of ' how best to solve the national question ' . There are reports that the Turkish government is taking the ' Sri Lankan route ' to solve the Kurdish question ! <p> Tamil Solidarity argues that we can also provide an example -- of fight back . We must not let the enormous anger , at the massacre and the evoking of it by the Killing Fields , go to waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future generations that horror of this nature will not go unanswered ; rather it will further intensify the fightback . To effectively resist the continued repression there can be not one iota of faith placed in the so-called ' international community ' , either the governments of the West or of India . <p> Through democratic , open and serious discussion , debate , united action and studying of history we can together learn to understand what is required to win . Let us fight to unite all those suffer to create a strength that will make sure that this sort of
