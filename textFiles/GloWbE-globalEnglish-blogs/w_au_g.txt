You should visit your Cochlear country website for the most accurate information specific to your location . <p> I suffered from a progressive and gradual sensorineural loss of hearing . At school and during university it was always necessary for me to sit near the front of the classroom or lecture hall in order to hear well . <p> At 40 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection cleared I was tested for hearing loss . I was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss and as a result of this my ENT surgeon recommended bilateral hearing aids . <p> However , my hearing loss continued to appreciate and I would have to replace my hearing aids every two to five years with new and increasingly powerful ones . <p> In 2003 my hearing loss was found to be in the profound range in both ears , making my hearing aids basically ineffective . My surgeon recommended bilateral cochlear implants as I had little effective hearing in each ear . <p> I received my cochlear implants sequentially which allowed for a period of adjustment to the new cochlear implant sensation while using the hearing aid in the other ear . My first implant was done on 10 July 2003 , followed by switch- on 30 July 2003 . <p> Prior to receiving the second implant I was tested again to determine if a second cochlear implant could deliver hearing benefits . Speech discrimination tests demonstrated that my understanding of sentences was superior without the hearing aid . A second cochlear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would significantly improve my hearing . <p> I still had a few reservations about receiving a second implant . Would the second cochlear implant perform as well as the first cochlear implant ? Would the sound sensation be the same as the first cochlear implant ? Had the best ear been implanted first ? I had a little residual hearing at the lower frequencies , which I could just still use with a hearing aid , although it was declining gradually . My expectation was that this residual hearing would be lost on implantation . Most implantees only receive one cochlear implant and manage well . Why was I being considered for a second implant ? <p> With a second cochlear implant , I would be totally dependent on the implants . I had to put all my faith in these devices for all time , as there was essentially no return . The slim midterm prospect of being able to take advantage of a medical breakthrough in the regeneration of cochlear hair cells would probably be denied . Given that there were no research reports of successful regeneration results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that a routine approved regeneration treatment was sometime away . I wanted to stabilise my hearing now and was not prepared to wait an indeterminate time for a maybeprospect . <p> Most hearing aid users are bilateral . Clinicians report that it is better to aid both ears as the overwhelming evidence suggests that the patient receives a superior hearing outcome when bilateral . Early research evidence and patient experience indicates a similar outcome for bilateral cochlear implants . Given these findings and my previous experience with bilateral hearing aids , bilateral cochlear implants appeared to be a reasonable option . <p> The cost of the procedure was not a factor as my health insurance fund would cover the second cochlear implant , and I considered the cost of batteries to be a small charge for continuing good hearing . <p> After much consideration I decided to have the second cochlear implant . While I received sound , confident and positive advice from both my surgeon and audiologist , the final decision to proceed was mine alone . My decision to proceed was made based on the experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surgery for the second cochlear implant was performed on 1 April 2004 , with switch- on 22 April 2004 . <p> After each switch- on I was able to understand speech within 24 hours on the implanted side , which was truly amazing . Following the first switch- on , I gave a lecture the next day . I could understand questions with some difficulty , but managed without too many problems . After the second switch- on , I could converse easily with the taxi driver while travelling from St Vincents Hospital to the airport . <p> Since receiving bilateral cochlear implants my hearing appears to have stabilised . I am now able to use a mobile phone ( on to switch ) with ease , which was not possible with hearing aids . I can manage TV without teletext , but I still find the text very helpful for certain programs where the accents are strong or the sound track is of poor quality . <p> My perception of music , particularly classical , is slowly improving . Some instruments sound well and truly off , while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I find the bilateral cochlear implants to be clearly superior to a single cochlear implant . Hearing in noisy situations can still be difficult , but there is a significant improvement in quality over just one cochlear implant or bilateral hearing aids . In addition , the second cochlear implant provides a backup when a speech processor requires repair , or the batteries run out . This means that I am never off the air , and I am always keen to replace spent batteries to remain bilateral . <p> In summary , my life is back to normal , both socially and professionally . In my case , bilateral cochlear implants have proved essential to manage in the hearing world when one is almost totally deaf . They have allowed me to continue an active participatory life without any real difficulty . For this I am most grateful to the people involved in the initial and continuing development of the cochlear implant technology , in large part , an amazing Australian development . <p> My bilateral advantages a ) Sounds are generally clearer , fuller and less distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to one side . c ) Adjustment to the second implant was very rapid ie several days , and the sound from each implant is identical . d ) People do not need to repeat speech as much as speech intelligibility is much improved . e ) Sounds are in stereo ie directional f ) Music can be better appreciated g ) Concentration on hearing during a full active day ( eg meetings/conferences ) is far less stressful . Stress induced headaches are less frequent . <p> If you are considering bilateral cochlear implants and would like to ask me questions about my experience I would be happy to take your call or answer your email .

##6751 <h> Love is blind when it comes to sport <p> I received many comments on last week 's article on the future of the A-League , and it would be easy to look at the four football codes this weekend and conclude that rugby , league and AFL all advanced their causes , while football ( soccer ) took yet another step back . <p> Indeed , in Saturday 's Sydney Morning Heral d , Peter Fitzsimons had another of his totally predictable rants about football in the form of the A-League being an entree for the main events later . His column included a poll which showed only 9% of fans would be watching football that night , versus 14% for AFL , 31% for league and 46% for rugby . Fitzsimons forgets he is supposed to be a sports journalist but instead assigns himself on a crusade to put football down . <p> Look at what he was comparing . <p> The football game was Sydney versus Wellington , traditionally one of the least-watched A-League games of the season . The rugby game was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Super 14 game like NSW v Canterbury , but the peak of the rugby calendar , All Blacks v Wallabies . The league game was in the heat of finals football , and two traditional clubs , Tigers v Roosters , while the AFL was also into its finals , and featuring the Sydney Swans . <p> So how did the weekend develop ? As I try to be more open-minded that Fitzsimons , I went to Homebush to watch the rugby . <p> Here are a few observations you wo n't read in the match reports : <p> After the haka , John Williamson tried to whip up the crowd to sing Waltzing Matilda , which many years ago , in an act of spontaneity , once seemed to work well to counteract the splendid New Zealand war dance . But this time , it was downright embarrassing . The sound system did n't seem to work , and it took a long time before there was any evidence of crowd participation . For most people sitting near me , it could n't end quickly enough . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacks ! All Blacks ! " . Someone even tried the old Olympic " Aussie , Aussie , Aussie " , but it stimulated no " Oi , Oi , Oi " . <p> There was not one song in the entire game , despite a decent 70,000 crowd . There 's far more noise and coordinated singing from 10,000 at a Sydney FC game , and the Aussie National Anthem is sung with much more pride and gusto by a football crowd at the World Cup . <p> The capacity of ANZ Stadium is 83,500 , and the crowd was just over 70,000 . That 's a lot of empty seats for the biggest home rugby game of the season . David Beckham and LA Galaxy drew a crowd of over 80,000 a couple of years ago . <p> The opening scoring penalties were for " Not rolling away " and " Joining ruck from the side " . The rules are so technical and complex amid the mess of bodies that the referee can find almost anything against either side . The game was dominated by penalties for offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself was close , which made the final 10 minutes exciting , but the rest of the game was nothing special . But chalk up a strong effort by rugby . <p> The Tigers versus Roosters showed league is the game which nobody could kill off with a double-barrel shot gun . It keeps bouncing back despite the best efforts from those within the code . The salary cap debacle at the competition 's best team and more behaviour problems than in the average prison only seem to draw the fans closer . Okay , the scrums are a farcical way to restart play and totally non-competitive , and there 's no international competition of any merit , but league can still produce excitement . <p> Over at AFL , the Swannies bowed out by five points at the MCG , and while any close finals game is thrilling , the Sydney team blew a 30 point lead and missed many chances to kick away . Even in sports-mad Melbourne , the 100,000 capacity MCG attracted only 39,500 to a finals game , and fans were complaining about the low attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wellington in front of only 8,500 , and Central Coast squeezed home 1-0 with a controversial send-off and penalty . <p> So of the four codes , soccer looks the loser , and the other three can point to close , exciting games , even if it is finals week and the Bledisloe . No doubt , Fitzsimons and thousands of rugby , league and AFL fans will point to the weekend and feel vindicated , even if Australia lost to New Zealand for the 10th time in a row . <p> But then the Big Daddy of them all kicks in : Manchester United versus Everton in the English Premier League . Controversy at the kick off as one of the best players in the world , Wayne Rooney , is left out . A wonderful game of end-to-end play sees United take a 3-1 lead with goals which need to be replayed several times to appreciate their sheer artistry . Quick , precise , pinpoint passing and beautiful footwork . Then last minute drama as Everton score twice in added-time to snatch a draw , with a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathtaking stuff , football at its best and an absolute joy to watch . The ground was packed , and hundreds of millions watched on television . <p> What does all this prove ? <p> The fans of every code can point to their game and say it was thrilling and the 
##13151 <h> Miriam <p> Miriam appears in the Book of Exodus , which chronicles the time of Jewish slavery in Egypt . Her name means ' bitter sea ' . <p> Miriam was the sister of Moses and Aaron and was a prophetess from a very young age . This meant that God spoke to His people through her , although He did not speak directly to her . Her powers were proven in her prediction that her brother Moses would grow up to become the leader of Israel . <p> In Miriam 's time , the Jews were living under the rule of the Egyptian Pharaoh , who worried that the Jewish people seemed to be growing mightier . He considered the Jews to be a threat to his sovereignty , and devised a plan to quash them . <p> While they were slaves to Pharaoh , the Jews seemed only to increase in number and strength . Thus , Pharaoh decreed that all Jewish-born sons be murdered ; a plan which was not carried out because the midwives did not cooperate . He then decided to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fate of her people and endeavored to save her own baby brother and thereby the Jewish nation . She assisted her mother in making a wicker basket in which to place him . They knew that he would float among the reeds of the Nile , and they hoped that he would be rescued from certain death . <p> Pharaoh 's daughter Bathiah found the basket and drew the baby from the water . This is why he became known as Moses , which means ' One-Who-Draws-Out ' . With the baby she found Miriam , who innocently offered to find help for the child , " in the child 's own mother " ( Exodus 2:8 ) . Miriam saw that her brother must be legally reunited with his mother . Her foresight and brilliance were indicative of her role as prophetess for her people . <p> Miriam and her mother agreed to return Moses to the Pharaoh after the child was grown . They brought him to the Pharaoh , with Miriam 's mother disguised as a nurse . The Pharaoh 's daughter named him her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews , and to bring them out of the house of slavery . By communicating with God he went on to lead his people to freedom through the parted Red Sea . <p> Miriam led the Jewish women , who followed her example of praising God for His miraculous provision . It is written . Then the prophetess Miriam , sister of Aaron , took up a tambourine , and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing ( Exodus 15:20 ) . The miraculous well of water that followed the Jews through the desert for forty years was believed to flow in honour of Miriam . The well ceased to flow upon her death . <p> Miriam questioned her brother Moses ' power . She felt slighted that God actually spoke to him , as opposed to only through her . She was punished for wanting to be equal to her brother , and was struck down with leprosy and banished from the Jews ' camp for one week . <p> Miriam 's life was composed of both agony and ecstasy , and serves as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned why Aaron , who also attacked Moses ' credibility , was not punished at all . Miriam was the force behind her brother 's survival , yet she was never allowed his status . <p> Unlike the previous matriarchs , Miriam did not live to conceive . Her objective was to bring forth a nation from physical slavery into spiritual freedom , with God as her guide . Miriam lived for her people , who suffered with her through her sickness . After her bout of leprosy , her singing was not heard again . Miriam , in song and in silence , spoke for the liberation of women . <p> Miriam is an example of the plight of women in Judaism . Her questioning of God 's ways is a tribute to her strength of character . Miriam 's song lives through 
##13450 <p> Sometimes it is hard to understand exactly what people mean , and sometimes for the biggest questions in life everyone has a different answer . <p> When people talk about God and what we are doing here on earth , for example , you 'll find that most people do n't agree on very much at all . <p> If you have heard of the word religion , you might know that there are many different beliefs about who God is or whether he or she exists at all . <p> Atheists do n't believe in God . They say that there is no scientific proof for God 's existence . Other people believe in a God that is like a really nice person who loves us all , or that God is just another name for the universe and existence - it just IS . <p> But do you know what ? We think every one is right . How can that be ? <p> Have you ever thought about all the names that water has ? We know the liquid is called ' water ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . Then there is ' ice ' -- it is frozen water and it is so hard it can be like a rock . Then if you heat water up it becomes a ' vapour ' or ' steam ' and is practically invisible . <p> Lets think about <p> God like water for a minute . Sometimes he ( or she , or it ) is invisible like a vapour but if you were to stop and look really closely you would be able to see tiny water droplets in the vapour . Other times , God is like a liquid , that you can swim in and other times God is so real , it is like a block of ice right in front of you . <p> Sometimes you ca n't actually see the water , but it still exists . Everything on earth needs water for life . Plants need it , animals need it . <p> We are all like that too , we all need love for our lives too . To be simple , love is another name for God . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they still believe in love . So they experience God that is very hard to see , like vapour . <p> Then there are others that say they can see God like an energy , swim in him , like a liquid . For them God is just as real as drinking water . <p> Then there are still others that believe that God is as real as a block of ice . If you ran into a block of ice you would crash into it . For some people , God is like that , so real you ca n't miss her . <p> Then there other names for God . I might call God - ' love ' , but someone else says no is he is a person like you and me and his name is ' God ' , or ' Supreme ' , or ' Allah ' , or ' Rama ' and others say that God is not a male or a female , that God is more like a ' force ' or ' energy ' .

You feel its wetness , the way it flows through your fingers and how it feels against your skin . <p> Imagine that you are standing still and just feeling the water flowing around you . <p> The little waves are passing by and you are not affected . <p> Next try and imagine that there is a force or an energy that joins us all together and it is this water .

##35451 <h> Time to find a better deposits deal <p> PORTFOLIO POINT : UBank and Rabo Bank are currently heading the pack on shorter-term bank term deposit accounts , with Bank SA leading on longer-term accounts . <p> It 's time for all self-managed superannuation funds and larger private investors to negotiate much more vigorously with their banks over term deposit rates . <p> Let 's make a rule that if you are looking to maximise your returns you should not place large sums on term deposits that yield less than 5% . <p> And you should expect much more than that for five-year term deposits . <p> Because of what is happening overseas , banks are now starting to talk turkey and this article is designed to help you negotiate better deposit rate terms with your bank , particularly if you have a substantial sum to invest . <p> All the banks are now concerned that a split in the euro could take place . If it happens ( and there is no certainty it will ) , then the major European banks who are big funders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly damaged . There will be far less money available for Australian banks . <p> That means that our banks must replace some of their overseas deposits with a much greater amount of Australian bank deposits . As you look to take advantage of this , if you 're seeking to deposit money for one year or less , then your starting point is the National Australia Bank 's wholly owned subsidiary UBank . In fact , UBank operates on the same banking licence as the NAB , so it is the same bank . And , of course , bank deposits of up to $250,000 with the NAB and other banks are guaranteed by the Australian government . <p> You will see that UBank offers at least 5.1% for three , six and nine months and 5.3% for 12 months . It is obviously more convenient to stay with your existing banks , but in some cases the NAB ( via UBank ) is offering over 0.5% more than the big banks on shorter-term deposits . You ca n't afford to ignore that difference for the small amount of inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks understand this new game and will come close to the party to match the Ubank 's shorter-term offer . If they do n't , then you must take your money away or you will lose your bargaining power next time around . And if you are a NAB customer just laugh at them if they wo n't talk turkey . <p> When it comes to longer-term rates , banks by 2015 will need a bigger proportion of deposits over two to three years because these longer-term deposits will be regarded as ' sticky ' and require less capital backing . The Dutch-based Rabo Bank has been leading the higher longer-term deposit drive in Australia for some time and I have made comments about Rabo . <p> Rabo is an excellent bank but it is based in Europe . Most of its Australian business is concentrated on loans to agriculture , which is now a very prosperous part of the economy . But if you want to play safe keep your deposit below $250,000 -- you have Australian government guarantee up to that amount . Rabo has a suite of offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topping out at 5.8% for five years . It will be hard to get your Australian big local bank to match the Rabo rate , but if you dangle it in front of them it will help you negotiate particularly given the Australian government guarantee . <p> Many Australian depositors would prefer their money in one of the big four banks or a regional like Bendigo and I can understand that . No one can be quite sure what will happen in Europe , although the Rabo is one of the best European banks . When it comes to the big banks , your first port of call should be the Westpac subsidiary Bank SA -- like Ubank with NAB , it operates under the Westpac licence . <p> You will see that Bank SA 's short-term rates do n't match the NAB via UBank but in longer-term rates they are attractive , with all their rates longer than two years at or above 5% , topping out at 5.3% for five years . The parent Westpac rate for five years it 5.2% . Use those Bank SA rates to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne . But you can also use them when talking to CBA , ANZ . NAB or Bendigo . <p> Australian term depositors have had a very difficult time in the last six to 12 months , with rates falling sharply . The banks have not passed on the full official rates in their mortgage lending but they certainly lowered their term term deposit rates . The fight back can now start . <p> I should emphasise that if there is a crisis in Europe almost certainly the official Australian bank rates set by the Reserve Bank will come down sharply . So it is possible that term deposit rates will soften , although the margin between the Reserve Bank rate and term deposit rates will increase . <p> What has made Australian banks more nervous about Europe is the fact that the Europeans are coming up with solutions that look as though they might solve the situation , but in each case there are holes . And each time they announce a rescue package and then do n't deliver quickly on what they agreed , the position gets worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently 12 to 18 months ago . Now we are dealing with Italian , Spanish and wider problems . European banks are hiding enormous losses with much more to come if the Euro splits . Moreover Germany , via the Bundesbank , is funding the exodus of deposits from banks in Greece , Italy and Spain . Not surprisingly many Germans are very upset and are taking the government to court . Even if the German government wins the court battle and the funds keep flowing to finance fleeing " Club Med " bank depositors , Germany will be hard pressed to maintain the funding of Club Med much beyond the end of 2013 . <p> Meanwhile , in the streets of Spain , the poverty is increasing with middle class people joining the queues for food . In Greece the situation is worse . History tells us that sort of poverty will not last in a country without revolution , and as the protests grow the pressure to split the euro will be intensified . <p> One of the reasons the Germans and most of the countries in Europe do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be incurred by the banks that have operated on the basis the euro would stay together . And it 's those losses that will mean that the wholesale banking market will contract dramatically . Australia depends on that market for about 40% of its local funding . The Australian banks must replace that overseas money with local money and that 's why they are negotiating on Australian deposit rates . <p> Given this pressure , as more people shift , bankers will become more flexible with their term deposit rates . There are substantial funds in Australian superannuation in the equity market , and banks will need to entice that money out of equities into term deposits . If there is a split in the euro there will be a scare on equities , so banks will be using a two-way stick to attract the money -- fear of equities and higher deposit rates . <p> I must emphasise that I am not necessarily forecasting a split in the euro . It is possible that the European community will go through this very difficult time and come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty . <p> At the Eureka summit Paul Keating said this was an unlikely outcome but it is clearly possible . The Australian banks now regard what Paul Keating told the Eureka summit as at least a 50% chance of taking place , so they have begun to take action on term deposits . Now is the time for Eureka readers to take advantage of this situation . <h> Weekend Briefing with Alan Kohler <h> Alan Kohler <p> Keep up to speed with the key news and events shaping world business and economic affairs today by reading Alan 's weekly in-depth report , including 
##54150 <p> I was 4 years old as I stood with my mother in a crowded public bus in Kandy , Sri Lanka . I heard the drop of coins across the floor of the bus as an elderly women prepared to pass her bus fare to the conductor who was squeezing through . She vocalized her frustration in Sinhala and moments later I got on my knees and started to pick the coins scattered between a proverbial sea of feet . I recall passing the coins to her just before we reached our stop and reveling in her changed expression . I remember words of praise as she patted my head and the shape of a wide smile forming across my face . <p> Alas I 'm sure we all have childhood memories like this . I share this in wanting to express the fact that it was clear to me at a very young age that I was at my happiest when I was contributing . In fact I may go so far as to contend that this is likely a universal fact ! A sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of purpose ... is extremely powerful . <p> Uncovering Contribution <p> I do n't intend for this to be a self-indulgent , autobiographical account but rather a brief window into what I am finding to be the essence of contribution . My foray into Aid and Development in Post-Tsunami Sri Lanka was an emotional , moral reaction to the suffering and devastation around me . My perspective at the time was that I was one of the fortunate ones with the capacity to lend a helping hand . <p> I was persistent in contacting various NGOs in December 2004 and in a matter of days I was working on a range of projects across the Southern and Eastern coast of the island . Many of which involved immediate relief for refugees from both the civil war and the tsunami . Witnessing the conditions in which my own countrymen lived in made me reflect on my childhood in Southern Africa and what I was doing with my own life . <p> Before I knew it I had convinced myself that I wanted to live a life of contribution and help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would pursue in spite of societal pressures -- particularly as a male from a South-Asian family and a business student at university . I was reacquainted with the deep sense of fulfillment I had felt as a little boy but had long forgotten in my angst-ridden teenage years . <p> Confronting Reality <p> My involvement with Simple Wisdom and a great deal of time spent visiting villages across Sri Lanka was enlightening on many fronts . Especially in that I was exposed to ways of life that I had previously been sheltered from . In particular I was able to better empathize , with the plight of Tamil refugees across the East Coast -- caught between the Army and the LTTE . It was a time filled with purpose and I daresay ... adventure . Long drives into rural hamlets , experiencing the charms of village hospitality , the frenetic rush of organizing rations in refugee camps , the comradeship between coworkers -- these were all life affirming experiences . <p> Yet when I look back I can see that my intentions were largely centered on self . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family life , project work became a refuge . For I was needed , I was of use ! Though it is easy to be harsh on oneself in retrospect , I often describe my initial foray into social work as being a endemic of a " dependence on dependency " . For my personal happiness and esteem was so largely staked on me being useful within a state of gross inequity and suffering . <p> It was across 2007-2009 that I really started to understand the negative impact of operating in this paradigm . This was a period of deep reflection after my father 's sudden passing and it helped me understand the roots of how I perceived myself and humanity as a whole . While the connection of all of this to social justice might seem vague and nebulous to some , I have found this process of developing self-awareness and assessing my intentions to be vital . <p> I started to ask myself what contribution looks like if it not an egoic pursuit or the refuge of a disenchanted individual . Moreover , I started to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful within my own skin . As the famous and arguably over-quoted ( under-practiced ? ) Gandhi quote goes " Be(ing) the change .... " <p> For who was I to speak of possibility and capacity when in actual fact , I viewed myself as deficient and unworthy on so many fronts ? In many ways I was forced to confront these limiting beliefs I had about myself since childhood . In truth , they linger , I continue to challenge them as I write this blog post . <p> Practicing Development as Freedom <p> I read a great deal of books through this period of discovery -- landmark texts such as Amartya Sen 's " Development as Freedom " and E.F . Schumacher 's " Small is Beautiful " being among the most influential . Yet I feel that it was the aforementioned process of self-discovery that crystallized the views that form the foundations of my thinking at present . The essence being that it is only through a genuine belief in self and ones capacity to self-determine that one is able to genuinely contribute to others . Simply put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent TEDx Talk that I gave at Macquarrie University , I spoke about this journey from the perspective of the principles that guide my approach to contribution . I share this with the hope that it resonates . <p> I recall having conversations with a close friend about there being a crisis in " esteem " and " dignity " . In many ways , typical notions of philanthropy and charity tend to address social justice issues are designed along the lines of a donor and a beneficiary , a giver and a taker , a doctor and a patient . The " dependence on dependency " I referred to earlier , in my assessment , seems to be the elephant in the room . Have we not made an industry of aid and development after all ? There is so much talk of " poverty " and often strictly in financial and material terms ) but so little talk of our immense human capacity to transcend it through self-determination . I am still struck by what can be the potentially debilitating impacts of labels such as " third world " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that " Empower " as an organisation is a part of a growing movement that sees its role and responsibility as being to enable human freedoms , to understand our pragmatic relationship with the earth itself . It is a role that requires fostering tremendous respect and dignity as the content of development is not ours to determine , but that of the very people we serve . It is not a role measured purely in outputs , dollars and cents or a headcount of people reached but rather in the quality of our efforts to support self-determination by working towards complete redundancy . We call this the " joy of not being needed " . To witness the accomplishments of others without a need to assign <p> So how has my view of purpose shifted ? There is no question that I still derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from this work , much as I did before . It remains a large part of my personal dream for my life . However , my sense of worth was so deeply entrenched in being a saviour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the power that comes from actively journeying towards ones own dreams in life . An awkward disconnect between self and my intentions for others -- is now replaced by a sense of integration and authenticity . As cliche as it sounds -- I am seeing how deeply connected everything is . Right from the intersections between natural systems to the foundations of our dreams and intentions . Moreover , there is a palpable feeling that our freedoms are intertwined and that we are all on the path of understanding the nature of what chains us and what liberates us . <p> Our lovely Event Coordinators Mita and Kelly talk about their involvement with Empower , particularly their experience organizing a successful fundraiser in Sydney . <p> Empower 's Event Coordinators Kelly Ponsorford ( L ) and Mita Das ( R ) <p> Kelly Ponsford <p> Empower is a very inspiring organisation , enough to want to spend much of my spare time delivering on my commitment to help coordinate a calendar of events this year . I first found out about Empower through a work colleague and was intrigued when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers the mechanisms to help communities deliver the aspirations they have for themselves , in a way that meets their needs best . <p> There are lots of little things I have learnt and which I would try to influence in future events but here are a couple of the more significant ones . <p> This process reinforced for me the importance of taking hede of gut feelings and making sure that you iron those out rather than ignoring them . There were occasions when it would have been easier to let lack of clarity go , to deal with it on another occasion , but when we did this it meant there was re-work and in general I always had an uneasy feeling when the potential was there . When I nipped these issues in the bud , there was a better outcome compared to when I let things ... slide ( like the pun ? ) <p> If we were to do this again , the importance of lead time and careful preparation should not be underestimated . The event went well . However with having an initial false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in a relatively short period of time . It 's a risk and it meant we had to cut corners in terms of having a really solid target audience , and a solid set of tools to leverage extra fundraising and future connections with the audience . We basically launched in with crossed fingers and rolled up our sleeves . What could we have achieved if the planning had been more strategic ? <p> Working with Empower Inc and the people that are Empower is just what I have been looking for.These last few months have been exhilarating and creative . The more I learn about Empower , the ideas and actions of the people in Malawi and the successes of each of the projects , the more I am convinced this is a fantastic organisation to be associated with . I ca n't wait to learn more about the projects in Malawi and Sri Lanka and hopefully find new ways to add my skills to the mix . <p> Working on the concept and delivery of the Dream , Act , Change @ Slide event with Mita as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exciting and challenging , and fantastic to have a team where skills are set to work to complement each other . Working with Empower Inc and the people that are Empower is just what I have been looking for . These last few months have been exhilarating and creative . The more I learn about Empower , the ideas and actions of the people in Malawi and the successes of each of the projects , the more I am convinced this is a fantastic organisation to be associated with . <p> Interview with Mita Das <p> Tell us a bit about why you are involved with Empower ... <p> I met Shanil ( Executive Director ) and heard about Empower quite by accident really . But once I heard his story and the philosophy that underpin the projects , I wanted to help . I have seen first-hand , how even a small amount of support can make such a huge and enduring difference in people 's lives . I have so much compared to the majority of people around the world , it makes sense to me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit better . Empower 's ideology is one that I agree with which is why I choose to support them . <p> What 's your role in the Empower Tribe and how do you feel about it ? <p> I am an event coordinator which is great because this is something that I have done in the past and have expertise in . Empower event management has previously fallen to the directors . My volunteering frees up their time and energy , which is far better spent on managing the projects in Malawi . <p> You recently collaborated with Kelly Ponsford to organize a fundraiser for Empower . Tell us about it ! <p> It was actually a lot of fun . It was like organising a big party . We had to find a venue and chose Slide on Oxford Street which was pretty funky . It was great working with Kelly because together we were able to brainstorm ideas and she has a lot of positive energy . The theme for the night was Dream , Act , Change which is Empower 's vision statement . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be escapist , feature various acts and enable positive change . Between us , Kelly and I were able to persuade a variety of people to perform for free and donate items for a silent auction . <p> How did you find the experience of or ganizing this event ? Was it really stressful ? <p> I have organised events in the past as part of my paid work so I knew that I had the core skills required such as planning , organising etc . However I had never organised an event for an NFP before . I felt a lot of responsibility because if the event was unsuccessful there was a possibility of actually losing money ( deposit on venue hire ) which Empower definitely can not afford to do . Mind you , I put the pressure on myself , the directors of Empower were always supportive and emphasised that it was important for the volunteering experience to be enjoyable for Kelly and I rather than onerous and stressful . But obviously I wanted the evening to be a success by raising lots of money and awareness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this experience and what do you look forward to ? <p> Kelly and I have different styles of working . I 'm a bit more laid back with more of a ' she 'll be right ' attitude so it was good that Kelly was more detail focussed which is necessary for event management . Having said that , I 'm also more of a control freak than I 'd like to admit . I 've learnt that when I am working collaboratively , I have to respect that my way is not always the right way -- there are lots of ways to achieve the outcome ! I 've also learnt that I need to be a lot clearer about knowing what other people expect me to deliver . In the melee of organising a big event , sometimes individual 's responsibilities can become a bit hazy . But the main thing I 've learnt is that everyone in the Empower tribe is fantastic and I really enjoy working with them . I look forward to working with Empower more , to help create positive change in Malawi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates on our Malawi project . It has been some time since I 've returned from my adventures , and yet I am still buzzing with excitement ! The time I spent in Sri Lanka and Malawi was extremely rewarding , and I am deeply optimistic about the year ahead ! <p> While we are still organizing the initial visits in Sri Lanka , progress has accelerated rapidly in Malawi . In our second year of operation , Zatuba Village is starting to rally together and demonstrate leadership at a regional level . It was , admittedly , a challenge to develop a strong understanding of a non-handout , community-driven approach , but the hard work by the local team seems to be paying dividends . <p> Partner Planning <p> Before heading to Zatuba Village , we had a project meeting to plan for the year ahead based on the goals already intimated by the village . This was our very first meeting as a project team with Mzuzu University , BEED Malawi and our permaculture consultant Lieza Du Preez . It was an invaluable exercise in establishing common goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the registration of Empower in Malawi as a Company Limited by Guarantee . Jones Ntaukira ( Executive Director ) , Runil Patel ( Director-Finance ) and myself ( Director-Strategy ) will head up the new company . This is an exciting development as we seek to formalize our presence and transfer responsibility to a wholly local team . <p> During this time , we also managed to secure initial agreements with OVOP and SSLLP ( both local organizations ) to assist with coffee exportation and livestock management respectively . A very productive few weeks ! <p> Visit to Zatuba Village -- Jan 2012 <p> Throughout 2011 , Jones and our network of Malawian partners were sowing the seeds for Zatuba Village ( 40 households ) and Kapita Primary School ( 400 students ) to become epicentres for self-reliance in the South-East Mzimba region . Our approach to this has involved capacity building to organise villagers into inclusive Village Development Committees ( VDC ) and facilitating annual Vision Workshops that include all men , women and children in a community . This is further distilled into action plans that Empower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement . A key distinction being , that there are no handouts apart from education ( we have provided permaculture training to develop a school food garden + eco-sanitation and cost-recovered our investment in solar lanterns for 40 households ) . <p> My time in Malawi reviewing our second year of operations was inspiring . Despite forex and fuel shortages , rising food prices and political turmoil , there was hope in the hearts of the villagers in South-East Mzimba . Chief Zatuba 's speech , especially , captured the village 's intention to be a regional example : <p> The situation in Malawi has since stabilized , with Joyce Banda becoming Africa 's second female president . Her ascension has already helped restore diplomatic ties with donor nations and address crippling fuel shortages , as well as instigated a much-needed devaluation of the Malawian Kwacha . <p> Village Development Committee . <p> The Village Development Committee formed in Zatuba Village now operates in accordance with its own constitution , and convenes meetings in a professional manner . I was particularly impressed with their record keeping , accountability and enthusiasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will also ensure the rotation of leadership . The committee consists of men , women and youth , and are responsible for the annual " action plans " formulated at the annual Vision Workshops . <p> What is especially deeply encouraging is the consistent tone of " we must take responsibility " that is taking root within the region . <p> Vision Workshop 2012 . <p> The second iteration of the Vision Workshop in Zatuba Village was a successful forum to discuss community aspirations and challenges , and form the basis of the village 's second action plan . Women , men and children were all involved in the process , brainstorming with their respective groups and sharing their views in a plenary discussion . While the turnout from regional villages was lower than expected ( mainly due to the rains ) , we had a broad range of participation , including from the regional primary school and the regional village headman ( who presides over 22 villages in the region ) . <p> The central focus of the Vision Workshop this year was : <p> - Completion of repayments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> - Completion of Community Bank Pilot in March 2012 ( completed ) and expansion to include all 22 villages in the region by May 2012 ( on track ) <p> - Expansion of Solar Lantern Project to at least one neighbouring village by September 2012 ( in progress ) <p> Those in attendance determined these goals with facilitation from Empower and its partners . <p> Solar Lanterns in Zatuba Village <p> Having experienced in 2010 the darkness of Zatuba Village at night , I was excited to observe the impact of the new solar lighting . After spending eight hours charging in the sun , the Solar Lanterns provided to Zatuba give approximately the same duration of LED powered light . Chawezi operating his grocery store at night ( after training from Empower Inc 's entrepreneurship training support ) , a mother feeding her child , children playing , families talking and women cooking together ; these are just some of the practical possibilities enabled by solar lighting . The Villagers praised the technology , as it saved them money ( no kerosene costs ) , was safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to use and offered a brighter light than simple candles or lamps . <p> A personal highlight of my visit was when a village elder asked me to be patient with him starting our campfire , as they did not purchase kerosene anymore ! What 's more , there appeared to be general appreciation in being able to pay for these units with their own hard earned money ( over 12 months ) . The women of Zatuba dancing with the lanterns ( and around them ) was certainly a touching moment , and their reverence highlighted the profound impact that sustainable lighting can have on a community . <p> Our stay highlighted the fact that there is a strong regional demand for solar lighting on various scales , and we are currently exploring the expansion possibilities of this service through the regional community bank that will be established this month ( May ) . The roll-out of solar lighting products through organizations such as Solar Aid and D.Light could lead to the entire South-East Mzimba region ( 22 villages ) having access to an affordable source of lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ; our next update will focus on progress with Permaculture and Eco-Sanitation at Kapita Primary School in South-East Mzimba . <p> Admittedly , it 's been a fair while since we 've blogged . But better late than never eh ? As you may have noticed , thanks to the efforts of Valerie Schwartz and Charith Ellawala ( etc. ) , we now have a brand spanking new website . And to go along with it , we have a new outlook on what this blog will be . Over the course of the next few weeks we will be bringing you a whole slate of new content , including updates on our projects and organization , as well as breakthroughs and news in the areas of sustainable technology/agriculture and social entrepreneurship . <p> To kick off our new blogging enterprise , over the next four weeks we will be posting a four part series of updates on our Malawi project . Part one will concern Planning/Visioning and Solar Lanterns , part two on Permaculture and Eco-Sanitation at Kapita Primary School , part three on the Regional Community Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we plan

##71350 <p> Both would struggle to explain how they came to produce a set of words which intercepted with a tune and then took off to become property beloved by the world -- or , at least , someone in the world . <p> I 've asked a number of acquaintances , colleagues and friends to hit me with their best-ever lyrics -- just a line or two , and the reason they like them . <p> It is the omissions in this brief survey which are most surprising . There is not one Bob Dylan song from the last 45 years . Elvis Costello made some short-lists but not the final cut . There is no U2 , no Lou Reed , no Michael Jackson , no Kurt Cobain . <p> Some found the task stressful , as though being asked to nominate a favourite child . It only shows how important and personal certain songs become . <p> I have a theory that people do n't choose songs the songs they like . The songs choose them .

Maybe you just want to get off the oppressing world for a while and the question David Bowie asks , " Is there life on Mars ? " seems like a good one . <p> My theory also explains why you 'll sometimes get uninvited repeat visits by songs you hate . They are itinerant , looking for homes . I wish Kevin Bloody Wilson 's shocking " DILLIGAF " ( Do I Look Like I Give a Fuck ) would stop asking me to give it one . <p> Song writing is usually a solo process , even if the credit says " Jagger-Richards " . The tune may summon the words , or the words may summon the tune .

" <p> The song also solves the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle ( Elvis needs Boats ) <h> Erin says : <p> 10:57am 26/11/10 <p> What about the song by Billy Joel - Only the good die young . <p> " Oooohh they say there 's a heaven , For those who will wait , Some say it 's better but I say it ai n't I 'd rather laugh with the sinners and cry with the saints , The sinners are much more fun , Darlin ' only the good die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually rap gets a bad .. errr .. rap as being mindless self-promoting garbage ( mostly by people that do n't listen to it ) . And often it is . But there are 1 or 2 genuinely insightful lines for every 100 lines that follow the " I got 99 problems but a bitch ai n't one " format . <p> I love the Jay-Z line " I 've done my dirt but I got a good heart , now should n't that count for something ? " From a DMX song I think . <h> Shifter says : <p> 12:26pm 26/11/10 <p> Just wondering why you felt the need to credit Jay-Z as an artist there ? <h> Matthew says : <p> 03:14pm 26/11/10 <p> Rap actually has a lot of it , you just need to find it . <p> Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down And everytime you think you gotten past it it 's gon na come back around and tackle you to the damn ground - Eminem , If I had <p> Where you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're running right back Here we go again It 's so insane - Eminem ( and rihanna ) , love the way you lie ( Very accurate story about abusive relationships <p> So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh .

Oh ya there 's an excuse you lose Proof so you use . - Eminem , Deja Vu ( struggling through a friends death ) <p> I could put a whole lot of other songs up but these are the first 3 that come to mind . A lot of rappers have lost friends/family and actually lay down some heartfelt rhymes about them but unfortunately it rarely makes it to radio so it ends up with a bad rep . <h> Matthew says : <p> 03:32pm 26/11/10 <p> I 'll be missing you ( Puff Daddy ) and Good Die Young ( D12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ null says : <p> 11:14am 26/11/10 <p> you got to know when to hold them know when to fold them know when to walk away know when to run <h> KZ says : <p> Absolutely . This song is less about poker and more about life than anyone realises . <h> LJM says : <p> 07:24pm 26/11/10 <p> And here I was thinking it was a song about poker etiquette ! <h> DD Ball says : <p> 11:15am 26/11/10 <p> " When I survey the wonderous cross . " The entire song hits me in several places , written in the 1700 's . But then it satisfies my religious desire to worship . Another contemporary song I love is Plaisir D'Amour . " The joys of love are but a moment long , the pain of love endures the whole life long " and give it Judith Durham to sing it .. <h> ILR says : <p> 03:01pm 26/11/10 <p> He was probably pissed off at all his leftie-folkie Greenwich Village " friends " ( like Pete Seeger and Dave Von Ronk ) who dumped so much shit on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Newport ' 65 .

But when they sold out and had Fergie join them it all went down hill . Very sad . <p> This was one of their lyrics <p> " I see you try to diss our function by stating that we ca n't rap , Is it cause we do n't wear tommy hilfiger or baseball caps , We do n't use dollars to represent , We just use our inner sense and talent .

" <p> Recent shiver-making gooseflesh raising anti war lyrics from Rise Against 's , Hero of War . The whole song is brilliant . Or Samputu 's songs about the Rwandan genocide . <p> And Ralph McTell , The Ferryman " Then he heard the river laughing , and he heard the river crying , And in it was the beauty and the sadness of the world And he heard the sounds of dying , but he heard the sounds of birth And slowly his ears heard all the sounds of earth .

Richard Thompson 's Cold Kisses : <p> " Here I am in your room going through your stuff Said you 'd be gone five minutes , that 's time enough Here in your drawer there 's lacy things Old credit cards and beads and bangles and rings Well I think I 've found what I 'm looking for Hidden away at the back of the drawer Here 's the life that you led before " <h> Ugly Duckling says : <p> 02:22pm 26/11/10 <p> Heather , another Janis Ian song from the same album that spoke to me was " At Seventeen " . Especially the lyrics : <p> To those of us who know the pain of valentines that never came , And those whose names were never called when choosing sides for basketball . It was long ago and far away ; the world was much younger than today And dreams were all they gave away for free to ugly duckling girls like me . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high school too ! <h> Heather says : <p> 02:44pm 26/11/10 <p> Oh , At Seventeen is utter gold , pure teenage angst ... Janis Ian is also brilliant live . Saw her at Bluesfest a few years ago , and she stole the show . <h> Heather says : <p> 11:50am 26/11/10 <p> And any version of Masters of War - my fave is the Pearl Jam version , but the Dylan one is also great . <p> Def Leppard - love bites It applies to all relationships . You meet people and sometimes fall outs . Relationships are generally an ass , but you ca n't live without them . <p> And the one i commented earlier <p> " Whether its God or the bomb , its just the same and its only fear under another name " <p> MaxQ ( Michael Hutchence ) way of the world . Because its true , in the news especially , everything ( swine flu , NK , GFC ) is aparantly going to end the world today and we 're all going to die .

Nothing like screaming that out alongside Jesse Lacey in order to exorcise some existential angst . <p> Best : <p> Apart from Me vs Maradona vs Elvis which is brilliant in it 's entirety and also by Brand New , the best lyrics I think I 've ever heard are in ' I am trying to break your heart ' by Wilco . <p> ' Let 's forget about the tongue-tied lightning , let 's undress just like cross-eyed strangers ... I wan na hold you in the bible-black , pre-dawn , you 're quite a quiet domino , bury me now ... I always thought that if I held you tightly , you 'd always love me like you did back then .

And still I would be lying if I said it was n't easy , I am trying to break your heart . <h> Adrian says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot ' is a bit on the sad side but brilliant nonetheless . <p> " It 's cold as a tomb , and it 's dark in your room , when I sneak to your bed to rub salt in your wounds " <h> Music Fan says : <p> 01:00pm 26/11/10 <p> @Adrian , good call re : Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot .

How come we got seven dogs ? And who burned down the garage ? " <p> and from Every Time , by Butterfingers - one of the more printable lines reminds me of my youth ... " Everytime I 'm drunk at a party in a toga , I pull a damn hamstring to prove I do yoga " <p> and of course , the venerable Python , from the Lumberjack " I cut down trees . I skip and jump . I like to press wild flowers . I put on women 's clothing And hang around in bars . " <h> ej says : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love Johnny Cash 's version - very poignant - " everyone I know goes away , in the end " - as his wife died shortly after this song was released and then Johnny died not long after her . <h> Tony says : <p> 09:29pm 26/11/10 <p> I am sorry ...

How many times have you heard someone say " If I had money I would do things my way " ? But little they know that it 's so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind . Money ca n't buy your youth when you 're old , a friend when you 're lonely , or a peace to your soul . The wealthiest man is a pauper at times , compared to the man with the satisfied mind . <h> MsLaura says : <p> 05:21pm 26/11/10 <p> That 's done by Johnny Cash I believe ... or Joan Baez ?

Lights will guide you home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you <p> Then when we signed the registry " For the Longest Time " by Billy Joel <p> I had second thoughts at the start I said to myself , hold on to your heart Now I know the woman that you are It 's wonderful so far And you 're more than I 'd hoped for I do n't care what consequence it brings I have been a fool for lesser things I want you so bad , I think you ought to know that I intend to hold you for the longest time <p> Once we were married we had the punk version of " Happy Together " by the Turtles but covered by A Simple Plan <p> Imagine me and you , I do I think about you day and night It 's only right To think about the girl you love And hold her tight So happy together <p> We entered our reception to " Starlight " By Muse <p> And hold you in my arms I just wanted to hold You in my arms My life You electrify my life Lets conspire to re-ignite All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never let you go If you promise not to fade away Never fade away <p> Our Cake " I 'm a Believer " by Smashmouth <p> I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me . Love was out to get me That 's the way it seemed . Disappointment haunted all my dreams . Then I saw her face , now I 'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind . I 'm in love , I 'm a believer ! I could n't leave her if I tried . <p> And then we danced to " Nothingelse Matters " by Metallica <p> So close , no matter how far Could n't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters Never opened myself this way Life is ours , we live it our way All these words I do n't just say and nothing else matters Trust I seek and I find in you Every day for us something new Open mind for a different view and nothing else matters <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm generally not that impressed with most lyrics and find that music generally moves me far more . I guess that 's why I 'm always more inclined to listen to largely instrumental music of all sorts depending on mood . Anything from hard techno and other electronic music to classical music , to guitar solos . Far too often I find that songs seem to have banal , cliche lyrics for the sake of having lyrics and not because they vocals actually add anything to the music . In some cases I find that a cleverly used sample can be just as meaningful as a sung chorus . In any case , I find if you want meaningful lyrics you frequently need to get away from commercial music . Rap is a prime example . Most top 40 rap is terribly lyrically regardless of how good the beat may or may not sound . But some of the rap from less commercial artists has very clever , creative and thought provoking lyrics <h> Liv says : <p> 02:59pm 26/11/10 <p> Hilltop Hoods Walk on ... <p> I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only ever sleep when I 'm too tired to think Restlessness , the reaction that you will find From stress I guess and having a compassionate mind I worry bout the machine of progress , ai n't no stopping it The forest we destroy and the world we build on top of it Mercenaries get paid salaries to slaughter Girls obsessed with body image find calories in water Nurses comfort seven-year-old casualties of mortar A peasant 's daughter caught up in a war for a border And at home we treat our refugees like criminals Detention centres just a catch phrase for a minimal Security prison , we drive gold trimmed cars Down the road an Afghani kid grows up behind bars And we wonder why they hate the west When we treat them like they 're second-class citizens at best We 're all pawns in a game , the USAs miniatures Aussie foreign policy with George Bush 's signature Peeps die for a watch and blue chip stock Did they do Big Pop or was it two bit cops I wan na sue kid rock for making rednecks think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spit it from the hilltop Wan na affect change in the subjects that we talk on Connect strangers , work together and walk on <p> Polluting airways , mankind strays with no reforming So slap on that sunscreen and enjoy the global warming Cos ignoring world issues is what we all do best Just like Aussie politicians shoe shining for the U.S To save losing face , no thoughts to the fumes that trace Our sky lines and clogs our seas we swimming in consumer waste The fumes of hate rise globally but will it cease The day we try and find a little peace within the Middle East We shadow their borders yelling deplete their arms Its just war for black gold so they can grease their palms We all need a scapegoat , a villain to cop blame We 're just wolves in sheep 's clothing killing in gods name And that 's world wide , like global over population We mine the world dry of natural resources to feed our nations Appetite for waste , I see it everywhere I feel like throwing a flag of protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of her natural defences But talk is cheap , and taking action is expensive We wear our hearts on our sleeves , our flags on our borders And that 's why nuclear testings done in pacific foreign waters We follow reporters with the worth of a scholar And gather personal opinions from a rag worth a dollar Man this is not a subject I feel lightly I can talk on The attitude is one man of many , so walk on <h> Jess says : <p> 02:45pm 26/11/10 <p> My city 's still breathing ( but barely it 's true ) through buildings gone missing like teeth .

The sentiment comes from a place of total vulnerability and utter desperation , and Trent Reznor 's voice portrays that perfectly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice exudes power ( Almost like , ' I 've been there , but gotten through it ) . Given the subject matter , the NIN version is more appropriate really . <h> hot tub political machine says : <p> 03:45pm 26/11/10 <p> Hey Jess , I did some reading on " dissociation " - a surivival technique where the sexually abused detach from the reality of what is happening . How doing that can also make them feel like they are slipping away and they need pain to jolt them back to the present -so self harm again to survive . <p> Couple that with attachment problems that can occur leading to social difficulties " Everyone I know goes away in the end ...

I have too many favourites to list here , but Fiona Apple , the Dresden Dolls , Bright Eyes and so many other contemporary artists . I 'm 24 years old so a lot of the music that got me through my teenage angst was ' new ' music , and there are some gems that still resonate with me every time I even think of a couple of lines . I have ' From the razor to the rosary ' from My Chemical Romance 's ' It 's Not a Fashion Statement , It 's a F-ing Deathwish ' tattooed on the insides of my wrists - not sure why those particular words struck such a chord , there were other songs from that album ( Three Cheers ... ) that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words hit me straight in the chest the first time I heard them , and to this day still have that effect on me . <p> MCR 's ' Cubicles ' is the best description of unrequited love I 've ever heard : ' I 'd photocopy all the things that we could be If you took the time to notice me But you ca n't now , I do n't blame you And it 's not your fault that no one ever does <p> But you do n't work here anymore It 's just a vacant three by four And they might fill your place A temporary stand-in for your face This happens all the time And I ca n't help but think I 'll die alone ... ' <p> Bright Eyes has some unbelievably good lyrics as well - my two favourites are ' No Lies , Just Love ' : It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen That I bought those pills I thought I would need And I wrote a letter to my family Said it 's not your fault And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I do n't belong Like the ground 's not mine to walk upon And I 've heard that music Echo through the house Where my grandmother drank By herself And I sat watching a flower As it was withering I was embarrassed by its honesty So I 'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face Not this f-ing wreck That 's taken its place <p> So please forgive what I have done No you ca n't stay mad at the setting sun Cause we all get tired , I mean eventually There is nothing left to do but sleep <p> ... and ' Lover I Do n't Have to Love ' : I picked you out Of a crowd and talked to you Said I liked your shoes You said thanks can I follow you ? So it 's up the stairs And out of view No prying eyes I poured some wine I asked your name you asked the time Now it 's two o'clock , the club is closed we 're up the block Your hands on me I 'm pressing hard against your jeans Your tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out You did n't care to know Who else may have been you before I want a lover I do n't have to love I want a girl who 's too sad to give a fuck Where 's the kid with the chemicals ? I thought he said to meet me here but I 'm not sure I got the money if you got the time You said it feels good I said I 'll give it a try Then my mind went dark We both forgot where your car was parked Let 's just take the train I 'll meet up with the band in the morning Bad actors with bad habits Some sad singers They just play tragic And the phone 's ringing And the van 's leaving Let 's just keep touching Let 's just keep keep singing I want a lover I do n't have to love I want a boy who 's so drunk he does n't talk Where 's the kid with the chemicals I got a hunger and I ca n't seem to get full I need some meaning I can memorize The kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you You write such pretty words But life 's no story book Love 's an excuse to get hurt And to hurt " Do you like to hurt ? " " I do ! I do ! " " Then hurt me . " <p> Then there 's Bridezilla 's ' Brown Paper Bag ' - this song was written when the band were all in their teens so the lyrics are very simple , but so pure . This song is just gold all over : ' I put you away into a brown paper bag , That way I wo n't find you all over the place . <p> Even the Old 's say " You need a distraction , go find a distraction " <p> Shuffle through old love letters I wrote to you but did n't send , Dote over every picture I 've got of you ... That I can find . <p> There are so , so , SO many songs I could spend all night sharing , but I 'll keep it to those for now . For all you modern-music haters out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the charts today , there 's a dedicated artist out there with genuine talent and a passion for good songwriting who is just waiting to be found and loved ! <h> Antares says : <p> Fair maid in a garden , walking alone , What is it makes her to weep and to moan ? I am as a tall sailing ship out on the sea , Where only long breezes reach out to me . Chorus : And I 'll set my sails of silver , And I 'll steer towards the sun , And you , false love , will weep for me When I 'm gone , when I 'm gone , when I 'm gone . Fair maid in a garden , how can it be ? I 'm staring seaward but what does she see ? A mast of the tall rowan tree , ropes of fine silk , Decks holystoned shining whiter than milk . <h> Matty C says : <p> 12:06am 27/11/10 <p> It 's never over , my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder It 's never over , all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her It 's never over , all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter It 's never over , she 's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever <h> Des says : <p> 12:37am 27/11/10 <p> Sorry but I 'm putting the whole song down , I mean this is the internet and we ai n't killing trees so skip this if large blocks of text in comments disturbs you .

##106950 <h> PCOS &; Fertility <p> When it comes to infertility , there are two groups of PCOS women . <p> There are those who 've known about their PCOS condition before trying to get pregnant . And those who 've had problems getting pregnant and then been told they have PCOS -- which explains why they 've been having problems getting pregnant . <p> The first group have probably been prepared for the struggle by their doctors , or by learning about PCOS . For the second group , the diagnosis of PCOS , while it may have been a shock also provides some relief , explaining a myriad of previously misunderstood symptoms . <p> Either way , both groups now find themselves trying to achieve a pregnancy the hard way . The information on this page has been structured to reflect the different stages on the fertility journey . Some may overlap , but they are all important to the couples struggling to become parents . <h> Lifestyle Factors <p> PCOS is a condition best managed by improving your lifestyle . Improvements in diet and exercise will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fertility and help regulate your menstrual cycle . This section includes details of relatively simple things you can do to enhance your fertility . <h> Weight Loss and Exercise <p> The ' weight-loss and exercise ' mantra is repeated so often by the medical fraternity that patients get a little numb to the message . This is especially true when weight loss seems virtually impossible using traditional low fat / high carb diets . Eat smarter , by choosing a low GI / high protein diet . <p> Exercise improves insulin sensitivity and therefore weight loss . <p> Exercise reduces other risk factors like high blood pressure . <h> General Health Issues <p> Quit smoking &; recreational drug use -- Smoking is a known cause of infertility . <p> Drink adequate water -- During IVF procedures , you are routinely advised to drink at least three litres of water a day as it can lessen the complications of Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) . This is a good habit to develop for the duration of fertility treatment and pregnancy , since your body is having unusual demands made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid spas and saunas during fertility treatments . <h> Financial Issues <p> Fertility treatment is not cheap . Consider your options regarding private health insurance before you start trying to conceive . There may be waiting periods before you are covered for IVF and related procedures . It is also a good time to consider what level of coverage any pregnancy achieved would have . <p> Some private health insurers have 12-month waiting periods on newborn babies , meaning you have anticipate their birth . This is an almost impossible task for the woman with PCOS who may spend several years trying to conceive . It seems ridiculous to pay several years of cover for an unborn child . Do your research . You may find that your child would , in fact , be covered , but only in cases of accute ( ie. Life threatening ) illness . Shop around . Different funds provide different levels of care and different waiting periods for newborn children . <p> The Medicare Safety Net provides extra financial assistance once you have incurred a certain amount of expense . It works on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think about their cost and how you can be assisted by the safety net . Three treatments in one calendar year will cost you less than two treatments in one year , followed by another in the subsequent year . This is because you will need to incur two thresholds , versus one . Current information regarding the Medicare Safety Net thresholds is available on the Medicare website . <p> The Government has proposed changes to the level of support it will provide to couples requiring procedures like IVF . This proposal is being passionately argued by fertility advocate groups across Australia , in the hope that the Government will continue to support people who genuinely need fertility assistance . It will be necessary to keep your eye on the Medicare web-site for any changes to Government policy . <h> The Pill <p> In his book , PCOS : The Hidden Epidemic , Dr Samuel Thatcher explains that egg follicles need to be exposed to at least three healthy menstrual cycles to develop enough to maintain a pregnancy . For most women with PCOS , this is an impossible challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill until you are ready to try to conceive , and then try to conceive on the very first cycle after you stop . There is a wash-out effect , meaning that you will be more fertile for the first couple of cycles , so use this to your benefit . <h> Temperatures <p> Measuring basal body temperatures can track or predict ovulation . Some PCOS patients have fairly regular periods ( or bleeds ) but do n't actually ovulate . A collection of three months of erratic basal body temperatures , combined with erratic cycle lengths will indicate to you that you are not actually ovulating . Either way , this information can be useful to a doctor because it provides an initial understanding of your menstrual cycle . Do n't bother measuring basal body temperatures if you are on the pill as they will be skewed by the hormones in the pill . <h> Naturopathy <p> Naturopaths have the capacity to enhance the effectiveness of medical treatments through the provision of complementary therapies . There are herbal remedies proven to improve insulin-resistance , regulate menstrual cycles and provide general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve your diet and lifestyle , and given that fertility depends on the correct balance of a symphony of factors in both your body and your partner 's , it is worth considering their advice . <p> Do n't self-medicate with herbal remedies -- you need proper medical advice . Will herbal medicines sound harmless , they can interfere with medications or fertility treatments . Discuss using these treatments with a qualified naturopath and your qualified GP . <p> Herbs which may improve insulin sensitivity : <p> Vanadium ( found in dill seeds ) <p> Cinnamon <p> Gymnema <p> Goats Rue ( forms the basis of diabetic drug , Metformin ) <p> Sarsaparilla <p> Herbs which may improve PCOS symptoms : <p> Licorice ( anti-androgenic , helpful for acne and hirsuitism ) <p> Peony ( normalises ovulation ) <h> Counselling and Support <p> Do n't be afraid to speak with a counsellor , pastor or psychologist about PCOS . It is a very private condition that tears at the very fabric of your womanhood . While you can grieve quietly over acne , obesity and hirsuitism , and cry privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , your private pain must be discussed with partners , doctors and possibly friends and family . Medical treatment schedules might mean you have to discuss your condition with your employer . You will survive the process much more intact if you take the time to talk it through with a counsellor . <p> It may be appropriate to receive counselling both alone and with your partner . Your partner too , will be dealing with grief and feelings of inadequacy . Many fertility clinics offer staff counsellors - take advantage of their wisdom and their knowledge of the subject area . But be warned , not all well-meaning counsellors understand the deeper issues of PCOS and infertility . <p> POSAA 's forum provides a range of topic lists where you can connect with others in your situation . Take the time to join one or two of them . E-mailing other PCOS sufferers can be a liberating and healing way to start discussing your private pain . When you are contemplating fertility treatments , the Forum is a good place to gain information and support . <h> Diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most doctors will go through a series of tests to determine why you are having trouble conceiving . A diagnosis of PCOS is reason enough to explain infertility , however it is common for doctors to investigate whether other factors may also be present . Doctors are looking for physical abnormalities , hormonal imbalances , menstrual cycle defects , endometriosis or problems with sperm . <p> Diagnosis and treatment are often combined . It is not always necessary to understand why you are not conceiving , in order to provide treatment . Cycle tracking , while being an opportunity to understand a patient 's menstrual cycle , can also be an opportunity for assisted reproduction therapies or timed intercourse . <h> Cycle tracking <p> Cycle tracking is often used to assist the doctor to understand your menstrual cycle . This can involve taking basal body temperatures and observations of cervical mucus and the position of the cervix . It can also be a more involved process of regular ultrasounds , blood tests and ovulation tests . These tests can sometimes be combined with medications , called challenge tests , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process is designed to observe the body in its various phases of the menstrual cycle , it is also possible for some couples to become pregnant using this method . Doctors have more information available to predict when ovulation is likely to occur , and therefore intercourse can be timed to have the best outcome . <h> Blood tests <p> Blood testing is one of the most common forms of medical diagnosis . When testing fertility , hormone assay tests are used at various times of the menstrual cycle to assess the function of endocrine glands . The results are compared with those of fertile " control " subjects , in an attempt to understand the patient 's infertility . <h> Laparoscopy <p> The Laparoscopy is used for both diagnosis and treatment . This key hole surgery procedure is usually done in day surgery under general anaesthetic . Three holes are made , one in the navel and two at various positions on the lower abdomen . The stomach is inflated with gas to create a space for the doctor to work in . A laparoscope ( a fibre optic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inserted through the three holes . <p> The patient will feel soreness for a few days afterwards , especially if treatment was undertaken . The organs in the lower abdomen can swell slightly as a result of being moved during the procedure . Also , it is possible for some of the gas to remain in the stomach cavity , resulting in some pain until it is absorbed by the body . The procedure carries with it all the normal risks of an operation under general anaesthetic . <p> Some doctors will require you to do a bowel preparation . This involves eating a low fibre diet for a few days before the procedure , and then drinking a strong laxative mixture on the day beforehand . This is done to clear your bowel and intestines . This greatly lowers the risk of infection , if the bowel is accidentally pierced during the procedure . <p> Some of the conditions doctors can assess and treat via laparoscopy include : <p> Scar tissue from previous operations <p> Damaged / blocked fallopian tubes <p> Endometriosis <p> Ovarian drilling / wedge resection <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out in conjunction with a laparoscopy so that the entire reproductive tract can be observed , in which case it is done under general anaesthetic . The uterus is filled with gas and a hysteroscope is used to examine the cervix and uterus . A camera or other surgical instruments are inserted through the hysteroscope to carry out treatments . <p> When done on its own , hysteroscopy can be done in a doctor 's rooms under local anaesthetic , with the patient receiving needles around the opening of the cervix . However , it is also done in day surgeries using epidural or general anaesthetic , depending on what is being undertaken . <p> Some of the conditions doctors can assess and treat via hysteroscopy include : <p> Septums in the uterus <p> Polyps <p> Diagnosing unexplained bleeding <p> Adhesions / Fibroids <h> Ultrasound -- abdominal <p> This procedure is virtually painless , however the requirement for a full bladder can cause some discomfort . Usually you will be asked to drink between 600ml and 1 litre of water an hour prior to your appointment and hold it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensor that looks a little bit like a computer mouse over your stomach . They may push quite hard at times , so squeeze your bladder in tight . <p> This technology allows the doctor to see the entire lower abdomen , looking at your organs from various angles . They can not see your ovaries in as much detail using this method as they can using a transvaginal ultrasound . In fact , your ovaries may appear normal on an abdominal ultrasound , but clearly polycystic on a transvaginal ultrasound . You may be given both ultrasounds in the one visit , allowing the operator to get a more accurate diagnosis . <h> Ultrasound -- transvaginal <p> This painless procedure involves having a long thin probe inserted into the vagina . There is an ultrasound sensor on the tip of the probe , and the ovaries and womb can be observed in great detail using this method . Various elements can be identified and measured , and often the patient is able to watch along on a screen . It is worth asking the operator to explain to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . <p> Many gynaecologists have a transvaginal ultrasound machine in their rooms for routine diagnosis and cycle tracking . Expert ultrasound operators are specialist doctors with better equipment and generally more experience in using ultrasounds . While the physical operation of an ultrasound machine is learned quickly , these specialists are experienced in observing minute details about your body , or the unborn child that could be developing inside you . <h> Hysterosalpingogram <p> A hysterosalpingogram is a diagnostic procedure designed to observe and test the uterus and fallopian tubes . Fluid is inserted into the uterus via a tiny tube inserted into the cervix . As long as you have a skilled operator this is barely more painful than a pap smear , however novice operators can make it teeth-clenchingly painful . <p> Your vagina may be swabbed , although not all operators think this is necessary . A speculum and torch are then used to guide the operator as they pass a fine tube into the cervix . Fluid is injected through the tube and a tiny balloon is inflated at the opening of the cervix to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultrasound to observe the fluid as it fills the womb and flows into the fallopian tubes . Dye , or sparkling fluid known as a levovist , can be used to test the openness or patency of the fallopian tubes . The levovist appears brightly coloured on an ultrasound screen , allowing the operator to check for blockages . <p> From this procedure , doctors can assess : <p> The volume of the uterus <p> The presence , size and location of any polyps , fibroids or septums . <p> The openness of the fallopian tubes <p> There is a minor risk of fainting after this procedure , due to an electrolyte imbalance caused by the fluids injected into the womb . While it should not be a painful procedure , it is suggested that you get someone to drive you home afterwards . <h> Semen Analysis <p> Sperm quality , volume and motility needs to be assessed at regular intervals through the fertility process . This is done by the collection of ejaculate , which needs to be tested while it is still warm . Sperm is collected , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom . It must then be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible . The sperm sample should be kept in a cosy pocket , or tucked inside clothing close to the skin , to keep it warm . <p> Different labs have varying guidelines for preparing for the test . Generally , the male should not have sex or masturbate for two days prior to the day of sperm collection . This is to ensure an accurate representation of his body 's ability to produce sperm . <p> Sperm production can be adversely affected by illness and environmental factors . If your partner has had the flu , a virus , or any illness involving raised body temperatures , they should allow about a month for their body to recover . Spas , saunas and long hot baths should be avoided as they too will damage sperm production . <p> This is your partner 's chance to feel the awkwardness you routinely endure as part of the fertility journey . While men are not usually good at expressing their feelings , they will be struggling with fear and inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shooting blanks " and just being tested is a threat to their manhood . This is your opportunity to repay all the gentle support they 've given you through test after test . Do whatever it takes to boost your sweetheart 's ego through this harrowing process . If a poor result is received , he will need to be retested in a few months . Make sure he is healthy and 
##108051 <h> C--- does not have to be the dirtiest word <p> LAST week was ( and please do n't take this the wrong way because it really was , quite literally ) a c--t of a week . First the City of Melbourne sent its fearless officers to tear down posters advertising an art exhibition called C---s . <p> Then Jane Fonda , bless her septuagenarian get-out-of-jail-free card , let the c-bomb drop on the US Today show during a discussion of the play The Vagina Monologues , to which she had been asked to contribute a speech titled with the offending word . <p> " I said , ' I do n't think so , I 've got enough problems ' , " Fonda said by way of explaining why she declined the offer , nonetheless forcing NBC into a grovelling apology to viewers . <p> Now , to call someone a c--t could be to call them a coot . That 's could but , clearly , not . Those coy little dashes exist to obscure the confronting reality , reinforced by last week 's double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the English language 's most insulting , heinous , dirty word is a slang term for female genitalia . <p> Contemporary language is seasoned with all sorts of expletives that are infiltrating the mainstream . Take c--- 's ostensible male equivalents , prick , cock and dick ? no longer any shock value or asterisks there . Even in an august newspaper such as this , and depending on the benevolence of individual subeditors , we might even be able to get the word f--- to fly in its unannotated form , although usually in the context of quotes from fey British film directors or secret tapes of police force members . <p> Auditioning a new , more acceptable colloquial term for girlie bits that does n't contain the world 's worst insult is problematic . There 's something so prim about vagina ? as Germaine Greer once pointed out , it refers only to an internal section of the female anatomy , without the " fun bits " . And anyway , it means " sword sheath " in Latin . Pussy 's too porn ; clacker ? well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like locomotives should perhaps be abandoned . <p> But to find an alternative is to blame the victim . Poor little c--t used to be a perfectly acceptable anatomical word until its criminal femaleness cast it into the seventh circle of hell . Church records dating back to the 11th century reveal English surnames that incorporate the word , including Bele Wydecunte and Robert Clevecunt ; Gropecunte Lane was in London 's red light district around 1230 . Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales , written around 1390 , used the quaint " queynte " , possibly as a cheeky way of circumventing its growing naughtiness . Shakespeare , ever the fan of the bawdy play on words , did something similar in Hamlet , and Twelfth Night . <p> But its use as an insult was a distinctly 20th century development . And is it really happenstance that c--t rather than cock became the nuclear bomb of profanities ? Or is it somehow related to the fact that while most people are familiar with the concept of misogyny , its male equivalent ? misandry ? is in danger of dropping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fighting back with reclaiming the word , much like nigger among some African-Americans and queer among gays . Greer , who once published an essay titled Lady , Love Your C--t , changed her tune several years ago on erasing its shock value by using it as the standard term for vagina . " I tried to get people to say it , I tried to take the malice out of it . It did n't work and now in a way I 'm perversely pleased because it meant that it kept the power . " <p> Greer , however , is preternaturally fearless . <p> The Vagina Monologues celebrates its 10th birthday this year and its premise remains as relevant as ever : that even vagina remains a word polite women do n't like to say in public . That 's why the writer , Eve Ensler , gets her audience to scream " c--t " at a pivotal moment in each performance . <p> The artist at the centre of last week 's City of Melbourne censorship escapade , Greg Taylor , who maintains that his art works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than generate free publicity for the show ) , said : " The word itself is n't offensive . It was once such a noble word and it 's just been turned around into the most insulting thing on this planet . " <p> And would that protector of public morals , Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer , who primly assured his constituents , " I did n't look closely at the images " , have got his ceremonial robes all in a twist over Puppetry of the Penis , or a book such as Dick for a Day ? <p> Perhaps the time is n't right to slap the word c--t up on billboards in a bid to desensitise the general public , but a little more thought ought to go into the reflexive " ugh " it seems to engender . Because some times , even rude words need to fight for equal opportunity . <p> **27;9393;TOOLONG http : **35;9422;TOOLONG ... theage.com.au The Age 2008-02-19 C--- does not 
##115651 <p> The debate and the television series that continues to divide and captivate a nation returns tonight with Act II of I 'm A Celebrity , Go Back To Where You Came From . Last night we were introduced to the prominent Australian personalities , Angry Anderson , Catherine Deveny , Michael Smith , Imogen Bailey , Allan Asher and Peter Reith , in the " first stage of their immersion " during which they came face-to-face with a taste the journey that 0.5% of the world 's 10.55 million refugees seeking asylum face in order to escape some of the most dangerous , war-torn cities in the world , . <p> Tonight we return to said dangerous , war torn cities , Kabul and Mogadishu , for our second stop on the way to our " Final Destination . " Not sure where that 's going to be , but hopefully it 'll be a much nicer , less bigoted place than that from which we departed . <p> 8:35 - We begin tonight 's program in Kabul ( that is some srs jrnlst talk right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ) where the threat of violence comes as something of a surprise to Peter Reith . Catherine Deveny , on the other hand , makes a bold claim when she says " if I go down , please film it . " This is n't the Snuff Broadcasting Station Catherine , so that probably wo n't happen . For security reasons , the prominent personalities ( guests ? stars ? subjects ? ) are reissued with their mobile phones . Deveny checks her @mentions to no avail . : ( <p> 8:39 - A young girl , Tarana , is telling a horrifying tale that involved the massacre of 74 people , which she somehow miraculously survived . She 's twelve years old now and " hopes things will improve so she can move out of this place . She just wants life to be good . " Catherine , Angry , Peter and myself are all visibly distraught . Cut to a flashback of Anderson saying " I do n't care about your story " , a statement he is seriously reconsidering now in the face of such needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent set out to find Abdi 's - from last night 's episode - house , a place he has n't visited in over twenty years since fleeing as a thirteen year old . They 're using a satellite image and a friendly man in a green shirt to get an approximate sense of where they need to head . The group locate a long-lost cousin ( or brother ? ) of Aalima , the woman who cooked dinner for our trio . It 's discovered that after twenty years , Abdi 's house still stands , which is pretty miraculous considering the apparent Somalian fondness for demolition . We meet Abdi 's uncle and family , providing a moment of hope in an otherwise " hopeless " place . <p> 8:54 - Still in Somalia , the group are forced to enact evasive manoeuvres when faced with a road block . Surrounded with guns , the group make a quick dash from the vehicle to a children 's hospice . At the sudden opening of a door , Imogen promptly shits herself . Inside we meet Alma , a seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can only stay in the charity 's care for a maximum of four months . We meet Tony Burns , an Australian who runs the charity , and Tony says 41% of Somalian children are malnourished , with at least 200 dying everyday . " It 's heartbreaking because not enough is being done for them " says Bailey at the sight of dozens of fly-covered children . " I do n't know what the right word for it is , but I feel like shit . " You and I both , Imo . " My current life seems like a pretty selfish , bullshit life to me . " You . And . I. Both . Imo . <p> 9:01 - Michael boards a plane and has already been propelled to action ( aviation puns ) .

##121450 <h> History of Phuket <p> Throughout it 's history , Phuket has always been a welcoming beacon , a jewel set in the crown of the Andaman Sea . From the arrival of the 1st Century BC Indian merchants to today 's vacationers and retirees , Phuket 's beauty and mystique have been a siren song for those seeking paradise . <p> Even Hollywood has n't been immune to the beckoning of the Phuket region , capturing breathtaking vistas on film in the classic James Bond movie , The Man With The Golden Gun , and more recently , The Beach , on location at the Phi Phi islands , just off Phuket 's coast . <h> Early history <p> Early in Phuket 's history , original locals included now-extinct tribes of pygmies , who called the fertile , virgin triple-canopy rainforest home . Comprised of hunters and gatherers , the pygmies lived off what Mother Nature and their heavenly surroundings provided : meat , fruit , nuts and berries . <p> Other early inhabitants included the chow lair , a nomadic people populating the coastal areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seafood . <h> A trading post <p> Phuket was known for centuries as an important trading post on the eastern shore of the Bay of Bengal , with busy ports seeing shiploads of goods come and go , along with their merchant crews from Arab and Malay worlds , as well as India , Burma , China and Siam . <p> When large tin deposits were discovered in the 16th Century , Phuket was colonized by Portuguese , French , and British traders looking to set up shop . A century later , the British were contemplating control of the vital trade passage through the Strait of Malacca , using Phuket as their base of operations . <h> The heroines of Phuket <p> The British sent Captain Francis Light to scout the area , and Light became embroiled in Phuket 's most important historical event when he spotted Burmese forces returning to Phuket . Just a year earlier , Thai forces had successfully defended Phuket , fending off the Burmese intruders . <p> Captain Light alerted the governor 's office of the impending invasion . Unfortunately , unbeknownst to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kunying Jan , took the reins , and together with her brave sister Mook , assembled Phuket 's military . As legend tells it , the two women spearheaded an operation that disguised local women as men , making the military force seem like a huge , impenetrable and invincible army to the Burmese . <p> In the face of a formidable foe , the Burmese still attacked , but quickly withdrew after a short siege . Kunying Jan and her sister were awarded the ' Thao Thep Kasattri ' by King Rama I , a title of nobility usually reserved for royalty . <p> The Heroines Monument on display at the Thalang roundabout pays homage to these two courageous women who are a part of Phuket 's history . <h> The tin boom <p> Tin-mining took off with a bang in Phuket in the 19th Century , attracting thousands of Chinese laborers looking for work from the European mine owners . A traditional folk , the Chinese workers brought their spiritual beliefs and culinary talents with them , teaching the locals and passing them along . Eventually , inter-marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the ' Baba ' . <p> With roots firmly in the tin mines of Phuket , many of the Baba became merchants themselves , and brought their newfound riches to Phuket Town . They built mansions and mammoth homes for their families , showcasing fine Portuguese and Chinese accents and influences . <p> Many of these incredible ' Sino-Portuguese ' architectural displays have been restored to their early splendor , and today visitors can enjoy their fine craftsmanship and get a sense of history with a walk through Phuket Town 's Old Town district . <h> Beachcombers and bathers <p> Tin and rubber held fast as Phuket 's dominant industries for years , until the first elite sun-seekers appeared in the 1970 's , coming to play in Phuket 's topaz waters and bask in the warm sun at a sparkling new Club Med in Hat Kata . Phuket also became more accessible by air from the mainland , with Thai Airways offering daily flights from Bangkok , opening the door even wider for tourism . <p> The tourism industry spread like wildfire throughout the island , with the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patong . <p> Swarms of tourists , from heiresses and Oscar-winners to everyday , average people , visited Phuket over the years , bringing in the tourist dollars and keeping the industry strong until the Tsunami hit the island on December 26 , 2004 , leaving carnage in its wake , a dark day in the history of Phuket . <h> The Tsunami -- death and destruction <p> The hardest hit areas included popular Patong Beach and several other west coast towns , which suffered major destruction and killed 250 people . Phuket 's economy sputtered briefly , and within about a year , Patong had rebuilt - a shining new Phoenix rising out of the ashes . <p> Just a year later , few scars of the damage remained , and 80% of the tourist business returned to Phuket , jump-starting resort development once again . <h> Island paradise <p> Patong and Phuket Town , along with the surrounding magical Phi Phi Islands bring visitors from around the globe to Phuket , giving them a tropical taste of life in paradise .

##123951 <p> Adelaide Crows coach Neil Craig is a man of unique vision . We know this because he has told the public as much on several occasions . Where Crows ' fans see a rabble who currently sit 14th on the AFL ladder with three wins from 12 games , Craig sees great things ahead . <p> " It 's the most exciting group I think this club has ever had . I can just see this group of players doing great things , " Craig said in April , after his side 's loss to the Blues . Even this weekend , after yet another loss , he was largely upbeat . " It 's an inexperienced team that I think is showing some really good signs , " he babbled . <p> Visionaries are great . Without them , the oceans would never have been sailed , the heavens conquered , nor the Snowy dammed for hydro power and water . But true visionaries are rare . It 's one thing to claim to be able to see over the horizon . Another entirely to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face . Which brings us to Julia Gillard ... <p> Like the embattled Adelaide Crows coach , who in 2006 was hailed as the saviour of his underperforming club , Prime Minister Gillard was hailed as a stuttering government 's great redeemer just a year ago this week . <p> As we all know , Kevin Rudd said that tackling climate change was , quote unquote , " the greatest moral challenge of our time " . He soon backed out of this and other grand visions , and came to be seen as both a ditherer and a bully . <p> In stepped Gillard , boldly proclaiming on the day of her ascension that " a good government ( Rudd 's ) was losing its way " . With a line like that , you 'd expect her to have shown us all exactly what a visionary government looked like . <p> Has n't happened . <p> Admittedly , the PM is hamstrung by Labor 's fragile alliance with the independents and Greens , which forced her backflip over the carbon tax . <p> She is also falling victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell her , it 's hard to kick goals when you 're desperately defending your own end of the park . <p> The thing is , Gillard no doubt does have something resembling a grand vision . She articulates it woefully , but it 's something to do with changing Australia 's energy base so that our economy is not based on carbon -- a transformation which will keep us competitive with the big , smart First World economies . <p> As David Penberthy pointed out yesterday , the PM is pinning her hopes on a $12 million PR campaign which will show that the big end of town will cop the brunt of the costs associated with a carbon tax . <p> That 's a sign she 's already lost the battle . She should n't be trying to smooth it out , smooth it out , smooth it out . She should save the $12 million and stand there defiantly and say : " You know what ? This carbon tax thing is going to cost us all a bit . But it 's worth it and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing too . Yesterday he tried to back track , saying : " It 's an exciting challenge to build this team , but it 'll be scary for our supporters for a period of time . " He should have used that line from the get go , rather than pretend all would be both hunky and dory any minute now . <p> Remember how John Howard 's popularity dipped after the introduction of the GST ? He stuck by it , calmly explained why we needed it , and the medicine was n't so bad after all . And his popularity soared again . <p> The problem with the approach taken by both the Adelaide Crows coach and the prime minister is that they 've both tried for too long to pretend there will be no immediate pain , which there clearly will be . <p> They should have ' fessed up early , then held fast . Then if they get dumped , they get dumped . At least they would have shared their vision with us along the way rather than staring mistily into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Because it 's not there . <p> In other news , the team that whipped Neil Craig 's Crows this weekend was Julia Gillard 's team , the Western Bulldogs . The PM might take heart from the fact the Dogs were down by 22 points at quarter time but went on to win by 30. <h> 79 comments <h> Erick says : <p> The difference between Howard 's GST and Gillard 's carbon tax is the mandate . <p> Howard took the GST to an election , and won a clear mandate to introduce it . Gillard took ' No Carbon Tax ' to an election and won a clear mandate not to introduce it . <p> Gillard held the voters in contempt , and no amount of self-justification will fix that . Now she 's stuffed if she passes the tax , and stuffed if she drops it . That 's the price of lying to the voters and holding them in contempt . <h> Super D says : <p> 07:11am 20/06/11 <p> With a little luck we 'll get to vote on the carbon tax sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 07:27am 20/06/11 <p> By the same logic , Howard had no mandate for Weapons of Mass Destruction , the Iraq war , Off-shore Processing of Asylum Seekers , Temporary protection Visas or Work Choices . Likewise , Abbott had no mandate to change Coalition policy on Climate Change . By the way , when is the anniversary of Turnbull 's assassanation by Abbott ? <h> TimB says : <p> 08:08am 20/06/11 <p> No Mick . <p> Tell me , before an election did Howard utter anything like these statements ? <p> " There will be no Iraq War under the government I lead " " There will be no WorkChoices under the government I lead " " There will be no offshore-processing of asylumn seekers under the government I lead " <p> What is it with idiot lefties and false analogies ? <p> PS . " Likewise , Abbott had no mandate to change Coalition policy on Climate Change . " <p> This is even more stupid . Of course Tony had a bloody mandate . Why would you say he did n't ? Because you do n't agree with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the majority agreed to his revised policy . In what demented , logic-deprived universe do you live in where a majority is *not* considered a mandate ? <h> Michael says : <p> 08:16am 20/06/11 <p> Mick S , you would have to let the folks know before the election and let them vote on the issue to have a mandate , events that arise during the term of government are handled by the party sometimes with consultation with the public and other times without consultation . <p> Jesus , learn a bit more than just the tagline " mandate " genius ! <h> Mahhrat says : <p> 08:46am 20/06/11 <p> Yeah sorry Mick S , you 've missed the target . <p> Whatever you think of either party or their leader , Erick 's quite right on this one . <p> By the way Ant , shame on you for sucking us into a political discussion using sports ! <h> Jay-ded says : <p> 10:31am 20/06/11 <p> Bring on the election ! <h> Anthony Sharwood says : <p> 01:14pm 20/06/11 <p> @mahrat . Sorry Buddy , sport is the prism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me <h> Ross says : <p> 02:07pm 20/06/11 <p> Erick , I agree there is an issue of ' mandate ' here , but I am wondering why such short-sightedness in our national ability to look at history . Rudd was elected with the population knowing full-well that there would be an Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) . However , this ended up being dumped because of an Opposition which kept voting down the legislation in the Senate ( which could have been used as a trigger for a double dissolution election , but Rudd was somewhat gutless ) . My point here is that whilst the proposed tax was a lie by Gillard , is is equally false to look for a ' mandate ' when examining the actions of Abbott and the Opposition . This should have been finalised several years ago but was blocked when a public was interested . Seriously , neither side of politics in this country is clean and people need to view all of them in the entire context and not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines . <h> Craig says : <p> 03:11pm 20/06/11 <p> @ Ryan <p> I 'm sure we 'll do great fiscally saving that $12 million by throwing $70 million to throw a " referendum " to salve Abbott 's self-superiority complex with a referendum that he 'll not abide by . <p> Cough , cough . <p> Pot , say hi to kettle . I 'm definitely sure that using $70million to " save " $12 million is a sign of ' great fiscal and economic management ' . Really . <p> You 're no better than Labor . Try again please . <h> Random says : <p> 03:17pm 20/06/11 <p> There 's another difference between the GST and the carbon tax . The GST was implemented by a Government that ACTUALLY WAS fiscally responsible AND delivered services as well as a $20 billion surplus - as distinct from Labor 's profligate spending , poor governance , and expensive bureaucracy that spends any potential surplus ! <p> If the Coalition ever did introduce a carbon tax , at least you 'd get the feeling it would be short term pain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedded with bureaucracy . <h> Marilyn Shepherd says : <p> 03:35pm 20/06/11 <p> He did not win a clear anything . He lost the popular vote by a long way and many democrats were elected to stop him . <p> Do n't try and rewrite history sunshine . <p> The GST adds 6% without compensation from the cradle to the grave . The pollution tax is for a few years and adds 0.6% with compensation for the poor . <p> Do get a life old son <p> And actually the lie Dillard told is that she would n't charge a carbon tax because that was the policy anyway . <p> What I want to know is where was Howard 's mandate to send us chasing non-existent WMD in Iraq and how come the AWB were not charged with giving $300 million to Saddam after stealing it from the starving Iraqis . <h> RyaN says : <p> 05:10pm 20/06/11 <p> @Craig : it is not Abbott costing the taxpayer $70million on a referendum , that is Juliar Gillard who lied people in the previous election . " There will be no carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of further offense is her blatant disregard ( like the communist she is ) for the will of the people , hence she has to be pulled into line and the people heard . <p> Yes people Gillard 's lies and absolute abhorrent disdain for the will of the people by not seeking a mandate is going to cost you and I $70million . Thanks for pointing that out Craig . <h> acotrel says : <p> 06:30am 20/06/11 <p> @Anthony Who in the LNP has ' vision ' ? We 've seen no evidence of a platform with a vision for Australia 's future .

Wait for the carbon dioxide tax and you can guarantee another . <h> ThE BadGeR says : <p> 10:55am 20/06/11 <p> ryan Guess you missed the part where Labor kept us out of the GFC and made us the envy of the world . <h> Sony B Goode says : <p> 11:21am 20/06/11 <p> acotrel , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RyaN says : <p> 12:21pm 20/06/11 <p> @ThE BadGeR : not at all mate , I realise that it was John Howards surplus and good economic management that set us up to sail through the GFC even with these idiots at the helm spending money faster than water with nothing to show for it other than dead bodies . <h> Craig says : <p> 12:35pm 20/06/11 <p> Neither party has a vision at all . IF you 've been keeping tabs on Tony 's circus today , he says that even if somehow people vote YES for a carbon tax in a referendum , he says he wo n't be bound by it . <p> I 'm against the carbon tax , but if you call a referendum to the tune of $70 million , you have every obligation to be BOUND BY THE OUTCOME . <p> You Lib trolls are complete jokes , there 's nothing at all to differentiate you from Labor , not one bit . Like your leader , you folks need to stop wasting peoples ' time with your inane and worthless dribble . <h> LeonT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was John Howards surplus and good economic management that set us up to sail through the GFC " <p> Yeah it was pure economic genius and good management to sell productive assets and then use the proceeds to retire debt and give out as election bribes rather than invest in nation building exercises that have a higher internal rate of return than the interest on the debt . <h> RyaN says : <p> 02:38pm 20/06/11 <p> @LeonT : and what cost effective and well managed " nation building " have we to show for this massive debt that we now have thanks to Labor ?

Our manufacturing costs are too high . d ) Left a 20b surplus and 50b future fund , Labor took 6 months to blow the lot . e ) you do n't live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanities student or public servant perhaps ? <h> Sony B Goode says : <h> Gerry says : <p> 12:31pm 20/06/11 <p> Nothing warms my heart more than seeing the right wing writhing in anguish and expelling nonsense as a by-product . <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <p> 02:31pm 20/06/11 <p> Actually I must admit that I cribbed a few arguments from Thomas L Friedman 's book , Hot , Flat and Crowded : Why we need a green revolution and how it can renew America . His solution is actually a free market one with venture capital providing the innovation as long as government provides the targets and goals . The one thing the free market hates at the moment is the uncertainty over renewable energy , carbon taxes , ETS etc . <h> David C says : <p> 03:08pm 20/06/11 <p> so tell them no carbon tax . isnt that certain ? Business deals with uncertainty all the time <h> Gregg says : <p> 07:34am 20/06/11 <p> " The thing is , Gillard no doubt does have something resembling a grand vision . She articulates it woefully , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base so that our economy is not based on carbon -- a transformation which will keep us competitive with the big , smart First World economies . " You have great trust Ant in someone who does not have the technical skills in technology , international politics - rather be in a schoolroom were her words and not much by way of economics to form a grand vision based on what a lot of highly paid people will give her reports on , to her liking of course but probably with so much jargon she 'll not understand anyway . <p> As for the energy base , you can ask yourself easily what would it be without coal ! - China , that big supposedly smart economy building new coal fired power stations regularly and some of the first world now questioning nuclear whilst many countries hanging on to the first world have economies floundering so badly , it is probably only a matter of time before the pack crumbles , the domino theory still very much in play . <p> She should save the $12 million and stand there defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax thing is going to cost us all a bit . But it 's worth it and here 's why ... " First of all , it would be a great vision to get some home truths out there ; like : . what is this carbon thing . and just what is a bit ! and does that include power shortages as older power stations start to crumble ? Then the why can be reasoned . But with an offsider like the limey green lime Bobbing about , I do not like Gizzard 's chances of ever reasoning too much other than the Lodge was nice and retirement paid for by taxpayers will be exceedingly comfortable . <h> Jay says : <p> 08:01am 20/06/11 <p> The Crows sacked Gary Ayres as soon as they lost a few games . He was effectively rebuiliding his list but the Crows hierarchy gave him no opportunity . Neil Craig is only still coaching because he is a South Australian . Julia Gillard has demonstrated that she is so out of her depth . Labor should replace her with the only person who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he is a heretic and does not believe in man made climate change ... Oops . <h> JC says : <p> 09:18am 20/06/11 <p> the current AFC is like the Labor Party -- made up of useless hacks , ex players -- Steven Trigg as CEO ? ? ? ? WTF ? ? ? -- - noone from the outside is allowed in -- its a South Australian thing -- Heaven forbid they ask Paul Roos , Mick Malthouse or Bomber Thompson to have a go -- we 'll try Bickley or Goodwin FFS ! ! ! -- the only person who promises more and delivers less than Joolya is Neil Craig -- and like Jools hopefully gone by seasons end ! ! ! ! <h> Tony of Poorakistan says : <p> 11:06am 20/06/11 <p> Unfortunately , whilst Craig is a bloody good general coach and definetely the best fitness coach in the country , he is no good on game day . <p> He simply refuses to ( or ca n't ) react to opposition changes . Look at all the games where the Crows play wonderfully for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes some changes and they catch up . <p> The classic was a few weeks ago when Malthouse patently told Sidebottom to go down to the goals and sent a rocket up Thomas to get him running down the wing rather than standing around blowing kisses at the boys in the stand and they creamed us in the second half . <h> Fiddler says : <p> 02:54pm 21/06/11 <p> And nuclear power . And is a realist . I think he is in the wrong party . He and Turnbull should swap <h> TimB says : <p> 08:13am 20/06/11 <p> " She should save the $12 million and stand there defiantly and say : " You know what ? This carbon tax thing is going to cost us all a bit . But it 's worth it and here 's why ... " " <p> She could have done that . Except there 's no way for her to fill in the end of that statement with anything that ca n't be instantly refuted by basic logic and common sense . Hence the desperate spinning we see now . <h> atthepub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Australian nation like the Adelaide Crows will prosper eventually , but they will need to get rid of their current respective ' coaches ' to do it . <p> Anyone can see that Neil Craig , while being a competent and technically savvy coach , does n't have the ability to inspire his charges to perform the deeds they need to do in order to succeed . They will never die in a ditch for him , which is a spirit that players under coaches like Malthouse and Sheedy could always generate . <p> Similarly , Julia has no ability to inspire anyone , and she also suffers more because she does n't even have the entry level skills for ' coaching ' of competence and knowledge that people like Craig have . <h> Holly says : <p> Funny - I 've heard Julia Gillard says pretty much those words about the price on carbon on many occasions , but as the saying goes there are none so deaf as those who do not wish to hear . <p> Now we have Tony Abbott threatening the country with a costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still hoping to seize power and is indeed but a " heartbeat " away from doing just that . In these circumstances it is beholden on the media to subject the man to as much close scrutiny as they do Julia Gillard . So instead of just subjecting us to the nightly vision of Tony in some workplace telling us that we will all be ruined - please pin him down to the facts , including those on his own direct action policy . <p> For a start how can parliamentarians vote on whether to hold a plebiscite now when they do not have the information yet to make a decision . <h> L. says : <p> " Now we have Tony Abbott threatening the country with a costly exercise in futility in a non binding plebiscite . " <p> " exercise in futility " .. ? ? Gillard has stated numerous times that the majority of Australians support her policy . How is confirming that one way or another once and for all a waste of time .. ? ? <h> acotrel says : <p> 10:15am 20/06/11 <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tony in some workplace telling us that we will all be ruined - please pin him down to the facts , including those on his own direct action policy .

What gets me is that anyone would be so irresponsible that they 'd vote for him ! THINK you bastards , THINK ! ! <h> Vaunted says : <p> 10:28am 20/06/11 <p> Holly , the facts here are not whether global warming is happening , it 's ( 1 ) whether anthropogenic warming is significant to anyone other than those who make their livings from exploiting ' the science ' , and ( 2 ) whether crippling Australia 's economy is going to have any significant bearing on the world 's climate . Anything else is socialist claptrap with another agenda entirely ; one which the ' none so deaf ' Greens/Getup/ABC brigade never debate and do n't actually wish to discuss . Well , this is a democracy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% of the vote ragbags a disproportionate measure of power . What is undeniable is that Julia lied and cheated and connived to win office , a repugnant fact which we most of us can probably wear to some extent , but on this urgent , fundamental issue every Australian who cares about integrity and fair play should be standing up to demand his or her rightful say . " We 'll all be ruined ' " may well sound dramatic but it 's arguably true . The cost of a referendum pales by comparison with the cost of an unreasonable tax on emissions , imposed by people who are rather obviously bent on deconstructing our economy and will do or say whatever it takes to make that happen . <h> Matt says : <p> 02:04pm 20/06/11 <p> What are your thoughts on the $12 million ALP advertising blitz then , Holly ? <h> My Say says : <p> 03:36pm 20/06/11 <p> For my two cents . I think that the government should spend a few hundred million educating the deniers about the reality of global warming . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the few hundred million Howard spent lying to us about the GST and raising prices 10 percent across the board . <h> Mikeymike says : <p> 04:19pm 20/06/11 <p> @ acotrel : <p> You missed a couple of words from your last line . <p> " THINK like me you bastards , THINK LIKE ME ! !

This is the AFL . Good set up and competent coach ? Welcome to years of late draft picks . You need to take the job just after someone utterly incompetent and reap the fruits of their bad coaching ... <h> Sony B Goode says : <p> 10:41am 20/06/11 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assassinated an elected leader , they were not elected , they had to form government on lies and deception , and they have no plan for this country that does n't involve endless prosperity destruction .

Should you do so , you will find assassinate means : to injure or destroy unexpectedly and treacherously ( Websters Dictionary and others ) as well as the homicidal meaning . <h> Robert Paris says : <p> 02:14pm 20/06/11 <p> @Mick S Quote : By the way , when is the anniversary of Turnbull 's assassination by Abbott ? <p> This is a ridiculous comment , ( A ) Turnbull was not elected as the leader of the Liberal party by the people of Australia , he was not the PM elected by the people either , so it was no betrayal at all . ( B ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and the ALP deposed of him anyway . Personally I did not like Rudd so I could not care two figs , but many did and they have a right to be pissed off . Not so with Turnbull . Besides ... he 's a silvertailed merchant banker snob that adheres to Maurice Strong and Al gores bogus Cap and trade system which is being contradicted by true climate science ... not the the bogus ones Gillard sets up full of economists and what not ! ! . BTW Maurice Strong ... who delivered the speech on the need for world government , Agenda 21 etc ... to the UN in 1992 is an OIL BILLIONAIRE ! ! Yet he started the " No Fossil Fuels " movement , The Green Movement etc ... etc ... Hows that for total Hypocrisy ! ! Al Gore recently sold his mansion with 5 fireplaces ... I guess he is not worried about a little extra carbon . Unless your nest is being feathered by the ALP in some way . you will regret the day this tax comes in , over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some say .. " Bring it ON " All I can say is ... explain to your grandchildren why they have no freedoms anymore and are living under a socialist government , never mind the blue skies Kate , the Tax wont cure that but it will squeeze the poorer section of Australia dry and then the middle class after that ... bit by bit . <h> Matt says : <p> 02:18pm 20/06/11 <p> You 're all wrong . You all need to focus on the real issue here ... I think the umpiring on the weekend meant that Craigy 's boys were pushing sh*t uphill from the get-go . It 's not easy to build your vision when the core is eroded by those white ( yellow ) maggots . <h> Robert Paris says : <p> 02:48pm 20/06/11 <p> Details on Direct Action are largely irrelevant . Its not a glued in policy like the Carbon Tax , once the Carbon Tax is in , its very dissicult to remove , whereas direct action is relatively easy to remove . Even Turnbull admits this . The Carbon Tax is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shady reputation . Educate yourself , Gillard is of the same socialist ilk , Abbott for all his faults is not , and he still respects individual rights . <h> Monty says : <p> 03:08pm 20/06/11 <p> Bob Browne from the Greens orchestrated the Carbon Tax ... Gillard and the Labor Party are following promises that kept them in government ... Browne is the silent partner wielding his new born power behind ALP policy .... as for the Crows they are a lost cause this season I would n't waste your breath ... ! <h> The Liberal Loafer says : <p> 05:02pm 20/06/11 <p> Its the Labor Party and its well planned organised vision for the future . Or Its the mass media &; its lack of vision trying to hoist its creation , The Liberal National Party Loafers into federal government for no reason except that they could . The Liberal National Party only rely on mass media preferences to get elected . They never do , say , think or act on anything . The Liberals are billionaire playboys !

They get government for nothing off the mass media . <h> kidday says : <p> 02:28pm 21/06/11 <p> the neil craig situation is just like john worsfold situation a couple of years ago . we lost a lot of our stars ( mcleod , goodwin , edwards , burton , etc ) and have replaced them with inexperienced players . west coast lost judd , cousins and kerr and look what happened to them ! the same thing ! the slide was inevitable , and changing coaches now would be a very bad move long term because the younger players are still getting their heads around the current game plan set by craigy . our team now is essentially like the gold coast squad . lots of inexperienced players ( mind you , some are a little more experience than GC ) , but have some proven players trying to lead them in VB , vince , doughty , thompson , etc. every team goes through rebuilding phases , if every team who " unexpectedly " finished close to bottom cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 4 coaches a year ! like craig has pointed out , we are showing glimpses of our potential , and in a couple of years when we can play it out for a full game , ( assuming we are nt dealt a bad hand with injuries ) we will see real results . if you came into this year expecting finals , you obviously did nt take a realistic approach given our list as it were . i do nt know why the media is purposely painting craig in a negative light now he s having his FIRST bad season , but you all are falling for it . how come there are no figures on the good things that are happening around the club ? its all negative during a rebuilding phase . regardless of whos coach , we will be bottom 8 next year , and will be a threat in 2013 unless our players improve quicker than expected . i do nt know about any of you clowns , but ( an estimated ) two seasons in the bottom 8 in return for another 7 seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine premiership contenders is a good deal in my books . try and remember between ' 06 and ' 09. craigy opened up a real window of opportunity there , and assuming we get through this phase with him , we 'll have another one in no time . <h> bj says : <p> 06:01pm 21/06/11 <p> Well said Kidday . I totally agree , however as Ant says , it was a mistake of Craigy 's not to lay all the cards on the table early in order to provide realistic expectations for the season . He is now becoming aware of his mistake . <p> I 'm also a little concerned that the more experienced players you refer to are not stepping up yet . VB , Doughty , Vince , Reilly .... they are not rookies anymore and have enough game time to be playing much more consistent footy and

##145052 <h> Japan thinks it is Greece but can not remember 1997 <p> Last week ( August 10 , 2012 ) the Japanese Parliament approved a bill to double the sales tax ( from 5 per cent to 10 per cent ) over the next three years . It is a case of dj vu . We have been there before . The economy suffers a major negative private spending shock . The government 's budget deficit increases as tax revenue collapses . The outstanding government debt rises more quickly than in the recent past . The rising government deficit supports a recovery in real GDP growth . The conservatives start shouting that the government will run out of money , that interest rates will soar and inflation surge and life as we know will end . The government raises the sales tax and cuts back spending . Real GDP growth collapses , tax revenue falls and the deficit and debt ratio continue to rise . We are back in Japan in 1997 -- but the only problem is that we are playing out the same story in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forgotten about 1997 . This has been the main agenda of the new Prime Minister since he took office in September 2011 . There was some political gymnastics to get the bill through with the PMs own party objecting to the increases on the grounds that " it would hurt struggling economic recovery after last year 's natural disasters " ( Source ) <p> The opposition ( LDP ) agreed to the hike in return for a new election . Which suggests they care more about getting another chance at power than they do about the fortunes of the economy . <p> The Wall Street Journal article ( August 11 , 2011 ) -- Japan Raises Sales Tax to Tackle Debt -- reported the decision of the Japanese government but used what appeared to be a news story to go into full-bore propaganda mode with all sorts of unsustainable claims about the state of Japan 's fiscal situation . <p> The WSJ say that : <p> The hard-fought tax increase shows how it is possible for advanced democracies -- struggling to curb government borrowing and adjust fiscal policies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- to cut government borrowing . <p> But it also highlights the difficulties . Despite the tax increase , Japan 's spending is still expected to far exceed government revenue for years , and analysts say more tax increases and benefit cuts are needed to address budget shortfalls . <p> The only reasonable interpretation of a citizen living beyond their means is when they are spending more than they are earning in a flow sense . The earning could come from drawing down prior saving , selling real or financial assets or from labour and other income . <p> However this gap occurs , the citizen is running down their net financial assets and typically increasing their indebtedness . That is a finite situation for any individual because as the users of the currency they are financially constrained -- meaning they have to fund their spending at all times from their revenue sources and then from borrowing . <p> There are life-cycle justifications for citizens going into debt early in life ( for example , to purchase a house ) and then over time going into a net saving position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole can also be in a deficit and accumulating debt as a result . The private sectors in many countries were in this position prior to the crisis unfolding in 2007-08 after a credit-binge promoted by the out-of-control and poorly regulated and supervised banking sector . <p> But then think about what it means for a currency-issuing government , such as Japan 's , to be " living beyond its means " . First , you have to ask what its means are defined as . That is an easy question to answer for a currency user because we just need to identify its revenue sources . <p> However , for a sovereign government , which is never revenue constrained because it is the monopoly issuer of the currency , there is no financial sense that can be applied to the term living beyond its means . <p> A government can push the economy so that it runs out of real resources that can be transformed into goods and services . But as long as there are real resources available for sale in yen then the Japanese government can not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector to " live within its means " is significantly influenced by the fiscal balance that the government runs . In the case of Japan which runs an external surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP , the private domestic sector could save overall even if the government ran a balanced budget . <p> But the desired overall saving for the private domestic sector is higher than 2 per cent of GDP which means that to maintain growth the government has to run a deficit . The deficit in this sense supports -- or in Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) parlance -- helps to finance the overall private domestic sector saving by ensuring that income growth is higher than would otherwise be the case . <p> So there is no logical content in the WSJ assessment quoted above . <p> There was an interactive application accompanying the article carrying the ominous title " Fiscal Reckoning " . Even the colours they used in their charts are dull ! <p> One of their charts compares Japan to Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Italy , the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eurozone nations operate within a different monetary system where the national governments have no currency-issuing capacity and , as such , their spending is constrained by their capacity to raise tax revenue and borrow from the private bond markets . <p> I qualify that statement because the ECB easily render the bond markets powerless in the Eurozone if it wanted ( and it has via the Securities Markets Program to some extent in particular country-specific cases ) . But it remains the national governments do not have that option . <p> Whenever you read an article or report that conflates pure fiat currency systems ( US , Japan , Korea ) with bastardised and constrained fiat mometary systems ( Eurozone ) you can conclude that they are either intent on misleading their readers or do not understand the difference and therefore disqualify themselves from commentary . <p> The WSJ article that : <p> The tax increase ... will slow the rate of issuance of Japanese government bonds . But the new revenue will quickly get consumed by projected growth in retirement-program spending for the country 's rapidly growing population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen as more politically contentious than the tax increase . <p> It is highly likely that the tax increases will increase the rate of issuance of Japanese government bonds because there will be negative impacts on the growth rate , which is in a rather precarious state at present . <p> The following graph is taken from data published by the IMF in their April 2012 World Economic Outlook database . It shows total general government spending ( red line ) and revenue ( blue line ) in billions of Yen on the left-hand axis and annualised real GDP growth ( grey bars ) on the right-hand axis from 1980 to 2011 . <p> The cyclicality of the deficit ( the difference between the blue and red lines ) is obvious . It is also obvious that when the economy returned to more solid growth from 2003 , the gap started narrowing only to widen again as the financial crisis took its toll on Japan 's export contribution . <p> I reconstructed the graph to highlight the decade 1990 to 2000 , which captures the last few years of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as revenue collapsed and the Japanese government ramped up expenditure growth to maintain real GDP growth . In 1993 , total tax revenue fell by 3.7 per cent and fell again in 1994 by 1.6 per cent . <p> Government spending growth increased by 6.4 per cent in 1993 , 2.8 per cent in 1994 , 4.1 per cent in 1995 and 4.8 per cent in 1996 -- which was a combination of cyclical effects ( automatic stabilisers ) and discretionary decisions to stimulate growth . <p> The fiscal support that was provided allowed the Japanese economy to avoid any negative real GDP growth ( on an annualised basis ) despite the massive collapse in private spending after the property collapse . That was a remarkable demonstration of the effectiveness of fiscal policy in offsetting fluctuations in private spending . <p> I would note that even though the budget deficit grew in the mid-1990s , it remains true that the Japanese government was overly cautious with respect to the provision of fiscal policy stimulus . They initially adopted an expansionary role which delivered modest real GDP growth . But , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IMF and OECD ( and the host of commentators who choose to repeat the propaganda coming out of those institutions ) . <p> The screams from the commentators were no more imaginative then than they are now . Today I saw headlines like : <p> 1 . Japanese Debt : A Slow-Motion Train Wreck <p> 2 . It is clear that Japan is in a deep hole , and that getting out of it is a daunting . <p> It is almost as if the world has stood still in the minds of these commentators because that is more or less what they were saying in 1996 . We were told then that Japan was about to collapse , that bond markets would shun the government , that interest rates and inflation would surge and that the government would run out of money . <p> The problem is that the Japanese government succumbed to the pressure and in 1997 introduced a contractionary budget , which included sales tax increases and cutbacks in spending . Expenditure growth was cut by 0.7 per cent in 1997 . <p> The results were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both directions . The economy , which was showing some signs of recovery given the fiscal support , nose-dived . <p> Moreover , the deficit expanded . Tax revenue fell by 3.4 per cent in 1998 and a further 1.9 per cent in 1999 . <p> The following graphs are also constructed from the IMF WEO database . <p> The behaviour of the public debt ratios is clearly cycle and certainly not exponential . <p> The next graph shows annual real GDP growth rate on the horizontal axis against the net national debt as a per cent of GDP on the vertical axis . The black line is the simple linear regression trend line , which suggests that when growth is strong the national net debt ratio declines and vice versa . <p> That is exactly what we would expect and why it is imperative to concentrate on growth rather than directly trying to reduce the financial ratios . We know from bitter experience that when the target of the policy becomes the financial ratios , real economic growth typically suffers and the financial ratios move in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses OECD data for the General government net debt interest payments as a percentage of nominal GDP . It shows the evolution of this data series for Japan and the OECD Total from 1994 to 2011 . <p> It is very hard to see any explosions . <p> The Ministry of Finance ( December 24 , 2011 ) -- published an interesting supplement to the FY2012 Budget -- Japan 's Fiscal Condition -- which contains detailed breakdowns of the components of the budget . The Appendix is similarly rich in detail but full of OECD- and IMF-style propaganda . <p> The following graph is taken from Figure ( 6 ) Trends in Interest Payments and Interest Rate in the Japan 's Fiscal Condition document . The horizontal axis are fiscal years . The Ministry of Finance point out that " Government Bonds Outstanding " includes reconstruction bonds issued in FY2011 and FY2012 ( FY2011 ; 11.6 trillion yen , FY2012 ; 12.7 trillion yen ) . " These are " secured by the revenues including the special tax for reconstruction . " <p> It shows that as the amount of outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown significantly ( in Trillion of Yen ) because there has been such an appetite for the bonds that yields have fallen to very low levels . <p> The WSJ article then rehearses the standard arguments without realising how lame they are . For example , after a foray in to the rating agencies they write : <p> Japan 's outstanding debt now equals 214% of its gross domestic product , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . <p> Japan has so far been spared the bond-market punishment facing the beleaguered euro zone . But fears of contagion from Europe , and warnings from credit raters of further downgrades , pushed Japanese politicians to set aside their usual fractiousness . Decision-making paralysis has prevented them from addressing a number of challenges , from boosting a long-slumping economy to crafting a new energy policy following the sharp loss of nuclear power after the Fukushima Daiichi accident . <p> Even within the logic that is used by the scaremongers ( that is , that sovereign debt matters ) there is some very dishonest reporting . The typical figure that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 229.9 per cent of GDP , the highest of the advanced nations . ( for example , UK has 82.5 per ecnt , US 102.0 per cent ) . <p> Once you take into account the consolidated position of the general government and the central bank and take away the financial assets that the government holds ( excluding shares and other equity and financial derivatives ) the net consolidated government and central bank debt in Japan in 2011 was 98.3 per cent of GDP ( UK was 60 per cent ; US was 62.8 per cent ) . <p> So that is a very different picture . <p> But moreover , you will see the Eurozone folly is introduced as substantive argument and the ratings agencies are held out as something Japan should be worried about . <p> Japanese government debt carries zero credit risk and nothing the ratings agencies do will alter that . There are always more bond investors lining up each bond auction to purchase Japanese government debt than the government issues . The same investors have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent for the last 20 years . <p> Over the following five years , the government forecasts spending will grow at a rate three times the annual increase in tax revenue . The big expense : Japan 's rapidly aging population . In 1995 , 14% of Japan 's population was at least 65 years old , while social security and related expenditures took up 17% of the budget . In 2010 , seniors were 23% of the population -- while senior-related spending ate up 29.5% of the budget . Absent radical change in entitlement programs , Japan 's demography is on track to swamp its finances . <p> Which means that the government will have to spend less on primary schools and pre-school facilities and more on personal care services for the aged . <p> The only issue is whether there will be sufficient real resources available for sale to facilitate the living standard aspirations of the ageing cohort . <p> There is a chance that living standards will have to fall -- but that will not be because the Japanese government will run out of the capacity to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency it issues . <p> Productivity growth clearly has to grow to maintain real standards of living when the dependancy ratio is rising . That is the issue that Japan has to broker . Trying to broker it by plunging the economy back into recession or another extended period of low growth will undermine the capacity of that nation to generate productivity growth . <p> The WSJ say that the demands of the older Japanese : <p> .. is creating irritation among many in their 20s and 30s who have had to make do with low-paying temporary jobs , as companies have responded to two decades of stagnation by reducing the number of young people they hire and cutting pay and benefits . <p> Which gets to the nub of the ageing society argument in relation to fiscal policy . The younger Japanese might gain political sway as they get older and decide their parents do not deserve the standard of public goods that might be available . <p> The political process might force the government to cut the standard of living for the older population . But that wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome of the political debate and lobbying by different demographic cohorts . <p> The WSJ article closes with this wonderful demonstration of ideology cum ignorance . They quote a 24-year-old as saying : <p> There will be no money left in the pension system when our turn comes in 40 years ... I am worried things are only going to get worse unless we do something . <p> There will always be " enough money " available for government spending if the government chooses to make use of its currency-issuing capacity . <p> The problem is that if the government is pressured to " do something " by the neo-liberals then the 24-year-old will face a future of poor employment prospects and the rest of it . <p> Conclusion <p> Japan is not Greece . It should work that out and avoid repeating its 1997 disaster . <h> 10 Responses to Japan thinks it is Greece but can not remember 1997 <p> " There are always more bond investors lining up each bond auction to purchase Japanese government debt than the government issues . " ... just to clarify this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " captive " Japanese investors ) , here is the latest on Bloomberg : <p> By Jeff Black Aug. 13 ( Bloomberg ) -- Germany 's Bundesbank said it plans to begin trading in Japanese government securities from its Tokyo office next month as part of the management of its foreign currency reserves . " The trading office will execute investment operations in Japanese government securities within the management of the foreign reserves of the Bundesbank , " the Frankfurt-based central bank said in an e-mailed statement today . " In addition the office will monitor and report on market developments . " <p> At 0.78% in 10yrs , no less ! ! <p> Shades of " Who will buy UST 's .... ? " <p> Sovereign currencies ( such as the AUD ) are uncommonly strong as money first goes from peripheral Europe to the Core , then off to areas where the capital will be most assuredly returned . It would seem there is more behind this , and that we are in for an interesting period ahead . It is also a tacit acceptance that inflation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry picking here , or at least only partial explanation . <p> Looking at the first graph : <p> If the GDP 1997 dip was caused by falling govt. spending then why no dip after much steeper and longer 2003-2004 fall in the govt. spending ? The collapse only came in 2008 arguably due to reasons unrelated with govt. spending ( the GFC ) . If MMT can not explain 2003-2004 then it probably also is incorrect about the 1997 . <p> I think Bill makes it fairly clear that the fall in economic growth and government revenues after 1997 was primarily due to the tax increase , with the 0.7 percent/GDP cut playing the minor role . The point is that the attempt to consolidate the budget acted counter-cyclically to Japan 's recovery <p> I think i get your point about 1997 . But why did n't the much sharper deficit reduction of 2003-2005 produce a recession ? Growth was stable until 2008 . There might have been an export surge or something , otherwise it is unexplained . I hope Bill can respond . <p> Public debt is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth " to the private sector as contrasted to " inside wealth " that is created within private sector . Then there is also " saving desires " that can change rather rapidly , change in which seems to correspond to mainstream term of " confidence " . <p> Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) does not suggest cuts in government spending ( net or otherwise ) will damage growth necessarily . It all depends on what other sources of spending growth are present . There are times when governments should make discretionary cuts in their net spending ( for example , when net exports are booming or private investment is strong ) . <p> In the case of Japan , there was no " cherry-picking " going on in my explanation . Private spending and net exports had recovered substantially after years of fiscal support after the 1997 debacle . <p> So by 2004 , public cuts were less damaging . However in 1997 with private spending still very fragile and the uncertainty of impact of the Asian crisis on exports , the last thing the Government should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same point holds now . <p> MMT does not indicate when GDP will fall as a consequence of reductions in government spending . If the private sector is conned by mainstream economists and politicians into believing that budget surpluses are desirable , it may increase its spending ( increased confidence ) to the extent necessary to more than offset the reduction in government spending -- thus enabling GDP to keep rising . But to do this , the private sector must increase its debt levels which , if the government keeps trying to run surpluses , leads to the unsustainable accumulation of private sector debt . Once this point is reached , private sector spending collapses , as does GDP . This is what happened in 2007 . Had the private sector in Japan , as well as in other nations , not increased its debt-fuelled spending ( largely consumption spending ) , the decline in GDP would have occurred earlier and the inevitable GDP recession would not have been as severe , albeit it could have been avoided altogether if central governments had been prepared to operate budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last comment was motivated by RonT 's comments . I also neglected to say that MMT is very good at predicting likely macroeconomic difficulties , especially when facilitated by the bad macroeconomic policies of currency-issuing central governments , but ca n't predict exactly when the difficulties are likely to emerge . That does n't make MMT any less relevant . Mainstream economists kept recommending fiscal policy stances in the 15-20 year period prior to the GFC that set economies up to fail , but were ' lucky ' enough for the undesirable nature of these policies to be masked by a debt-fuelled consumption binge that kept GDP bouyant and allowed central governments to achieve their budget targets . The fact that inevitable GDP recessions are often a lagged response to inappropriate fiscal policy is no doubt used by mainstream economists as a way to avoid criticism . After all , for most of the decade up to 2007 that the Aust Fed Govt ran budget surpluses , Aust 's GDP growth was strong , giving the false impression that macroeconomic policy was appropriate . It is still being used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasurer at the time ) was the best Treasurer Aust 's ever had . What the GDP growth masked was how the Fed Govt was setting the Aust economy up to fall into recession , and that the Aust economy was not rescued by strong exports to China and India , but by the new Fed Govt 's fiscal

##157750 <h> Divisions emerge in Bangkok climate change talks <p> The Institute 's Mark Bonner sends an update from recent days at the current Bangkok meetings on climate change . It 's deep and complex policy work , often difficult for outsiders to understand ; but critical to global agreements on climate change matters . <p> compliance - in that the Kyoto Protocol is seen by developing countries as essential to hold developed countries to their promises ( including enhanced emission reduction targets and finance ) as well as the preservation of the already agreed institutional arrangements ; <p> ambition - that is , the Ad-hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action ( AWG-ADP ) filling the emission reduction gap between current commitments and what the atmosphere needs for any chance of halting the average rise in temperature to below 2 o C. <p> A big challenge , and one that may haunt the negotiations at COP 18 in Doha later this year , is the fate of the AWG-LCA . The AWG-LCA was established to implement the Bali Action Plan ( BAP ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parties ( COP 13 ) in 2007 . BAP aims to encourage : a shared vision for longer-term considerations on mitigation and adaptation efforts , technology development and transfer , and finance . The BAP agendas of technology and finance are important to the CCS agenda . They include consideration of mechanisms that can enhance the means of accelerating technology deployment , and that can remove obstacles to , and provide financial and other incentives for , scaling up technologies to developing countries . <p> An informal group of the AWG-LCA met on Friday 31 August . This group seems to be totally divided on what the next steps might be . The AWG-LCA was given a year 's extension at COP 17 to complete its work program , after which it is to terminate at COP 18 . Any outstanding issues are to be re-tasked to an existing subsidiary body . There is clearly a major disagreement between developed and developing countries as to whether the AWG-LCA should seek another extension to finish its work program ( developing ) or to terminate ( developed ) . <p> The AWG-LCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parties ( held on 30 August ) as an informal note ( i.e. holds no status within the negotiating process ) identifying the issues that the AWG-LCA was tasked with at COP 16 ( Cancun ) . These issues included : <p> relationship between Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism ; and <p> consider additional functions for TEC and CTCN . <p> Issues 1 , 4 , and 5 are the outstanding issues . Interestingly , the facilitator 's information paper concluded with : " parties were of different views on the need to have a decision under the LCA on technology development and transfer at COP 18 " . <p> On Saturday 1 September , an AWG-LCA informal group also discussed finance issues . Similar to its technology cousin , this agenda is racked with divergent views as to whether recommendations to the COP are appropriate . An informal note was also drafted outlining three outstanding issues including : <p> financing arrangements between 2013 and 2020 ( after the Fast Start Finance ends in 2012 and long-term financing starts in 2020 ) ; <p> fast start finance ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views of the developed countries were that no decision is required at COP 18 on these finance-related issues ( and so no negotiating text is needed ) . Developing countries wanted the issues to remain in the AWG-LCA as they seek certainty from developed countries that their funding commitments to developing countries can be delivered and will continue into the future . It was noted that a couple of technical reports by the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and GCF will be lodged at COP 18 to inform this process in 2013 ( as decided at COP 17 ) . <p> Also on Friday 31 August , a workshop on frameworks for various approaches ( market and non-market ) to give effect to an enhanced mitigation effort was held . The workshops aim to introduce a degree of informality to discussions so that substantive issues can be explored . However , as illustrated above with the AWG-LCA informal papers , they rarely escape the formality of country prepared statements and positioning . <p> It was the market based framework that occupied the minds of party delegates , with non-market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly overshadowed by the former 's variety and complexity . The complexities seem to revolve around whether or not market based mechanisms should or could be linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) so as to leverage the mechanisms that already exist . While most developed countries ( especially countries which have signalled they will not sign up to the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and/or sub-national schemes not party to the Convention ) agreed that where possible , arrangements under the Convention and Protocol should be used , they noted that maximum flexibility should be given to countries to decide on how in this regard . For example , Japan 's bilateral offset mechanism ( BOM ) , Australia 's linkage with the EU emissions trading scheme , and the California and Quebec emissions trading schemes are relevant in this regard . Issues such as avoiding double counting of mitigation ( such as links to existing mechanisms such as NAMAs , Technology Mechanism , and the Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) ) and the nature of the institutional and governance arrangements arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the UNFCCC Secretariat . <p> A second workshop was held on the same day on new market based mechanisms ( NMBMs ) . A developed country panellist observed that the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) is an example of only the supply side of a market mechanism -- and that you also needed a demand side ( a carbon budget ) . So essentially all approaches ( baseline-credit , sectoral and cap and trade ) are needed and should be encouraged . Also , linkages to the existing rules under the Convention could provide for transparency and environmental integrity . These two issues are at the heart of developed country thinking . It was further observed that access to cost-effective approaches to mitigation provides for a higher propensity by developed countries to enhance their mitigation ambitions . <p> A developing party panellist however strongly opposed any form of NMBMs that rests outside of the Convention , as they potentially undermine the existing architecture under the Protocol . This includes multi- and bilateral arrangements such as Japan 's BOM . He observed that some sectors simply do not lend themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases due to their very high global warming potential . A technical paper has been drafted by the UNFCCC Secretariat . <p> Two other workshops were held on Sunday 2 September , including on quantified emission reduction targets ( QELROs ) by developed countries ; and diversity of NAMAs by developing countries . A number of questions were posed for panellists to discuss , but clearly this is a very politically charged debate linked to a number of other important agendas . For example , in regards to NMBMs , a developed country panellist observed that the possibility of a broad range of cost-effective approaches established outside of the Convention can equally provide for enhanced participation and mitigation outcomes , but developing countries see this as potentially an excuse by developed countries to deviate away from the Kyoto Protocol 's architecture ( and so undermine the CDM ) . <p> The QELRO workshop aimed at a minimum to increase the confidence of developing parties to better understand ( through transparency of dialogue ) the thinking and assumptions that underpin country pledges . In regards to NAMAs , it is clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum flexibility to decide what actions constitute nationally appropriate actions , without being held to account for a mitigation outcome ( as NAMAs are undertaken voluntarily ) . This includes not being held to prescriptive monitoring , verification and reporting procedures . This in turn could maximise the diversity and participation of developing country efforts in the mitigation space . A developed country panellist noted however that NAMAs should not just be reliant on finance from developed countries , and given that there are localised benefits to such actions , they could/should proceed anyway . An observation was made that for NAMA actions to receive developed country assistance , they will need to be systematically managed to a large extent ( through standard accounting rules etc . ) . <h> Concluding observations <p> While CCS has not been explicitly discussed here in Bangkok ( as CDM-related issues were agreed to in the Bonn session ) , a private sector panellist on the NMBMs workshop observed that market mechanisms need to be designed in a CCS friendly manner up-front -- the fact that it took about a decade of negotiations to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford to wait as long again to utilise this large-scale mitigation option under next generation incentive schemes . <p> The next step in these talks is for the chairs and facilitators to make sense of the discussions within the informal groups and to prepare either a summary paper or an oral report on the way forward and on how to proceed with the issues of technology and finance in particular .

##158452 <h> Surf Spots <p> The island of Bali has locations which work in the Dry Season and the Wet Season . The dry season is the peak surfing season and it typically runs from May through to September , this is when the famous waves of Uluwatu , Padang Padang and Impossibles break at their best . <p> Below is a list of the main breaks on Bali with key information and pictures . <p> nusa dua the 1st drop of point of the boat is the best before the rip gets ya there 's a left and a right then when the rip get 's a hold it 's all right.but be aware the 1st time i surfed it the reef looked about a good 3 to 4ft but when i got out there it was soild 5 to 6ft second day in indo a bit rusty surfed 4 a couple hours but was happy i only told the boat driver 2 hours.anyhow the right hander sunur reef is the best wave on that side of the island when it turn 's it on.wet season is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that would be the case with the bikes , no real hassles n cheers whippet for the info 2 , at worst a little fine no worries at all , a couple more weeks of central coast oz slopfest 2009 and im off to paradise , im startin to froth ! ! ! <p> on the fishing subject andy.i 've found the nusa dua side of bali is where i 've nailed lots of big fish over the years the kuta side can produce 2 but i have'nt had much luck you can get fishing charters any were in kuta just ask someone iv'e found about 50oz dollars about on the mark each person.and they might even slip a couple of bintangs in depends on how long ya feel like hassle them <p> rob , no real surf on penida ... i have surfed a little cove there about 2-3ft but thats cos lembongan was out of control 15ft plus cloudbreaks ... i havent looked all the way round the other side but im preety sure its just cliffs dropping off into deep water ... sweet . <p> selamat siang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert in sa we go by the line -pay your dues , ie.put in the time , work out conditions , tides etc to get the goodies . so todays info about the spot up the coast-4:30 departure to avoid traffic and crowds in my mind does more than one thing ; give surfers more than just general info ( your site philososphy ) and how to crowd the spot out at sunrise . theres noticably more crews heading up there now and i truely believe your info is only enhancing the traffic in the water at a spot that is of average quality but was a great escape ( that Bob was a creepy man ) so what do you say slim ? selamat tinggal stuie <p> G'Day Stuie , I appreciate your opinion , and thanks . Have you surfed at Balian lately ? it 's not packed with Aussie 's in the water at sun rise ! Do you know how many surf guide 's , surf schools there are in Bali , bro it 's 2009 . Maybe down in South Australia in your desert you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway all A surfer haS got ta do is look at a map and they can see that when a ESE-SE Tradewind blows it 's going to be cross-shore on the North West Coast of Bali , from Legian north it just gets worse . Face it Stui ya do n't ned to be a brain surgeon to work it out what time is the best to be there . Ya know if you would n't have posted your feelings about keeping a Bali surf spot un-crowded ( which by the way is a joke ) there 's be a new report over writting the Balian report in another hour or two . Now it 'll be in the comments for ever .... But do n't worry Stuie as not every Aussie surfer in Bali gets up at 4.00am on a Sunday morning . Thanks for the feed back and I hope / know South Australia will never be over run with learn to surfer schools . <p> Stuie , Your an idiot mate . Balian is far from a secret and a really doubt slim posting about what time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is its 2009 , you can read any book about surfing bali , talk to any bemo driver and they will all recommend balian in small swell and early due to the wind . Its far from a secret and if slim never posted here it would still be as crowded as ever . <p> Hi , we are coming over in July , and we are planning on spending a few days surfing before heading up to Ubud . I 've been to bali however never to surf ... where are the good surf beaches , and where is the best place to stay near the beaches ? We will be spending our last week in seminyak , so do n't mind if we do n't stay in town for hte first few ' surfing ' days . <p> Also , it will be my bf surfing , and he is not a beginner ( probably intermediate , is a surf life saver so can handle decent waves etc ) . <p> HI Everyone .. Im thinking of goin to Bali and staying in Nusa Dua -- Nikko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows from first hand experience how long to get Ulu 's and the west coast surf breaks from there . Also what best option of travel e.g Taxi , Hired mo-ped , with a surf board. ? Cheers ... Goin in early August so West coast would be the pick .. Correct ? <p> Me and my boyfriend are going to spend a couple of weeks on Bali and Lombok . We 're really instrested in learning how to surf . What we get is that the west coast is best place to go during the summer and we are now wondering about prices for beginners/surfing lessions and board rental rates . <p> From Nusa Dua it will take you roughly 30 mins by bike/car . If you have n't done the ride before or do n't know your way around the Bukit that well I would say to grab a taxi the first time so you can memorise the route . After that just grab a bike with a rack , so long as you have some experience riding . Generally safer than the ride from Kuta to Ulu as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast will be the go in August , but you 'll be able to score some good sessions at Nusa Dua too if there is no/little wind . <p> Gday , Does anyone have any updates on the toxic waste dumping going on at dreamland ? I heard reports of a number of crew getting horribly sick from surfing at Balangan ... Hair falling out , skin peeling off and the likes ... Any info will be much appreciated <p> G'day Slim , A friend of a friend has a membership and heard it from one of the caddies who is gf of a greenkeeper , she knew about the late night dump and told him after she heard about a few local surfers getting sick ... DDT is a heavy duty pesticide banned in a lot of countries , one of its uses is large scale mosquito eradication ... long term side effects are similar to agent orange , sterility , birth defects ... short term effects include hair loss , nasty rashes and skin peeling off ... just wondered if anyone heard about anyone getting sick from surfing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess <p> Hi Isaac ! thanks for your feedback and I do n't think I " rubbished " anyone dude . I metioned that " there were surfguides arriving by the minute with van loads full of Japanese surfers " or something like that . So please make sure you read the report before you comment . it 's pretty simple if you do n't want to appear out of context . Oh and sorry Isaac what does OTT mean I 'm not real hip with the abreveations <p> the point is anyone who is in any way involved with surf tourism has a responsibility to ensure the product they sell remains as advertised . look at the surf camp deal with large groups of europeans arrivng en-masse to all surf an average wave etc , would you pay through the eye if the brochure said ' come and surf a soft left with 14 germans , 8 aussies , 4 russians etc . <p> just a quick question -- I 'm coming out to bali this november and am staying for 3/4 months . As it 's the wet season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still kuta ? <p> Also , this might seem like a stupid question but as the winds are genrally light in the mornings and evenings in bali does this mean that you can still get glassy conditions on the west coast during the wet season ? So If I stayed in kuta I could still possibly have glassy conditions before breakfast ? cheers ! <p> ei man , great page . thank 's a lot for your work . it helpes a lot . 3 friend 's and i are comming in middle july till end of august . we 're still wondering if we should take our boards , or rent or buy something very cheap for the whole month and a half . what do you think ? ? ? we are looking for some place very very cheap to stay , cuz we are -- i can say broke . and we do n't even know where to go , i mean city , where to surf and so .... i 'll be greatfull for any suggestions . <p> Nik , drop me an email through the contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a friend here in Tuban only 100yrds back from the beach infront of the Outer reefs who only charges AU$6.00 per night . The rooms are comfortable enough for a surfer on a tight budget but still very basic and most importantly safe and secure . <p> Hi Slim , Going to bali on 1st aug staying at ramada bintang tuban , was looking at kuta cam and the photos of the beach and sea walls in 2008 in front of hotels , what month was the big tides and hows it looking now ? thanks Tim <p> Hi Tim , well your going to be pretty well surprised when you see the new beach we have here in Tuban , they actually did a great job for now . But it 's going to be hard to say when we start getting some big swells and big tides where just all the sand will move to . <p> hi Slim , traveled to Bali last june for 40 days . anyway to make some money while staying in Bali. i have a nice digital camera with 300 mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some Bali Girl and i would like to return . any help would be nice , thank you Gary West <p> Hi Gary , sorry to say mate but the days of photographers rocking over to Bali and trying to sell photos to surfers are just about gone . These days there are ex-pats with expensive work visa 's and plenty of local photographers at just about every location . <p> Hi Slim , Tim again just wondering if you know of any airport taxes for bringing in 3 or 4 boards into denpasar airport , if ur keen 4 a bintang one arvo will be at ramada bintang 4 2 weeks from 1st august cheers <p> Hey Tim , 3 boards is ok but if they notice you have 4 your going to be invited into their office for some negotiating .... keep a smile on your face and have some 20 dollar notes in your pocket . If you fly in to jakarta and then domestic to Bali you can bring as many boards in as you want ...... go figure . Bintang sounds good ! <p> Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an awesome time in Bali . Always hang out for the daily baliwaves update for my favourite surfing hol destination . Me and a couple of mates are visiting in Oct and was wondering if you could give us some advice and recommend what the best boat trips are available to Sumbawa and Lombok etc I found an old article about a 10m ocean speed boat that visits these locations from your daily update back from 2008 but was wondering what the best options are and approx prices . Thx heaps ! Cheers Loz <p> Hi , I first travelled to Bali in 1974/5 as a 20 year old . Kuta in those days was only built up for about one hundred metres each side of Bimo corner -- my mate and I stayed in a losman 50-60 m from Bimo cnr on Legian Rd , about opposite Poppy track ( wasnt a lane then ) -- it was all fileds down to the beach . We stayed for 2 months over Xmas/Jan and surfed mainly at Nusa Dua and Ulu 's -- I can remebered surfing Nusa Dua 6-8ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left our clothes/towels in bushes and arranged for bimo to pick us up a few hours later as it was only a village back behind the beach -- only a couple other surfers out , scary ( saw my first water snake it tried to get onto my board ! , I went back in 1998 and was blown away by the development , surfed at Kuta reef for 2 days then went to Lombok for 2 weeks . Went back again last year and decided to stay down at Ulu , surfed Balangan a couple times -- nice wave but as always ( everywhere in Bali in June-Aug ) crowded , but key is to get out early -- enjoying the memories , still riding short boards and surfing every week . Looking to go back to Indo next year . cheers <p> Hey Andrew , I have a contract rate of Rp200,000 per night at the AA . Over the counter they ask for US$50.00 per night . But you 'd be better off here at Home Base with us for US$15.00 ( Rp150,000 ) per night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure do remember our visits in the early 2000 ? s Epic G'Land and nice to meet Scardy ! Please be sure to look in on my Bro , Richard ! No waves here but lots of fishin , mountain biking , skiing Mt . Bachelor in the Winter and all kinds of good stuff ! Aloha to you and all the best ! David Dornbusch <p> with regards to hallidays scotts comment . the reason for this was because it was so hard to attract sponsors back then newy boys through there rigourous campaining and tireless efforts were able to draw in 2 major sponsors ie bintang and captagon int . come to think of it we pioneered the use of captys plus binys as a surf additive . <p> Hi'yall , Slim , great site -- very funny ( I think you 're a secret comic ) . Ok , I 'm the quintessential cliche , but hear goes ... I 've just learnt to surf , have never been to Bali before , and am looking for a beginner 's beach where I can practice every day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Prefer a bungalow in a less crowded spot than any hotel room in kuta -- does such a place exist , and when is the best time to head over ? Cheers ! <p> unreal site . got a quick question , im heading to bali in a few days for my first time and some are predicting a " massive " swell this coming weekend , were staying near ulu , but im not too keen on surfing 10- 12ft ulu ... well i am keen , but im not so sure my lungs and boards are , haha . was wondering where the best semi protected places are nearish by ? bingin ? anywhere else ? any help would be greatly appreciated ! ! ! once again great site , keep it up ! ! <p> Hi there -- just found the site and its great ! A quick question ; My family and i are hoping to head to Bali in the middle of Feb next year and i was wanting to find out 2 things : 1 : ) is the wet season constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful days until a big downpour for an hour or so at about 4PM ? 2 : ) Is the west coast ( Legian etc ) really that bad for surf in the wet season ? I would be happy with 2-4ft on my longboard for a few hours each morn before both the wind and my family gets up . <p> Hi .. trying to plan a surf trip in Dec ( only time we can get off work ) and really would love any advice on where to stay/surf in Bali ? ? Should we hire a guide ? car rental . I 'm over my head planning this as a surprise for my two son's/and husband . Thanks for any advice . <p> Hi , going over Xmas this time , staying in Legian as usual . Daughter and i usually happy surfing there but as it 's wet season is it non exsistent ? Where is relatively safe on other side with regards reefs etc ? Thanks <p> coming to bali in three days and staying for a couple of months but i do nt really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for part of the time but want to explore on my own as well , do you know how the government/police are with camping off the roads discreetly ? <p> Urban , a bit of advice , if youve got no money stay at home ! There are enough white guys hanging out in Bali leaching off society . Get a job and come back in a few months time and support the economy . If you camp you will get sick and robbed . <p> I think you mean tourists on a tight budget do n't ya , that just about sums up every surfer under the age of 25 I think ...... and then going back 35 years in time it was every surfer ( 99% ) ! ! ! ! ! Yep , surfing and capatilisim .... hand in hand . <p> Heya , great website thanks for the effort . A friend and I are arriving on Sat Dec 12 . Was wondering if we should get accomodation in Sanur or stay on the west side ? It seems like ur blogs are coming from the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come stay with the crew at home base , I just have to talk to my friend thats coming with me . We were planning on going to Sanur , but if the waves are better on the west coast and its not too crowded I wud luv to go there . So u think Illuwatu and the west side is still the best bet ... ? Cheers . <p> hey , im actually headin to Bali December the 26th , Kuta i believe , i was wondering about the reef dangers and anything else i needed to know about the areas ocean life . also i wanted to know will it still be decent swell in the area ? <p> Returned from Bali a few weeks ago ... learning to surf at the moment and was around Kuta ( in front of Hard Rock Cafe ) because it was so small at the time . Any suggestions on first board would be greatly appreciated ! Cheers . <p> Ill be going to Bali in mid January . When you list the beaches according to dry/wet season , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wet season , or it is possible to surf there and its like a general recommendation ? <p> Hi . I want to go on a surf &; yoga camp in Bali on my own . I 'm a 29 year old female and do not have any experience with surfing ( well , only 1 day ) . I like enjoying the nature , but a bit of fun time is also on my list . Any tips ? Thanks . <p> Hi Slim . Mate I will be in Bali in June for my bros wedding and would like to do a simple day trip to Nusa Lombongan or somewhere close for a surf with him . Can you recommend any boat charter companies that do Surfing day trips to Nusa Lombongan or similar . all the best , marcus <p> Thorny , Pottz was born in UK but is hardly a Pom , grew up in South Africa , spent most of his teens in US and then settled on Northern Beaches , NSW , Australia . The only pom surfer Ive heard of is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Anyway , Im bemused that Slim has the time to answer these lame emails but when someone seriously asks a question they get squat in reply . <p> Marijntje -- There is a YOGA resort called -The Sacred River Resort -- at Balian ( river ) and the surf area is right there .. at least 1.5 hours west of Kuta .. If you ride a motor bike -- there is a great ride to be had through the mountains , Straight across from the market area of balian a road leads into the mountains and eventually takes you to the rice town of Papuan , you then hook around to join the west coast hwy back to Balian , good luck .. <p> Yeah fair enough mate . With regard to money exchanges in Kuta , can you recommend one or two ? I have followed ur posts and know you say some are rip off merchants charging hidden fees after they get your cash and some are good , is there any in particular that you recommend as I plan on doing most of my Aust $$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than get $$Aust2K exchange here at Travelex or some other rip of exchange merchant that we have here in Australia . I know Kuta fairly well so if you could point out a couple of good ones Id appreciate it . <p> One of the best in Jalan Legian is right at the southern end of the street , coming down the street on the left hand side . Then there 's the Kodak Central exchangers in Jalan Kartika Plaza . These operators are fair dealers and issue receits . These are the ones I use when I 'm lucky enough to have dollars . <p> MONEY EXCHANGERS- Ta ! for the comment on Medewi , Slim .. On the road that was called Rum Jungle road , there is a money exchanger- opposite the Legian primary school .. From the Jaya Karta Hotel entrance continue to the school-opposite is a glass fronted office -money counted -behind glass -checked by office and then- you .. best rate is for Bank notes ( ie real money ) and the best day for exchange seems to be Tuesday morning- ? ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years -- DO N'T risk Dodgy EXC .. <p> On board repairs- Go straight to Wayan Badung -owner of Point Surf shop . This guy is as good as you get . I have had boards that have that , used , maybe i need a new board look , transformed into show room wannabes . I always cycle my boards thru Wayan 's hands b4 returning to Aust . Especially those boards regarded as Magic .. Keep them in as good shape as you can- you may be years finding one as good .. <p> Hi Steve , my board repairer here in Tuban is by far the No.1 in Bali . He works for the Bali Barrel surf shop ( old original site ) he is the man when it comes to fixing your baby . Through me my guests get their boards repaired at " local price " ie : a snapped board is between Rp150,000 -- 200,000. around US$16.00 -- $21.00 . So imagine how much he charges for just a dirty old ding . <p> G-day JB ( slim ) Im just checking your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way tomorrow.I 'd like to catch up for a chat and a Bali coffee .. Thing 's are on the improve , I have a leggie now.Either way will see you soon .. Regard 's <p> Hello all , we are planning a trip in July 2010 and staying at Mu 's Bali on the Uluwatu cliff , with our 15 yr old and 12 yr old boogie boarders , the 15 year old is a die hard mad surfer and I am sure he will be fine on the reefs , the 12 yr old surfs alot too but is a little scared at times of the big mothers out the back here in Nth Avalon Sydney Australia , and tends to stay on the shories . We want a surf holiday that will accommodate all , I keep reading so many mixed reviews of Bali surf and have nothing in relation to children . I would be so grateful for some advice . Could my little guy surf Dreamland ? ? If not where ? Thanks Simone <p> hey slim , my wife is a bali chick and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rupia is doing .... but lately there has been no info ? i know your a busy boy and all that ... and mate one more thing why have you not been reporting on Nusa Dua this wet season ? anyways mate great site ! keep up the good work ! <p> Hi , I 'm heading to bali mid july till mid aug . I am looking for rights is the much chance of getting good rights that time of year and where ? i 'm also not going to bring a board so i 'll be looking to buy once i get there . where would be the best place and brand . And i think i 'll hire a car to get around to differant spot is there anywhere i could pick up some surf buddys to take along . Thanks <p> Yes there are right handers to be had all year round ........ search though . Contact Diverse Surfboards via their link on baliwaves.com , he has a tonne of quality boards already here in Bali , or he can have one made and here waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming over in a few weeks and would like to get in a few earlies on the reefs around Kuta before heading off elsewhere for the rest of the day . Can anyone give me some ideas/hints on getting a good boat to take me out to the reefs . Departure point and price would be handy . Cheers Pigga <p> Hey Slim , im heading over for a month in june . Staying at Hyatt Sanur . What is the closest East side beachbreak to there ? Ive got my 7 year old daughter with me this time so I have to keep it safe . Is padang galek safe for a 7 year old grommet ? Cheers PAUL . <p> Slim , You forgot to tell the Dengue Fever mozzies bite during the day , and into the late afternoon , and that they are called Tiger mozzies due to the fact if you look at them they have bright yellow &; white spots and some stripes . Super easy to see the differences between them and " normal " malaria " predators .. <p> BTW -- There a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mas-Ubud- Gianyar , local kids are coming down with it now ; I know 3 personally . <p> As usual tourist " officials " are trying to keep this way under wraps so the tourists will still pile in without fear . Ahh , the smell of it ; greed that is .. <p> Hi Slim , Great site ! Great info and pics . QUESTION : does anyone know about getting longboards on with JETSTAR ? I think thier max is 277cm but my log comes in at 281cm in its cover . Do you think they would let it pass or turn me back ? Just wondering if anyone has got through . If not are there any quality longboards to hire in Kuta . And before you all start saying Bali is no good for longboards .... spare me . Ive logged my way all around Indo . Just never flown with JETSTAR . Cheers <p> No Paulo totally wrong and the guy who told you probably wasnt even a Balinese . They depend on Aussies to help there seasonal income . They all know Aussies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves as best as they can ! <p> Most Aussies are merely thought of as useless immoral alcoholics . They support the economy I suppose but they should try and be more culturally appropriate . What pissed out rich white guy isnt arrogant or obnoxious ? <p> Hey charger , you do n't have to worry . So many choices depending on where you 're staying . Kutabeach is good at the bottom of Poppies lane , and then Midway between Kuta and Legian , Then Legian at the bottom of Jalan padma . All good high tide beach breaks . Low tide beach break is Ku De Ta , best with a 3ft plus swell early morning . <p> Seminyak has some great boogi board spott . The Ku De Ta is a little fat but if you get on at low tide there 's a rideto be had . walk down the beach to Petitengat temple ( Just past La Lucciola restaurant and there is a high tide right that will work you over . Just take care here The temple is n't always happy about beachy things right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable wave . <p> we have just come back from Bali and had a BB in our group . he was stoked with waves at ulu and padang padang.Just get the boats around tuban/kuta to run you over , take the new wife , if she is not a surfer a morning at padang padang cove is a great way to spend some time , beautiful clear water to swim and away from the crowds of kuta , so relaxing <p> Sorry bro I do n't organise trips to anywhere , I prefer surfers to be able to book directly with the company itself and cut out the middle men and get a lower price . Just like how I mention with the 15% discount over to G-Land . Unfortunately I do n't think you can book direct at Lakey 's . Better to just get a flight from Bali to Bima from any local travel agent in Bali and just rock into Lakey 's there are at least 10 hotels / Losmans over there . All are pretty much right in front of the waves . <p> RE " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original bali surf report , baliwaves.com ( since ' 99 ) . Yes sir it 's been another long day for this little black duck hitting the road at 4.30am for Balian.And finally getting back to home base at 4.30pm " Jeez yoove got a tough life there Slim , LOL. regards Maggsie <p> Anyone wanting to hire really good quality long boards in kuta / Seminyak area , go up to Seminyak beach , about 150 -- 200meters on the Legian side of KuDeTa resturant is a creek running into the ocean . Right next to it ( the Sofitel Resort is also behind them ) are my mates Wayan and Bram who hire out boards , rashies and beach beds . Tell them Maggot sent you and he will sort you out . <p> I 'm going to Bali in the middle of October and I will stay for 5 months . I 'm aware of the rainy period and that the east side of Bali works well . Question is- how 's the west side during that time . is it possible to surf early morning . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thinking maybe its possible to score good uncrowded surf at Balangan , Kuta Reef , Ulu etc . Somebody told me its less wind at that time but would like to know from some Bali-specialis- guy(girl) SoThe thing is Im a goofyfooter so it would be a shame to miss out on the great lefthanders . <p> Hi Slim , Coming to Bali Fri 5th Nov and was just wondering if the volcano has had any effect on the island of Bali , and how is the swell forecast from 2 weeks of the 5th looking , here in Newcastle its flat as a tack . Cheers Timmy P <p> surfed at kuta reef in late october 60 or more in the lineup head high plus , my mate only scored 2 waves in 2 hours lots of hasseling going on with people droping in all over the place , the place was full of snakes and most of them were australians so come on get real if you do nt do it at home do nt do it in bali you ass holes . ps i still love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi Baz , yeah it makes ya wonder does n't it . Do you think these people would drive straight to the front of the line at the petrol station , no . Would they push their shopping trolley straight to the front of the check out , no . But as soon as they jump outta that boat at Kuta or Middle Reefs it 's paddle straight to the inside and expect the next set wave that comes through . Even if there are only 10 other surfers already out there waiting , go figure that . <p> Hey Slim , how are you . I am shooting a bit of a video re travelling thru Indonesia . Was just wondering what size lense your using on your stills camera . I just purchased a Nikon D7000 for a record of places but would like a lens for it . My camera gear is Sony EX3 and FX1 with a small handycam for in car shots . Would appreciate if you can spare time to give me a bit of info . Am off to Lombok for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footage but will be going back around April to Lombok and Sumbawa Have just rented a house in Sanur for 2 years so maybe one day we could catch up . Cheers for now Rick Powell <p> Hey Slim , I 'll be in Bali for a business trip in a couple weeks and managed to get two spare days to surf . I 'm a little out of shape and probably be bodyboarding . Advice on surfing spots and equipment rentals please ? very much appreciated ! <p> I 'll be spending a long weekend in Bali in early May . I 'm not a super experienced surfer but would like to get out and have some fun . Is there a spot for beginner / intermediate level surfers you can recommend ? <p> hi there , i am trying to organise a surf charter for early october but the enquiry page wo n't let me send.

I 'm definately bringing a 7 ' 2 ? board for bigger waves . Trying to decide between a 6 ' 8 ? that 's good on over-head down the line waves but not great for maneauvers or an all around 6 ' 4 ? that works great in average surf , but might not hold in to well on super fast sucking barrels . Any opinions would be most appreciated . <p> hi ! planning a trip somewhere for some surf and Yoga and have to say that Bali is on top of my list . Would you recommend it for end of Dec , early Jan ? is is raining everyday .. all day ? or just a small shower from time to time ? any hot yoga , surf , spa spot to recommend ? thanks so much !

Was thinking of staying in Nusa Dua , but what are your recommendations for the best location to stay ? looking at staying around april/May . Thanks heaps xx <p> hi i was looking for some advice . i live in perth and havent been to bali on a surf trip before but have been there a couple of times long time ago . my friend is trying to persuade me to take here and her two little kids to bali for a week in june . i want to surf , she wants kids club and a resort .... any advice .... <p> gday slim ... i am interested to know if any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the pics they take to the surfers involved .. ? do you know if they sell them online or just try to sell thenm to surf mags .. ? any details would be greatly appreciated . cheers <p> Hi Jules , there are photographers at just about every popular surfing location here in Bali , and yes they are all willing , in fact very eager to sell their photos to any visiting surfer they can . Some of them have really high end camera equipment some do n't . So always take into account this when you are buying photos . eg : do n't try and screw down the price from a Local Photographer especially if he 's using 6-10 grands worth of camera gear . <p> Balian is not crowded because of Bali waves it is crowded because the locals have sold most of their land which allows more accommodation to built and house people at places where once only people willing to rough it could stay , It is the same in Medewi and there is also a airport going to be built in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus there is a super Bi pass road going to be built which will link the kutafication all the way up the coast day trippers from Kuta are going to increase a million percent , like everywhere else in Bali it 's crowded as hell but the waves are still sick just smile get your waves and enjoy what else can you do except stay home and help the numbers drop <p> Hey slim Love ya Site and the twitter feed . We are heading to Bali in August to surf for the second time this year ... Last time in march stayed canggu and fell in love with it . Waves at that time were mostly in Nusa dua ..

##169551 <p> I was overseas in South Africa with some great mates , cheering on the Socceroos at the soccer World Cup , and to top it all off I was celebrating my 21st birthday . <p> Little did I know in a few short weeks my life was to change dramatically . <p> I had a hint of what was to come when on our final bus trip of the tour we stopped in at a service station so everyone could have some dinner . I chose a dodgy slice of pizza . As I started to eat , an ulcer-like sore on my tongue , that I had first noticed a few months earlier , really started to give me grief . <p> My mum had convinced me to have it checked out before I left for the trip . <p> I had seen one doctor and been back to see another a month later when the sore was still there . Neither doctor had thought that anything was wrong ? and nothing showed up in a series of blood tests . Since then , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried at the time , but when I got home I saw another doctor who sent me to a specialist for a biopsy . I had to wait five days for the results . <p> The words ' you have cancer ' were n't actually used . The specialist who performed the biopsy said that it was a tumour . That meant little to me because I 'd never been in contact with cancer before , and I did n't realise the seriousness of the situation . <h> My diagnosis <p> Looking back , everyone was scared for me . But I was ready to fight . Even though I could never know what was ahead of me , I was in a good place mentally . <p> This was despite the fact that I had no answer for why I had developed this disease . Surely you only get cancer of the mouth after years of drinking and smoking ? I was 21 , only a social drinker and I had only ever smoked one cigarette . <p> Nine days after my diagnosis , and after several tests to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess whether any lymph nodes in my neck were affected , I was on the operating table with a team of surgeons put together to save my life . <p> They had to break my jaw to gain enough access to my mouth . They performed a left-sided tongue dissection , taking nearly half my tongue , to remove the tumour , and a left-sided neck dissection where they removed 30 of my lymph nodes . Two of these tested positive for cancer . <p> They also took a minor artery and a ' muscle graft ' from my left thigh to re-construct my tongue . It 's incredible what they can do . The surgery took 11 hours , and left me in intensive care for eight days . <p> It was an incredibly tough time in hospital . Having youth on my side made my recovery a little faster than the average though . About two months later I was well enough to begin having high doses of radiation treatment on my head and neck every day for 44 days along with chemotherapy . <p> During treatment I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was also experiencing heartburn , nausea and vomiting . I was on a liquid diet for a long period , all the while with a very sore mouth . <p> At one point , I was fitted with a nasogastric tube for a few weeks because I could n't even cope with the liquid diet . I lost a lot of weight . <p> To top it all , I could n't speak for days , weeks , in fact . I had books and a pen to communicate . The books filled up very quickly . <p> All in all , the treatment regime was gruelling but it was what I needed to survive and kill the cancer . So I fought as hard as I could through that period and somehow made it through . I have a lot of people to thank for where I am today . <h> Head and neck cancers : the stats <p> Cancer of the tongue is one of several cancers that can affect the head and neck . <p> Cancers of the lip , throat , nose , sinuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are approximately 2078 cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in Australia each year , according to the Cancer Council . They account for 2% of all cancers diagnosed annually in the country . <p> We all have a one in 275 risk of developing head and neck cancer by the time we turn 85 . <p> The disease usually affects older men who have been heavy smokers and drinkers . <p> However , the UK 's National Health Service says studies are suggesting cancer of the mouth , in particular , is increasing among younger age groups . <p> It 's being recognised that a proportion of these cases are caused by infection with the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - the same virus implicated in cervical cancer . <h> Moving on <p> Many things are affected post-treatment . The radiation I received was equivalent to millions of x-rays of my head and neck . This damaged my salivary glands , meaning I will forever have a very dry mouth . I can not eat dry food , only moist foods . So gravy and sour cream are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never improve , but my ability to taste will hopefully return . <p> I had a speech impediment for the months of treatment and afterwards . We were warned before my operation that my speech may change , and I 'd need daily speech therapy to re-learn how to form words . <p> It was suggested that a career in public speaking would be unlikely , so that was scary as I have aspirations to be a teacher . <p> But I was lucky that my operation went well , and the graft on my tongue , took very well and modelled very closely to the shape of my original tongue . Although it took months for the swelling to decrease and improve its appearance and function , my speech has slowly improved to the point today where it 's near perfect . <h> Comments ( 31 ) <h> celester : <p> 28 Oct 2012 9:44:02pm <p> Hi dave u are truly brave I 'm 28 and diagnosed with tongue cancer I do nt smoke or drink . And my operation is going to be same has yours when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the middle of your lip ? I am shit scared . My op is on the 20th of Nov . <h> Troy : <p> 14 Mar 2012 9:45:06pm <p> I am a 24yr old male . Very similar diagnosis/treatment ; SCC of the tongue spread to 6 lymph nodes in the neck . Surgery/Radiation/Chemo . Absolutely horrible experience . Differences are I was a heavy smoker and casual drinker of 8 years coupled with some immensely stressful living/relationship situations for the last 4yrs . Some might say internalization of stress will manifest itself as illness and in some cases help create a " perfect storm " for cancer to establish itself on the detectable scale . Anyways , we 've got some badass scars to show off and life to appreciate even more . In a twisted way it 's been a beneficial experience by way of maturity and self-reflection . Carry on and best of life to you . <h> Craig : <p> 07 Jun 2012 4:11:10pm <p> My dentist referred me to a specialist re : a lump on my tongue , which was removed under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt great to have it removed .

My experiences were very similar to yours . My doctors treated the cancer aggressively and I have been cancer free since June 2000 . Afterwards I went back to uni and finished my teaching degree . I have a slight speech impedient and scarring still from the operation and radiation treatment but the kids in my classes have always accepted that as part of me . You do n't have to give up your teaching dreams because it is still achieveable . I am in my 8th year of teaching . Good luck with the future . <h> Jack Jeckyl : <p> 28 Jul 2011 7:12:42am <p> Wow .

I 've had leukoplakia under my tongue , and it has been lasered off . I have also had two biopsies . The biopsies are to test that the leuloplakia is not heading in a tumour direction . <p> The 2nd biopsy has resulted in on-going , seemingly permanent pain . My experience has been bad enough , yours would 've been unbearable . <p> You and I and some other bloggers here know what oral pain is like . The smokers I know still do n't wan na hear it . <p> I 'm 42 , first had trouble at about 38 . I too have never smoked , and drink rarely . <h> Gabby : <p> 22 Jul 2011 10:38:36pm <p> Hi Dave , My name is Gabby and I 'm 36 yrs old and was diagnosed with tongue cancer in late August last year . Mine was on the left side of my tongue and I also had 2 nodes affected . I have an almost identical scar as yours , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm doing well : ) I did not smoke either and tested negative to HPV as well.We do need to get the message out that it 's not always smokers , drinkers and older people that get oral cancers ! Hope your well : ) <h> Early Grayce : <p> 22 Jul 2011 5:41:55pm <p> Got ta get checked for anything ongoing . I had heartburn for a few months but saw a doctor regularly so managed to get him interested after a few months . A quick ultrasound followed by an MRI a few days later when my doctor managed to get back to them and authorise it then dozens of scans for a month with no conclusive diagnosis . One cut a third of the way around me and the surgeon had a 2.5cm tumour removed from the back of my pancreas where it had been hiding . Four weeks of recovery in hospital and now just over 18 months clear . I did n't think that should happen before I turned 35 . <h> Jack : <p> 22 Jul 2011 2:19:59pm <p> Dave what a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease and/or nagging little pain or discomfort one may have -HAVE IT CHECKED OUT AS SOON AS .

##198750 <h> Must Reads <p> The bad manners of the internet are now turning up on the air waves and on the street to create one of the rudest political debates Australia has seen . <p> Prime Minister Julia Gillard is being hit by the type of public nastiness which would have embarrassed and horrified most people a decade ago . <p> She has been called a liar to her face by a woman who constantly referred to the Prime Minister as Julia ; Sydney radio figure Ray Hadley this week called her an imbecile ; at anti-carbon price rallies she appears on banners as a witch or even a bitch . <p> She 's not alone in being treated with a new and venomous rudeness . <p> Today Liberal front bencher Malcolm Turnbull decided he 'd had enough of someone he considered a pest , and took action by removing the anonymity of the man . <p> Mr Turnbull published his name and mobile number on Twitter along with a request to stop contacting him . <p> " I have asked him to desist in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications that would be a good thing , " he said in a later tweet . <p> The lack of civility is well known to people who write blogs and other on-line pieces which allow comments by readers . <p> Nastiness is considered standard operating procedure by some on-line , and the cheap shots are even considered clever by their users . Anonymous rudeness is the safety zone of the confused and inarticulate . <p> People hiding their identities and accountability behind fake names and uninformative email addresses feel bold enough to fire personal attacks at writers who are public about their stances . Usually they add nothing to policy debate , only to the lexicon of insults . <p> That type of cowardly oafishness , a minority in most internet behavior , has been encouraged to go public by a swag of AM radio figures who set the pace in terms of offensiveness ahead of genuine policy examination . <p> Alan Jones ' " Ju-Liar ' ' was playground stuff which one would never have forecast would have a place in national debate . <p> Now incivility is spreading beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air waves occupied by hard-line radio commentators , and into the streets as the carbon pricing issue is examined . <p> There is no direct and obvious link to gender , but it is difficult to believe that the rush of offensiveness is n't connected in some way to the fact the Prime Minister is a woman . <p> And it is almost certain that Ms Gillard will not be the sole target of the new rudeness as the electorate is subjected to what in effect are election campaigns by her and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott . <p> A taste of this came on Wednesday when a polite and reasonable young woman , a Greens voter , waited her turn at a Tony Abbott rally in Frankston to criticise his policies . She received a hostile reception from the crowd , and was harassed by men as she left the gathering , including one man who told her to go back under her rock . <p> The interesting thing is that the rudeness did n't come from immature louts , it came from older people - who no doubt bemoan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known better . <h> 361 comments <h> c.conserv. says : <h> c.conserv. says : <p> 02:08pm 14/07/11 <p> Should have mentioned John Howard 's name , as well as Pauline Hanson 's - the majority of the media turned a blind eye to the ignorant behaviour directed at these two . Tony Abbott is depicted as a monkey in many cartoons ! <p> Look to yourselves , media people <h> mark saunders says : <p> 02:15pm 14/07/11 <p> oh boo hoo <h> Brendan says : <p> 02:37pm 14/07/11 <p> It 's late in the day to comment , however , I throw in my two cents . <p> Perhaps the internet has changed the way we speak to each other because we are all still learning the rules of the new social media ? Perhaps in five or ten years flame wars and petty insults over the net will seem as course and silly as playground shouting matches between six year olds . <p> I 'm positive about the future . I think we 're going to adapt to this new environment in time . <h> Erick says : <p> 02:39pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing this partisan drivel . <p> John Howard received far ruder treatment , for a longer time , than Julia Gillard ever did . They even threw shoes at him after he 'd retired from politics . <p> Opinion writing is one thing , but this really is scraping the bottom of the barrel . <h> melle says : <p> 02:40pm 14/07/11 <p> Unfortunately for Ms Gillard , the people have a very good idea of the real Julia . She has no class - and in these bad-mannered times , she 's getting no respect . Simple as that <h> Kevin says : <p> 03:09pm 14/07/11 <p> @Erick Name an instance when JH was PM that he was verbally abused to his face by someone on the street . <h> SimonTigey says : <p> 03:17pm 14/07/11 <p> Gillard deserves every bit of abuse she gets , she deserves no respect at all ! ! ! <h> Outraged says : <p> 03:36pm 14/07/11 <p> @Kevin : John Howard had a pair of shoes thrown at him ! Not to mention all the times Howard was " Boo'ed " at sporting events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me started on poor Pauline Hanson who had eggs thrown at her and her meetings shut down by violent greenies ... she was also thrown in jail ! <h> Kevin says : <p> 03:38pm 14/07/11 <p> The uncouth rabble are playing into Julia Gillard 's hands . The more abuse she cops , the more she comes out looking dignified and courageous . I do n't recall JWH appearing at shopping centres explaining the merits of Workchoices . <h> Markus says : <p> 03:54pm 14/07/11 <p> " Name an instance when JH was PM that he was verbally abused to his face by someone on the street . " Every single time he went on one of his walks . <p> What you are really after is an instance when JH was verbally abused to his face while PM that made the news . This will be a lot harder to find , as " John Howard gets insulted by person " was not really considered by the media as newsworthy for some reason . <h> melle says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> @Kevin . Gillard is not being courageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She HAS to face the people . And why is n't Bob Brown standing with her ? You know the answer to that one , do n't you <p> Julia Gillard back-stabbed her leader to get his job . Now she is weeping for the cameras . Fall for it , if you wish <h> Amused says : <p> 04:17pm 14/07/11 <p> Its amusing that MFarr thinks that this is a sudden onset with regard to his PM . Newsflash Malcolm , people have been rude and badmannered for years to John Howard , including you . And if you think that Gillard is being targetted because she is a woman , you are as delusional as Oakeshott , she is being condemned because she is arrogant , inept and useless - simple really . She must earn respect , she cant demand it . <h> melle says : <p> 04:31pm 14/07/11 <p> @Brendan - thoughtful comment , but there are n't too many rules , that I 've noticed . People to say what they 're really thinking - things they would n't risk saying face-to-face . ( I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom to backchat , at last ) <h> Seano says : <p> 04:52pm 14/07/11 <p> @melle - Tony Abbott has been appearing at shopping centres for months . Is that not then just as desperate ? Pollies need to sell ( for want of a better word ) their polices , and I think it 's fair enough for them to get out amongst the people to do it . <p> Should n't they be able to do it with out being called names ? <h> Unionist says : <p> 04:56pm 14/07/11 <p> Erick says:02:39pm " John Howard received far ruder treatment , for a longer time , than Julia Gillard ever did . They even threw shoes at him after he 'd retired from politics . " <p> Far ruder , your kidding right ! I want what you have been smoking . And as for the shoe toss what a pathetic attempt that was , I would have collected him right between the eyes and he would have known he was tagged . <h> mrtiedt says : <p> That took about 10 seconds to find on google . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 05:23pm 14/07/11 <p> Hullo , Seano . The heat is on Ms Gillard . Ms Gillard is in Situation Desperate . Too late for tears ! The ill-mannered , name-calling started with Paul Keating , as you would have to agree . Nossy has pointed this out already . <p> Keating guilty of bad example , Seano . You would agree - no ? <h> No 1 Rosie says : <p> 05:31pm 14/07/11 <p> Yes Mr Farr should be ashamed of himself even after his ladyship has told the media at her recent Press Club speech to stop writing crap ! <p> It amazes me that the media can turn all this shouting and screaming at Julia Gillard by those of us that have had enough of her deceptiveness into a sympathy vote ! They do not bother to read between the lines . I am scared dead scared to see Tony Abbott and the Coalition take over the reigns with a powerless Labor Party in Opposition to give us some kind of a political balance . The idea was put into our minds by none other than Tony Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when in Govt he will repeal the carbon tax Gillard answered " no hypotheticals " <p> I just wish the media would realize how angry and frustrated the people have become . The knifing of our elected PM and the big fat lie comes the bastardization of our democracy and the position of PM of Australia in which she holds . All respect and trust is gone and the aged , wisdom and pride have surfaced all too ready to take up the fight to Julia Gillard and the Labor Party ! <p> It seems Mr Farr will always find some excuse to defend the indefensible Julia Gillard . <h> RyaN says : <p> 05:31pm 14/07/11 <p> @mrtiedt : guess you caught yet another Laborite doing what they do best , LYING ! <h> bobw says : <p> 05:31pm 14/07/11 <p> Erick is right . Mal should n't have written this article if he was n't prepared to produce a comprehensive historical treatise on Prime Ministerial abuse in Australia . It 's what balance demands , after all . So what if JG is the current PM and JH has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the issues of the day ? Good grief . What is the world coming to ? <h> Kevin says : <p> 06:00pm 14/07/11 <p> @RyaN Calling me a liar ? My posts are all there . How about you back up your slur by pointing out where I lied ? @mrtiedt So JHW was abused by someone in a row boat . That must have been really threatening I said he 'd never been abused to his face by someone on the street ( too many security guards ) and that I do n't recall him going to shopping centres to explain Workchoices . Keep trying . <h> Seano says : <p> 07:33pm 14/07/11 <p> Hey melle , <p> Absolutely the heat is on Gillard , it 's make or break time . But then the heat should always be on our leaders . Personally I have no problem with them showing emotion , it just shows they 're human and they really do care . <p> " The ill-mannered , name-calling started with Paul Keating , as you would have to agree . Nossy has pointed this out already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point there . Where is the line drawn ? Personally I think there 's a difference between the cut and thrust of passionate argument and out and out abuse . A well placed or cutting insult can have the effect of both highlighting your opponent 's flaws and cutting them down to size and Keating was a master of this . <p> I think the line is when people start hurling personal abuse that is backed up with nothing but hate ( and often lunacy ) . When people also think that all they have to do to win the argument is to call names and then keep screeching loonier and loonier invective . And when they think they have the right to get really personal about life choices or family it 's across the line . <h> RyaN says : <h> Scott says : <p> Oh please Mal , do you think your exempt ? how hypocritical , I believe you just called us cavemen who are confused and inarticulate . sounds rather like an insult and a generalization to me . <p> The fact is that people are angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the incompetence of the government and our hard work being wasted . now how are we all supposed to react ? No-one listens , so people get noticed by being bold , making waves . it has happened for thousands years and now we are at a point where people are thick skinned and de-sensitized to the type of language that would make our grandfathers choke on their teeth . so tell me , oh wise columnist . how do we fight to be heard , while being polite , when no-one listens . <h> Tom says : <p> 09:47am 15/07/11 <p> The left are squealing like stuck pigs . What a beautiful noise . Bullies copping some back and Mal is upset . <h> LeftRightOut says : <p> 12:42pm 15/07/11 <p> Mal has been trying and trying to do whatever it takes to save his Julia ... now he 's taking the Oakshott line that it 's all because she 's a woman ! Fair shake of the sauce bottle , Mal ... how did she manage to be popular at the beginning ? Did the country suddenyl wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a woman ! string her up ! " . <p> You 've written some drivel , Farr , but this takes the cake . People have referred to Howard copping much more , effigies of him as Bush 's dog , shoes thrown at him , leftist rallies about detention , children overboard , GST etc etc ... Farr is now trying to rewrite/shape history by lying in his columns ... one liar defending another perhaps . Maybe we shoudl create a blog about you Canbberra press gallery types , so people can see , in a single location , just how partisan you people are ( both left and right ) . Pathetic effort again , and another fail . <p> PS : My REAL email address is attached to this , though I use my favoured handle . not hiding behind anonymity . I 'd freely express my views about you to your face , in a polite manner . <p> PPS : Julia Gillard has often asked to be referred to as " Julia " . No point complaining when people accede to this request . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I doubt that Unionist.Unless of course you had all your sheep there to hide you . What I just do n't get is the fact that Jooliar became PM only through a blatant lie . We have so called inderpendants that conspired to get Labor across the line we are run by a fraudulent government and dills like you are happy about it and making excuses for them <h> c.conserv. says : <h> wolf says : <h> Amused says : <p> Certainly does nt seem to be working , with the shootings in the cities every night . <h> wolf says : <p> 05:23pm 14/07/11 <p> May not work everywhere but it does make a Gabrielle Giffords situation less likely . <h> LC says : <p> 07:10pm 14/07/11 <p> Wolf , he 's referring to trying to keep guns out the hands of criminals , which is the motivation of gun control here . It does not work in that respect because , well , criminals are criminals . Like they would give a flying f*** about what 's illegal and what 's not . Want evidence ? Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Self defense is a recognized human right in common law anywhere in the developed world and in the UN 's UDoHR . It 's unreasonable to expect the police to defend you from criminals , their job , when push comes to shove , is to investigate what happens at the scene of a crime after it 's occurred , and to arrest and charge criminals involved . No way could they appear in time to stop a crime occurring unless they just happen to be passing by . Hence why self-defense is protected by common law in the first place . But of course with any right comes responsibility . Anyone who wants a gun license must be reexamined on both how they handle the weapon , as well as a check on their records to ensure they do not have , or at risk of developing , a mental or physical impairment which would mean giving them a gun could mean danger , every 2 years , Swiss style . They should also be legally obliged to make sure that the weapon is kept properly secured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's used to commit a crime . And finally , those caught carrying an illegal weapon or caught with any weapon without a license should face a mandatory 18 months in jail . <p> There is a town in the US called Kennesaw , where , provided they fit federal guidelines for gun ownership , they must own a gun for civil defense . The law passed in the early 80 's has caused a reduction in crime , which I 'm pretty sure would have caused the gun control lobby to look pretty red-faced , as they claimed it would be chaos , that minor vehicle accidents would turn into bloodbaths etc. http : **35;167;TOOLONG ... <p> Granted , US 's lack of gun control in certain areas goes too far in the other direction . EG. no civilian should be allowed to handle automatic or high-caliber weapons , or even weapons which can easily be converted to fully automatic . Additionally , saying guns are a form of rights protection is utter crock in any 1st world country . The SWAT ( or SOG 's closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get anywhere nowadays . <h> LC says : <p> 10:06pm 14/07/11 <p> Besides , do n't pollies run around in bulletproof Statemans ? <p> And I do n't recall there ever being a political assassination in Australia . <h> RyaN says : <p> 10:26am 15/07/11 <p> @wolf : yes and your implication that Gabrielle Giffords was shot under some sort of right wing political motivation has been thoroughly debunked . <p> Do keep spouting your left wing lies though wolf , its not as though just about ever murderous , viscous dictator in the worlds history came from the left . Hell even Giffords shooter was a blatant lefty but do n't let the truth get in the way of your barefaced lies . Barefaced lies , wow just like our lying commie PM. <h> wolf says : <p> 11:26am 15/07/11 <p> @Ryan Wow the assumptions just keep rolling in do nt they . I post a couple of politically neutral comments and it 's fascinating to see the ' bias ' that gets read into it . Probably shows your political views more than mine . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I indicated a ' side ' ( right or left ) is behind political violence ? The point that you have helped demonstrate is the rhetoric is becoming increasinly hostile from ALL sides . Giffords shooter was a man with strong political views and his society has a style of ' debate ' that is increasingly uncivil . Add in the possibility of procuring firearms from your local K Mart and you see the result . As the incredibly hostile personal attacks on even this site shows the ' debate ' here has degenerated into childish squabling and name calling . I 'm glad that in this country the children are n't allowed to play with grown up toys like guns . <h> gisseppe says : <p> 01:30pm 14/07/11 <p> I do feel sorry for the PM , but i think she has asked for it by not giving the public a say , people like to think they have a choice , and they voted on what was said prior to the election . I think Julia is probably a very nice person but i would never vote for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown dog you wake up with flees . <h> Mayday says : <p> 02:06pm 14/07/11 <p> Very nice people do not get to positions of power ! <h> Vaunted says : <p> 04:28pm 14/07/11 <p> The Rudd/Gillard regimes have both taken first prize , in my book , for extreme rudeness and disrespect . I could expand on that , what with the being lied to and the ' carbon pollution ' tax being forced down our gullets , but I 'm sure you get my drift . Perhaps the proletariat are just trying to give as good as they 've got . Politeness is a two-way street ; I reckon one of the most disgraceful things I 've witnessed was our former middle-aged and supposedly dignified PM pulling a theatrical GetUp-type stunt in childishly , churlishly , pathetically turning his back on speakers in parliament ( I note that Gillard pulled the same move last week ) , and it 's more-or-less been all downhill from there . <p> And no Mayday , you do n't have to be a nasty , self-obsessed , rude or lying prick to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor engenders respect , perhaps amply illustrated by the abruptness of tenure of the two most recent incumbents . <h> Adam Diver says : <p> You ca n't call a spade , a spade . Its good that John howard and Tony Abbott recieve(d) no vitriol at all . Only targets of the left get any sort of negativity . <h> Jack says : <p> 03:00pm 14/07/11 <p> How did John Howard get away with saying there would " never , ever " be a GST ? Could it be that men do n't lie , just women ? <h> Hamish says : <p> 03:12pm 14/07/11 <p> Pathetic Jack . You know the difference . Do n't be so disingenuous . <h> Markus says : <p> 03:23pm 14/07/11 <p> @Jack , he did n't . He copped it big time , all the way up to that 2nd election . The difference is that Howard was a big boy , who did n't need the media to jump in and protect him from the repercussions of his own actions . <h> Tony of Poorakistan says : <p> 03:27pm 14/07/11 <p> Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like a GST or a Carbon Tax to an election , like Howard did , hey ? <p> Let 's see the lying , red-headed bitch do the same . <h> Kevin says : <p> 03:34pm 14/07/11 <p> @Tony of P Exactly what does the colour of the PM 's hair , or her gender for that matter , have to do with anything ? You are a prime example of what Malcolm Farr 's article is about . <h> Markus says : <p> 03:58pm 14/07/11 <p> " Exactly what does the colour of the PM 's hair , or her gender for that matter , have to do with anything ? " A lot , apparently . Notice how Farr has never felt the need to publicly defend any male politician , despite some of them copping 10 times the vitriol that Gillard has thus far ? <h> Erick says : <p> 04:09pm 14/07/11 <p> @Kevin - " Exactly what does the colour of the PM 's hair , or her gender for that matter , have to do with anything ? " <p> About as much as Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 04:24pm 14/07/11 <p> @Erick When have I mentioned budgie smugglers ? Do you endorse Tony of P 's comments ? <h> Fiddler says : <p> 01:34pm 14/07/11 <p> Not disagreeing that I would rather people stuck to intelligent debate but your claim about ten years ago ...... hmmm I seem to remember some pretty nasty things being said about John Howard back then . As for calling the PM Julia to her face , I would n't call her anything else , I , like most people stopped calling people " Miss " when I finished school , this is n't America where their head of state is referred to as " Mr President " ( I know she is n't our head of state , but lets be practical here " <h> RJB says : <p> 02:22pm 14/07/11 <p> Farr 's indignation at name calling does n't extend to anyone outside the Labor party . Instead of blaming radio commentators Farr , consider that anger is brought to the boil over time by a very compliant Canberra press gallery who twirl the batton in front of Rudd and Gillard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 02:54pm 14/07/11 <p> Perhaps it is her atheist moral compass which prevents her from understanding why people can not fathom a liar ? <h> Luce says : <p> 02:58pm 14/07/11 <p> I would n't necessarily say she 's a liar . She said no carbon tax would be introduced under any government she leads , and Bob Brown is making damn sure she 's not leading this one ! <h> Hamish says : <p> 03:08pm 14/07/11 <p> Calling Julia a liar is like calling her a redhead . For the first time in his life Mal is seeing one of his leftie heroes copping the kind of treatment conservative leaders expect on a daily basis . <p> Also I wonder if there 's a bit of ' Sir Galahad ' sexism going on here to boot . <h> Ando says : <p> 03:13pm 14/07/11 <p> Lair means she new when she said no Carbon that she would introduce one anyway as soon as she was elected . I do not believe that to be the case . Back flip yes , liar no <h> Mouse says : <p> 04:24pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election that it would be a hung parliament and she would have to say YES to a carbon tax to get the Greens onside to win . But , she definitely did know that she had said NO pre-election and lied , adamantly I may add , by saying she had never said that . She exacerbated the situation by eventually admitting her backflip . Her big mistake was not explaining right from the word go that she had to compromise on her election promise to form a Labor government . People may have had a bitch about it , but I am sure that she would never have had the backlash that she now has . gillard 's arrogance , behind closed door deals and " school marm " attitude have done her no favours at all , but it is this that have caused people to stop listening . She has no-one to blame but herself . <h> Joan says : <p> 04:32pm 14/07/11 <p> Gillard gets the respect she deserves . She knifed Rudd overnight then just weeks later blatantly lied to Australian voters . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised No Carbon Tax . We need another election , Australians are angry for being taken for a ride and taken as fools <h> mel says : <p> 04:41pm 14/07/11 <p> So none of you remember the Liberal 's " core " and " non-core " election promises ? And does anyone remember Tony Abbott on the 7.30 Report blatantly admitting he would lie to win ? So do any of you rant your disappointment at the two-faced conservatives and the lying Abbott ? <p> Give us all a break , people . Julia is just like the rest of them . <h> jb says : <p> 05:02pm 14/07/11 <p> Juliar Mugged Rudd , Mugged Australia and has Mugged Mal . Juliar the Mugger ... The funny thing is the guy that kept her in Power is also going to be the one who pulls her down . And after the dish he served on the press today once he 's done that he 's going to be next in line ... hehehehehe ! Now thats going to be the sweetest desert of them all ... yummy yummy ... <h> scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called a liar because she lied FFS ! ! <p> And as for the ' Julia ' thing - what happened to " my name is Kevin and I 'm here to help " - the ALP started the familiarity thing they ca n't complain about it now . <p> If Julia kept her word and was remotely competent people would n't be rude to her ... <h> atthepub says : <p> 07:25am 15/07/11 <p> Which PM have we ever had that only ever spoke the truth and nothing but ? <h> Q.Pham says : <p> 01:36pm 14/07/11 <p> Awww quick , someone give poor Mal a tissue . No more picking on Julia everybody ! But I 'm sure all references to mad monks , budgie smugglers etc are still ok . What is it with lefties spewing forth their hatred for anyone they disagree with and then crying like babies when it happens back to them ? Fairs fair , ya big baby . <h> fairsfair says : <h> Seanr says : <p> I do n't think you 're a big baby fairsfair .... I would never comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree Q.Pham <h> Tator says : <p> 02:52pm 14/07/11 <p> Hey Fairsfair , do n't be like that , You ca n't be like me with a chip on your shoulder , actually to be like me , it will be a whole spud . <h> Luke4 says : <p> 01:36pm 14/07/11 <p> It did n't happen to Howard ? I think it did , but not so much on the net in those days . Welcome to the world of the Internet Malcolm where most Australians can vent their anger , instead of venting it only at their neighbours and relations in the lounge room . Opinion pieces are written to stir people up , and the authors usually love that . Then what follows is what you see here and other sites , hysteria . So what do you think we should do ? Close down the internet maybe , or not have comment sections following ? <h> Ben81 says : <p> " It did n't happen to Howard ? I think it did , but not so much on the net in those days . " Ohhhh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You are such a hypocrite Mal Farr ! ! ! You - the biggest Labor-loving Bully-Boy of the lot moaning about people being rude ! <p> Your comments and slurs against Abbott and the LNP , along with anyone who voted for them or is against this ridiculous gathering that calls themselves a government are 10 times worse than ' get back under your rock ' ... and you call yourself a professional journalist ? <p> You 're just an arsehole with a means to express your opinion quicker than most people . <p> PS : We all know that feral greenie only went to that conference to pipe up and say " I 'm better than you lot " , but the way she was followed out by that bloke ( AND the media ) was not called for . <h> Kevin says : <p> 02:13pm 14/07/11 <p> What about when Tony Abbott was ambushed by the Channel 7 reporter ? How many complaints were posted about that ? Posts on the internet are one thing , but I think those ( including TA and JG ) who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people encounter them face-to-face . <h> Elphaba says : <p> 02:36pm 14/07/11 <p> So Kevin , we should call her a fibber ? Is that more polite ? <p> If someone is swearing and calling her a firecrotch or something equally inappropriate , I agree - which is why I said there was no excuse for rudeness . <p> Calling Julia a liar is not rude . It 's a fact . People frequently refer to TA as the ' mad monk ' and I do n't see Farr jumping to his defense . <p> This is a Labor apologist piece . So I 'll comment on it with the credit it 's due - which is none . <h> Kevin says : <p> 03:07pm 14/07/11 <p> You could n't get away with calling her a liar in Parliament . To my knowledge , no-one has called Mr Abbott " mad monk " to his face . The partisan double standards on the Punch are laughable at times . <h> Chris L says : <p> 03:07pm 14/07/11 <p> I personally do n't care if you call her a liar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " fact " ( at least not in relation to the carbon price when she promised no carbon tax ) . Of course the difference is just a technicality , but it does negate the charge of lying in that instance . <p> Mind you , calling any politician a liar is bound to be accurate . It 's not a phenomenon that suddenly started in 2007 . <h> Elphaba says : <p> 03:16pm 14/07/11 <p> Oh for Christ 's sake , Chris L , you 've been banging on about this for days and I 'm over it . <h> Chris L says : <h> melle says : <p> @Chris L. If it were not a lie , as you seem to feel , then a forthright Ms Gillard should have continued - " There will be no carbon tax , etc. " ....... and explained what there WOULD be . No ? <h> c.conserv. says : <p> 04:19pm 14/07/11 <p> @Kevin : To Kevin 's knowledge , no one has called Tony Abbott ' mad monk ' to his face . What ? ! <p> Have you checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 04:55pm 14/07/11 <p> @c.conser No , of course I have n't checked with him . Which is one reason why I qualified my comment with " to my knowledge " . If you know otherwise , I would be glad to hear the details . <h> Elphaba says : <p> 06:47pm 14/07/11 <p> Either a Chris or possibly a Christian has been citing article from the Australian saying that Julia did n't lie , whilst continually failing to refer to that piece of footage . <p> If this is not you , I apologise unreservedly . <p> I 'm not sure how a genuine case of mistaken identity is a ' lie ' though . <h> Chris L says : <p> 10:49pm 14/07/11 <p> That 's ok Elphaba , when we post under pseudonyms mistakes will happen . <p> I noticed that clip you linked cut out just as she said no carbon tax . I 've looked further and can find no clip that shows what she said next and no transcripts of the full sentence . Someone here has been saying that she went on to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if true ) would mean she did n't lie and did have a mandate . <p> I 'd be curious to find out the actual truth . Can anyone link a clip or a transcript of that full interview with channel 10 16/08/10 ? <h> Christian Real says : <p> 11:26am 15/07/11 <p> Kevin Tony Abbott was n't ambushed by Mark Reilly , he was caught out and that is why he went stck still , unable to answer . Tony Abbott , the ' want a be ' Prime Minister shows that under pressure from the media he is speechless and unreliable as even the Leader of the opposition Liberal party . <h> Chris L says : <p> 01:51pm 15/07/11 <p> Still ca n't find an unedited copy of the interview where Gillard rules out a carbon tax . <p> I did , however , find a news article that states she plans to bring in a carbon price . It would now seem a fact that she did not lie and she does have a mandate . <h> c.conserv. says : <h> NOT a Liberal voter , just sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar ( A liar is someone that lies BTW Mal ) and the woman in Brisbane called her a liar . What 's the problem ? She 's a liar . <p> Ray Hadley considers her an imbecile and expressed his opinion . It 's his show , he is allowed to express his opinion , actually I believe that is why he has a show , to express his opinion irrespective of how you might view it Mal . <p> The Greens voter ( trouble maker ) that came to a Liberal party function with an agenda around embarrassing Tony Abbott , she was clearly unprepared for the level of hostility she encountered . 99% of people would n't do that , she chose to attend and start trouble , she was n't invited by anyone to that gathering . Do n't want to get bit by lions ? Stay the f#*k outta the lions den - pretty simple really . <h> Chris L says : <p> Same would go for that lady that tried to ambush Gillard at the shopping centre then . <p> I take it if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe it 's true , whether factual or not ? <p> All politicians lie , and the funny thing is that " No Carbon Tax " was technically correct ( it 's a price ) . I find it strange that we 're suddenly surprised and outraged at political furphies , especially when this outrage is coming from the " non-core promise " party followers . <h> Dave Lewis says : <p> 03:08pm 14/07/11 <p> Ah ha an imbecile You seem like an imbecile and Im sure your mother was is an imbecile I presume most of your family are imbeciles , but as far as quality is concerned you are top of the heap when it comes to imbecility Now Ive expressed my opinion . It 's my show , Im allowed to express my opinion , actually I believe that is why I can contribute , to express his opinion irrespective of how you might view it imbecile . <h> Luce says : <p> 03:12pm 14/07/11 <p> So , Ray Hadley going on national television and throwing a childish insult at the prime minister is him expressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's policy proposals ( which is what voters can and should do ) at a rally is a trouble maker ? I would have thought it the other way around persoanlly .. hypocrisy much ? <h> NOT a Liberal voter , just sensible says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> @Chris L. As I do n't have a public profile , I 'd find it rather odd if someone as much as referenced me in a public forum , let alone a called me a ' name ' ( I 'm assuming you mean a derogatory name ) . Very strange question . <p> Thanks for playing . <p> @Dave Lewis . Oh no ! Dave Lewis , someone I have never met and have no opinion of has called my family and I imbeciles over the Internet because I can form my own opinion . <p> How ever will I go on . Woe is me ! <p> BTW Dave , I can use punctuation . Imbeciles like myself were taught how to do that when we were still in primary school , how about you ? Miss those years did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your remedial classes ? <p> Thanks for playing . <p> @Luce . Ummm one person is paid to give their opinions , the other was simply out to make trouble ( and a hero of herself at her next dinner party ) , surely even someone with you level of intellect can see the difference . <p> Thanks for playing . <h> Matt F says : <p> 04:52pm 14/07/11 <p> So if we 're not paid for our opinions we have no right to express them ? That 's some strange logic there . I do n't believe the woman at the shopping centre ( who you defended ) was paid for her opinion so , judging by your last comment , she should n't have been able to express it either ? Or are people only allowed to express opinions that you agree with ? <h> Luce says : <p> 05:05pm 14/07/11 <p> Haha , what ? ! So basically what you 're saying is the voting public are automatically trouble makers if they dare question the policies that will directly affect their lives , simply because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very genuine concerns ? <p> But a public figure being paid to talk by someone else , who shoots out unhelpful and childish insults , should be free of criticism , even though he represents the interests of an influential organization and not that of the public which this democracy is meant to serve ? <p> You , sir , have a strange view of the world . <h> Chris L says : <p> 11:04pm 14/07/11 <p> " @Chris L. As I do n't have a public profile , I 'd find it rather odd if someone as much as referenced me in a public forum , let alone a called me a ' name ' ( I 'm assuming you mean a derogatory name ) . Very strange question . Thanks for playing . " - <p> This is a public blog . Where do you think you are ? <p> I can make my question simpler if you need me to . When Dave called you an imbecile , is that justified if he believes it ? <h> Glen says : <p> 11:55pm 14/07/11 <p> " ... ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris L its a tax . Last time I checked the Federal Government is not in the business of SELLING carbon credits ( and if they do GOD HELP US ! ) . I see you are making the point its a price because it has a dollar value rather then a rate like GST , but it is still a tax . You are NOT gaining anything from this " price " as you put it ! Therefore TAX ! ! ! Sorry to be prissy but I hate it when people stuff definitions , especially for an agenda . <h> Chris L says : <p> 08:48am 15/07/11 <p> @Glen - Why accuse me of having an agenda ? That 's just a lazy way of dismissing a person 's viewpoint . I have posted comments defending Abbott in the midst of the confected outrage over his Womens Weekly interview and his admission over stretching the truth . Does that mean I have a Coalition biased agenda or were those comments OK because they supported Abbott instead of Gillard ? <p> My point then and now is that politicians did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep voting for these two parties they will continue to regard us with contempt ( suckers for punishment ) . <p> PS . I 've noticed these clips and quotes from Gillard promising no carbon tax are all carefully edited to cut out in mid sentence . I smell quote mining . <h> Chris L says : <p> 02:37pm 15/07/11 <p> @Glen - Further to the point about tax/price I have linked an article from The Australian published prior to the last election where Gillard specifically says there will be no tax but there will be a price . I do n't think I 'm splitting hairs here and if the voters did not understand what this meant I blame them for not doing some research . <p> These quotes from the coalition trying to make it look like she promised no carbon action at all are the lie . <h> Glen says : <p> 09:14pm 15/07/11 <p> Not convinced . I got you with uber pwnage just admit it . <h> Chris L says : <p> 12:32pm 16/07/11 <p> @Glen - Your pwnage was truly uber but my **28;204;TOOLONG was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not convinced but if you read with both eyes you will see my point . <p> PS. the link I refer to is further up under Elphaba 's thread . <h> Dan says : <p> 01:41pm 14/07/11 <p> Malcolm , it does n't matter what you write , the rudeness continues ( see some of the above and I 'm sure there will be plenty to follow ) . I am heartily sick of politics as it is played in Australia today . Regardless of your views , discussion should get beyond the level of the playground . <h> Paul says : <p> 07:22pm 14/07/11 <p> It 's not about the ability to question , Dave , it 's about the level of civility . One can ask why one changed one 's mind without using the word " liar " or using bulliing nicknames ( which , unfortunately , there is a nice easy one for you , but for the sake of civility I will leave it unsaid ) . <h> Anubis says : <p> 01:44pm 14/07/11 <p> Malcolm you stated in your article that " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't connected in some way to the fact the Prime Minister is a woman . " <p> ICB on that . If a male PM had done the same as Prime Minister Julia ( There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead ) Gillard then they too would be subject to the same sort of venom . This is a non-entity of a Prime Minister . No Policy wins , continual bungling , making up policy on the run - The East Timor Solution , The Manus Island Solution , The Malaysia Solution . Her ineffectual Government has hocked the nation to the tune of $100 billion dollars and climbing and this new policy on Carbon Pricing , which was supposed to be revenue neutral , was shown from the launch to be have a budget impost of over $4 billion dollars , and still climbing as the policy is assessed . <p> Of course Gillard , as the head of the most incompetent Government in Australia 's history , is going to draw venom from the electorate . She blatantly lied , and continues to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she is a woman , but because she is incompetent , out of her depth and trying to serve a personal agenda of social engineering in Fabianistic socialist idealism . She treats the electorate with absolute disdain and preaches to us as if we are simpletons. <h> boby says : <h> TimB says : <p> 01:44pm 14/07/11 <p> Dear lord , what a load of crap . <p> You could have replaced this entire article with a single tearful line : <p> " LEAVE JULIA ALONE ! ! ! " <p> Just think Mal , you could have even done a youtube vid . Then we could have had Harquebus complaining about " that flash crap " and thus kickstarted a far more stimulating topic for discussion than what you 've posted . <p> Politicians cop crap all the time . It 's part of the job description . It 's been going on for years . I do n't recall you leaping to the defence of Tony Abbott because of his " Mad Monk " moniker . <p> Oh and trying to claim it 's only happening now ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief . Erick 's going to be all over that one , and rightly so . What a stupid argument . <p> Julia brought this on herself because of her absolute contempt for the electorate . It 's only fitting that the electorate shows it 's contempt for her too . <h> Seanr says : <h> RobJ says : <h> melle says : <p> 10:51pm 14/07/11 <p> @RobJ , You meant - Good post TimB ? ...... Ok , all fixed <h> Eddie says : <p> 01:45pm 14/07/11 <p> You must be kidding Malcolm . What do the these politicians expect when exactly this behaviour is how they conduct themselves in parliament . They are childish and bullying towards each other . Name calling is part and parcel of being part of question time . <p> Yet for some reason you think that the public then should draw the line . <h> Keith Hammersmith says : <p> 01:46pm 14/07/11 <p> so somehow people calling the prime minister out for what she is - a Liar , some how related to the PM being a woman in some round about way ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did lie . Male of female , she lied so she is a liar . Any Prime minister that said he/she was not going to do something that a vast majority of people are against , and then once elected does it anyway , would be called out for what they are , male/female , it makes no difference . <h> fairsfair says : <h> Elphaba says : <p> 02:02pm 14/07/11 <p> I think the people agreeing with Farr pick up where he left off ... <h> Mouse says : <p> 04:59pm 14/07/11 <p> have you read some of these posts ff ? It looks like it certainly can ! The thing I really detest about this is the fact that Farr has used the gender role , " because she is a woman " . It 's getting a bit old . It would not matter whether she has breasts or balls , she is still a liar and still incompetent . <h> mickijo says : <p> 01:49pm 14/07/11 <p> In the past four years or whatever it was since the ALP gained office , there has been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been no let up from trouble and it is still going on . I now look back at the Howard years as years of peace , years of steady progress , years of sailing in calm waters . Now we never have that anymore . We lurch from one thought bubble to another . We have no idea of what will come next . My sincere hope is that someone will get enough commonsense to bring on an election so we can get back to a steady course again . We need that . <h> Chris L says : <p> 03:45pm 14/07/11 <p> You need to open that other eye . <h> Bill says : <p> 01:51pm 14/07/11 <p> The lady who spoke to Julia Gillard about her lies was very polite and while nervous was not angry . She did what most journalist including Farr fail to do and thats get to the truth . Some people are scared of getting chucked out of the press gallery but its true journalism obligation to find the truth . Its about time you started Malcolm instead of backpedaling . <h> MaKettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of bloody England . I bet your not upset when someone 's rude to Abbott . Were you outraged at the rude treatment Howard recieved in the past ? People at home watch her in QT , not sure which Julia that is ( oops I mean PM Ms Gillard ) but I know she herself has no problem being extremely rude to people in their while the nation is watching . <h> Two Mummies says : <p> 01:56pm 14/07/11 <p> Ever thought that by not having a firmer hand on the moderating tiller you and The Punch are simply encourgaing the sort of behaviour you are now railing against ? <p> Easy to simply blame the anonymity of the internet but at the end of the day the editors/owners of this site are the people responsible for publishing the sort of trash talk that encourages bullying and name calling in the real world . <p> ( no doubt and true to form a whole bunch of trolls will now attack this post ) <p> The contrast between the comments section there and the below-the-line atmosphere here at The Punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules along those lines are liable to be howled down as " censorship " by dim bulbs unable to see the ( obvious ) distinction between enforcing a baseline of relevance/civility and suppressing legitimate political opinions . <p> Of course , the other problem may be that heat generates more site traffic than light . <h> Marku says : <p> 03:11pm 14/07/11 <p> @bobw , while I have n't come across the Mumble blog myself , I have noticed with a lot of other sites that the apparent civil debates taking place are just a result of moderators deliberately moderating any comments that may cause offense . <p> Unfortunately , this inevitably translates to moderating any comments that the writer and regular readership disagree with , which makes the whole thread look more like a hand-holding kumbaya circle than a legitimate debate . <h> nihonin says : <p> 03:24pm 14/07/11 <p> And yet though you both complain about the comments posted on The Punch ( Two Mummies &; bobw ) , here you are ! No one is making you stay . <h> bobw says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> @Marku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer and regular readership disagree with " <p> Why ? As long as a relevance/civility threshold is relatively minimalistic , I see no reason why it ca n't be applied with acceptable consistency . <p> Say there 's an article about Gillard 's policy on truffles , and someone comes on and posts " Gilltard is nothing but a liar union communist scum " . Does deciding that a comment of that nature adds nothing substantive or relevant to the conversation really involve taking a political stance ? <p> Or say someone makes a comment on an article , and I submit a reply like " you are nothing but a clueless freakshow and obviously in the pay of getup " . Do I really have a right to expect that something like that will be published ? Are my political views being suppressed if it is n't ? Surely not , because I have n't made a relevant , recognisably political argument ( or , indeed , an argument at all ) . <p> I realise that some comments will fall into a grey area , but as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doubt goes to the poster , I do n't see why moderation should take on a political aspect . Gratuitious abuse , certainly , is not hard to recognise . <p> @Nihonin : And you have repeatedly decried the carbon tax as a national disaster , and yet here you are , still apparently living in Australia ! No one is making you stay . Your logic , not mine . <h> Two Mummies says : <p> 04:22pm 14/07/11 <p> I stay to read the articles and hope that the standard of comments will improve enough to make it worthwhile participating in the debate . <h> Markus says : <p> 04:26pm 14/07/11 <p> Not disagreeing with you bobw , I would absolutely be in support of that . Just pointing out that it is not the reality of how a lot of blogs that claim they follow a process like the one you described actually work . <p> While some abhorrent things make it through here sometime , I find the Punch is closer to the middle ground between censorship and anarchy than most other opinion blogs. <h> bobw says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the reality of how a lot of blogs .... actually work " <p> That may well be the case , but surely we could trust Rupe 's News Limited ? <h> c.conserv. says : <p> 04:52pm 14/07/11 <p> @bobw , the " excellent " Mumble blog ? ? You 've got to be kidding - that 's home to the most colossal windbags in the entire nation . <p> Yes , it 's civilised <h> bobw says : <p> 05:13pm 14/07/11 <p> @c.conserv : Ha ha ha . Fair enough . I think Peter Brent is quite good , and will refrain from generalising too much about the input of the below-the-line " windbags " . <h> nihonin says : <p> 06:43pm 14/07/11 <p> Ooooo bubw , good spin you have there , you turn your comment on me into a slight about my position on the CT into some kind of insult , please forgive me bubw for not having the same opinion as yours , I 'm so ashamed mwahahaha nah I ' m not . Oh and as for your comment about still being here in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sit on your bum , so you can type insults all day , so it 's best I not leave . <h> bobw says : <p> 07:10pm 14/07/11 <p> @nihonin : Are you quite finished foaming at the mouth ? If you ca n't grasp that a feeling that a discussion forum could be b-e-t-t-e-r need not compel one to avoid it altogether , then I 'm afraid I ca n't help you . <h> MDMConnell says : <p> 01:58pm 14/07/11 <p> Well , if someone has told lies , it 's not " rude " or " offensive " to call them a liar is it ? <p> Leaving that aside , I do n't think Gillard has been treated any worse than any other PM . Howard and Keating copped bucketloads of really personal bile for years , imagine if they had a great big self-indulgent sook every time someone took a cheap shot at them ..... we 'd have had no room for any other news ! . <p> Perhaps there is still a mentality that we should " go easier " on Gillard because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be insulted at the idea that we need to " be nice " to her because of her gender . <h> Diamantina Dick says : <p> or the ABC presenter who made lookey signals about him shen she thought she was off air ! ! ! <h> RyaN says : <p> 02:03pm 14/07/11 <p> Wow , so this partisan fool has burst out in a rage about the fact that his beloved party is being slaughtered mostly thanks to Julia . <p> I particularly like these pearls .. " She has been called a liar to her face by a woman who constantly referred to the Prime Minister as Julia " That is her name is n't it Mal ? How offensive to call someone by their name ! <p> " There is no direct and obvious link to gender , but it is difficult to believe that the rush of offensiveness is n't connected in some way to the fact the Prime Minister is a woman . " wow talk about playing the card hey Mal , I mean its only evil horrid males that are out there standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impunity by this government and readily backed up by their glorious purveyors or her propoganda like you Mal . <p> Keep spewing forth the glorious propaganda Mal , its as laughable as your credibility . <h> Bitten says : <p> 02:41pm 14/07/11 <p> I think the ' Julia ' issue is an etiquette issue : her title is Prime Minister in her official role and that is how she should be addressed . Obama does n't get called Obama in his official function . Any Minister would similarly be addressed formally as ' Minister ' in their official role . The rest of it is a bit rich though , I quite agree with you . <p> Malcolm , the PM should n't come out to mingle with us , the great unwashed pesky annoying voting public , if she wants to be constantly receiving compliments and told how like , totally brilliant , she and her government are . She should stick to ALP toadies , like yourself . She elected to come down the pleb level , I 'm afraid she 's getting her eyes opened . And probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not supposed to be . <h> Dave Charlesworth says : <p> 02:52pm 14/07/11 <p> Just image RyaN , what a bonus it would of been for Malcolm if the woman in QLD had been a Man ! ! ! <p> talk about playing the racist card then ! ! <h> Tator says : <p> 08:14pm 14/07/11 <p> Bitten , actually his first name is Barack , not too many people in western countries go by their family name <h> Bitten says : <h> The Stumpy One says : <p> 02:04pm 14/07/11 <p> Mr Farr , <p> Such a short memory . Do you recall the names , placards , statues and floats of Howard and how offensive they were . What about a lout in speedos hassling Tony Abbott in a shopping mall , what about someone throwing their shoe at a former PM . <h> Randal says : <p> 02:06pm 14/07/11 <p> Of course no one has ever said rude or offensive things publically about Howard , Costello or Abbott it 's just now that we have a female ALP PM that all those nasty conservatives egged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a problem . <p> Sorry Malcolm I must have missed all of those articles that you wrote in defence of the senior Liberals when they where compared to Nazi 's , called misogynists , racist , murderers and had their religious beliefs denigrated ... <p> So if you can you be a good chap and refer me to where I can read this mountain of work that outlines your concern at the insults thrown at our political leaders on both sides of the chamber , that would be much appreciated . <p> Should not be a problem for a balanced journo such as yourself Mal , surely ! <h> Steve says : <p> 02:09pm 14/07/11 <p> I hardly think it 's any worse than what Howard copped at the end of his time . The union funded anti-work choices scare campaign was relentless ( I know , I was a union rep at the time until I quit in disgust at the misinformation I was expected to peddle ) and the left wing protesters were n't exactly polite in what they were saying about him . <h> melle says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Summed up in 5 words - <p> " Parliament coming to the streets " <h> Mathias says : <p> 02:11pm 14/07/11 <p> Mate , honestly , sack up and do your bloody job . What a sad , sobbing piece of no point trash this is . How far removed from ' the public ' are you , not realise that we we are so disenchanted and disgusted with this government , that a lot of people feel the only thing left to do is scream . I can not believe that you are paid to spew out this rot . <p> I am however , disgusted with what happened to that poor lady , at that rally in Frankston. ( but really nice of the camera man to put down his camera and help her out of there , instead of just standing there like a tree stump . *sarcasm ) <h> Ben81 says : <p> 02:38pm 14/07/11 <p> Yeah I was waiting for someone to come along and say people disagreeing with this are " proving his point " , that point seemingly being a desperate attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thing from the Australian right . Does it get any weaker than that ? <h> Adam Diver says : <p> 02:56pm 14/07/11 <p> Is the view nice there on your pedastal ? <p> How dare we have a democracy ! <h> Stan Ivanov says : <p> 03:42pm 14/07/11 <p> @Adam Diver : no , it is not . <p> And it is spelled pedestal , see the difference ? <h> James In Footscray says : <p> 03:50pm 14/07/11 <p> Stan for Emperor ! <h> Chris L says : <p> 04:02pm 14/07/11 <p> @Ben81 - It 's true that name calling is neither new nor limited to one side . Neither is lying ( aka non-core promising ) , so this mock outrage at a backflip seems confected . Unless we 're to consistenly hold politicians accountable for their promises regardless of which party they belong to . I would support that 100% ! ! ! <h> Ben81 says : <p> 05:17pm 14/07/11 <p> " so this mock outrage at a backflip seems confected " Whatever makes you feel better about still trying to cling to this government Chris . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign and then backflip on that weeks later with a signed agreement saying the opposite ( especially with a terrible policy with serious impacts for zero real world gain ) and call any opposition to that " mock outrage " . You can probably say that yourself and look like a twit , but look what happens to a governments support when a PM acts that patronising . <h> Kat says : <p> 09:55pm 14/07/11 <p> I am always amused when so-called defenders of democracy first reactions are to threaten to take it away from those they consider " undeserving " <h> Chris L says : <p> 09:03am 15/07/11 <p> @Ben81 - So , you recognise that name calling is n't something new , but not following through with a campain promises is something Gillard invented ? Otherwise you surely would have been similarly outraged by the previous Coalition government . <p> I noticed your response seems to simply consist of name calling and dismissing me as " clinging " to this government . I 've stated a few times in previous blogs that I have no intention of voting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but I would like people to avoid resorting to lazy assumptions . <h> Ben81 says : <p> 10:15am 15/07/11 <p> No Chris there was n't much the last Lib government promised not to do and did anyway that ' outraged ' me . No way . I was n't happy with everything they did if that matters , it 's a complete cop out to say " but ... but ... Howard ! " anyway . <p> How about if you do n't want people making assumptions about you , avoid brushing off the obvious strong opposition to the carbon tax as " mock outrage " , that 's garbage that smells of desperation whether or not you intended it . I would n't say that about the left 's opposition to Howard 's policies . <h> Chris L says : <p> 01:16pm 15/07/11 <p> @Ben81 - Ok , here is why I think the outrage is disingenuous . The day before the election Gillard said she 'd be keen to bring in a carbon price . The clip people keep talking about where she says " no carbon tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the sentence and I can not find any example of the full statement online . <p> PS . I specified that I would like both parties to be held accountable for broken promises . If you want to brush off the responsibility of the right while baying for the blood of the left I do n't think you can credibly accuse me of being partisan . <h> Ben81 says : <p> 01:48pm 15/07/11 <p> Look Chris if Gillard saying clearly " There will be no carbon under the Government I lead " and the treasurer saying " What we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax " " We 've made our position very clear , we 've ruled it out " is n't clear enough for you I do n't know what is . <p> And even if none of that was ever said , this was not taken to the election and nobody has had a chance to have their say on it , Gillard refuses to let people ever have their say , Bob Brown says he will ignore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people are clearly very frustrated with that . I do n't see what 's so hard to understand about the fact that a lot of people are angry about this policy ? I mean really , how could you possibly convince yourself otherwise ? The way we ended up with this is just one reason people are angry , the main reason is that we 're driving up the cost of Australian products and the cost of living to achieve zero impact on climate change , not the slightest measurable thing . It is absolutely reckless and unjustified . <h> Chris L says : <p> Did you check out the article I linked ? Gillard said there would be a carbon price ( as opposed to tax ) before the election . <p> They went to the previous election with an ETS plan . <p> If anyone thought they had no say over carbon pricing/ETS they have n't been paying attention . <h> Ben81 says : <p> 05:00pm 15/07/11 <p> hmm , this place is like banging your head against a brick wall sometimes is n't it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just look at her sending mixed messages at the last second , and in it she again rules out a carbon tax . " I do n't rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme , a market-based mechanism , " she said of the next parliament . " I rule out a carbon tax . " <h> Kath Grant says : <p> 10:37am 16/07/11 <p> Spot on Stan . It 's not what they say but the way that they express it . Some of the comments are breathtaking in their rudeness . <h> Chris L says : <p> 12:35pm 16/07/11 <p> " hmm , this place is like banging your head against a brick wall sometimes is n't it " - <p> I agree . <p> My point is simply to point out the hypocrisy of the situation . If she can be condemned over a carefully edited soundbite then she can be absolved by an article from one day before the election . <h> Ben81 says : <p> 03:38pm 16/07/11 <p> What carefully edited soundbite ? She said it on more than one occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And again , the way we ended up with the tax is just one reason people are angry about it . To say it 's confected mock outrage is just plain ridiculous . <h> Chris L says : <p> 10:39am 17/07/11 <p> Ben , the clip cuts out mid sentence . Did this not trigger anyone else 's BS detector ? She went on to say there would be a carbon price . <p> Fair enough if you think this is splitting hairs , but no less than using half a quote to condemn her . <h> James In Footscray says : <p> 02:30pm 14/07/11 <p> Is n't there some responsibility on a PM to set the tone ? Why is n't that happening ? <h> OMGosh says : <p> 02:58pm 14/07/11 <p> Our PM has certainly set the tone here is a summary are here is the video . 1 leadership of the Labor Party 2 No carbon tax 3 Tells MP 's to deny they are in power sharing with " The Greens " 4 Every reputable climate scientist agrees with her 5 She was not invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jb says : <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <h> Gregg says : <p> 03:42pm 14/07/11 <p> If you are talking about what Mal has claimed Shane , it was on the news for a brief airing and it was not an offensive " you 're just a lying ..... " but Gillard was in some shopping mall . out doing her bit to sell the tax etc. and in addressing a woman , the woman asked her " why did you lie to us ? " All I saw aired of the answer was Gillard saying something like " I 'll have to have a talk to you about that " There was another bit with what could have been a minder chipping into to say something to the woman and she retorted with something like an " excuse me ! " That was all I saw televised . <p> Whether we call it a lie or a backflip on an election campaign statement , the CT which could just as easily be called a taxation structure reform and is by Swannie &; co. deserves to be put to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillard and the Greens will never return until that happens , and yep language can get ugly . <p> The saddest bit of all is that if the legislation goes through , it is going to be just as big a mess to undo and ultimately it is Australia and Australians that will suffer twice and that is where Gillard stands to be condemmed doubly . It would be a blessing if some backbenchers manage to find some courage to do the right thing by Australia . <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <p> 05:00pm 14/07/11 <p> @Gregg- obviously you 're not a " The Young Ones " fan ...... <h> Ben81 says : <p> 02:30pm 14/07/11 <p> Free speech Mal , it kind of applies to people you do n't agree with too you know . Also , resorting to acting like is some kind of one sided new thing is just weird and desperate . <h> AJ says : <h> John says : <p> 03:03pm 14/07/11 <p> No , it 's not ok in parliament , I recall some fine statesman-like speeches from Gough Whitlam and Jim Killen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't recall one instance of rank abuse that is the norm these days and from both sides of the House . It is pathetic . Is it a sign of the times that people have lost the art of insult without being odious at the same time ? Maybe the calibre of person who stands for parliament has dropped considerably . Look at the shock jocks ' behaviour . They actively incite such belligerent behaviour and all this for ratings . Never mind the side of politics they support . It is inexcusable . Maybe respect and tolerance for opposing viewpoints are things from the past-very sad . <h> Interested observer says : <p> 02:31pm 14/07/11 <p> I did listen to the Greens supporter at the rally . I considered her to be naive - stating platitudes in long winded terms without ever acknowledging that the action she was so proud of will not make any difference to climate change . I think it was a pity that nobody took the time to debate with her politely , to bring her to recognise this . I was totally unconvinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Steve says : <p> 02:33pm 14/07/11 <p> To implement a major reform you have to take the people with you . You have to present your argument prior to an election and run with it as part of or indeed the major part of your electoral platform . If you win the election having convinced the majority of the nation then even those who opposed you fall into line . <p> Compare that to what we have in this instance : <p> Rudd convinced by Gillard ( and others ) to drop ETS/carbon tax Rudd 's popularity falls because of dropping ETS Gillard takes over because Rudd has lost popularity Gillard specifically rules out a carbon tax 6 days before the election Gillard forced to break that promise to gain Greens support in minority Govt . Carbon tax being introduced without electoral mandate or support of the majority of the population . <p> Attempting major reform under these circumstances does not take the people with you and is a recipie for long term discontent over this issue . <p> ALP have simply gone about this the wrong way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anubis says : <h> Freeman says : <p> Years of blindly defending labor have taken their toll on Perse , she just stays at home now , rocking in her chain , afraid to read the papers or watch the news . <h> Mouse says : <p> 06:11pm 14/07/11 <p> Anubis , I do believe perse has moved to a new site , different name , same old lines though ! <h> Freeman says : <p> 02:43pm 14/07/11 <p> Talk about one eyed ! Dude , you should be wearin an eye patch . Howard was bullied by unions , reporters , Mark Latham and even recently had shoes throw at him , he never complained and no-one rushed to his defense . <p> Gillard 's Lie on the Carbon tax was the most blatant act of deception by any PM in memory and it deserves the response it has aroused . No need to be so precious , Farr . no serious impartial person could defend it , you are supposed to be a reporter , not an ALP trumpet . <h> nossy says : <p> 02:44pm 14/07/11 <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Keating was master at them way back in the early 90 's - see his " Insults Archive " linked . He used the word " scum " and such with gay abandon and today Speaker Jenkins would call a halt to anyone who said that . I think these are " gentile " times - if Gillard cant stand the heat then she should get out of the kitcken ! http : **29;234;TOOLONG <h> c.conserv. says : <p> 03:03pm 14/07/11 <p> @nossy . Yes , you are right . Keating was the master - and so many in the media adored him for it . <p> So ....... tough ! <h> Likes Joining Dots says : <p> 07:31pm 14/07/11 <p> Nossy , you beat me to it . There is abuse from the anonymous blog contributors and there is abuse from those in power which has been going on for a lot longer , the difference from then to now is there is a forum to respond . <p> A few examples spring to mind from politicians , from memory - silly old bugger - get a job - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes and found The Punch and Question time has already done it for me . <p> I do n't agree with the Juliar/Rabbit digs and I would like some respect shown for our elected members , but these sorts of comments from politicians are hardly edifying . <h> No 1 Rosie says : <p> 12:12am 15/07/11 <p> Hi Nosthow , <p> Just finished watching Lateline - Keating was Tony Jone 's guest . He was in defense big time for Gillard . Carbon tax is a big Labor reform blah blah blah . Most of the time was spent criticizing Tony Abbott , even to the extent that he was backing Bob Browne and that Murdock 's News Ltd was against the Gillard Labor Govt . Mind you he did n't refer anything to the Gillard Labor Minority Govt , it was the Gillard Labor Govt . I think he has forgotten about the Greens , Oakeshott , Windsor and Wilkie and thinks this country is being governed by the Labor Party ! <p> Did n't want to talk about the polls , just blamed Tony Abbott and said the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning I felt apprehensive but then towards the end I thought that with his age I reckon dementia had settled in . <p> I think to be fair Lateline should bring on John Howard . <p> So Gillard is the shy Julia now crying out for sympathy votes . That is what her performance was about at the Press Club . <h> Burgey says : <h> Sentient Being says : <p> 02:49pm 14/07/11 <p> Pauline had to suffer the ignominy of having condoms filled with piss lobbed at her by lefties . John Howard was subjected to a very prolonged and very personal hate campaign by unbalanced ALP supporters , Green extremists and garden variety-thugs . <p> In terms of a lack of respect for elected public officials , conservatives have a very long way indeed to catch up with the bastardry the left has demonstrated in Australia over decades . <h> Markus says : <p> Someone referred to our PM by her name ? Scandal ! Throw them in the stocks ! <p> Is it because she is a Labor PM that Farr is blind to the abuse that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular basis ? <p> Or is it because she is a woman that Farr feels the need to defend her from reality at every turn ? This is the 21st Century , Farr . Women are just as able to handle criticism for their actions as men . Take your oppressive mysoginistic attitude elsewhere . <h> MarK says : <p> This is from a man who rt'ed the irresponsible Turnbull tweet and then saw it published on this website . <p> I note that now sanity has prevailed and both Farr and Turnbull have deleted the tweet but seriously Farr .... clean your own house first . <p> What about this tweet <p> " farrm51 Malcolm Farr Hey would n't it be funny if GetUp booked about 100 seats at the NPC for Monkton 's appearance Tuesday . Actually , I think they have . " <p> Here you are gleefully announcing that a press club debate is going to be hijacked by a left wing union funded group . You are a former president of the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery ( apologies if you are still ) and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you are worried by manners on the internet ? <p> Julia is being called a liar because she lied . That is all . As that wonderful lady expressed so succinctly yesterday this is why Julia is in trouble . Nobody but the true sycophants believe her . Look at Sky last night . People were lining up to call here a liar . The office of PM is trashed and this has happened on the current press gallerys watch and has largely gone unreported . <p> This piece , along with Sharwoods , just proves to me the total unpreparedness and disconnect the press , journalists , opinion writers and insiders have with the general public . <p> You guys really do not get it do you ? <p> You are spooked by the anger . It is not a " press says people are angry " story line it is a real anger . We have been trying to tell you people in the lofty castle that for a year . <p> Earth to " journos " we are pissed . <p> Hence the change , sudden as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For years we , the skeptics have copped the denier tag . Copped being derided as espousing " drunk rantings ( as I have been accused of ) " or our beliefs are from " professor bumfluffs " school of bullshit . <p> We have sat by while Copenhagen fell apart ; Cancun did nothing and hoped sanity would prevail . For years we have had to sit by while Al Gore told us the world would end soon while he racked up billions . We have seen Gordon Brown say we have 60 days to save the planet . We have seen Robin Williams tell us the seas will rise 100 metres . We have Flannery lie and predict nothing that has eventuated . We have listened while Flannery was feted for telling us of never ending drought then never ending rains . Not once has he been questioned and his incoherent logical fallacies shown up . We have had our kids indoctrinated with fear . We have been wronged . <p> No more . <p> When a PM gets re-elected by lying directly to our faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind " hysterical " before the election we get pissed . All that had to happen for a Liberal government was a few hundred votes in each seat to change . Do not have the temerity to think I will believe Julia saying she will bring in a Carbon Tax during the election campaign would not have swung a few hundred in each seat to the coalitions favour . <p> Now you are attempting to cover the error of judgement you have made . We are not comatose or narcoleptic . We are pissed . And we are expressing it . Re-read all your own articles . Re think your dogma . <p> Julia is hated Farr . Hated . Labor need to dump her and this policy . Or they need to run an election campaign on it and test their conviction . <p> She picked this policy not because she believes but because she wanted a cause to be tough by . And you have supported her every step of the way . <p> Do n't get huffy mate . You were wrong . So very very wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to take this week alone will not save her or save your opinions from being shown to be false . <p> Australians hate a bullshit artist Farr . They hate being treated as idiots . Gillard , the warmists and the compliant press have done it to us for long enough . Do n't feign surprise a day of reckoning came . <p> And it will get worse . <p> PS I totally reject yours ( and Oakeshotts ) opinion this has to do with sexism . Are you really that desperate you are going to go there ? OMG . The wheels are falling off quicker than you ever thought eh . <h> Seanr says : <p> *clap* *clap* very nicely put MarK , I 'll put this down as the comment of the day . <h> Andy1 says : <p> 03:32pm 14/07/11 <p> I agree , comment of the day MarK . Nicely articulated . <h> Anubis says : <p> 03:39pm 14/07/11 <p> Spomething along these lines too - last night , just before midnight , Channel 99 ( Go ! ) ran an episode of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Absolutely brilliant . <h> Sony B Goode says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> Leftists are all closet fascists , you ca n't have a world view of culling prosperity and believe in freedom . They are either idiots or evil . <p> Gillard is just evil . <h> Mathias says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Anubis - ' Accordning to our calculations , global warming is due to hit 2 days before the day after tomorrow . " hahaha <h> Kevin says : <p> 04:20pm 14/07/11 <p> @MarK Your rant does n't address the actual point of the article . Which is not surprising considering you are one of the worst offenders when it comes to showing a complete lack of respect to anyone who disagrees with you . PS : Do n't purport to speak on my behalf . <h> Anubis says : <p> 04:20pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Mathias - It was a classic . Should be necessary viewing for all " believers " <h> RyaN says : <p> 04:46pm 14/07/11 <p> @Mathias : the absolutely terrifying part is that persephone bases most of her reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> MarK says : <p> 06:08pm 14/07/11 <p> Hahahaha <p> I think I am now starting to get the moderation around here . <p> Hmmm . I might start a blog and publish what I send in then people can see what gets through and what does n't . Just for reference and research purposes . <p> Oh and hai kevin . <p> You have a super day now you little scamp you . <h> casba says : <p> 12:17pm 15/07/11 <p> And I will second it ! Brilliant , erudite and eloquent- and YOU are the journalist Malcolm ; yet this writer writes incisively , empathetically and with more sense and no spin than most of the Canberra Press Gang put together . <h> Dave lewis says : <p> 03:01pm 14/07/11 <p> Hadleys comment is rich coming from an imbecile who has anger problems which he states are being psychologically treated . He has clearly shown the opening up of his anger issues was a strategy to gain public sympathy whilst giving excuse to his beligerence and ignorance He should stand himself down and then publicy and personally apologise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ! <h> John Smythe says : <p> 03:02pm 14/07/11 <p> Mal , " People hiding their identities and accountability behind fake names and uninformative email addresses feel bold enough to fire personal attacks at writers who are public about their stances . Usually they add nothing to policy debate , only to the lexicon of insults . " <p> Cry me a river . Tory has my email address , and is more than welcome to ask me by email for my real name . My votes will also reflect I stand behind my opinion . <p> Felt like I was reading People magazine given all the sensationalising in this piece . <h> Markus says : <p> Agreed . The only thing preventing me from deriding their opinions to their faces is the likelihood that I will ever chance being in the same place as them at the same time . <h> Botboy says : <p> 03:02pm 14/07/11 <p> The comments here largely support what you are saying Mal . And I also agree that the PM is not treated the same as previous male PM 's . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ? The constant referral to ' Julia ' is designed ( by no one in particular ) as a sign of disrespect for her position as the PM . The woman yesterday went so far as to call her ' girl ' . Let alone the sexual innuendo of ' being bed with Bob ' or ' make an honest women ' etc . This also flows to comment about the way she speaks ... references to mothers . nana 's and kindy teachers all play into the sexual politic . <p> This debate has quickly degenerated into a slag fest and about what $10/week . You poor hard done by rich kids - yes we are all rich in Australia look around the world . Even if it is all a big conspiracy to redistribute wealth ( which I do nt think it is ) are people saying " bugger you - I am on $100,000 a year but you cant have $10 a week because the payments on my BWM are just too big . Pathetic . This debate is also having wider impacts - the current ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back drop of strong employment , low inflation , low interest rates ( still below average since the GFC ) high dollar etc . How much lays at the feet of TA and his ' the world will end ' rhetoric . Towns " wiped of the face of the earth " Industries " destroyed " . What a lot of overblown rubbish . If we want to go down the same path that saw American politicians shot and no intelligent debate in the public arena than we can just keep on the same path as that is the result . <h> John Smythe says : <p> 03:16pm 14/07/11 <p> come off the grass mate . You really think this is about her being a woman ? <p> please .... try again . <h> Anubis says : <p> 03:45pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Botboy - As far as your comments regarding TA 's " world will end scenario " . Is that different , or worse than , We are in permanent drought , Sydney and Adelaide will be without water by 2007 , coastal towns and suburbs will be inundated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any more snow in England/Australia , monster cyclones and tropical storms will devestate Australia , drought will destroy all our farming , it will never rain properly again , dams will never again be full , the world is going to be so hot that species will become extinct , all humans will die . <p> Standard warmist " end of the world " crap . Tell me , how much of this has come true ( BTW : if you have followed the debate for years you will know that all of the above are supposed to have happened by now , depending on which alarmist you listen to - Gore , Flannery , brown et . Al . <h> Botboy says : <p> 04:34pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Anubis - Climate happens over 1000 's of years so a scenario might take 100 's of years to play out . TA is talking about the world ending next year with introduction of a tax . Yes the things about the climate you mention will happen but prediction is not an exact science . If there was n't the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) we would be in the grip of an extreme drought - just lucky . I am glad the prediction did n't happen when they said they would but that wont stop it happening in 10 , 210 , 50 years . Luck I have no children and will be dead . <h> Botboy says : <p> 04:34pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Anubis - Climate happens over 1000 's of years so a scenario might take 100 's of years to play out .

Luck I have no children and will be dead . <h> Botboy says : <p> 04:45pm 14/07/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman is the elephant in the room . Men do not like being told what to do by women ( generalisation ) . So this is on a grand scale . It cant be verbalised as they know it is sexist but they can use a range of things ( not related to her sex ) to try and bring her down . It is not ALL about her femaleness but it is a big part of the reactionary approach people have taken with her . PS - I like it on the grass <h> John Smythe says : <p> 05:20pm 14/07/11 <p> " What a lot of overblown rubbish . If we want to go down the same path that saw American politicians shot and no intelligent debate in the public arena than we can just keep on the same path as that is the result . " <p> Mate , a lot of this is that Australia is heading down the same path . Someone actually pointed it out in a comment earlier today , and it answered why I felt I missing some link to Australians discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates the topic as much anymore . There are a few of us still keep nonpartisan on it , but FFS , people are just so RED STATE or BLUE STATE on this . <p> And , no , I do n't think this has anything about her being female . Perhaps some people attacking her use that in their attacks , but this is about her in a losing position , lying to get the winning votes . Had she of lied , when she was miles ahead in the polls ( spelt it right this time ) the impact would not have been as much . It was a deliberate power grab . And THAT is why people like me do n't forgive her . I do n't care if she is a she , a he , an it , black white purple or blue . Labor Liberal ALP or Joe 's niece . Her gross misconduct to the Australian voter , and this half-thought out package is completely unacceptable . <h> Preston says : <p> 03:02pm 14/07/11 <p> So the HON PM Ms Gillard did n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were hoping for Malcolm I suspect . The HON PM Ms Gillard should have just said NO to Mr Bob Brown and Mrs Christine Milne and stuck to her word she made to the Nation in the beginning . " There will be no Carbon Tax under a Government I lead " She decided to go back on her word to the Nation and accept the deal . Well now she must face the fury of the Nation . It was her choice . <h> Botboy says : <h> Tony of Poorakistan says : <p> 03:20pm 14/07/11 <p> I read it - he was very specific when it came to mentioning that it was ' ' only ' ' $9.90 per week but I notice he failed to tell us how many degrees $9.90 per week each would lower global warming by . ie , it is yet another ALP fluff piece , doubtless by yet another sycophantic left-leaning journo swilling free g &; t 's courtesy of the PMs press office . Most of them could n't find their arses with both hands after lunch , eh Malcolm <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no carbon tax under a government I lead . <h> Anubis says : <p> 03:48pm 14/07/11 <p> @ Tony of Poorakistan - see my post on The Great Dividing Rage Punch article today . Using the Warmists own figures it works out to one 4000th of a degree . Hmm , how many billions is going to be spent to save this poofteenth of a fraction of a degree ? <h> bobw says : <p> 04:22pm 14/07/11 <p> @ToP : Demanding a " temperature reduction " figure expressed in degrees only demonstrates that you do n't understand the issue . <h> Botboy says : <p> 04:39pm 14/07/11 <p> @ T of P - It is a bit like water restrictions - the water you save by not brushing your teeth in the shower is nothing but if everyone does it then a difference can be made . It is about doing our bit being that we ( the developed world ) have been responsible for putting most of the crap up there in the first place . And by the way your language and tone just confirm what the article has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what .... get over it . Is it playtime ? <p> @ Anubis - see above . Yes on our own it means little but someone has to start somewhere - plenty have we just have to catch up . <h> Tony of Poorakistan says : <p> 04:51pm 14/07/11 <p> bobw <p> yes I do . The left are able to tell us to the nearest 10 cents how much it will cost ; why ca n't they give us the same amount of accuracy as to what effect it will have . <p> Go to a butcher and he 'll tell you fillet steak is $39.99 per kilo . How would you feel if he charged you $39.99 , then said ' ' there ya go ' ' without telling you how much it weighed . You can not have it both ways . <h> Sony B Goode says : <p> 04:54pm 14/07/11 <p> It 's not about degrees of cooling ; it 's about percentages of prosperity destruction that can be achieved without a lynch mob descending on Canberra . As we can see the electorate has a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a koala can bear . <h> bobw says : <p> 05:18pm 14/07/11 <p> @ToP : Your analogy does n't hold , because a transaction with a butcher takes place in a context of immediacy and certainty . In any event , the primary aim of carbon abatement is to reduce the rate of increase , not to produce an appreciable decrease . <h> sid says : <p> 03:05pm 14/07/11 <p> Mal , where are you going with this ? ? ? ? <p> Where have you been ? ? <p> I agree there is some pretty nasty stuff out there and the slinging has been coming from all angles and all parties . <p> I find it rather comical really . <p> I do nt think Julia is a liar she is just conservative with the truth , if she said we are going to have a carbon tax she would have never got in . And as she readily admit the Greens are telling her what to do she has little choice . <h> John Smythe says : <p> 04:00pm 14/07/11 <p> .... if she said we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in ....... <p> right there is a lot of why people do n't trust her anymore . Deliberate lie to ensure she gets in . In an election where it could go either way , she lied to the Australian public to ensure she gets in ( as a minority govt mind you ) . <p> This is not coming from someone leading the poles and major backing by the people , this is coming from someone desperate for power . What emphasises this further is her continual arrogance and condescending tone to the Australian people . Add to this her recent attempts at NLP trying to tell us she is our ( elected ) Prime Minister .... ( you know what I mean by that comment , if you don ; t go back to the beginning of the paragraph. ) <h> poa says : <p> 03:07pm 14/07/11 <p> The ever consistant Mal Farr . Wow . You remember the hatred and vitriol the left poured on John Howard . You must think back on the personal campaign against Tony Abbot . Seeing a carefully scripted Gillard in tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help but think she may be better employed on the set at Neighbours . mate . Labor had better stop hiding behind Gillards skirt . You tried the old Maggie Thatcher routine yesterday . Tears today . What stunt will she try tommorow. ? And no doubt .. she 'll count on your support in doing so . After all .. Mr Farr wo n't be the one to criticize a hopeless government . ( Well a Labor one ! ) That might be rude ! <h> Martin says : <p> 03:08pm 14/07/11 <p> Malcolm , Ms Gillard simply does not carry herself as a Prime Minister . Peoples ' perception of her as a second rate choice is now obvious . When you have women , not men challenging her in such an aggressive fashion , she should know she now has a very big problem . She should be able to rely on some of the female vote , however I think they have forgotten about her gender and now feel she has let them down and embarrased her sisterhood . It is a shame that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land is somewhat of a failure and does not carry herself as a Stateswoman . Kevin Rudd , like him or dislike him did have that air of a Prime Minister about him as did Howard , Keating Hawke , Fraser and even Gough . They all stood for something , As did Margaret Thatcher . Gillard 's credibillty combined with the suspect method of initially gaining the Prime Minstership ( by knifing Rudd ) and the subsequent pandering to the Greens and Independants in a minority governmenr has portryed her as week and without purpose . It really does appear that people are incredibly frustrated at not being able to voice their opinion effectively . Hence they do things they normally would not do to try and get their opinion heard regarding matters of national importance . They also no doubt feel a frustration at the level of spin , disinformation and extraordinary efforts being made by a government to drown out negative sentiment to their policies . You are right , it is only going to get worse . People want to vote on this tax , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote , The Greens , having right of veto over every importatnt public policy . Something is going to give , I doubt this will last to 2013 . <h> James1 says : <p> 03:15pm 14/07/11 <p> People , please . Regardless of who said what about who , and when , and which is worse , surely we can agree that our national political conversation would benefit from more rational discussion , and less insults on all sides of politics ? <p> Yes , people said terrible , stupid , insulting things about John Howard . Yes , people say terrible , stupid , insulting things about Julia Gillard . Neither group is being helpful in doing so - indeed , they are just undermining the point they are making with their resort to childish insults . <h> Markus says : <p> 04:10pm 14/07/11 <p> I think people 's biggest issue is the double standard . <p> Howard was publicly derided day in , day out . Only the extremely out of the ordinary personal attacks were ever publicised ( shoe throwing etc ) , and even they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only after Gillard gets asked the quite reasonable " why did you lie to us ? " by a single person , that Farr suddenly feels the need to demand that the public vitriol against our elected officials has to stop . Why is that ? <h> bobw says : <p> 04:26pm 14/07/11 <p> Good call , James1 . <h> Tom says : <p> 10:56am 15/07/11 <p> Good call , Markus <h> Botboy says : <p> 03:16pm 14/07/11 <p> For those who have forgotten the original quote or just leave out the rest of the sentence for impact . <p> " There will be no Carbon Tax under the government I lead but I remain committed to putting a price on Carbon " <h> Freeman says : <h> Hamish says : <p> 04:10pm 14/07/11 <p> Unless 70% of people are oldsters on pensions ( the percentage of people who do n't like the tax ) , this comment is completely irrelevant . Not that relevance is generally your strong suit Marilyn . Your JWH comment is a classic example of the left 's penchant for slander . I guess when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a conservative it 's unprecedented disrespect for people in public life . <h> Natalie says : <p> 04:15pm 14/07/11 <p> Marilyn you should run for PM - you got what it takes . GO GIRL . <h> Barry says : <p> 05:24pm 14/07/11 <p> Racism . . . ah I love some of the idiots on here , always good for a laugh . <h> RyaN says : <p> 05:28pm 14/07/11 <p> Whoo the cookiest racist is here to save the day . We must love murdering brown people hey Marilyn because that 's what white people do . Moron ! <h> CynicalGoatWA says : <p> 03:27pm 14/07/11 <p> This article must surely must be one of the greatest pisstakes of all time by " Mr " Farr ( do nt want to upset the luvvies sensibilities too much ) . I mean even for a journo whose usual rantings are definately more " progressive " rather than " conservative " , this really is a bridge too far . Someone needs to swallow a bag of rapidset ..... <h> CJ says : <p> 03:34pm 14/07/11 <p> Malcolm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our elected representatives on the floor of the parliament . The standard of conduct in Question Time is a national embarrassment . Name-calling , cat-calling , interrupting , heckling , howling , interjecting , jeering , besmirching - our politicians wrote the book on it , and they add a new chapter every single time parliament sits . Ca n't believe that did n't rate a mention in your defense of them . <h> Barry says : <p> 03:40pm 14/07/11 <p> I do n't think the rush of offensiveness has anything to do with being a woman , but I do think it has a lot to do with the wrapping of cotton wool around our poor Prime Minister . Abbott has received a great deal more in terms of unfair character assassination . How about his comments on his daughters , which were completely reasonable comments for a father to make , and the raging feminist brigade turned it into the disgusting character assassination of a caring father for absolute no reason . Please get real . <h> jb says : <h> Shane says : <p> 03:48pm 14/07/11 <p> Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bars and at parties ? The toxic bores who 'd try to turn any conversation into a tedious lecture about how much they hated women , or the Prime Minister , or some Government policy , or Flash ? <h> Duschbag says : <p> 04:18pm 14/07/11 <p> Hey Shane : I know my mate was a drunk as he and I used to go to the PUB all the time . <h> jb says : <p> 03:51pm 14/07/11 <p> Oh and was n't it the PM itself who kept on calling what some of you journos write " Crap " , yeah real statesman like that was Mal was n't it ? Write opinion stuff but please try and include some more fact ! <h> Plato says : <h> John Smythe says : <p> 04:10pm 14/07/11 <p> you serious ? Who the hell do you think they referred to as Lil Johnny the Backbencher all those years ? <h> Leo says : <p> 04:06pm 14/07/11 <p> Malcolm , you seem to focus on political rudeness quite a bit in your musings . I recall finding foul of Paul Keating 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " line to Jim McClellan but these days a cat call seems to upset fragile sensibilities .... Given your stand , I hope your swear jar is empty ! ! <h> Karen from Qld says : <p> 04:08pm 14/07/11 <p> What the hell do you expect Mr Farr - this is what happens when you double cross the electorate for the sake of clinging on to power . If Julia Gillard wants respect then she should start showing some to the Australian public first by giving them the chance to decide if they want a carbon tax by calling an election . <h> ChrisD says : <p> 04:22pm 14/07/11 <p> I agree that the Australian people should have more respect for their leaders , but part of the problem is that these days the party leaders ( and others of high social status ) want to keep re-inventing themselves as " everyday-Joes " , pretending they are just like the common person , and as such bring their status down to that level . Pretty obvious really . <p> As far as Malcolm Farr 's concern about those who " hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone chose to be a human mouth-peice , getting paid for their opinion . When " The Punch " or any other media outlet wishes to start paying me for my comments , I will gladly put my full name and details to it , as part of my contractual agreement . In the meantime , I 'll just snipe from the sidelines . <h> Roland says : <p> 04:26pm 14/07/11 <p> The pro Gillard journo 's are but in tears at her treatment . And the polls are n't reflecting the story they are telling us . You can have a good cry about it with Barry on Sunday Mal . It 's all too upsetting I ca n't continue ................... <h> melle says : <p> 06:07pm 14/07/11 <p> Sweetheart Roland - hahaha . Overcome ? <p> There was weepin ' in the rafters There was weepin ' in the ricks .... <p> Too late for tears , Ms Gillard <h> James Ricketson says : <p> 04:32pm 14/07/11 <p> I read this article hoping to find , in the comments , some thoughtful responses . Perhaps they are here but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments - regardless of who they were made about - I tuned out . This is not debate . It 's a slanging match . Is this the quality of debate that we have to look forward to in the future , Punch ? If it is , you 've lost me as a reader . <h> Labor Ruined this Country says : <p> 08:47pm 14/07/11 <p> The time for debate is over . I just want this back stabbing , lying , PM and her hopelessly incompetent cohorts of Greens , Browns and Independents removed from government . And for all those Labor voters that say " ohh , I will never vote Labor again " I have but one question . The writing was on the wall before the last election when Julia knifed Kevin , why did you believe that she would n't introduce a carbon tax ? The people who voted Labor at the last election should just suck it up . You should have to pay this BS tax for the rest of us . <h> No 1 Rosie says : <p> 04:34pm 14/07/11 <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shouting and screaming will only stop when ' political morality ' by this Gillard Labor Minority Govt prevails which is elections now to seek a mandate on Julia Gillard 's carbon tax based on lying to the people during the last Election campaign . What did Mr Farr expect from the people when the epitome , the main actor , considered to be our role model has shown us how to become stubborn , unreasonable , non-listener and every other act of defiance . Those that wish to shout and scream to be heard are not the ones representing the people and would never be in the position to lie to the nation , unlike Julia Gillard , Australia 's first female PM . These people are not to be blamed . This is where the problem lies and if Gillard wo n't give us what is democratically our right " elections now to seek a mandate for her carbon tax the shouting and screaming will only become louder and louder . Her speech at the Press Club was pathetic and a lonely cry for sympathy votes . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became PM but all about herself and the lie she now has become so famous for . It should be likened to a maiden speech spoken when the PM first introduces herself to the people . What was the purpose of her telling us how shy she was at school , ? This was made worse when she was nearly in tears while saying it . It was another of her stunts and a reminded to us of her fake/real Julia episode to gain our acceptance after lying to us . What we now have is a PM behaving like a martyr ( in defiance rain or shine I am going to have this carbon tax because I say it is the right thing to do for this country and its people ) on one hand , while on the other she has now become the ' shy Julia ' crying for sympathy votes . Will the PM ever have any spare time left to govern and look at the other important issues for the betterment of this nation or is it all about selling her carbon tax until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the big fat lie comes the bastardization of our democracy and the position of PM of Australia in which she holds . The aged , wise and proud have risen and spoken and nobody deserves to be screamed and shouted at as much as Julia Gillard . <h> Joan says : <p> If you want to abolish democracy try stomping your feet and holding your breath along with your shouting and screaming . <h> No 1 Rosie says : <p> 12:24am 15/07/11 <p> Thanks The False Joan The Badger The Harass <p> Ning Nong Badger 's Here . <p> It is an achievement when a blogger reads my comments and responds , be it a worthless silly one or adding to the debate . <p> It separates the smart ones from the idiots ! <p> Now be a good little badger , crawl back to your badger hole and stop playing your duplicity harassing game ! <h> Joan says : <p> 10:04am 15/07/11 <p> @Rosie <p> Textbook extreme right wingnut .

Anyone who disagrees with your antiquated views is The Badger . What a laugh . <h> Seano says : <p> 04:46pm 14/07/11 <p> " Mr Turnbull published his name and mobile number on Twitter along with a request to stop contacting him . " <p> I saw this on Twitter today and thought " wow " and " Good on him for taking a stand " . I see the tweet has since been deleted . Turnbull would definitely make a good PM IMO . <p> If you want to see just how crazy the world is getting look at the replies our pollies on both sides get to their tweets . Some of it is truly insane . Although regular readers of the comments here probably wont be too shocked . <h> Matt says : <p> 04:52pm 14/07/11 <p> Who would have thought we are supposed to be the lucky country . So lucky in fact you can abuse our Prime Minister to her face and keep your life . Would you be so lucky in other countries ? I do n't think so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling her ' Juliar ' and ' Gilltard ' , what really are they hoping to achieve ? It actually has the opposite effect as intended , I doubt Julia reads the comments and it makes the authors seem petty , juvenile and immature . It 's grade school antics that really should have no place in such an important debate . That also goes both ways , ' mad monk ' is just as bad . When you have to revert to name calling perhaps it 's time to give up the argument or at least re-think your tactics ... <p> When posting online I stick to a rule - If I would n't say it face to face , do n't type it . <h> c.conserv. says : <h> Seano says : <p> Yes , I thought " wow " . I was surprised that Turnbull published the guy 's details . <p> I do n't see what you 're getting at . Following the pollies on is at least educational , they post all sorts of interesting stuff . <h> c.conserv. says : <p> 07:06pm 14/07/11 <p> @Seano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no politician , of whom I am so enamoured , that I would follow same person , leaving their " off to the airport , everyone " ..

Malcolm Turnbull is a " poor little boy " " a poor little pet " I remain unconvinced by this snippet . <p> no reply necessary <h> Seano says : <p> 07:58pm 14/07/11 <p> I really do n't give a shit what you 're convinced by or interested in . I 'm interested and that 's my choice . <p> Most people I follow , particularly the pollies post more interesting stuff than the minutiae of day to day life . If they get boring I stop following them . It 's a way to stay informed . <p> no reply necessary <h> LMAO says : <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <p> 05:09pm 14/07/11 <p> I like Malcom Farr 's articles because they bring out the whining Liberal maggots as opposed to the whining Labor maggots . There 's not much difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through subsidies and privatization , Labor give handouts to the welfare crowd . I can have my choice of Labor 's crap carbon tax or Liberal 's crap Direct Action plan . The joy ..... <h> Holly says : <p> 05:16pm 14/07/11 <p> Well in my opinion Tony Abbott is leading the race to the bottom . He started the big fat lie myth . ( and it is really a semantic issue - Julia Gillard did not rule out a price on carbon nor an ETS before the last election ) He is willing to appear on shock jock shows where they they can only make a point by repeatedly lying and throwing insults . I have never heard Tony ask them to tone it down . These men are plain ignorant in my book and really should not even be on the airwaves without being held to account for their lies and rudeness . <p> Julia is very gracious under criticism - not like the sulky tactics of Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott who walk off if they do n't like the question or feel they can not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sided debate . So come on people I challenge you all to stick to the policy debate . I also think moderators should be doing a better job . <p> I note the so called " community meeting " Tony Abbott addressed was actually no such thing . Good on that young woman who got past the minders and tried to inject some facts into the issue . Good on you too Malcolm Turnbull for speaking up despite the fact that you have been muzzled by Tony Abbott . <p> Why do we comment anonymously anyway . Why do n't you have the same rules as a letter to the editor . I would n't have the slightest problem with that , but I suspect a great number of your commentors are just big fat cowards . <h> No 1 Rosie says : <p> Are you Gillard 's over possessed voodoo doll calling the powerful forces to save her from the wrath of the people . <p> How about applying some of the standards you place on others over to the person you are trying to save . <h> Mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big difference between a carbon price , or ETS , and a carbon tax . Are you saying that gillard does n't know the difference ? julia gracious under criticism ? If you call giggling and patronising gracious , then I suppose she is . <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <p> 08:15pm 14/07/11 <p> Yeah , I heard that the Tony Abbott 's Frankston " community meeting " was a Liberal Party only invite . I wonder how the dissenter managed to gate crash it ? It 's a sad day in Australia when political parties are n't allowed to stage manage rallies of their political faithful . All that effort to feed propagada to the media ruined by a dissenter in a shopping center or community meeting . <p> Julia Gillard 's Carbon Tax is still crap , Both Gillard and Abbott are unfit to be Prime Minister of Australia and I still encourage everyone to vote informal at the next election <h> Christian Real says : <p> 11:14am 15/07/11 <p> No 1 Rosie Calling Holly ' Gillard 's over possessed voodoo doll ' , shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment so you go on the attack instead . As for standards , Tony Abbott , his faithful radio shock jocks and his loyal cheer squad has n't got any themselves . Tony Abbott , the want a be Prime Minister , serial liar , opportunist and has only got the ability to con gullible people like yourself . Mr Tony ( Do n't believe everything I say ) Abbott , the man of many disguises , No policies , No ideas and certainly No real direction <h> jf says : <p> 05:45pm 14/07/11 <p> Summary of this article - a female PM should be given greater courtesy and should not be subject to the same rigour as a male PM. <h> seduxen says : <p> 05:56pm 14/07/11 <p> You chattel slaves just shut up , watch your manner and die quietly ! Very polite , politically correct gangsters in suit and ties trying to kill us , our children and most of mankind with this carbon legislation . Lacks any kind of rational and scientific evidence but the main problem for ? ? ? if we are un-polite and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . Get real ! If you want to take on this crud , go ahead . But leave my valet , my stove and my hot water system alone . I did not give mandate for ANYONE to tax on false pretenses . Humanity continuously reducing carbon in the last 300 years : from hay to coal , to oil , to nuclear ( Michael Crichton ) . We must step up for the next level . Either cold fusion , geothermal energy , hydrogen cells , etc . The new technology must have the appropriate energy flux density . Solar , wind has not ! The technological revolution was able to propel mankind into the 20th century by the extra energy that was provided by oil . If we stepping back from the oil , it would mean stepping right back to the pre-tech revolution of the 19th century ! Who wants to sacrifice their own child ? Do n't look at me , because I am absolutely not ! Step forward and start to jump from the cliff . Do n't push me ! If we not using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back below 15-20% of the current one . No , Australia has no proper soil . It would barely yield on sustainable levels even on the irrigated areas ( Darling Downs , Murray Darling ) . It would mean famine , decimation of our population , returning diseases/pandemics those we have n't seen since the technical revolution - because these inventions made diseases to disappear and not the vaccines ! You want to try it ? Look at Black Africa . All vaccines of our World are n't saving them , because all those troubles are coming from malnutrition , and related diseases and most importantly very very corrupt and stupid politicians ! We do n't have the first two yet ... <h> Christian Real says : <p> 06:11pm 14/07/11 <p> ray hadley , alan jones and the liberal propaganda redneckneck radio should close down instead of the bullshit and diatribe that they are allowed to spin on a daily basis for their loyal one-eyed redneck liberal followers . Hadley , Jones and Tony Abbott and his redneck liberal opposition have brought the office of Prime Minister into disrepute and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australians , because Australians they are not and never will be . <h> Holly says : <h> Brian in Jindalee says : <p> 06:39pm 14/07/11 <p> Good on you for your column Mr Farr . Now would n't it be great if all of us had a column where we could berate people who are simply totally fed up with our Prime Minister , her lie about the carbox tax , her other policy failures , her manipulation of facts , and all of her self-serving mates . So please bugger off and let us vent by the only avenue we have . <h> Fiona says : <p> 07:35pm 15/07/11 <p> Brian , it 's called a blog . Why do n't you start one then ? You can vent all you wish . <h> Sony B Goode says : <p> 07:19pm 14/07/11 <p> Mr Farr will probably take his smashed leftist idealism to the grave , because it takes someone with brains and guts to recognised and then admit their world view is not only plain wrong , but that is evil . <h> Michael at The Entrance says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time . She is our first woman Prime Minister and as a woman it 's easy for the media and the stirrers to give her a bagging.How many would stand face to face withe a male leader and say the things that are being said . Me thinks even Tony Abbott would not be forever calling for a new election if our PM was a male . <h> Wolf Schmidt says : <p> 08:05pm 14/07/11 <p> Julia Gillard has proven herself a complete and utter failure in anything she has touched . In private business she would have been out on her ear quite some time ago . I find it incomprehensible that someone with her education and experience has turned out such a dud . We have no personal animosity , we just do not enjoy being lied to and treated as morons . We will sink the ALP-Australian Liars Party at the election to the bottom of the deepest pit . If Juliar can not stand the heat she should get out of the kitchen . Another thing I have been a lifetime Labor voter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> But seriously , how do you expect the people to feel when their powerfully expressed will is being so arrogantly controverted ? Yes I 'm sure all those elites think they know better than everyone else , but that 's beside the point . The point is this is a democracy , and if they government is n't willing to abide by the will of the people , they must be overthrown , peaceably if possible , by violence if other means prove futile . <p> Malcolm , you have n't seen anything yet . If the socialist alliance continues to govern in the fashion they have been this last year for another 12 months , I can confidently predict there will be blood on the streets . And rightly so ! We have never had a revolution in Australia like they ones that the French and the Americans are so proud of , because we have never really needed one : the government of the day has always striven to unify the country and build a durable consensus . <p> But this government is different . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through inflexible ideology and willful stubbornness , succeeded in turning almost every section of society , every segment of identity in the nation , against each other . <p> Western Australia has a serious succession movement starting to agitate from within it , COAG is fractured and enbattled , the media is at all out war with itself , people are shouting and bickering in the streets and in shopping centres , inner-city hipsters have never sneered at mainstream Australians more condescendingly , our once harmonious society is being rend asunder , because of this government . <p> Malcolm , you yourself said two days ago that the government is trying to " massively reshape the Australian economy " . For such a huge inmeddlement in the economy , the government requires a MANDATE ! <p> Its facetious to say that the government should n't have to consult the people on every single matter to do with running government , because no one is saying the government has to do that . No one said the government needed a mandate to suspend the live cattle trade with Indonesia , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government was within its rights to do that . Yes yes it was a massive blunder , and they should be judged for it , but that was n't the sort of decision that they needed to seek a mandate for , no one ever said they did . <p> Likewise , no one is saying that the government needs to get a mandate for its " malaysian solution " for asylum seekers , even though the government took the " east timor solution " to the election . The government is within its rights to pursue that policy too . <p> But when its a plan to " massively reshape the Australian economy " ( in your words ) , a plan to " fundamentally remake what it is to be Australian " ( in Gillard 's words ) , then for God 's sake ! Give the People a say ! <p> Failure to do so is rank cowardice , and if anyone thinks that such cowardice becomes our National Government , they are mistaken . <h> Shane From Melbourne says : <p> 10:29pm 14/07/11 <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives and the Senate was lawfully and democratically elected . You ca n't squeal like wounded pig when you do n't like the result . The people have had their say . It 's called the 2010 election . Revolution ? Succession ? Go for it , I could use the laughs ...... <h> Barry says : <p> 12:25am 15/07/11 <p> I disagree with Shane . Julia did tell a lie to get into government . Should all politicians make promises they do n't keep ? It it did not suit Shane I am sure he would be first to complain or maybe sqeal like a pig , stupid phrase . If Julia truly believed she is right she would give us a referendum on the question or an election . But she knows she would lose on both counts so it can not be the right thing for the majority . Just a few like Shane . <h> kosmiester says : <p> 08:44pm 14/07/11 <p> People , stop playing the man/woman and start playing the ball . <p> At the moment , you have 1 option if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and that is a Carbon tax followed by an ETS . Tony " Daffy " Duck is just playing lip service at throwing a miserly $3.5B at climate change . He is better off saving the money and funding his middle class welfare and maternity leave program . <p> There was a time not too long ago that everyone and I mean everyone that could vote , voted for an ETS in 2007 . Both major parties supported it . So what changed .... Not one politician of either side mentioned to me that coal industry would disappear or the sky would fall .. <p> So who has changed their mind on climate change action . You have ... that is right you have ... or is it you just hate Julia more than climate change action . So everyone thinks she lied .. wow ! Get over it . She made the no carbon tax statement before the election on the premise that she would win . She did n't in her own right so all bets are off . As if she thought she would be forming govt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for that too . <p> You changed your mind ( or should I say lied to yourself ) and now she has as well . Lets get on with it and get on with life . The cost of living is going to go up whether there is a tax or not just as night follows day . For God 's sake it has n't even been introduced yet . We have been complaining since time began that things are more expensive today then they were yesterday .... <p> I heard it all today , CEO of David Jones complaining about the Carbon tax affecting his sales last month . Who does he think we are idiots ... maybe . If Tony can deflect his lack of climate change action policy on the Carbon tax maybe he can do the same with his poor performance . <h> Darren Parker says : <p> What Changed ? R U Serious ? Did you not hear about Climategate , where it was shown that the scientists lied to us to keep the gravy train rolling . Do the reasearch man - read ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 05:55pm 18/07/11 <p> Darren .. Do n't need to do the research .... man ... History tells me we humans go to war to secure water , food and energy ... Guess what we humans will be doing if we do n't stop relying on fossil fuels . <p> We have 3 Billion people now that aspire to have the standard of living we enjoy .. Prices are going up because of demand not the carbon tax . So the punters out there crying about the cost of living better have a never ending tissue box . <p> I will leave it to you to guess what is going to happen . Climate change wo n't kill us man .. Mother Earth is much less ruthless than us humans .... <h> Holly says : <p> 08:51pm 14/07/11 <p> Oh my goodness . Tony does n't like to be questioned by a female . Lovely moment in Queensland meeting this evening when asked about his lies regarding the demise of the Queenland coal industry . Very uncomfortable being eyeballed by a woman who was not going to let him get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Tony . <h> Christian Real says : <p> 06:42am 15/07/11 <p> Holly Some people can see throughTony Abbott ' s scare campaign , but obvious some are just brain-dead and easily lead by his misleading lies and vilification of the carbon price that Julia Gillard promised to legislate in her next term of goverment on the eve of the 2010 Federal Election . From ' The Australian ' , this story " Julia Gillard 's carbon price promise " , written by Paul Kelly and Dennis Shanahan , on August 20,2010 @ 12.00AM ( the day before the 2010 Federal Election ) " Julia Gillard says she is prepared to legislate a carbon price in her next term " " I do n't rule out the possibility of legislation a Carbon Reduction Scheme , a market-based mechanism , " she said of the next parliament . " I rule out a carbon tax . " " This is the strongest message Ms Gillard has sent about action on carbon pricing . " Holly , from another news story , this one 's About Abbott . " Abbott dogged by old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a climate change " weather vane " has come back to haunt him - again " The Opposition Leader has been shown spruiking a carbon tax in an old interview that was aired on Q &; a on ABC Television yesterday . " " If you want to put a price on carbon , why not just do it with a simple tax ? " Mr Abbott argued <h> Christian Real says : <p> 07:51am 15/07/11 <p> Holly , even Malcolm Turnbull believes that Tony Abbott 's stance on Climate Change is bullshit , this is from a story " Abbott 's climate change policy is bullshit " , written by Malcolm Turnbull , December 7 , 2009 in the Sydney Morning Herald . " While a shadow minister , Tony Abbott was never afraid of speaking bluntly in a manner that was at odds with coalition policy . " So as I am a humble backbencher I am sure he wo n't complain if I tell a few home truths about the farce that the coalition 's policy , or lack of policy , on climate change has descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not cut emmissions without a cost . To replace dirty coal powered power stations with cleaner gas fired ones , or renewables like wind let alone nuclear power or even coal fired power with carbon capture and storage is all going to cost money . " To get farmers to change the ways they manage their land , or plant trees , and vegetation all cost money " Somebody has to pay . " " So suggestions that you can dramatically cut emmissions without any cost is , to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott , " bullshit " Holly , from another newstory in " The Age " : " We will have climate policy Abbott says " , written by Michelle Gratten , December 2 , 2009 " " Tony Abbott believes climate is real , with a human contribution , and has dismissed his recent description of it as " Absolute Crap " , as " A Bit Of Hyperhole " rather than his considered position . " Holly , and yet in another newstory : , from " The Australian " " Malcolm Turnbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year " written by " James Masssola , on May 20 2011 @ 2,43PM " Malcolm Turnbull says Tony Abbott 's direct action plan could cost taxpayers $18 billion a year by 2050 , declaring it 's " only fair dinkum " to admit the scheme will be funded by the budget . " " The whole point of direct action is that abatement is funded out of the budget as opposed to being funded by an impost on emmitting industries , who then pass it on to their customers in higher electricity or fuel prices . " <h> Nick Buick says : <p> 09:00pm 14/07/11 <p> I did n't ask these politicians to rob me of my very hard earned money , use it to buy votes from their mates in the trade unions , public service , and welfare state , then lie to me about their exciting new plans to rob me of yet more of my very hard earned money ...

Mr Farr it is Chair of Defence Force Angus Houston and respect should of been shown to his rank because he deserved it . <p> Malcom Farr im sorry but your continuous defence of labor has made you a laughing stock of all the ppl I know . <p> Also note how Gillard went on about how the media was crap , wondering what she thought of the media when in oppisition specially in 2007 . They must of been good then right . <p> Last note Gllard you have no right to attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your govt rips the heart out of defence <h> Barry says : <p> 11:55pm 14/07/11 <p> So , reading from a prepared script and force a few tears as you read it and get some journalists to feel sorry for you and they start to write nice things about you . Very clever of Julia . Re the story here about bad language etc I do n't see any change in behavior by the public towards politicians even though the journalist who wrote this would have us believe so . Julia lied to get her way into government . She is doing what she is doing because she made a deal with the Greens , she would rather by a lie tell us it is because it is the " right thing " . The deal clearly was that the Greens would make her PM if she agreed to introduce the carbon tax . She cared nothing about the promise " There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead " because who desire for power was greater than her sincerity and honesty to the Australian people . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still do the right thing by giving us ( all Australians a say by a referendum or an election . If the majority say yes , then she can do the right thing otherwise it is the " wrong thing " to do what the majority want . I think that 's what democracy means or have we become governed by a dictartor now ? <h> Sick of the BS says : <p> 12:59am 15/07/11 <p> One has to have a laugh at the amount of people who have posted comments here , who seem to think it is Julia Gillard who has written the article , or has been complaining about comments made against her ! Im pretty sure she is quite capable of handling whats been dished out thus far otherwise she wouldnt have gotten very far in politics ! Would like to know how many of the Liberal supporters here screaming Julia is a liar etc etc had no qualms about voting for John Howard after he lied to us all about introducing a GST ? Oh sorry , my bad , that wasnt a lie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! hahaha As for the claims he had a mandate , it wasnt exactly an overwhelming victory was it ? If i recall correctly he needed Meg Lees from the Democrats to help him get over the line with that one ! <p> P.S. How do you know when a politician is lying ? Their lips are moving ! : -p <h> RyaN says : <p> 11:08am 15/07/11 <p> @Sick of the BS : try to keep up , for the umpteenth time Howard took his GST to an election with everyone full knowing he was going to bring in a GST , Gillard is too communist and terrified to take hers to the electorate , that is the difference . <h> Sick of the BS says : <p> 10:18pm 15/07/11 <p> Ryan , for the upteenth time did Howard have an overwhelming , clear cut concise victory after he took the GST to the polls ? ? No he did not ! Hence forth my comment ! ! ! The only reason he got the GST through was because of Meg Lees ... FACT ! ! ! ! Oh hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same thing you liberals are lambasting Gillard for ? ? ? Maybe you lot should look up " hypocrisy " ? ? Id dearly love for Julia to hold an election right now , because id bet my bottom dollar it wouldnt be the landslide victory the mass media is portraying ! ! You know why ? " Anti carbon tax rally " in Canberra gathered 2000 people ..... PRO carbon tax rally in Melbourne gathered 8000 people ! ! I 'll hedge my bets thank you : -p <h> Christian Real says : <p> 05:12am 16/07/11 <p> Ryan , If you had surfed the internet like I do , then you would have found this statement from John Howard , where he said : " A G.S.T or anything resembling it is no longer policy , nor will it be policy at anytime in the future . It is completely off the political agenda in Australia . " " No , there is no way a G.S.T will ever be part of our policy " " Never Ever , Never Ever , It 's dead , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter says : <p> 05:25am 15/07/11 <p> Very interesting article Malcolm , but incredibly biased and leaves no doubt as to where your allegiance lies . The fact that Tony Abbott is subjected to the same , or worse , vilification seems to have escaped a mention in your article . And then the total omission of any reference to the hate campaign waged against John Howard or Pauline Hanson rounded off the bias . Malcolm , respect has to be earned . It does not automatically come with high public office . The Prime Minister , as head of the government , is the employee of the Australian people and as such the general public have every right to question , criticise or abuse when they feel that the employee is not performing in their best interests . <h> Lance says : <p> 06:50am 15/07/11 <p> Julia Gillards martyrdom performance yesterday at the press club in front of her warm and fuzzy adoring press gallery friends all clapping and applauding shows just how out of touch with Australia Gillard and the press gallery journo 's really are . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> PolyWatcher says : <p> 08:11am 15/07/11 <p> Did I not hear JuLiar using the word CRAP twice at the Press Club yesterday . Most unbecoming I would have thought from a person in such high office in setting such a standard . Maybe she does nt know that CRAP means SHIT . Well kids ( usual Juliar term ) , I would say children - if it 's alright for the Prime Minsiter to use the word CRAP at a news conference , by all means you go ahead and add it to your vocabulary , you may even prefer the word shit - means the same thing . Whats the bet this is n't published ? <h> Rick says : <p> 09:17am 15/07/11 <p> Crap or shit it all smells the same and I can smell it coming from your diretion. <h> stockinbingal roo says : <p> 10:48am 15/07/11 <p> Shit happens . <h> casba says : <p> 10:57am 15/07/11 <p> Wel ldone PolyWatcher . I was equally ashamed and disgusted when I saw that replay last night of her big-noting herself at the Press Clus yesterday , throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playground lout . I was reduced to the same sense of national shame and embarrassment when she threw the football around in the Oval Office with Obama . And people like partisan Malcolm Farr wonder why people are being so unkind and disrespectful to the office of PM . It is not the office they are insulting but rather the usurper who resides in that office . Her misuse of so many words , her ignorance over the way words should be pronounced and her repeated use of the phrases , " I am Prime Minister " or " as Prime Minister of this nation " display for all to see , her unsuitability for this prestigious and honoured position that she seized by stealth . She is no different from Richard III who is one of the most despised characters in English history/literature who also had a political assassination on his hands and lived to pay the price . We should all hang our heads in shame as she struts the world stage on our behalf- and at our expense . <h> Christian Real says : <p> 05:25am 16/07/11 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister was wearing " A shit eating grin " ?

The anonymity the Internet provides seems to bring out the worst in people.disagree with people all you want , but there 's no need for the vitriol that you most likely would n't say to someone 's face . You do n't have to agree with a politician , but surely you can make your point better if you 're at least civil about it . Most people tend to turn off when you 're rude to them .

No anonymity when the aborigines turned their backs on Howard ? No anonymity when the rent-crowd bashed a pensioner with a baseball bat for listening to Pauline Hanson ?

Our political discourse has descenced into vitriol , invective and downright hatefulness . I 've never known this country to be so beseiged by bile . So much for a cool-headed assessment of the underlying public policy questions . Somehow , our ability to participate , to discuss , to argue and to resolve has been utterly corrupted .

It also seems to me that if she listened to voter opinion then she wouldnt have the backlash that is currently underway . The same thing happened to Howard after so many years in office , he did nt listen and come election he was royally turfed out . <p> As they say the proof is in the pudding and JG 's reign as PM has been found utterly wanting . <p> However , what smells of utter garbage is this punch article .

" <p> Mr Howard warned Ms Gillard she would have to bear responsibility for her part in the policies of the Rudd government . <p> " She ca n't escape responsibility for all of the policies of the Rudd government because the concentration of power , even more so than in my government , was in a cabal of four people of which she was the number two , " he said . <p> " Julia Gillard has to bear her full share of responsibility for the policies that brought Kevin Rudd undone .

One caller seemed to be outraged that the taxpayers were paying for Ms Gillard and wanted to know if her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to her as a ' menopausal monster ' <p> Imagine the outrage if Mr Abbott was accused of making taxpayers pay for his viagra - not that I 'm accusing him of using it- 
##210652 <p> Pat Cummins has revealed he was booked into the Australian Institute of Sport to have his bowling action examined for signs that it had contributed to his injury-ridden year before the back stress fracture that has blocked him out of a second home summer in a row . <p> Cummins , 19 , is expected to miss nearly all of the 2012-13 season due to a stress fracture in his lower back . The diagnosis means Cummins will not be part of the Test series against South Africa or Sri Lanka , and almost certainly will not be considered for the Test tour of India in February , while his possible involvement in the Ashes tour of England might depend on whether he is able to play any first-class cricket before then . <p> On his return to Sydney from Melbourne where examinations confirmed the fracture , Cummins said there had been plans afoot for some time to have his action assessed scientifically . He also admitted that the surfeit of Twenty20 cricket he had played in the UAE , Sri Lanka and South Africa in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The back stress fracture means the aforementioned AIS appointment will not be taken up while Cummins rests , but it is understood that analysis is likely to begin with pre-existing video footage . <p> " We were talking about going down to the AIS , we were already booked in to have a look at my action while we had time . We 'd been planning to do it for a while , just to see what it came up with , " Cummins said . " One thing I noticed was I might 've been falling away a bit more than say a year ago . When I 'm bowling with a red ball I try to swing it and when I 'm swinging the ball everything 's going well . <p> " But when you 're bowling cross seamers with a white ball you kind of fall into bad habits maybe . " <p> The most recent first-class match Cummins played was his Test debut last November in Johannesburg , where he collected seven wickets and was Man of the Match . Australia 's selectors had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa at the WACA , but scans in Melbourne this week confirmed that he would be out of the equation for an extended period . <p> Cummins had back soreness during the Champions League Twenty20 but kept playing , including in the Sydney Sixers ' victory in the final . That might have seemed a risky course of action given his injury history , but Australia 's team physio Alex Kountouris said the niggle at the Champions League did not appear a major issue . <p> " He had a little bit of back pain towards the back end of the Champions League , which was n't a big concern , " Kountouris said . " He played all the games and was training and was functioning okay . But because of his age and his history we decided to investigate it and unfortunately he 's got an early stage stress fracture of his spine , which is disappointing . <p> " The good news is we 've got it nice and early , because we have had a high index of suspicion with him . Now we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . He 's now going to start his rehab . We do expect him to miss most of the season , if not all of it . But he will come back and he 'll be fine once he gets back in to playing cricket again . <p> " Pat had a spine bone stress injury a few years ago but the current injury is new and in an entirely different part of the spine . We expect he will recover fully from this injury and will be closely monitored to determine his return to the playing field , but expect that he will miss most of the 2012-13 domestic cricket season . " <p> As far as his management is concerned , Cummins said there was nothing he would have changed about the past few months , as he recovered from a side strain he picked up in England to play a series of T20 matches . However the latest setback is sure to cause another round of thinking about how Cummins should be handled . <p> " I 've got to sit down with the people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cummins said . " It 's a group effort . I probably would n't have changed anything from the last few months . I thought I was bowling enough and not bowling too much . I got through 20 games in the last few months so it was playing every two or three days . <p> " The one thing with all young people is they 're more susceptible with injuries , you ca n't really be too wrapped up in trying to pick and choose . If you 're ready to go you 've got to go out there and play , and if you get injured that 's just what happens . It 's what 's on the schedule , so looking forward if it 's not the end of this summer hopefully the Champions Trophy in England and obviously the Ashes is a major goal . Certainly not ruled that out yet , hopefully I 'll be right for them . " <p> Cummins missed most of last summer due to a foot injury and has managed only four first-class matches - including his Test debut - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain during the one-day tour of England this year and was sent home mid-series . <p> His latest injury means Australia will have one less bowler to rotate through the Test attack this summer , which could mean a heavier workload for James Pattinson and Mitchell Starc . Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus are the mature-bodied fast bowlers in the group , while there remains a chance of Ryan Harris recovering from injury in time for the series against Sri Lanka . <p> Brydon Coverdale and Daniel Brettig are assistant editors at ESPNcricinfo . He tweets here <p> @Neil Robinson - great comment . In particular , I think one over spells are not a good thing for a big pace bowler . The constant limited over tournaments are meaning the bowlers are n't getting the loading into the legs . <p> Posted by &nbsp; on ( November 03 2012 , 21:42 PM GMT ) <p> &gt;&gt;PACERONE Yes , you 're correct in part about the bowlers of old . But a couple of things - they had a good long rest between seasons - not jumping into planes and zooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . They built up stamina etc . Plus - let 's not forget they had very different body shapes . Trueman was only 5 foot 10 inches I think with a definite bowlers 's backside . Not over 6 ft 3 inches with a glass back . It 's difficult . But this thing about T20 / one day cricket is the problem . They ca n't warm up etc properly to bowl 1 or 2 overs . Plus the strain of changing an action to hold back for a slower ball all the time creates even more of an issue . As said - a season off - then grade / state cricket for another full year - he 'll only be 21 then , with hopefully a body capable of managing . All true cricket lovers wish him well <p> Posted by Meety on ( November 03 2012 , 21:41 PM GMT ) <p> @VillageBlacksmith on ( November 03 2012 , 01:13 AM GMT ) - what did Smith just get against the Saffas ? <p> Posted by MattyP1979 on ( November 03 2012 , 19:26 PM GMT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promise .

Out and out pace bowlers put massive strain on their bodies but can go some way to alleviating it by having an action which minimises that and is repeatable . This is something which is learnt as a youngster and honed through the teenage years . It is probably not until the age of 23-25 that it is completely repeatable every ball ( and the body is fully developed ) . One and two over spells playing T20 probably do n't help but bowling overs in the nets will get you there if you 're not playing . The trend for picking quick bowlers whilst still teenagers , like Cummins and Finn , is bound to put strain on their still developing bodies .

##216050 <h> Caltex top-up may not be enough <p> PORTFOLIO POINT : The subordinated notes issue by oil refiner Caltex may not prevent a ratings downgrade . <p> Caltex launched a $300 million subordinated note issue yesterday , after flagging the issue last week when it announced its supply chain restructuring and the closure of its Kurnell refinery . <p> The proceeds raised from the issue will be used to cover at least some of the costs associated with the restructuring . However , the " equity credit " that Standard &; Poor 's is expected to give these notes may not be enough for Caltex to avoid a rating downgrade to BBB , from BBB+ . <p> S &P; placed the BBB+ rating assigned to Caltex on credit watch , with negative implications , when the restructure was announced . S &P; also provided a possible escape clause for Caltex when it said the restructuring would likely be positive for Caltex 's business profile . So , Caltex may avoid a rating downgrade . In any event , apart from needing to raise cash , the equity credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motivation for the structuring of the issue and the means of analysing its merits . <p> It is also useful to consider structural features of other subordinated and hybrid issues that have been undertaken this year by companies other than financial institutions . <p> Tabcorp was the first to come to market this year , with a deeply subordinated hybrid issue . Tabcorp was followed by AGL Energy and then came Seek , with the most aggressively structured issue of all . <p> Seek was unable to convince investors that a perpetual note , with deferrable , non-cumulative coupons was a good investment . This was despite the fact that the coupon would have a credit margin of 500 to 550 basis points over the 90-day bank bill rate , and if the notes were not called after five years the spread on the coupon would increase by a further 200 bps . <p> Leaving aside a whole range of other problems with the structure of the Seek notes , the biggest problem was that the coupon may never be paid at all . This must be the best possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors would n't take it up . <p> Investors did not really rush to Tabcorp or AGL to buy their hybrid notes either . Neither company upsized their issues and they sold only $200 million of notes , in the case of Tabcorp , and $650 million for AGL . Both issues have firm maturity dates , of 25 years and 27 years , respectively , and the notes are callable after five years and seven years , respectively . <p> In both cases , there is a 25 basis point coupon step-up if the notes are not called , but the coupons can only be paid if mandatory coupon deferral triggers have not been activated . Deferred coupons are non-cumulative . <p> Both issues received 100% " equity credit " , which means the notes are treated as equity and not debt for the purpose of assessing the credit-worthiness of the issuer , and , thus , determining the long-term credit rating assigned . <p> Finally , both issuers can buy the notes on-market after the call date has passed . This is very nice for the issuers because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do the Caltex subordinated notes compare ? The Caltex notes have a 25-year term to maturity , are callable after five years and have a coupon step-up of 25 basis points if the notes are not called . Sound familiar , so far ? <p> There are some differences though . While the coupons are deferrable at the sole discretion of Caltex , there are no mandatory coupon suspension triggers and the coupons are cumulative and compounding . <p> That said , the coupons can be deferred for up to five years . Dividend payments and equity buybacks must also be suspended while coupons are not being paid , but employee-shareholders can still receive dividends -- presumably , this includes management too . <h> Table 1 : Caltex Notes Issue Details <p> The differences in the terms and conditions applying to the coupons are sufficient to ensure that the notes will receive an " intermediate equity credit " , which means only half the value of the debt will be treated as equity by the rating agency . <p> Caltex will also have the ability to buy the notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite explicit in its information memorandum , stating that it regards the notes as being a key part of its capital structure and therefore is not committed to redeeming the notes on the call date . <p> Moreover , while Caltex will not receive intermediate equity credit from the rating agency after the call date , it will receive " minimal equity credit " . <p> This means the rating agency will treat the full face value of the notes as debt , but , because there will still be 20 years to run before maturity and coupons are deferrable , these features will be considered when determining the long-term credit rating that should be applied . <p> The question for investors is whether a coupon based on a 450 to 470 basis point margin over the 90-day bank bill rate is sufficient to compensate for the credit risk of Caltex itself , a 25-year term to maturity and the risk of coupon deferral for up to five years <p> The bookbuild for the issue will take place this time next week and the coupon margin will be announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue will close to shareholders and the public on August 28 , and deferred settlement trading will begin on the Australian Securities Exchange on 6 September . <p> The Caltex issue brings the total senior , subordinated and hybrid notes issues offered to retail investors this year to a record $8 billion . <p> Philip Bayley writes for Banking Day newsletter , in which this article first appeared . <h> Weekend Briefing with Alan Kohler <h> Alan Kohler <p> Keep up to speed with the key news and events shaping world business and economic affairs today by reading Alan 's weekly in-depth report , including

##224051 <h> Greece : How 's it going to end ? <p> PORTFOLIO POINT : Greece may well end up defaulting , but it is unlikely there will be a breakup of the eurozone . <p> It would be nice to have a year without Europe 's debt woes constantly in the news . Sadly that 's still not the case , with Greece back in the headlines again lately as it seeks yet another bailout package . With its economy in tatters and social unrest on the rise , it 's natural to wonder whether at some point Greece and maybe Portugal and Ireland will opt to default and leave the euro . Or alternatively , given it 's impossible to expel countries from the euro , a group of strong countries might decide to leave . <p> What 's the current situation with Greece ? <p> The Greek ( and hence European ) debt crisis has been raging since late 2009 . Greece first received a bailout in May 2010 . Last year it was recognised that Greece 's public debt , at 165% of GDP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a writedown . Over the past month or so , Greece has been negotiating with private investors on the size of the writedown , and more recently with the so called troika ( the EU , IMF and ECB ) on additional austerity measures and reforms to boost its competitiveness in order to receive a second bailout package . This is necessary to make a 14.5 billion bond payment due March 20 . <p> Greece has since agreed to troika demands and its parliament has approved an austerity package . The key elements of the deal are a 1.5% cut in public spending , the loss of 150,000 public sector jobs over four years , a 22% reduction in the minimum wage , pension cuts and a debt swap that would cut 100 billion off more than 200 billion of privately held Greek public debt . <p> However , the end to this Greek tragedy is a long way off . Although Greece appears to have met all of the conditions set by the troika , eurozone finance ministers are yet to approve the deal amid talk it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some European parliaments are to vote on the package including the German Bundestag , and it 's unclear whether private bond investors will be forced to participate in the 70% debt writedown . <p> Finally , to meet the objective that Greece 's debt falls to 120% of GDP by 2020 , it 's likely the ECB will need to forgo profits on Greek bonds it bought at a discount . More fundamentally though , even if Greece gets its second bailout it will likely still struggle to meet its deficit reduction targets as austerity continues to bear down on its economy . <p> The Greek economy has fallen about 20% since 2008 and is likely to shrink 5% more this year . Unemployment is 21% and is set to rise to 25% over the year ahead . With depression setting in and unrest escalating , an obvious issue is at what point the Greek people say enough is enough and decide to default and leave the euro . Or alternatively , the rest of the EU decides it wo n't provide further assistance given Greece 's constant failure to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the euro ? <p> If Greece ( and other peripheral countries ) were not part of the euro , the way to work through current problems would have been to allow monetary easing via an exchange rate collapse in order to offset fiscal austerity . This would allow it to trade out of its problems , much as the Asian crisis countries did in the late 1990s or Iceland is doing now . However , as tempting as such an approach is , getting to it is problematic once a country is already in a currency union as Greece is with the euro . <p> If Greece or any other troubled country opted to formerly default and leave the eurozone , the following would likely occur : The country 's new exchange rate would plunge , possibly by 50 -- 70% ; austerity would become more severe as no one would be prepared to fund the existing budget deficit ; there would be a risk of a collapse in the banking system as local citizens sought to withdraw their euro denominated deposits ahead of the switch to the new currency ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation initially ; and remaining eurozone countries might seek to impose trade barriers on exports from countries that left on perceptions they have an unfair currency advantage . In short , the pain for Greece and other leavers could actually get a lot worse initially outside the euro than within . <p> For the countries that remain in the euro , it would n't be smooth sailing either . Banks would have to completely write off their sovereign debt investments in the departing countries . Bond yields in remaining troubled countries , such as Portugal ( if it does n't leave with Greece ) , Spain and Italy might come under renewed pressure as they might be assumed to be next . The euro would probably fall initially but maybe not by much as it might be seen as stronger once Greece and one or two others exit . The loss of export markets and ultimately a stronger euro could make life tougher for the remaining euro countries . <p> What if strong countries left the euro ? <p> An alternative scenario would be where strong countries such as Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the euro . The outcome for such countries would be similar to that described in the previous paragraph . The stronger countries ' new currency ( or currencies ) would likely surge in value . Interest rates would likely move higher . Lenders in such countries would face losses on their loans to euro countries given currency appreciation . Exports would suffer thanks to exchange rate appreciation and if departure from the euro also means a departure from the EU trade bloc . <p> Finally it should be noted that the process of any country leaving the eurozone is likely to be protracted -- up to a year or so , and involve referendums and treaty changes . <p> What 's the risk of this occurring ? <p> Both of these scenarios would be very disruptive with a eurozone breakup potentially weighing heavily on risk markets globally . But what is the chance of it occurring ? Our assessment is that the risk of a eurozone break up is low . <p> First , as is apparent above , the transition out of the euro for both strong and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Greece , as such it is in neither side 's interest . Greece ( and any other weak euro leavers ) would face an incredible disruption as the lengthy adjustment occurred ; its banks would potentially collapse and it would have to undergo even more austerity to bring its budget straight to balance as there would be no one to fund its budget deficit . <p> On the other hand , stronger northern European countries would be reluctant to go down that path as it is still not known whether the firewall to protect other larger countries such as Spain and Italy , and banks , from renewed contagion is strong enough yet , and more fundamentally because they would suffer from lost export markets and a stronger currency . <p> Second , polls indicate 75% or so of the Greek population want to stay in the eurozone . A majority of the population in eurozone countries , including those in Portugal , Ireland , Spain and Italy also want to stay in the eurozone . And in Germany , the main opposition is more pro-euro and Europe than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally , European countries have immense political capital invested in the 60-year project of which the euro is a key part and their actions to date ( eg , setting up a permanent bailout facility and the fiscal compact ) are all about strengthening it . So it 's hard to see an about-face . <p> Of course none of this is of any relevance if Greece descends into some sort of political chaos and effectively stumbles into a disorderly default or euro exit . <p> How strong is the European firewall ? <p> Much of what has gone on in Europe over the past two years has been about kicking the can down the road until the rest of Europe is stronger and a firewall can be built to withstand a Greek default . While it 's doubtful we are at that point yet , there are some positive signs . <p> First , the move by the ECB to provide banks with dirt cheap three-year funding under its Long Term Refinancing Operations program has removed concerns about the ability of European banks to finance themselves . As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bank funding problems were at the core , has been greatly reduced . While banks may not be using cheap LTRO funds to buy bonds in troubled countries at least they are less likely to be selling them . <p> Second , the firepower of bailout funds that may be used in Europe is growing . By mid-year the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) will be running with at least 500 billion of its own funding and China and other key emerging countries seem to be moving closer to adding to rescue funds . <p> Third , while many fret about Portugal going the same way as Greece and requiring its own debt writedown , there are signs Europe is feeling more comfortable with Portugal and is unlikely to let it go the same way as Greece . EU policy makers have backed away from forcing private sector investors to take writedowns ( as it only adds to the panic ) . Portugal is seen as delivering on its agreed reforms ( unlike Greece ) , Germany has signalled a willingness to provide extra assistance and the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years is low . <p> Fourth , bond yields in Italy , Spain and France have stayed calm through the latest bout of worries , suggesting greater investor confidence that Greek worries will be contained . <p> Finally , Europe as a whole does not seem to be plunging into the deep recession feared several months ago . Sure , growth went negative in the December quarter , but by less than feared and business conditions indicators have since stabilised and hooked up . <p> Ideally , if Greece is going to have a disorderly default the EU would probably prefer it occur after the ESM is set up mid-year . This is another reason why a deal on a second bailout or at least bridging finance is more likely than not by the March 20 bond payment . But the key point is there are several reasons to be confident over time the impact of a disorderly Greek default on the rest of Europe and hence globally will be more in line with its modest size ; that is , just 2% of eurozone GDP and less than 0.5% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis is still alive and well . Logic argues against a eurozone break up , but a disorderly Greek default is a high risk . However , at least Europe is showing signs of being better able to deal with it were it to occur , particularly if it is after new bailout funds are in place from mid-year . So although European debt issues are likely to remain a source of volatility 
##226450 <p> This is Part 2 of " The Dragon 's in the Detail with ' Chinese Kina ' " -- a two part series looking into China EXIM Bank 's K6 billion loan to PNG . Part 1 can be found here and should be read prior to Part 2 . <p> The revelation that the China EXIM Bank loan to PNG is actually a comprehensive credit package in the vicinity of K10 billion ( US$5 billion ) falls in line with EXIM 's strategic model of finance associated with developing countries and best demonstrated by the bank 's foraging into a number of African states . <p> It is debateable whether this model of developmental finance is indeed a genuine model of capital development for developing countries , or simply a credit-package which undermines the ability of these states to cope with debt -- a fear some Papua New Guineans hold . <p> But what is agreed though is that this model is conducive to long-term objectives of developing countries , largely because Chinese policy banks like EXIM , are state owned and offer concessional loans which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions which are globally competitive enough to trump that of both commerical and concessional loans offered by other partners . <p> Based on EXIM 's experience in Africa , the OECD Development Centre reported that the bank 's concessional loan structure is guided -- in general terms -- by the following basic conditions : <p> " Chinese contractors must be awarded the infrastructure contract financed by the loan . <p> This is similar to concessionary finance of traditional donors and provides these companies with an entry point to set up a presence in host markets where they can bid for commercial contracts , independent of projects under the concessional loan agreements . <p> In principle , concessional loans are used for procuring equipment , materials , technology and services , with no less than 50 per cent of the contract 's procurement coming from China . The loan is denominated in Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ) and has a maximum maturity of 20 years . <p> A grace period of 3-7 years may be granted to the borrower , during which the borrower will only repay interest payments and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidised and underwritten by Chinese Government finances . " <p> It is likely that these terms and conditions will also apply to EXIM 's credit package to PNG too . <p> And to support the above , a precedent already exists between China EXIM Bank and PNG via the US$300 million Pacific Marine Industrial Zone ( PMIZ ) where the bank provided a US$71 million concessional loan for its construction in 2010 . <p> Under this agreement , a relatively unknown Chinese contractor called China Shenyang International was awarded the contract as per the conditions of the loan . <p> These included the requirement that 70 per cent of the project was to go exclusively to a Chinese developer using Chinese technology , labour and equipment -- while restricting PNG firms to bid for the remaining 30 per cent . <p> In addition , China Shenyang International 's profit margin was dictated to be 20 per cent of the total contract value , while the loan structure included a grace period of 5 years and a loan repayment time of 15 years . <p> As an indication of how sketchy details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce and Industry Gabriel Kapris -- when naming the the developer to construct PMIZ , could not provide any further detail to the history , expertise or corporate profile of China Shenyang International -- apart from the company 's name . <p> Although the questions of ' what on ' and ' how ' EXIM 's K6 billion loan will be expended are important to PNG - and must be answered and made public by Peter O'Neill - it really is secondary to the the issue of what exactly are the terms of repayment . <p> One of the key issues of the K6 billion loan which has captivated PNG 's domestic discourse is the issue of affordability . <p> The Opposition in particular has repeatedly highlighted this as a point of concern and have contended that the government has pre-committed the gas revenue from the PNG LNG Project , due to be banked into the State 's coffers in 2022 , to pay back the loan . <p> But this does n't quite make sense under China EXIM Bank 's strategy . <p> What The Opposition and it seems everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , is that EXIM 's K6 billion loan will not be paid back via the regular financial installments dictated in the standard terms and conditions of a loan and disbursed through the budget process under the Department of Treasury 's watch , but instead , it will be accommodated for through a concessional commodity-for-finance agreement where the State will provide China with a minumum daily supply of oil and/or LNG in exchange for the financing of its expenditure objectives . <p> It 's an explosive conclusion - but one that I 've drawn logically given the rather bullish nature of the government 's promotion of the loan in light of unanswered questions and a reluctance to reveal key details . <p> ( It 's either a commodity off-take agreement or the commitment to provide stakes in a number of permits containing undeveloped gas fields and in exploration permits as happened in Nigeria -- I suspect the former ) . <p> Furthermore , it fits well with EXIM 's strategy . <p> One of the biggest hints to this possibility is Minister for Works Francis Awesa 's strong indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- China 's largest integrated energy company -- in the EXIM Bank loan deal . <p> CNPC and Sinopec , China 's national oil corporation , are both state-owned enterprises that have signed comprehensive supply contracts with ExxonMobil as part of the PNG LNG Project ; and both are beneficiaries of project assistance from EXIM too . <p> There would also be scope for this arrangement to continue and intensify when InterOil 's US$7 billion LNG project begins production in 2015 as another Chinese state-owned enterprise , China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) , has signed a Heads of Agreement with InterOil and PNG 's Petromin regarding the possibility of underwriting the project -- or at the minimum , helping to finance the State 's equity in the project . <p> Any such commodity off-take agreement would be actioned through a joint venture arrangement with Petromin -- PNG 's natinal oil , gas and minerals company , and be cushioned by the initial grace period provided by EXIM . <p> China EXIM Bank 's financing strategy that couples a commodity off-take agreement with the financing of infrastructure is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with Angola paying its debt to China back with oil exports , Gabon with iron ore , Demoractic Republic of Congo with copper and cobalt , and Guinea with Bauxite . Several of these arrangements are current . <p> But there are some serious concerns with China EXIM Bank and its ' Angola Model ' . <p> Perhaps the best example is that of Nigeria which was to draw down US$2.5 billion from EXIM in 2009 . <p> After the country transisitioned through elections , it was revealed by the incoming government that what was initially thought to be a US$2.5 billion concessionary loan credit package turned out to be US$500 million at a concessionary rate , and the remaining US$2 billion at EXIM 's commercial rate . <p> Furthermore , it has been recently revealed that PNG 's loan structure with EXIM regarding Madang 's PMIZ consists of highly controversial detail . <p> Perhaps most shocking is the revelation that the entire agreement entered into between the two parties , although signed and actioned in PNG , is to be " governed by and construed in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for Peter O'Neill and the EXIM 's K6 billion loan . <p> As more details of the concessional loan emerge ( Works Minister Francis Awesa is due in China later this month to finalize the deal ) , we may be looking at another of " the well-priced ' long term trade agreements ' or deferred payment , resource-backed commercial export credits , where the interest rate will be based on LIBOR plus a margin " . <p> Peter O'Neill must make public the terms and conditions surrounding the China EXIM Bank loan , and the fiscal strategies his government will use to manage and mitigate the risks associated with the loan . <p> These basic details and conditions of the loan structure need to be made transparent -- its importance to PNG requires that this be the case . <p> At the end of the day , the buck stops with Peter O'Neill and Co to refuse loans that are not concessionary by nature , as the Dragon is indeed in the detail with ' Chinese Kina ' . <p> There has been a lot of talk recently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan which Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has headhunted to address what he repeatedly highlights as being the country 's failing infrastructure needs . <p> The manner in which these infrastructure needs should be addressed -- via a complete yet flexible approach over the current parliamentary term , with the objective of rehabilitating or building from scratch a comprehensive number of infrastructure projects prioritized as being of national significance -- has been O'Neill 's catch-phrase to justify the drawing down of such a loan with the underlying goal of boosting the economy . <p> There is no shirking away from the obvious that PNG 's national infrastructure is indeed in dire straights , and it is imperative that something must be done to address what has been an eternal migraine for consecutive governments -- particularly at this juncture of PNG 's economic growth . <p> Peter O'Neill has opted to strike early , citing the country 's best ever economical , financial and political position in our history to undertake the burden of such a loan and its ramifications . <p> It must be pointed out that Minister for Works Francis Awesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXIM loan prior to Election 2012 -- so the planning for securing the finance has been in the pipeline for some time . <p> It 's a very bold decision -- and it has drawn its fair share of critics . <p> The Opposition in particular has jumped on the naysayer 's bandwagon and created considerable noise regarding the K6 billion EXIM loan . Its first press release on the issue was titled " K6 billion loan sinister " , and then the alternative government followed this up with two more which were far more focused on relevant details than scaremongering . <p> The Opposition 's key point of leverage -- and one which I agree with wholeheartedly -- is that Peter O'Neill must make public the terms and conditions surrounding the EXIM loan , and the fiscal strategies it will use to manage the loan over the coming parliamentary term -- and beyond . <p> These basic details and conditions of the loan structure need to be made transparent . The size of the drawn loan , and its importance to PNG -- the same argument the O'Dion Government uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree . What 's concerning though are the details of the concessional loan + fiscal strategy . These need to be made public #PNG <p> But as the rhetoric from both sides has settled down , some interesting bits of information have emerged -- and observations made which have gone unnoticed and unquestioned . <p> Firstly , Peter O'Neill has made it abundantly clear that the K6 billion has primarily been earmarked to fix the country 's economic life line -- the deteriorating Highlands Highway . <p> Treasurer Don Polye has hinted that the total reconstruction of the Highway from Lae to Mt Hagen , and then Mt Hagen to Kopiago , and Mt Hagen to Porgera , will cost somewhere between K2-3 billion . <p> Polye has also stated that another K2 billion will go toward Phase 2 and 3 of the Yonki Hydro Project to address the country 's energy needs . In addition , Works Minister Francis Awesa has also highlighted that portions of the K6 billion have been marked for the total rehabilitation of Lae City 's roads , including a four-lane highway from Lae to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that although Peter O'Neill is looking at borrowing up to K6 billion from EXIM , it appears that in fact the total credit package which China is considering making available to PNG is somewhere in the vicinity of $US5 billion ( K10 billion ) . <p> Thirdly , Minister for Public Enterprises and State Investments Ben Micah , while being questioned on the future of SOE 's Telekom and IPBC yesterday , let slip that a portion of the K6 billion would be assigned to upgrade the condition of SOEs in PNG . <p> With reports suggesting that the infrastructure needs of NCD have also been factored into the EXIM bank loan -- a bill Governor Powes Parkop optimistically estimates to be around K900 million and to be used to solve the capital 's traffic congestion woes ; and Peter O'Neill adamant that a financing facility be made available which will not run out of money when contractors are engaged , it seems that the initially quoted K6 billion will be surpassed , and quite easily too . <p> It is clear from the above that the K6 billion EXIM loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive credit package which will address infrastructure , energy , and capacity-building and investment needs for the O'Dion Government . <p> Collectively , it will be the single biggest individual loan the country has ever draw down . <p> It is likely that we will see the figure K6 billion increase over the course of O'Dion 's parliamentary term -- hinged heavily on the immediate to medium-term success of the PNG LNG Project , the long-term success of the establishment of the $US7 billion second LNG project ( InterOil ) due in 2015 and Harmony Gold 's $US9.8 billion Wafi-Golpu Gold and Copper mine in Morobe Province due in 2019 . <p> Part 2 of ' The Dragon 's in the Detail with ' Chinese Kina ' " can be read here . <p> The Tumbi Landslide is one of PNG 's worst ever landslide disasters and is believed to have claimed up to 60 lives . <p> The short but succinct report highlights disturbing concerns ISCI considers to be important enough to warrant a Commission of Inquiry into the landslide . <p> And I agree . <p> ISCI identifies four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the landslide ; <p> Government oversight of safety at the LNG project ; <p> The response of the National Disaster Centre to the landslide ; and , <p> Allegations of impropriety and collusion on the part of ExxonMobil via their subsidiary Esso Highlands Limited . <p> Commission of Inquiries vary in terms of objectives , but generally speaking , their roles are to collect information -- coupled with expert opinion -- and resolve conflict with the underlying theme of restoring public confidence . <p> When an inquiry is launched to determine facts in retrospect -- most often used for accidents or tragedies -- it is widely viewed that the purpose or focus of a Commission should not be the determination of individual blame , but rather , the purpose or focus should be on what information is needed to educate the public and provide context to justify the impending recommendations . <p> And it is precisely this key issue -- the wholesome collection and dissemination of information by an independent inquiry -- which has clearly not occurred , and it is obvious that this has caused considerable hurt and resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt in my mind that the Tumbi Landslide is a tragedy . The loss of up to 60 lives quantifies that . <p> However , it is important to make the point that this is not just a tragedy in the middle of New Guinea 's forests devoid of any human interaction . <p> No -- this was a tragedy which happened within the vicinity of ExxonMobil 's operations ; and within a stone 's throw from a quarry utilized for a period of two years by the PNG LNG project developer . <p> If there is a cause-effect relationship here , it has to be proven -- but the association between ExxonMobil and the Tumbi Landslide is clear . <p> The possibility of human influence in causing the Tumbi Landslide and claiming up to 60 lives is the reason why this is a national tragedy warranting a Commission of Inquiry . <p> Detractors of ISCI 's report may point out that the National Disaster Centre ( NDC ) did investigate and release a report into the cause of the landslide which concluded that it was initiated by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total absence of evidence provided in NDC 's report to substantiate that hypothesis . <p> The COI into MV Rabaul Queen was equally as scathing on Peter Sharp , the owner and operator of the ship , as it was on the National Maritime Safety Authority . Similar opinions formed by an inquiry into the NDC 's oversight of the Tumbi Landslide are probable . <p> ExxonMobil 's PNG LNG Project is a venture of national importance and its success will help provide the foundation of the future economic progress of our country . <p> The fear of possibly disrupting this Goliath , and consequently endangering the State 's own benefits , should not be a reason for Peter O'Neill and his government to shy away from investigating the Tumbi Landslide . <p> Instead , the importance of ExxonMobil 's project should indeed be the catalyst as to why an independent inquiry is necessary . <p> ExxonMobil and the PNG Government have entered into a long-term partnership . That partnership is based on trust and respect , and an understanding representing the views of ExxonMobil 's shareholders and strategic direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in what it believes to be in the best interest of our people . <p> Government oversight of safety at the LNG Project , as identified by ISCI , is part and parcel of this partnership -- and its effectiveness or lack of , needs to be revisited and reviewed . This is a point which has been emphasized by the Tumbi Landslide -- despite who or what caused the landslide to happen . <p> An independent inquiry will help alleviate these concerns by defining matters that need to be addressed in detail to help mitigate any future events such as the landslide . <p> Additionally , the PNG LNG Project is not limited to the Tumbi area . It 's operational scope is extensive covering several PNG provinces and the communities it affects and interacts with are substantial . <p> ExxonMobil must appreciate that the influence of the state on landowner concerns is reactive by nature ; and vice versa , the demands and expectations of landowners are manifested proactively . <p> It is because of these dynamics that I think ExxonMobil , through its subsidiary Esso Highlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent inquiry into the Tumbi Landslide . <p> In any investment the size of ExxonMobil 's , the stakes are high , but the response pursued by the developer in this instance is reflective of the short-term thinking which plagues many of PNG 's foreign direct investment firms . <p> It goes to show that foreign firms still have a long way to go in understanding the Papua New Guinean psych ; and it also demonstrates that the PNG Government still has a long way to go in developing the fortitude required of truly representing the interests of its citizens . <p> If Peter O'Neill is serious about having PNG 's interest at heart , then he understands that economic prosperity is important , but at no stage does it trump the lives of our people -- no matter how large the stakes . <p> Tragedies like the Tumbi Landslide will happen again , and with the long-term commitment of ExxonMobil in PNG , it is possible that this developer will be associated with another future tragedy . If that occurs , then ExxonMobil and Peter O'Neill will have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this risk , although self-serving , has not even been identified and exploited to mitigate future damage . <p> The big losers out of all of this are the people of Tumbi in the Southern Highlands . It will not be lost on them that one of their own is Prime Minister , and that he has done very little to alleviate their pain and address their concerns . <p> As Peter O'Neill 's new coalition government begins the arduous task of establishing itself in the post-election environment of Papua New Guinea , the sorting through of Election Petitions -- the concluding phase of the election process -- has begun . <p> At last count , 136 Election Petitions had been lodged with the first being filed on 14 May regarding the Southern Highlands Regional seat , and the last filed on 17 September concentrating on the NCD Regional seat -- a reflection of the drawn out process PNG Election 2012 demanded . <p> The 136 Election Petitions represent 79 electorates ( out of a total of 111 ) -- a contesting rate of 71% . Enga registered the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , Eastern Highlands with 10 and NCD with 11 . <p> Bougainville was the only province where no Election Petitions were filed . <p> In terms of electorates , Enga 's Kompiam-Ambum registered the most Election Petitions with 8 , followed by SHP 's Kagua-Erave with 4 , then eight others on 3 apiece . <p> A closer look at who exactly is lodging the petitions , and whom the petitions are being lodged against , provides some interesting analysis : <p> Of the 136 Election Petitions , 18 of them were filed by sitting MPs who lost their seats . <p> Most notably among these is former PANGU Pati Leader and Nuku MP Andrew Kumbakor ; former People 's First Party Leader and Governor of Morobe , Luther Wenge ; former PNG Labour Party Leader and Governor of Western , Dr Bob Danaya ; former Deputy Prime Minister and Wabag MP Sam Abal ; and former PNG Party Deputy Leader and South Waghi-Angalimp MP Jamie Maxtone-Graham . <p> There are also some notable non-MP losers who have lodged petitions . <p> Sir John Kaputin has lodged one against Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holloway has filed another against EHP Governor Julie Soso ( the only petition against any of PNG 's 3 woman MPs ) ; while former Police Commissioner Gari Baki and Commander of the Defense Force Jerry Singirok have filed petitions against Talasea MP Francis Marus and Sumkar MP Ken Fairweather respectively . <p> Furthermore , 20 of Peter O'Neill 's 33-member Cabinet will face an Election Petition -- and the Prime Minister himself would have faced one too had it not been for the last minute decision of his losing adversaries to withdraw their petitions at the eleventh hour , with the pride of having a Southern Highlander as Prime Minister proving the mitigating factor . <p> Mt Hagen MP and Minister for Petroleum &; Energy William Duma ; Kandep MP and Minister for Treasury Don Polye ; Alotau MP and Minister for National Planning Charles Abel ; and Kompiam-Ambum MP and Minister for Environment &; Conversation John Pundari , are all facing 2 Election Petitions each . <p> Based on the sheer number of Election Petitions filed , and the people who these petitions relate to and may affect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill 's Coalition . <p> Election Petitions have have four possible outcomes : <p> The election is declared void : the result is quashed and a writ is issued for a new election <p> The election is held to have been undue : the original return is quashed , and another candidate is declared to have been elected . <p> The election is upheld , and the member returned is found to have been duly elected . <p> The petition is withdrawn . this may occur when the petitioner fails to attend a hearing , or when Parliament is dissolved before the petition process is complete <p> It is quite likely that over the next months we will see a number of casualties from the Election Petition process -- and I think up to three Ministers will most certainly lose their jobs temporarily while writs are issued for new elections in their respective electorates to take place . <p> This is a tentative period for both the Government and Opposition -- but the stakes are much higher for Peter O'Neill than Belden Namah , particularly as there is surfacing evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to electoral fraud destabilizing the democratic process in their election to parlaiment . <p> I extend to you all my sincere greetings and best wishes on this historically special day in our nation 's annual calendar . <p> It is our National Day today and , as Head of Our Government , I am proud to celebrate our 37th Independence Anniversary with you . <p> Today , 37 years on , we proudly observe and celebrate the achievement of our nation 's political Independence on 16th September 1975 . <p> In doing so today , I pay the highest tributes to our nation 's Founding Fathers and Mothers who made this dream of building a nation for all of us becoming a reality . <p> Today I also pay my special tribute and gratitude to our nation 's founding leaders for the gaining of Independence . <p> I say thank you on your behalf of all citizens young and old -- to our nation 's founding Prime Minister Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare for his lengthy active and loyal political leadership service to our country . <p> I pay tribute also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Sir Julius Chan of New Ireland , President Chief John Momis of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville , pioneer woman parliamentarian Dame Josephine Abaijah and Statesman Sir John Kaputin who were among the leading lights of their time . <p> I pay tribute also to all our former Prime Ministers , Governors-General and Opposition Leaders and many other Leaders for their respective contributions in the evolution of our nation . <p> These great early leaders of modern Papua New Guinea all did well for our nation , to unite our people and to lay the foundations of a vibrant democracy . <p> Thank you all . <p> On this occasion , as Papua New Guineans , we must reflect on where we came from 37 years ago to where we are today and where we are heading as a nation in the years ahead . <p> We have a growing and evolving nation that is fast asserting itself as an leading developing economy in the Asia Pacific region . <p> While the industrialized nations face serious economic and financial crises , our nation is respected by many as a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent over the past 10 years , and recorded 11 per cent growth in 2011 , with forecast for 10 per cent growth this year . <p> As a nation we have done well but not enough to underpin a sustained quality education , good health and a marked reduction in our key social and poverty indicators . <p> Everywhere throughout our country we see overwhelming evidence of decline of basic services infrastructures like roads , airports , seaports , hospitals , schools and provincial and district administrative centres . <p> Law and order management and enforcement has also become ineffective and inefficient in the face of population growth and fast paced development and economic growth . <p> We have a great deal to do , especially in working together to delivering expected goods and services for our people and for our nation . <p> I am confident and I believe we can achieve these , if we all work together . <p> The economic , political and social building blocks , our government has begun putting in place will form the foundations upon which our nation will prosper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's future happiness , health and wealth will be achieved through an educated and healthy population , improved modern infrastructures and strengthening the law and order environment . <p> We can repair , renovate and maintain our existing service infrastructures hand-in-hand with construction of new roads , bridges , hospitals and schools by better prudent management and planning of our resources . <p> Yes , we can do better and our government is already starting . <p> We will move swiftly to lifting agriculture development for food security , increase investment and trade opportunities and improve delivery of social services to our people . <p> Our nation 's success and failures can be measured by many different yardsticks . <p> I prefer our nation 's success and our government 's leadership performance to be measured and calculated on the basis of our overall failures and our achievements . <p> We have a good government now in office and we can do better than ever before . <p> But our critics continue to look at us negatively . They insist on writing our nation off as one without hope and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own citizens , they continue to look for excuses to talk us down for their own political and selfish gain . <p> They talk negatively without giving any solutions . This is the kind of politics and leadership that continues let our people and our country down . <p> Our government does not and will not subscribe to such negative and meaningless views from these doomsayers . <p> Only leaders without ability , vision and experience will yell and scream . Those who know the job will shut up and get the job done . <p> As the government , we know our job . We have the most experienced Cabinet since 1975 . That is why our government will talk less and deliver more . <p> There is an old saying in my village which nicely describes loud mouths and non-achievers : " The person who beats his chest and yells the loudest never kills a pig " . <p> That is what a lot of the critics of our government and our nation are good for . <p> I see us as a nation of people that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes not so smoothly , but slowly moving in the right direction towards prosperity . <p> We have advanced as a nation with some successes , many failures and some missed opportunities in all aspects of our nation 's development . <p> I see us as a nation of people that can do better for ourselves in terms of lifting our own and our nation 's economic , political and social development . <p> Our government is government of inclusiveness , reconciliation and strong leadership that is capable of producing productively for our people and our nation . <p> We are a government that is committed to making positive changes that will improve the lives of all our people . <p> We can only look at our nation 's past failures as painful lessons that must not be repeated . <p> We must pick up the broken pieces left along the way in the last 37 years and reconstruct them . <p> We must do better by building a brighter future . <p> We must also embrace the missed opportunities of the past and use that experience to making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An important aspect of our nation 's progress , that we all must accept and celebrate in the 37th year of our National Independence , is the celebration and recognition of our women 's rightful place as equal partners in nation building . <p> The election of three women leaders to Parliament is an extremely welcome development and a step forward for all our female population . <p> My own election as Prime Minister further sees the change of leadership guard from our founding fathers to the next generation of leaders . <p> Yes , our people have a new sense of hope for our country and their family under the new leadership . <p> Our government also has high hopes for the delivery of best possible results for our national development and for our people 's wellbeing . <p> Our people and the international community all say we have one of the naturally wealthiest nations on earth . <p> We have a population that is ethnically and culturally diverse , yet we have remained tolerant and resilient in the face of economic and social adversity over the last 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact still remains that our people remain largely poor in a wealthy nation . <p> Under the watch of our government , we are starting to make positive changes to bring about outcomes that transform our people 's lives to one that will make them economically and socially better off . <p> As I have stated many times money , is not our nation 's problem , rather money has always been wasted on the wrong priorities . <p> We can not go wrong unless leadership at the political and public service levels is totally incompetent . <p> As government we have laid out a simple and achievable plan as building blocks for our nation 's development now and in the years ahead . These building blocks are : <p> Our government will not tolerate slackness , corruption and excuses for not delivering on the commitments our people expect us to deliver . <p> Within the first three months of this government , any person -- both in politics and public service -- that is not willing to live up to these commitments will have no place in our people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we commit ourselves to providing inclusive , transformational and participatory leadership that is zero-tolerant against corruption at all levels in our country . <p> We have activated the National Task Force Against Corruption to begin the process of amalgamation of all state agencies involved in anti-corruption operations . <p> Task Force Sweep will continue playing its role as our government moves forward to also establish the Independence Commission against Corruption . <p> Also more importantly , our government is serious about growing our nation 's future through prudent and stable economic and political management . <p> That has begun with the delivery of free education for all our children , free basic healthcare to all people , improved infrastructure which include roads , highways , seaports and airports and better telecommunication and energy supply systems to be delivered efficiently under our Public Private Partnership arrangements . <p> Our government has no time to waste . We are now working on financial options to deliver our programs within the legal and financial framework of our country . <p> All the transactions that commit our nation 's future will be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate and committed to involving all capable citizens in the development of our nation . <p> Together in unity , together in ownership and together in participation , we can transform our nation into one whose population is educated , living improved and happy lives and participating in personal and national wealth creation . <p> As head of your government , I am confident that we can achieve greater prosperity for our country and for our people . <p> And all our dream is for every man , woman and child to become educated , to become free from the chains of poverty , to becoming happier and healthier with better opportunities for better life . <p> I had that dream when I was growing up in my village many years ago . Many had that dream when they were growing up in the villages across the Nation . <p> We all had that dream 37 years ago . <p> Let us make the dream a reality together . <p> I wish all our people and all our friends , a very Happy and Memorable 37th Independence Anniversary . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of " reconciliation , unity and trust " , Governor General Sir Michael Ogio yesterday signaled a comprehensive legislative agenda which the O'Dion Government has set its sight on to tackle . <p> On top of the list is the repealing of the Judicial Conduct Act 2012 , which caused massive protests in Port Moresby in April this year , as well as the Supreme Court Amendment Act , the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act , and the amendments made to the Prime Minister and NEC Act -- which placed a restriction on the legal age of the occupant of the Office of the Prime Minister and was aimed at legitimizing the removal of Sir Michael Somare . <p> This domino collection of rushed pieces of legislation were all reactionary in nature , while most were retro-active , and were initiated with the intent of legitimizing an illegitimate government as judged by the Supreme Court . <p> As I wrote at the time , they were drafted , introduced and passed by the Parliament for all the wrong reasons -- and quite frankly , were not only immature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicted the spirit of the Constitution and the mandate given to our leaders by our people . <p> In acknowledging this difficult period of political stagnation , Governor General Sir Michael Ogio paid tribute to the people of PNG : <p> " We must now resolve to never repeat those difficult and challenging experiences . We must not put our people through that pain , fear and uncertainty ever again . Instead we must take action to instil confidence in our people . <p> They could have taken to the streets to express their anger as we so often see in many countries and egg on each other . But they did not , instead they displayed patience and understanding and they left the political events to take their own course . For this we need to thank our people because the outcome could have been very different . " <p> Although Peter O'Neill has kicked off the 9th Parliament with a bang -- the reality always remained that if he wanted to be taken seriously as a leader of merit for PNG , he needed to repeal these pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salamo -- on behalf of the judiciary . <p> Peter O'Neill has done that , and to his credit , has also rectified the hurt he caused Sir Michael Somare in terms of the Chief 's removal from the post of prime minister and then as a Member of the Parliament . <p> But questions still need to be answered before O'Dion can be accepted as being authentic . <p> Although the suggestion by the Governor General that parliament will also consider an Act of Indemnity to protect Peter O'Neill and current and former members of parliament as well external actors , regarding their actions pre-election -- is somewhat acceptable -- there are some issues which are clearly not . <p> Most notably , the recent calls by the Member for Henganofi , Hon Robert Atiyafa , to do away with all current leadership tribunals and commissions of inquiry has yet to be dealt with by the O'Dion Government . <p> In addition , the silent passing of the Maladina Amendments into law , which diminishes the independence , powers and effectiveness of the Ombudsman Commission and which has been vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal in 2008 , has covertly been slipped through the back door supported by Peter O'Neill prior to Election 2012 . <p> These are key issues relevant to the accountability of our elected representatives which are integral to the principles of good governance and a parliament which acts in the national interest . <p> Although O'Neill 's push to establish an Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) must be applauded , for the O'Dion Government to indeed be seen as being authentic , the same

In these early years Keith Richards and Pete Townshend , along with Ron Asheton , were cited as his most important influences . <p> After the demise of Radio Birdman in the late 70 's , Deniz persevered with music , playing in a succession of Sydney based bands . New Race ( with MC5 's Dennis Thompson , The Stooges ' Ron Asheton and Radio Birdman members Rob Younger and Warwick Gilbert ) , The Visitors , and the Angie Pepper Band all quickly acquired strong and lasting reputations . <p> In the early 80 's he returned to the US to pursue other career goals and fulfill family obligations . While continuing to write songs and play guitar in relative isolation , he explored roots and continued to soak up influences , especially focusing on the older blues players such as Hubert Sumlin , Muddy Waters , Jimmy Reed , Son House and Robert Johnson . Attention was also paid to the newer experimentalists such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar work of Fred Smith . In reality , although a productive period , it ended up being a decade long hiatus from the spotlight . <p> From this solid , yet intricate foundation Deniz re-entered the public arena with a new batch of songs and a desire to pursue a solo path . <p> DENIZ TEK SOLO Deniz began his solo career in 1992 with the recording of Take It To The Vertical . The assembled studio band included fellow Birdman Chris Masuak , Scott Asheton ( The Stooges ) and Dust Peterson ( Syndicate of Soul ) . Released by Red Eye Records / Polydor , the album was critically acclaimed but never achieved airplay . An extensive Australian tour , with Bob Brown replacing Dust Peterson on bass , witnessed wildly enthusiastic crowds but was a disaster on a business level . Album sales were disappointing . <p> With the encouragement of Red Eye 's John Foy , Deniz regrouped and redesigned a new band of all Australian players . This lineup , to become known as The Deniz Tek Group , featured Celibate Rifles Kent Steedman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickson ( ex Survivors , Passengers , Barracudas , New Christs ) on bass . They rehearsed , recorded and immediately began playing shows around Australia in mid 1993 . Finding a solid hard rock groove , as well as a mutual love of travel and playing to new people , they toured successfully in Australia , America , and Europe over the next 2 to 3 years . <p> Red Eye went on to release the album Outside ( 1994 ) and the EP 444 The Number of the Beat ( 1995 ) . Much to Deniz ' and the band 's chagrin , the EP 's mislabeling as 4-4 was a bellwether for trouble to come . <p> CITADEL YEARS The next album , Le Bonne Route ( 1996 ) , was a complete departure from its predecessors . Recorded in Billings , Montana , it was eclectic and experimental . The band lived at Deniz ' house , wrote together , rehearsed , and recorded demos . They took time off to travel across the West , playing shows from San Francisco to Bozeman , sharing many adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' adopted Native American tribe . <p> The remote Montana location and entirely different environment led to new and unusual creative directions that were reflected in the recordings . The finished album was too much for Red Eye , who , under pressure from their parent company , declined to release it . A two minute walk away from Red Eye , a new home was quickly found with Citadel Records . <p> Before the release of the album , the group flew to Italy for what was a chaotic and highly unpredictable tour . A limited edition CD ( Italian Tour EP ' 96 ) highlighting various Le Bonne Route tracks was released to coincide with these dates . <p> After returning to Australia and at the end of a national tour promoting the now released Le Bonne Route , Kent Steedman departed with minimal notice , forcing the decision to either cancel the remaining shows or carry on as a three-piece . Believing in the latter option , the group played on . With only three days to prepare , these last two Sydney shows at Caringbah and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would continue on as a power trio for several more years , intermittently playing concerts around Australia , frequently with Birdman 's Pip Hoyle as guest keyboardist . <p> Escalating costs of international travel now unfortunately prevented Deniz from touring overseas with them . From this point onwards he would rely on local musicians in the USA and Europe to form his backup bands . In 1997 Le Bonne Route had been released in America through Minneapolis based Prospective / TwinTone Records . It was received positively and Deniz did selective shows in the US with a new band featuring local Montana musicians , bassist Todd Eagle and drummer Tony Horton . This North American lineup also promoted the album with an extensive tour of Europe . <p> Citadel 's final Deniz Tek Group release was the EP Bad Road ( 1997 ) . It featured an acoustic version of the Le Bonne Route track Bad Road . Other rarities included a sonically pure live performance of Steel Beach , several songs that were recorded during the 444 sessions at Electric Avenue and a ripping demo version of 1968 from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Equinox ( 1998 ) followed . This album entailed a complete band change and reversal of Deniz ' usually minimalist production philosophies . Adding drummer and percussionist Clay Green , Deniz would now record with engineer , co-producer , sonic explorer and electronic guru Dave Weyer . Once again Deniz had a release signifying a radical transition to a new phase which employed diverse instrumentation , multiple vocalists , the techniques of musik conkret and sampled sounds . The experimental side of Equinox would later be taken to its full blown conclusion and driven past the edge of sane sonic abstraction with Dave Weyer in the Glass Insects project , resulting in the exceedingly hard to find CD self-release , Cool and Unusual Punishment . <p> In Australia the greatest moments of the Equinox June/July ' 98 tour were captured on the limited edition , mailorder only CD release , Got Live ( 1999 ) . Deniz Tek Group members Nik Rieth and Jim Dickson returned to play the dates . The sound quality of the original minidisc desk recordings were clarified and beefed up in Montana at Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band at its peak . During the tour Rob Younger made a spontaneous one off guest appearance . His lead vocals can be heard on two tracks . <p> DEEP REDUCTION In 1996 Deniz had agreed to produce Pennsylvania based The Stump Wizards ' album Contains Lead . While they were in the studio they cut a single ( Black Tulip ) using the moniker Deep Reduction , a reference to heavy truck gearbox terminology suggested by drummer Clyde McGeary , a trucker known for his exploits driving large rigs loaded with toxic waste across America . The single was successful enough that they decided that this blend of garage punk/pop , electric blues and psychedelia could be pursued as there was no conflict with their parent band 's styles . The self titled Deep Reduction ( 2000 ) was thus recorded , mostly live , in 5 days using vintage Fender , Marshall and Ampeg amplifiers . Vocal duties were shared . Released by GetHip in the US , it was promoted with both US and European tours . <p> With ultra 60's-cool bassist Jonathan Sipes joining the lineup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more culturally and sonically consistent rhythm section , the group still had difficulty finding the right vocal approach . Multiple singers seemed to diffuse the focus of the music and the excellent backing tracks languished until a better idea came along . Rob Younger was asked to step in and take over the vocals . He agreed , and after being given the green light to rewrite lyrics and melodies as needed , traveled from Australia to Al Cox 's Studio 213 in Mechanicsburg PA . The vocals were redone and several extra tracks added . <p> Rob 's unique and strong vocal approach seemed to be exactly what was needed to unify the album . Simply titled 2 ( 2002 ) , it was released by GetHip in the US and Citadel in Australia , where Rob and Deniz later toured with the band 's final lineup which included Jim Dickson ( bass ) , Clyde McGeary ( drums ) , and Jonathan Sipes ( now on guitar ) . <p> GOLDEN BREED In the late 90 's Deniz combined forces with the legendary twins , Art and Steve Godoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now turned their limitless energies toward recreating late 70 's punk mayhem as well as becoming world renowned tattoo artists . <p> Forming the rhythmic heart of Deniz ' US touring band of the time , the Godoys had played dozens of concerts on several tours across America . Their intense energy and positive spirit proved to be a perfect match for Deniz , who then developed the idea of a new hard rocking band which would give the twins a more prominent role and wider creative scope . Deniz Tek And The Golden Breed , a power trio playing basic no frills rock with a brutal rhythm section and penetrating single electric guitar , played deceptively simple songs which often layered melody and unusual harmonic lines on top of the heavy undercurrent . The debut album , Glass Eye World ( 2003 ) , was released in the US by Career Records . <p> Deniz and the Godoys ' partnership continues to this day , in the form of West Coast based renegade punk group The Last Of The Bad Men , with singer Danny Creadon and bassist Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safe and Ride , on the Godoy 's DHD label . <p> DODGE MAIN In the early ' 90s Alive Records ' Patrick Boissel began a crusade to resurrect the Detroit Sound . When Deniz and Wayne Kramer were asked to lead the effort , both agreed . Dodge Main , named after the now defunct automobile assembly plant in central Detroit , was born . <p> Less than a week after returning from touring Italy with The Deniz Tek Group , Deniz flew to LA to record . Scott Morgan ( The Rationals , Sonics Rendezvous Band ) had been recruited to sing , with Paul Ill on bass and Brock Avery on drums and percussion . Recording was done at the Music Box , a small studio in West Hollywood . Some songs were written on the spot , others in Deniz ' motel room . MC5 , Radio Birdman and Sonics Rendezvous standards also made the cut . The entire album was ultimately tracked in less than 5 days . Released by Alive in 1996 , it received rave reviews and a 4 star treatment in Rolling Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows . Currently there is an unreleased live concert tape waiting in the wings featuring the band at peak power in Cleveland with bassist Gary Rasmussen and drummer Scott Asheton .

##241551 <h> Tips , techniques and templates <p> Computers are wonderful . They have changed our world in so many different ways , and almost always for the better -- although there are some who would dispute that ! <p> Computers are now ubiquitous and a part of everyday life . Most of the University 's students ( apart from some mature-age students ) have grown up with computers and take them for granted when it comes to writing assignments . They open up their copy of Word , start by jotting down notes and build up into a polished essay , adding in references and footnotes that renumber automatically as they move paragraphs around . In the olden days , I used to write assignments by hand and type them up on a typewriter , so for me Word is nothing short of a miracle . It 's not only a great time saver but also a quality enhancer . Once I 'd typed up my assignment there was no more reworking -- it took too long to tweak a word here , reorder paragraphs there and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Word -- insert pictures and graphs , set up the page in columns , even create HTML for websites . There are many templates available for download from the internet that can help you to create a letterhead , a memo , a form or even a newsletter . <p> It 's therefore tempting to believe that anyone can be a graphic designer and that they can create beautiful publications using Word . <p> This is a mistake . <p> Good graphic design is a subtle art that takes into account many arcane skills like typography , white space use , image selection , alignment and the creation of tone and texture . Graphic designers spend many years learning these arts and skills . <p> One of the skills that graphic designers learn is how to use the applications required for computer generated graphic design . These applications include InDesign and/or Quark Xpress for desktop publishing . There are other applications out there but none that professional designers use ( unless you want to publish technical documents and then you might use FrameMaker ) . Photoshop is the industry standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drawing images . <p> You can not easily control a font 's kerning ( space between letters ) in Word and can not tailor kerning for individual sets of letters . Also , if a Word document is opened on a computer without the fonts installed then Word changes the font to one that the computer does have installed . <p> It is difficult to lock an image in place on a page and control the way that text flows round it . <p> Word can not handle EPS graphic files well . <p> Word can not specify PMS colours . <p> Commercial printers will generally not accept Word files because they can not control the output . <p> The same comments hold true for PowerPoint . Therefore , please do n't use Word or PowerPoint to design publications or promotional materials for the University . The University provides InDesign templates to help graphic designers comply with brand requirements . These templates should only be used by graphic designers however -- doing a course to learn how to use InDesign will not make you a graphic designer 
##259750 <h> 2012 <p> Interview with Marissa Soroudi <p> By Daniel Rothbart <p> Marissa Soroudi is an artist who immerses herself in foreign environments and , much like an anthropologist , studies them . Artworks have taken her from the canopies of tropical trees in Vanuatu to life among cannibal Pacific islanders and recently to performing with burlesque showgirls . Through a personal methodology of contemporary art , Soroudi turns male projections and fantasies on their ear . <p> Daniel Rothbart : How did your idea for the Showgirls series first come about ? <p> Marissa Soroudi : My life was divided between a Persian culture 's societal beliefs and the fables of New York City 's modern pop culture . In both societies I see the domineering role of male opinion over women , where admiration of the female essence is overshadowed by appreciation of the female form . A strip club is the extreme manifestation of these things . There , women are viewed only for their physical beauty and as objects of desire , while the female individual is abandoned . The complexities I struggled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip club . I needed to understand more about this association between men and woman and why this was the case , and a strip club/brothel seemed like a good place to start . I did n't go in knowing I was going to do the Showgirls project . I did n't know before I started that I would be photographing men . I really just went in asking a lot of questions . <p> DR : Were the men reluctant to pose for you ? What kind of reactions did you encounter when you approached them ? <p> MS : There were two steps to my method . The first was how I gathered the information and the second how I physically got them into my studio . Step one comes down to three factors : <p> 1 ) They 're in a dark room <p> 2 ) They 've been drinking all night <p> 3 ) Its very late at night . <p> As a result , men were much more candid and revealed a lot more to me than they would have done in any normal environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who visited the club frequently . " <p> Vivian , 2008 , Duratrans print in lightbox , 30 x 20 x 6 inches <p> It was these intimate conversations that had me thinking about male projections and the male anima -- the Jungian term for the female counterpart in men . It has to do with how men relate to women , how they idealize women and all of their relationships with women . In a strip club , the anima is embodied and male projections are overtly exercised . The women act like whatever the men project they want us to act like . The way we look is dictated by what the men want us to look like . We are their fantasy . Showgirls is a series of photographs I took of my customers . They did n't realize when talking to me that they were being observed and studied , they thought they were speaking intimately with a stripper . <p> Claudia , 2008 , Duratrans print in lightbox , 30 x 20 x 6 inches <p> How did I physically get them there ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this -- people being at the mercy of their desire and how much they 're were willing to suffer for it and what they 're were willing to do for it . For the same reason they were spending money in the club , they were looking for some sort of connection . They were willing to come to a stranger 's home studio , take off all their clothes and wear the sequined and feathered lingerie of a woman they had been obsessed with . They became a parody of their obsession and I think it had to do with being at the mercy of desire . <p> DR : How did you instruct the men as they posed ? <p> MS : I tried to make them comfortable because the position of power changed really quickly . When they 're in a strip club they have the money and the power , but then all of a sudden when they 're in the studio , they 've forgotten about that situation and are standing in front of a lighting assistant and a makeup artist . Suddenly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into women 's lingerie . It 's an awkward situation , so the first thing was to make them comfortable in order to get a more natural shot . I would put on some music and give them another drink . I found that talking about the club or one of the girls there helped ease tension . <p> Dallas , 2008 , Duratrans print in lightbox , 30 x 20 x 6 inches , <p> DR : What kinds of questions did your models ask you ? <p> MS : They asked very personal questions . I think a lot of men in clubs like this really want a connection and not just a sexual connection -- they really want a connection with a woman . I 'd tailor my answers in order to get them to speak more and feel more open with me . It was less about me talking about myself but rather them telling me about themselves . They asked me questions about what I desire , what I look for in men and other predictable erotic questions . <p> DR : How did it feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected femininity ? <p> Jules , 2008 , Duratrans print in lightbox , 30 x 20 x 6 inches <p> MS : I hate to say that I might have enjoyed it too much ! I was holding up a mirror to this female fantasy that they carried inside . It was a picture that they painted for me , most elaborately and in great detail . I did n't know what would happen when I dressed them up in female clothing or why they would find it so disturbing to be dressed as a girl they were in love with . It 's weird that a sixty-five-year-old sex tourist gets angry when he sees himself dressed as a young Asian girl . There was another guy that I found crying in the bathroom of my studio looking in the mirror when he saw himself dressed up . Realistically all I was doing was holding up a mirror to their erotic psyche . I do n't generally photograph men -- I focus my work on women , but what I quickly understood in the club is that women really shut themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plastic clothing and alcohol to shut down the female soul so they can be sort of like dollies answering to male desire . As I said , men in that club dictated the way we looked and to some extent I think that carries on outside of a strip club . It was a very male environment so I became more interested in photographing these men . I used to record them as well . That 's how it began . I had a little microphone in my bra and in private shows I would secretly record them talking to me . I never revealed what they told me during these shows . I kept the dialogues from my recordings to myself . The only thing I 've ever shown to the public are the photographs that they dressed up and posed for . Somehow putting men in the shoes of the women they were in love with -- just putting them in their clothes and having people look at them- was extremely disturbing and unsettling for them . For someone like me who has always struggled with inequalities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series . It was interesting to see them stripped of their machismo attitude ... and a bit humiliated . <p> New York City , February 16 , 2012 <p> Photo Credits : Marissa Soroudi Writing Credits : Daniel Rothbart is an artist and writer .

##261250 <h> Site Sections : <h> Section Pages : <h> The Importance of a Successful New Employee Orientation Program <h> The Purpose of New Employee Orientation Programs <p> A good new employee orientation program delivers multiple benefits to your company , some of which are often overlooked . Here are but a few of the many benefits that both the new employees and the employer will receive . <p> Helps your employees get up to speed quickly and learn the " ground rules " of the company . This often reduces start-up , training , and other indirect costs associated with having new employees who are unfamiliar with the company . <p> Conserves manager , supervisor , and peer time . Answering the most common questions posed by new employees saves everyone else the time in answering , explaining , and clarifying issues . <p> Reduces the " new employee stress " factor . Everyone , even new CEOs , experiences some level of anxiety and stress when starting a new job at a new workplace . Efficient new employee orientation programs have been proven to significantly reduce this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Helps establish a positive , can-do attitude at the beginning of a new employment situation . Learning job responsibilities , expectations , and the corporate " attitude " of their new employer helps employees feel both comfortable with and knowledgeable about their new job and the level of performance that the company wants . This typically establishes a positive employee attitude toward the new situation and future possibilities of success . <p> Usually , there are two distinct components to a successful new employee orientation program . One part is typically devoted to a general orientation , which discusses the overall policies and procedures that apply to all areas of the company . These often include matters of personnel , compensation , benefits , employee rights , unions ( if applicable ) , and the employees ' general responsibilities . The second component addresses job-specific issues that relate directly to new employee responsibilities , company expectations , and policies and procedures . This component serves to help employees perform , work through issues , and understand how their new team operates . <p> To reduce employee turnover and help your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips to implement a successful new employee orientation program . <h> Tips to Have a Successful New Employee Orientation Program <p> Regardless of their experience level and placement in the organisation chart , new employees need information , a sincere welcome , an understanding of expectations , and a useful introduction to the policies and procedures that involve their tenure . Consider some of these specific action plans to help ensure a successful orientation program . <p> Emphasise the " people " factor as well as the job duties and procedures . Give equal time to the new employee 's peers and supervisors . Regardless of the talent level and experience the new employee brings , he/she is required to interface successfully with co-workers and management . Beyond simple introductions , allow the new employee to spend some quality time with staff , particularly with those members who will work closely with your new person . <p> Start the program with the most important issues . Everyone is more alert at the beginning of the day or program . This gives you time -- even extra time if you need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This also allows new employees to spend " getting to know you " time after the important job and company specifics have been covered in detail . <p> Do n't overwhelm new employees with too many details or introductions at once . Even the brightest new employee can be overwhelmed with data , information , and new people if they 're presented in " machine gun " fashion . Space out your program to keep it interesting and digestible . Covering policies and procedures , then interjecting an introduction or two , and finally moving to some duties and responsibilities should keep the new employee 's interest and allow him/her to better absorb the information . <p> Use a buddy/mentor system . Having an experienced employee serve as an orientation mentor for the new staff member accomplishes a number of positive goals . This action can relieve new employee anxiety , provide a primary source of information after orientation , and offer a " buddy " to help the new employee start his/her company tenure in the right direction . A word of caution : Do n't simply pick someone without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the risk of the " buddy " feeling challenged by the new employee and possibly having the wrong outlook on the temporary mentor duties . <p> Emphasise the general as well as the specific . While it may be difficult to fully explain your corporate culture , you can emphasise the company 's mission , brand , function , goals , and objectives . This is important for providing a " global " picture of the new employer and helps new employees understand how they " fit " in with their team and their company . <p> Using these tips helps create a successful new employee orientation program by infusing a sense of belonging as well 
##280852 <p> November 6 : US Presidential election .... and voting for many other offices .... and issues . e.g. In Minnesota , a marriage amendment will be on the statewide Nov. 6 ballot . If approved by a majority of those voting , it would amend the state Constitution to say that marriage can only be a union of one man and one woman . State law already forbids gay marriage . <p> Basic to the same-sex marriage issue , but rarely discussed , is the topic of anal sex . Reports below , by doctors , are essential reading for an honest understanding of this issue <p> John , about your question that " no one wants to talk about , " I 've been hesitant to comment because I do n't think that explicit sexual mechanical discussion is something I want to be involved in on the net . But , I will say this : if you google various medical websites in the states , you will find out what needs to be done to make a variety of different types of sexual expression safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many kinds of sexual expression and that folks who are gay or straight often use many different kinds . <p> Secondly , a comment you made previously is that Frances ( MacNutt ) thinks that the psychiatric and psychological associations " folded " on considering gay relationships a disorder and instead just one of God 's many variations due to an activist lobby . John , one person 's activist lobby is another person 's " let 's raise our voices together about this thing that is important to us . " I would say that making the assumption that an activist lobby bowled over the psychiatric and psychological professions in terms of both their standards and their common practice assumes that 1 ) the professionals can not think for themselves , or 2 ) they have no character 3 ) or they have no backbone . <p> As a straight person , I understand that the area of gay relationships can take a lot of getting used to . Many , many , many of us have been socialized against it , especially , if I can say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the states ) . Rather than focusing on the mechanics of sexual expression ( which I must say , and I do n't mean to be offensive ) the Catholic hierarchy tends to do , I say , again , get to know gay people . As you get to know them , ask them how safe and meaningful sexual expression works for them and how it fits into their relationships . I do n't mean to preach , but Jesus got to know people , and not getting to deeply know people when we have a question about a group , is not , in my opinion loving . Getting to know them is the FIRST thing we owe them . -------- Response from John W : <p> Dear Anon , yes , you are absolutely right ... we should get to know people first , like Jesus .

She is very bright ( " A " average in bio chemistry ) , thoughtful , and balanced . <p> She said that she has felt ashamed of being Catholic for a long time , that when she tells people she 's Catholic , there 's a stigma attached . And that she feels the need to defend the 1,000,000 's of Catholics who are doing good . She said , " They just do n't know the Jesuits , or the work you do for good , mom .

Mass every Sunday . An active Catholic family . But the tradition just does not speak to them . I had been willing to compromise on women not being ordained , but my two daughters will likely not do that . The Pew Center says that we have the highest rate of not passing our tradition along to our children ( other than the Hispanic population ) .

##282352 <p> It sums up the current political situation pretty well , and what a bizarre situation it is . <p> Gillard stabbed Rudd in the back , Rudd stepped up and helped out his Lady Macbeth during the election , interim-mad-monk-Abbott pushed a relentless campaign , we discovered that there was Julia and then there was the " real Julia " ( along with two impersonators ) which was confusing , the Greens slid gracefully into the Senate and House of Reps , Bob Katter ... I do n't know what Bob Katter is doing , but one somewhat effective campaign video and all of a sudden he 's the force to be reckoned with . <p> More interestingly , since http : **35;1230;TOOLONG ... reassures me that " no " we do n't have a government yet .. is the increasing political concern being shown by the independents which was sadly lacking from either major party 's election campaign this year . <p> Firstly , they banded together . Thank god someone has learnt something from the fiasco that both parties called their " election campaigns " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a big part of politics but this year the campaigns seemed to be entirely founded upon this idea that " we 're bad , but the others are heaps worse ! " . United not divided , the independents have shown some savvy with that one . <p> Secondly , they 're making demands ! It 's been a long time since our government has had to answer to demands of any sort ( they do a great job at ignoring the demands of their constituents ) and these are demands which demand transparency , another concept our government is not particularly familiar with . <p> Gillard 's bending over backwards to accommodate them , which is more a reflection of her sense of eminent downfall rather than any innate respect for processes of open disclosure . Whilst Abbott is largely trying to do the same , he just quite bring himself to put the costings on the table ( well , without a set of conditions ) . For a party that uses the Australian fear over anything economic related ( GBNT , deficits , surpluses , overspending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some of the mist and mirrors . <p> Thirdly , they 've stepped away from the hot election issues ( refugees , health reform and a mutual commitment to do nothing about climate change ) and decided that they 'd like to look at all the other incredibly important portfolios that we seemed to forget existed -- like Education , Workplace Relations , Transport , Agriculture , Defence ... It certainly feels more like an election now than it did a couple of weeks ago . <p> And finally , they 're proposing a new style of politics , one that would allow for a " concensus option " and a majority government to be formed . This is the most radical non-radical idea anyone has had since Kevin Rudd took the radically non-radical steps of apologising for the hideous past treatment of Indigenous Australians and decided that climate change was probably a little problem we should address relatively soon . Unsurprisingly , Abbott 's finding this all a bit confronting and difficult , but Gillard seems relatively receptive to the idea . <p> So there you have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ... and all of a sudden it seems like it 's about to get political . <h> Rob S says : <h> Harquebus says : <p> 01:00pm 30/08/10 <p> The people have voted for what they want . There has to be a sitting of parliament before we can start again . <h> Polly Waffle says : <p> 08:55am 30/08/10 <p> The Gang of Three might eventually become the Famous Five , if we are lucky . It 's time the major parties were enlightened and this election has certainly done that even if they have been dragged kickiong and screaming into th 21st Century . Long live the Independents and the Greens - they have brought a breath of fresh air into the country . They might even stop Coles and Woolworths importing Captain 's Biscuits from China . <h> Rob S says : <h> Amber says : <p> 11:17am 30/08/10 <p> It would be worth having another one just to see what would happen . More informal voes ? More polarised LIb/Lab votes ? Fewer Green votes ? Fewer Independent votes ? So many interesting possibilities - will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 12:54pm 30/08/10 <p> ... that Government really do n't do much anyway ? <p> or just that there 's actually still a caretaker government in power , even if it is that next to useless Gillard mob . Not to mention generally equally useless state and local governments . We 're not exactly Somalia just yet . <h> Muzz says : <p> 04:44pm 30/08/10 <p> I like the " mutual commitment to do nothing about climate change " . Here 's hoping it continues . <h> Dam Train says : <p> 05:41pm 30/08/10 <p> I can not believe I just wasted my time reading that article . What was the point ? To tell us that we do n't have a government ? Or perhaps it was to spruik a website . <p> Me thinks Soph needs to spend less time writing meaningless articles and more time developing an approach that can thrust climate change into the middle ground and convince all Australians that we need action not 
##289050 <h> Temples of Phuket <p> Thai temples , or wat , have long held a magic and mystique and are considered one of the most important symbols of Thailand . From a giant Buddha keeping watch over the island to the sanctity of a working monastery , visitors to Phuket 's temples will feel their awe-inspiring , spiritual atmosphere . <p> Before visiting , it 's important for visitors to remember to show respect at religious sites by not wearing clothes that reveal their shoulders , chest , stomach or legs . Shorts or short skirts are definite no-no 's . Visitors will also often be asked to remove their footwear before entering some of the temple buildings . Donations are readily accepted and greatly appreciated at all watt . <h> Big Buddha <p> This image , one of the Phuket 's most well known temples and revered landmarks , sits atop one of the Nakkerd Hills between Chalong and Kata . Easily spotted from miles away , Big Buddha measures 45 meters high and 25 meters across the base , and the location offers visitors spectacular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting away from the bustling city and beaches , the only sounds visitors will hear are the wind-blown Buddhist flags , small bells , and soft dharma music . <p> Still not 100% complete , it is a sight that should be on any itinerary , and on a good day , more than 1,000 people visit the site , donating money for building materials that include beautiful white Burmese marble . The gigantic Buddha is funded entirely by donations , and countless donation boxes are found around the site . When completed , it 's estimated that the entire project -- including the road leading up to the site -- will total about 150 million baht . <p> Finding Big Buddha is easy as it is well-signed . The road is off Chao Fa Road East near Chalong , then follow the red and white signs that will lead you up the hill . <h> Wat Chalong <p> Wat Chalong , about 8 km south of Phuket Town , is the busiest , biggest , most ornate , and most important Buddhist temple on Phuket . This temple honors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus houses the Poh Than Jao Wat statue . <p> Visitors to the Wat Chalong are often startled by the sound of firecrackers , which are ignited by thankful Buddhists in smaller , beehive-shaped structures on the temple grounds . Whenever a prayer of theirs is answered , they loudly celebrate with thanks by setting off a string of firecrackers . <h> Wat Phra Thong ( Buried Golden Buddha Temple ) <p> A little less touristy than Wat Chalong , Wat Phra Thong is in the middle of Phuket , which means visitors will need to forego the beaches for a bit to see this temple . <p> According to legend , the revered Buddha image at this temple was found with only the very tip of the head visible aboveground , to which a little boy had tied his buffalo in days when the area was used for pasture . The boy and buffalo then became ill and died . <p> Over the years , the local villagers and even invading Burmese soldiers tried to excavate the Buddha , only to be attacked by ants , wasps , hornets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden tip would be stolen , it was at one point covered in a cement-like mixture of burned shells and sand . <p> Eventually , a monk from Sukhothai came to Thalang and was able to persuade villagers to build a temple around the exposed Buddha 's head and re-gild the image . <p> The more scientific explanation as to why this Buddha is half buried is much more boring : a canal simply changed direction and flooded the area , burying it in a layer of silt . However , it remains that no one that 's ever tried to dig it out has succeeded . <p> Only the upper part of the Buddha image , known as Phra Phut , is on display in the temple today . <h> Wat Phranang Sang <p> The oldest temple in Phuket , this " Temple built by a queen " was constructed over 500 years ago , complete with ancient tin Buddhas , some found nested inside the bellies of others . <p> Wat Phranang Sang displays statues of Phuket 's heroines , Lady Chan and Lady Mook , a reclining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of the life of Lord Buddha 's and important historical events . <h> Wat Suwan Khiri Khet ( Wat Karon ) <p> The only temple in Karon Beach , this small , attractive temple was founded in 1895 and recently renovated . Two large , emerald-green serpents stand guard at the main building , and the interior walls , doors and window panels portray Buddha 's life . <p> The temple is an easy walk from Karon , and well worth a visit and a few photos . <h> Wat Srisoonthorn <p> Built in 1792 , the temple is known by locals as Wat Lipon , and showcases a 29-meter-high sleeping Buddha on the central building 's roof , making it easy to spot from the road . <p> This particular image depicts Buddha entering Nirvana , and this image , as well as smaller ones nearby in varying positions , face the entrance to welcome visitors . <h> Wat Putta Mongkon <p> In the center of Phuket Town , visitors will find Wat Putta Mongkon , often called Wat Klang , or " centre temple " , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this wat , including a small bell tower , yellow pagoda ( chedi ) and a Sino-Portuguese style mansion that houses temple monks . <h> Wat Kajonrangsan ( Wat Kajon ) <p> The temple 's unique attribute is its main building , built in Roman style -- very unusual in Phuket -- and Thai pagodas . <p> Other wat in Phuket worth a visit are Wat Kathu , Wat Khao Rang and the ornate Wat Kosit Wihan , some offering 
##293152 <h> Employees <h> On this page <p> At common law an employee is a person who works under an employment contract which may be either verbal or written . An employee is always an individual ( as opposed to a company or partnership ) and their employment is regulated by state ( WA ) and federal industrial relations laws including , where applicable , awards . An employee does not have the right to control how and when work is performed and can not delegate work to others . <p> Workers deemed to be employees regardless of the common law definition <p> Some laws such as workers compensation and superannuation laws as well as some taxation laws deem workers to be employees regardless of the common law definition . See topics on Superannuation and Independent Contractors to find out if someone may be considered an employee in these contexts . <p> Employees may be engaged as permanent full-time employees , permanent part-time employees , casual employees or seasonal employees . It is important to understand the difference between these different categories as the various entitlements and responsibilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee correctly and therefore to adhere to legal and award requirements can lead to misunderstandings and possibly legal action for underpayment of entitlements and prosecution for breach of the award . <h> Permanent employees <h> Full-time <p> Permanent full-time employees work fixed hours each week and are entitled to various forms of paid leave such as annual leave , personal leave , long-service leave and parental leave . They are also entitled to notice of termination and to make a claim for unfair dismissal . <h> Part-time <p> Part-time employees are employed for fixed hours every week and depending on the number of hours worked have the same entitlements as full-time employees calculated on a pro-rata basis . If public holidays fall on days usually worked the employee is entitled to payment for that holiday . Part-time employees are also entitled to notice of termination and to make a claim for unfair dismissal . <h> Casual employees <p> At common law , casual employees are employees who do not have regular or systematic hours of work or an expectation of continuing work . A typical casual employee is employed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually paid a loading to compensate them for lack of entitlements such as annual leave , personal leave and the lack of continuity of work . Under Clause 10.4 of the Pastoral Award 2010 , casual employees are entitled to be paid at the hourly rate plus 25% . The award also specifies that on each occasion the casual attends for work they are entitled to a minimum payment of 3 hours work . Casual employees are not usually entitled to notice of termination . <p> Unfair termination laws have for some time recognised the concept of regular casual employees . The federal industrial laws provide for casual employees who are engaged on a regular and systematic basis and who have a reasonable expectation of continuing employment to make a claim for unfair dismissal providing they have served the minimum employment period . <h> Risk of engaging employees on casual basis rather than part-time <p> Employers who engage employees on a casual basis when their employment can be more accurately described as part-time , run the risk that the employee will bring an action for non-payment of entitlements such as annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Such claims have succeeded in the past despite the fact that a casual loading had been paid . Employees have up to six years to make a claim . <p> Employees who work similar hours each week <p> Employees who work similar hours each week , which are known in advance , should be hired as permanent employees , either full time or part time and paid the various entitlements . <h> Seasonal employees <p> Seasonal employees are engaged to perform work during a specified season with no expectation of continuing work once the season has passed . The season must be clearly identifiable , for example by weather or temperature , availability of the particular product or activity or marked by certain conditions such as festivities or other activities . For example , calving and harvesting . <p> Seasonal employees will usually be paid a loading to compensate for the loss of such entitlements as leave and notice . Under the federal industrial laws , seasonal employees are not entitled to notice of termination and if they are dismissed at the end of the season they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about minimum entitlements see the National Employment Standards . <h> Hiring people from overseas <h> Illegal workers <p> Employers considering employing non-Australian citizens or permanent residents ( e.g. working holiday makers ) should be aware that some visas prevent or restrict the right of a person to work in Australia . Every worker from overseas must have a valid Australian visa with work rights . <p> Illegal workers are non-Australian citizens who are working in Australia without a visa , or who are in Australia lawfully but working in breach of their visa conditions . Work means any activity that normally attracts remuneration . In other words , even unpaid workers will be considered to be working if their work would normally attract remuneration . <h> Employing an illegal worker is a criminal offence <p> Employers are responsible for checking all workers ' rights to work in Australia . It is an offence under the Migration Act 1958 to knowingly or recklessly allow workers to work , or to refer workers for work , where those workers are from overseas and either illegally in Australia or working in breach of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offences face fines of up to $13,200 and two years imprisonment while companies face fines of up to $66,000 per illegal worker . <p> These offences apply to employers , labour hire companies , employment agencies and other people who allow illegal workers to work or refer illegal workers for work . <p> You can only commit the offence of allowing an illegal worker to work if you have a direct legal relationship ( e.g. a common law contract of employment / independent contractor agreement ) with that person . If a worker is obtained from a labour hire company , the hire company remains the legal employer of the worker , the farm using the services of the worker will not be liable , unless it also has a separate legal relationship with that worker . <p> However , due to the serious nature of these offences and penalties , farmers employing labour from a labour hire firm should still insist on seeing evidence of work rights <h> Importance of checking work rights <p> People found working without a valid visa can be removed from the workplace without notice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment caused by the sudden removal of an employee , employers should check the work entitlements of new employees . <p> Employers are responsible for checking all workers ' rights to work in Australia . If employees or job applicants refuse to cooperate with this process they should be told that they will not be employed until such checks have been satisfactorily completed or until their entitlement to work can be verified . <p> Employers should check the work entitlements of all job applicants . If employers check the work rights of all employees and applicants they will be in a better position to defend allegations of breaches of the racial discrimination legislation by prospective employees who object to questions relating to their origin . <h> Checking a prospective employee 's entitlement to work in Australia <p> Work rights can be checked by asking to see the person 's passport or other evidence of Australian citizenship , such as a birth certificate or certificate of citizenship , as well as appropriate photo identification . <p> The Visa Entitlement Verification Online ( VEVO ) service is the safest , easiest and quickest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overseas . <p> VEVO is a free , internet-based system that allows you to check the work entitlements of a visa holder online gives you current visa information and is available 24 hours a day , seven days a week . <p> Employers who do not have immediate access to fax or email have a period of 48 hours in which to conduct any checks . <p> Providing these checks are initiated within 48 hours of an employee starting work and the employer does not know the person is an illegal worker , the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has said that they will not be referred for prosecution , even if the employee turns out to be an illegal worker . <p> Employers who discover an employee is an illegal worker must end the working relationship immediately . <p> Employers relying on the 48-hour checking period will need to have records of the date and time when the employee started work to enable calculation of the 48-hour period . <h> How often to check <p> Australian citizens and permanent residents need one single check at the time of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no changes to their immigration status have occurred .

With this visa those people you employ from overseas can work in Australia for a period of between one day and four years . <p> The Employer Nomination Scheme ( ENS ) enables employers to sponsor highly skilled workers to fill skilled vacancies in their business .

Employers must be lawfully operating in Australia , and the position must provide full-time employment in Australia for two years . Conditions of employment and wages must comply with Australian legislation and awards . <h> Working holiday makers <p> To meet the seasonal nature of work on dairy farms it may be worth considering working holiday makers for short-term employment . <p> The working holiday maker program is a cultural exchange program which allows visa holders to supplement their holiday funds through short-term work .

##298251 <h> FAQ <h> What is the Herpes virus ? <p> A virus is a minute organism which requires a living cell in order to grow and replicate . Most viruses are with you for life but lay dormant most of the time . The Herpes family of viruses includes : <p> Herpes Simplex Virus 1 ( HSV1 ) -- usually presents as blisters in the facial area and is commonly known as ' Cold Sores ' although they have nothing to do with having a cold but can recur often just as a cold does . HSV1 is not limited to outbreaks in the facial area but can in fact occur anywhere on the body . <p> Herpes Simplex Virus 2 ( HSV2 ) - usually presents as blisters in the genital area and is not usually referred to as ' Cold Sores ' . HSV2 , just as HSV1 , can occur on other locations on the body . <p> Human Herpes Virus 3 ( HHV3 or VZV ) - the Herpes Varicella Virus causes chickenpox ( a rash which often occurs in childhood and normally only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash which can occur in later years and which also usually only occurs once ) . <p> Human Herpes Virus 4 ( HHV4 ) - the Epstein-Barr virus which causes Mononucleosis , commonly known as ' Mono ' or the ' kissing virus . ' <h> How do you catch it ? <p> Herpes is passed on via ' skin to skin ' contact , this can include normal forms of affection such as kissing and also all forms of sexual activity . Previously it was believed only to be contagious during an active outbreak , but it is now known that the virus can shed asymptomatically -- during periods when there are no symptoms present . <h> What are the symptoms ? <p> Symptoms vary between individuals and outbreaks . You can even have herpes and never show any symptoms at all . Common symptoms accompanying an initial outbreak can include flu like symptoms ( aching , swollen glands ) , itching , redness , a rash , a ' tingling ' sensation , pain in the lower back and legs , small fluid-filled blisters . Recurrent outbreaks are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <h> Is there a cure ? <p> At this time there is no ' cure ' for herpes , however , medication is available which can help relieve and reduce the symptoms , and to inhibit recurrences . <h> What treatment is available ? <p> Treatment includes antiviral medications , topical creams ( for oral herpes ) , and natural therapy regimes . Antiviral medication results may differ for individuals , so it is important to monitor your condition under the supervision of your doctor or health professional to ensure you are using the most suitable treatment for your condition . <h> Is there a vaccination ? <p> Research is currently underway around the world on a vaccine for the herpes virus with some initial results showing promise for the future . An Australian trial targeting teenagers is currently underway . To find out more about the study , call 1800 554 609 . <h> How often do outbreaks occur ? <p> This again varies amongst individuals . Some people only ever experience the first outbreak and never have a recurrence , some people never experience an identifiable outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrences generally reduce with time , however , an increase can occur if you experience additional stress or emotional trauma or eat foods which trigger your outbreaks . It 's a good idea to learn what personally triggers your outbreaks so you can better manage your condition . <h> What is an ' OB ' ? <p> Outbreak ( OB ) is the term used to refer to an active episode of the herpes virus , usually with blisters occurring . <h> What does the term ' prodrome ' mean ? <p> Prodrome is the term used to describe the symptoms which some people experience before an active outbreak . Common prodrome symptoms can include tingling , redness , swollen glands , and/or neural pain in the legs or lower back . <h> Can I spread Herpes when I am not experiencing an outbreak ? <p> Yes , herpes can be spread whilst no symptoms are present . The virus can be active at the skins surface and viral particles can be shed and passed on to another at this time . This is called ' asymptomatic shedding ' because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occurs very rarely . The bad news is that without clinical testing it is impossible to know when this is occurring . <h> How can I protect my partner ? <p> Abstain from sexual contact during an outbreak or prodrome because this is when the virus is most active on the skins surface . Taking antiviral medication and practicing ' Safer Sex ' ( using a condom or dental dam ) can also help reduce the likelihood of passing on the virus . <h> What about future pregnancies ? <p> Obviously practicing ' Safer Sex ' can have the sometimes unwanted consequence of preventing pregnancy . If you are in a relationship where one partner has herpes and the other does not and you wish to start a family , then at some point you must make the decision to dispense with protection and risk passing the virus on to your partner . Consult with your doctor and actively work in partnership with both your partner and doctor to reduce the risks involved . <h> How will having Herpes affect my unborn child ? <p> Herpes can be passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active outbreak . There is also a slight risk of passing on the virus during birth through asymptomatic shedding . If a baby contracts the herpes virus during birth there is a risk of brain damage and even death in rare cases . However this does not mean that you can not have children or have a natural birth . If your doctor knows or suspects you may be having an outbreak he may suggest a caesarean , however , many people do give birth naturally without passing the virus to their baby . Consult with your doctor and actively work in partnership with both your partner and doctor to reduce the risks involved . <h> How do I tell someone I have Herpes ? <p> This can be one of the most difficult aspects of having herpes ... telling your current partner ( or casual partner/s ) , or informing a potential new date that you have herpes . Choosing when and how you tell them takes some consideration and preparation . You need to consider how this person may react , what information they might be interested in ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational and support resources ) . It is also very important ' how ' you tell . If you act ashamed , you will make having herpes appear shameful . Try to speak in a normal tone and present the facts calmly . By giving them this very personal information about yourself you are showing them how much you respect and trust them . <h> Can I have a relationship without telling them I have Herpes ? <p> The choice is obviously yours whether you choose to tell someone your STI status before becoming involved with them or not . However , you do need to consider the impact it may have on your relationship if you wait to disclose until after you have become intimate or involved . Many people are bitter about the circumstances under which they contracted Herpes and wish that the person had told them the truth up-front and allowed them to make their own informed decision on whether to take the risk or not . By informing someone about your STI status you are showing how much you trust , respect and care about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have some educational resources on hand , eg. a leaflet or reference to online resources , such as the article for people considering embarking on a relationship with someone with the virus , you may be pleasantly surprised by their positive reaction . <h> What can I do to ease the physical symptoms ? <p> Antiviral medication can help reduce the physical symptoms and promote faster healing . Topical creams are only effective for oral herpes outbreaks , but alternative therapies such as Aromatherapy have also proved beneficial for some . Applying an icepack can help relieve symptoms and if used during the prodrome stage may sometimes prevent a full outbreak from occurring . To ease the pain sometimes experienced during urination run water over the affected area ( eg. In the shower , or use a sitz bath ) . <h> How can I cope with the stigma ? <p> Oral herpes appears to be generally accepted as commonplace and of little consequence , however genital herpes is often perceived as a disease of the ' dirty ' and ' promiscuous ' . This is obviously not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because genital herpes is contracted through sexual activity . Despite the modern healthy attitude towards sexuality STDs ( STIs ) are still viewed in such a negative manner that most people feel ashamed when they become a statistic . However , as educational programmes and media promotions become more commonplace the stigma is slowly being reduced . <h> What support can a doctor provide ? <p> Doctors and medical professionals can provide an accurate diagnosis . The symptoms of Herpes outbreaks are sometimes mistaken for other problems , such as Thrush or bacterial infections so it is very important to be correctly diagnosed . A doctor can provide both information and counselling support , as well as providing a prescription for anti-viral medication which will help reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks . It 's a good idea to monitor your herpes outbreaks in concert with you doctor as some anti-viral medications are more effective for some people than others . By closely monitoring the effectiveness of your medication you and your doctor will quickly be able to identify which treatment works best for you . <h> What other support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available throughout Australia and worldwide . Services provided by individual support groups may include : <h> Can I transfer the virus to other parts of my body ? <p> Autoinoculation is the process where a person can pass the infection from one area of the body to another . This is common with children passing facial oral Herpes on to the hands or other areas ( it can be difficult to discourage scratching in children or make them aware of the need to be careful during outbreaks ) . For the virus to enter the body at another location an open cut in the skin is necessary . Normal hygiene procedures -- washing hands after touching an outbreak area should be enough to prevent this from happening . Does this mean the end of my love / sex life ? Many people fear that contracting Herpes means their love / sex life will never be the same again and that no one will ever love them again or want to have sex with them again . This is far from the truth . Whilst it is true that having Herpes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to be made , the changes required can be minimal and easily managed . Abstaining from sex during an outbreak is an obvious precaution and one which should n't be too hard to implement because most people would not feel like having sex during an outbreak anyway ! But this does not mean that you can not be affectionate or intimate with your partner ... intimacy is not dependent on genital contact . Practicing ' Safer Sex ' at all times is important , this means using a condom or dental dam during all sexual contact , including oral sex because either type of herpes can be transferred during oral sex . <h> Can I ever have unprotected sex again ? <p> Herpes is with you for life and you can shed viral particles without showing any visible symptoms so there is always going to be a risk of passing the virus on . However , the risk can be minimised by avoiding contact with the outbreak area during the active phase ; by practicing ' Safer Sex ' and taking anti viral medication to reduce outbreaks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to have a blood test for antibodies in case you are taking unnecessary precautions against passing it on to someone who does in fact already have Herpes but is unaware of it . If you are in a relationship where both partners have Herpes and there is limited risk of passing on any other infection then there should be no reason why you can not have ' unprotected ' sex during non outbreak periods so long as you are using some form of contraception if that is necessary . Obviously if you are planning a family ' Safer Sex ' practices will not be possible all the time . To reduce the possibility of transmission you should consider limiting unprotected sex to the ovulation phase only . <h> Can I still have oral sex if I have Herpes ? <p> Since both forms of Herpes can be passed to other locations it is best to use some form of protection for oral sex . Coloured and flavoured condoms can add a fun element , and dental dams may be worth a try . Some people do choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal choice which requires your own individual assessment of the level of risk and the individual 's preparedness to face the consequences . <p> Hi , I have had a sore tongue for the past 2 weeks ( almost like I 've eaten something hot and burnt it ) . I have a gut feeling this is a herpes sore , however I ca n't find a lot about tongue infections . Have you come across this at all and can you tell me more about sores inside the mouth ? Thank you . <p> hi , i do nt know what to do and need help .. i havent had any symptoms or anything to warn me that i may have had herpes and a guy i was recently with is telling me he wants to kill himself because i was unclean and dirty and that he has herpes now when i did nt even know .... i just hoping if i could get some advice and support with this because i never knew and just do nt know what to do with my life ... <p> Firstly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pass it on to someone else . That does not mean that this is the case , only that it is ' possible ' for this to occur . <p> You can get tested to find out if you have herpes or not . Visit a doctor or sexual health clinic and ask for a herpes test specifically because it is not generally included in an STI test . Herpes is very common and not something one should feel ashamed of , but people do feel this way , particularly when they first find out . With time and support people usually come to accept it for what it is , get past the desire to blame someone else , and get on with living their life . <p> If you can suggest to the guy that he seek out some support himself he may find it easier to deal with -- particularly important if he has suicidal thoughts . <p> If you find out that you do have herpes as well , then make sure you access the support you need too -- check with your sexual health clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join an online group . <p> Hi , i 've got symptoms right now and it 's been over 2 weeks it 's not my first outbreak how long does it go for ?

##300950 <h> Holy Protomartyr and Equal-to-the-Apostles Thekla <p> Memory celebrated September 24 <p> According to her biographer , St. Epiphanios , Thekla was born of humble parents in the town of Ikonion in Asia Minor about a quarter century after the birth of Jesus of Nazareth . Like other girls of her class , she had no formal education and was unfamiliar with any of the arts or the classics . A dutiful peasant girl , she was resigned to one day becoming a wife and nothing more was expected of her , but she showed an intellectual curiosity which was frowned upon by her friends but was encouraged by her mother . She attained a degree of literacy , which was rare for a girl in those days , and with the help of her mother found some of the answers she eagerly sought in quest of the real meaning of life . <p> It was not strange , therefore , when Thekla was eighteen years old that her mother took her to listen and learn about the new faith that was bringing joy to those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to the mightiest missionary of them all , no less than St. Paul himself , whose message of Christ so moved the young girl that she sought out the company of St. Paul , who personally converted her to Christianity . She had much to learn about the teaching of Jesus and his true light and attended every meeting held in the the area by St. Paul and spoke with other converts in whom she found the love of God . <p> When Paul was preparing to leave the area to continue his work for Jesus , Thekla ran to her mother and begged her for permission to go with the holy man and take up the cause for Christ in her own way , if St. Paul would let her . Her mother , a devout Christian herself , told her daughter she was free to go anywhere to serve the Lord . The delighted girl then overtook the missionary party of St. Paul and was welcomed into the group , thereafter to become so deeply involved that she was soon one of the ablest of the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own missionary work in other parts of the lands hitherto unreached , while the rest of the missionaries did likewise and split up into groups that fanned out into all directions of the pagan countries . With St Paul 's blessing she set out on a journey into many strange lands , some of which were hostile and others of which were anxious to hear the words of the girl whose reputation had preceded her . She won countless numbers of pagans to the new faith but was finally apprehended by an unnamed pagan ruler whose barbarism struck terror into the hearts of his subjects . <p> There ensued a series of tortures that would have ended the life of any mortal at the outset , but the Lord had seen fit to make Thekla superhuman , in answer to the cruelties of the enemies of early Christianity . When she was cast into a fire , she walked away unscathed . Lances bounced off her and nails could not penetrate her skin .

##329051 <p> The story of the Patrician Brothers coming to Australia in 1883 has its beginnings in Australia itself . White Australia began in 1788 as a penal colony for the British Government . From the beginning , relations between Church and State were somewhat strained , especially between the Irish Catholic Church and British State . <p> At first all education was provided at the expense of the State . All Government and Private schools were funded by the taxes of the people . For the Catholic Bishops of the infant Church community of New South Wales , the Catholic schools were the nurseries of the Church . The Government school system was seen as ' seed-plots of future immorality ' . While there were a few Religious Congregations in the young colony to assist with the education of Catholic children , most teachers in Church schools were lay people . Their wages were paid by the Government . <p> The history of the early colony reveals many ' clashes ' between the Irish and British . Education was to be one of the key points of conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial support from all schools outside the Government system . The Bishops were determined to maintain a Catholic school system . Since they no longer had the finances to pay lay teachers , they began to appeal to Religious Congregations around the world to send members of their Congregations to run and teach in their schools . <p> In 1880 Bishop Murray of Maitland , and in 1882 Bishop Quinn of Bathurst and Bishop Lanigan of Goulburn ( all of them rural areas in New South Wales ) had been in touch with the Patrician Brothers in Ireland . A sponsorship scheme was set in place whereby these Bishops would pay for the training , transport , and accommodation of Brothers being prepared for the New South Wales missions . <p> The first Patrician Brothers arrived in Australia on the 7th of March , 1883 . They began teaching in Bishop Murray 's school on the 9th of April . <p> For the remainder of the 19th century the Brothers mainly worked at setting up schools in the country areas surrounding Sydney : Maitland , Goulburn , Bathurst , Redfern ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagga , Forest Lodge ( Sydney ) , Ryde ( Sydney ) , and Orange . By 1894 Ireland had sent thirty-nine Brothers to work in Australia . <p> The road was not a smooth one . There had been a significant number of deaths of the Brothers , some through illnesses they had brought with them , others through unfortunate misadventures . Also , there were several conflicts with Bishops concerning issues of control and authority over the Brothers . <p> By the end of the first quarter of the twentieth century , the Brothers had withdrawn from all the country schools . With so few Brothers and with country schools isolating the Brothers from each other , it was decided to concentrate on setting up schools in the working class areas of Sydney : Waterloo , Wahroonga ( formation house ) , Granville , Blacktown , Fairfield , Liverpool , Sefton , Narellan ( 1963 , formation house ) . <p> Over the past twenty years the Brothers in Australia have been looking closely at their ministry . The Congregation was founded to minister to the educational needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia to take over Catholic schools from lay teachers who could no longer be financed . In the late 1990 's that apparent need was no longer there . We are being called to discern where the poor are today , and therefore where we are being called by the Spirit . Today not all the Brothers are involved in education . We have Brothers involved in such areas as parish ministry , hospital chaplain ministry , and CEO administration . <p> The population of the Sydney metropolitan district is 4.6 million and covers an area of 12000 square kilometres .

##342652 <h> Sugar at back of price rise pack <p> By Tim Colebatch Canberra Greg Roberts Brisbane September 12 2002 <p> Since 1991 , the average price of milk in Melbourne supermarkets has risen 68 per cent . Bread has gone up 70 per cent , rice 79 per cent and eggs 91 per cent . But the price of a bag of sugar rose just 10 per cent . <p> As the Federal Government 's $150 million package to rescue the Queensland sugar industry met with increasingly negative sentiment yesterday , Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on retail prices underlined why sugar farmers say it costs them more to grow the sugar than they get for it . <p> While food prices overall have risen 43 per cent since 1991 , the sugar has been virtually at the back of the pack in price rises . <p> In the year to June , the average price of a two-kilogram bag of sugar in Melbourne supermarkets fell 19 cents - slightly more than they would rebound under the levy the Federal Government will impose to pay for its grower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy as " yet another Costello government 's promises . " ) ; document.write ( " <p> advertisement <p> " ) ; // --&gt; <p> Canegrowers have warned the package may not result in industry reforms . <p> However , the government believes that on top of the $60 million it gave the industry in 2000 , the package , to be funded largely by a retail levy of up to 18 cents a kilogram , is generous , and that reforms are inevitable . <p> Peter Sheedy , the manager of Herbert River Canegrowers in north Queensland , said the package does not provide adequate assistance for the production of next year 's crop , which follows four successive poor crops due to floods or drought , or for debt relief . <p> " It 's one thing to put food on the plates of growers , it 's another to keep their operation going , " Mr Sheedy said . <p> He said the government wants the single desk for selling sugar on the domestic market removed . <p> But this could undermine the single desk for export sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing growers want is a free-for-all in sugar marketing . " <p> The package includes $60 million for regional industry restructuring , including funds for mill diversification and for growers facing difficulties to " leave with dignity and make a new start " . <p> Australian Canegrowers Council general manager Ian Ballantyne , said the proposed tax-free payment of $45,000 was inadequate . <p> " Nobody in any industry is going to walk away from their properties for $45,000 ; there 's nobody out there buying properties anyway , " he said . <p> The Prime Minister last week rebuked the industry for failing to reform in 2000 , but Mr Ballantyne said this money was spent on recovering from floods and cyclones . <p> Mr Ballantyne said he could not see how the package would provide for meaningful structural reform . <p> " You ca n't throw $150 million at a $10 billion industry and tell it to rationalise in 18 months .

##351150 <h> Burma 's Economy : The Next Big Story in Asia <p> " It 's like Thailand was 50 years ago , " Alexandre de Lesseps told me . We were talking about the next big emerging market to bloom in Asia . It may surprise you , but it is one heck of a story ... and opportunity . It also fits our grand thesis on emerging markets and is the subject of my upcoming book , World Right Side Up . The country I 'm talking about is Myanmar ( or Burma , as most people still seem to call it ) . <p> I caught up with Alex over the holidays because I remembered his infectious enthusiasm for the country . He is an accomplished investor of frontier markets , those half-forgotten realms on the fringe of the investing world . Alex has been investing in Burma for 15 years as a partner at SPA Capital Partners , working with Serge Pun &; Associates . <p> The latter is an investment holding company that has been in Burma since ' 91 . ( And yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the French developer of the Suez Canal , who also oversaw the early construction of the Panama Canal . ) <p> I first met Alex at a dinner at a pleasant riverside restaurant in Phnom Penh , Cambodia . My friend Doug Clayton of Leopard Capital arranged the dinner . ( We 'll hear from Doug in a bit . ) I was in the middle of a swing through Thailand , Cambodia and Vietnam . When I asked investors in these places what the next big story to emerge from Southeast Asia would be , the answer was always the same : Burma . <p> Burma is beginning , at last , to thaw . The grip of the military junta is loosening , by its own hand . ( " This is very important , " Alex said . " The decision to change the country came from within . It speaks to the depth and substance of the changes taking place . " ) The market is beginning to open up . Political prisoners have been released . Press censorship rules have been relaxed . Things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first US Secretary of State to do so in 50 years . <p> Alex told me he 's never seen anything like it in all his years in Burma . The hotels are full . Many are already sold-out for the first few months of the year . And Burma gets more and more mainstream attention nearly every week . Why is Burma important ? <p> In short , it has everything the world craves - in size . The Wall Street Journal reported : " Myanmar 's potential is too great for some investors to ignore . One of the last , large frontier markets in Asia , it is rich in oil , gas , timber and gems and has the potential to be a major rice and seafood exporter . " Estimates of natural gas reserves , for instance , would make Burmese fields the 10th largest in the world . Labour costs are low , which could support basic manufacturing . <p> Doug Clayton visited Rangoon ( Yangon ) and wrote about it in his newsletter . Doug notes that Burma has the largest landmass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has 1,240 miles of uninterrupted coastline , deep-water port sites on the strategic Indian Ocean , plus 600 little-used tropical islands . <p> As home to more than 2,000 pagodas and temples and miles of pristine beaches , Burma could support a larger tourism business . " From my own wanderings in both countries , " Doug concludes , " I would rate Myanmar 's long-term tourism potential just as strong as Thailand 's - which draws 14 million tourists a year , versus Myanmar 's 300,000 . " <p> The comparison with Thailand is hard to miss , and Doug pursues it further . " To comprehend Myanmar 's potential , look over the border at Thailand , a country of comparable size and population , " Doug continues . " Around the time of World War II , colonial Burma 's economy and development surpassed Thailand 's . " <p> Since then , though , Thailand 's economy is now 10 times bigger than Myanmar 's . Doug reckons that " the gap between these historical peers seems likely to narrow as Myanmar introduces a political system more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motive force behind the " world right side up " idea - this narrowing of historically anomalous large gaps in development to a world more in tune with longer historical experience ( and hence , right side up ) . <p> One of the books I read over the holidays was Thant Myint-U 's Where China Meets India : Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia . Thant continues the theme . Rangoon was once the rich capital of British Burma . It was an exporter of rice , timber and oil . <p> " By the late 1920s , " Thant writes , " Rangoon exceeded New York as the greatest immigrant port in the world ... Rangoon became a hub for all of Asia . " By the 1930s , Burma 's economy , on a per capita basis , was at least twice that of China ' s . Today , China 's is about six times as great . That is a gap that ought to narrow as Burma opens up . <p> Simple geography also anchors Burma 's importance . It sits between China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the size of France , with 60 million people . Thant makes Burma 's unique position clear . If you draw a 700-mile radius around Mandalay , Burma 's second-largest city , you encompass a population of 700 million people - nearly one in 10 of all the people on the planet . <p> It is a natural crossroads . Already , work has begun on a network of pipelines and highways and railways - all with Burma as the bridge to the two potentially biggest markets on earth , China and India . <p> " There will be opportunities to invest , " Alex told me . Indeed , he 's already seeing investors line up . In the next several months , new funds will launch . The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced it would help Myanmar develop its stock market . Many companies are already trying to elbow their way in Burma . <p> These are mostly Asian companies , as they are not covered by the sanctions imposed by the US and Europe . But some Western companies are already making inroads . Unilever sells soap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a few are still there as exceptions to the sanctions , such as the French oil giant Total . <p> Overwhelmingly , the foreign investment has focused on oil and gas , mining and power . And Burma 's biggest investor has been China . ( One Chinese businessman quoted in Thant 's book says , " I hope the sanctions last forever . " And why not ? It keeps out the competition . ) There is plenty of opportunity in basic things like cement and automobiles and hotels . <p> And it 's all just beginning . We 'll keep an eye on Burma as opportunities open up . It 's an exciting time to

##417252 <h> Features and investigations journalist for The Sydney Morning Herald <p> Got the power ... Shirley Ball says ECT " rebooted " her brain in a way that medication could not . Photo : Tamara Dean <p> Electroconvulsive therapy is providing a jolt from the blues for many suffering from mental illnesses . Tim Elliott explores the resurgence of a much-maligned medical treatment . <p> One night in April , 1999 , Shirley Ball found herself lying in bed beside her husband at 4am , staring into the darkness and thinking of ways to kill Amy , her four-month-old daughter . A pillow over the face - that would do it . What would happen if she put Amy in the microwave ? The thoughts , which came from inside her head but were n't hers , terrified Ball , who lay there , just like the night before and the night before that , pinned to the bed , waiting for the dawn . " In the morning it was always this huge relief . I 'd think : ' I 'm safe again for another day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time , I 'll scream . ' A moment later , the baby cried , and Ball screamed . And screamed , and screamed , and screamed <p> Ball is 52 now , and lives in Sydney , where she works as an optical dispenser . A tall , slim woman with green eyes and blonde hair , she was raised by strict parents in a family that " appeared normal on the surface " but was riddled with mental illness : her two older brothers and younger sister had all been treated for various depressive conditions ; some had been hospitalised . Ball considered herself " the lucky one " , having arrived at adulthood with barely a down day . That all changed at the age of 38 , however , with the birth of little Amy . <p> " It all began in hospital , when I could n't sleep , " Ball says . " I went home , and then , after six days without proper sleep , I began to feel euphorically happy , like I was n't part of my body , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to have strange thoughts - " Have I had my baby ? " , " Is that my baby ? " - and to feel that she possessed a psychic ability . Two nights later , she and her husband were at a work function when Ball complained of feeling " even more strange " . " Everything was slowing down , " she says . " I could n't talk properly and even walking got harder . " Returning home , Ball had her dinner fed to her and was put to bed , where she told her husband : " If that baby cries one more time , I 'll scream . " A moment later , the baby cried , and Ball screamed . And screamed , and screamed , and screamed . <p> After Ball had been shrieking , non-stop , for an hour , her husband called a friend , who happened to be a psychologist . The friend immediately called a mental health crisis team , but it was n't until midnight that a nurse arrived , whereupon she determined that Ball was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . <p> Memory bit ... GP Dr John McAuliffe has returned for further ECT treatments . Photo : Frances Andrijich <p> At the hospital , Ball became terrified of red and pink , colours that she suddenly associated with blood . " I could only talk to people who were dressed in blue , " she says . Staff took her to her room , but when it turned out to be painted pink , Ball became hysterical and had to be sedated . <p> After two weeks in hospital , Ball was released on a course of antipsychotic medication . But the worst was yet to come . Over the following weeks , then months , she found herself sucked into an obliterating vortex of delusions , paranoia and depression . Despite the antipsychotics , she still could n't sleep , and found it difficult to distinguish between dreams and reality . Then came the depression , an asphyxiating dread that proved similarly immune to medication . " I could n't function . I 'd drive to the shopping centre but then not know what to buy , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cry in the car , then forget to the shut the boot and drive off . " <p> Admitted to Hornsby Hospital , she became convinced the staff were filming her and so , feigning normality , she got herself released . At home , she received daily visits from a psychiatric nurse , and remained on medication . And yet she increasingly thought of nothing but death , of killing her daughter , her husband , herself . <p> Fearing for their safety , she sent her husband and Amy away , and after drafting up plans for suicide , made one last call to a friend . " He got me in to see a new psychiatrist , " Ball explains , " who had me admitted to St John of God Hospital , in Burwood . " <p> Doctors at the hospital told Ball she was a candidate for electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . The procedure would involve passing an electrical current through her brain in order to trigger a seizure . " They told me , ' There are negatives . ' I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With short-term memory ; you might not remember all your time here . ' And I said , ' What , and you mean that 's a bad thing ? ' " <p> Ball ca n't remember the treatments , which then , as now , were given under general anaesthetic . But she knows she only had two , and that after the first one , she felt better " overnight " . A few days later she received another dose , after which she felt better still . <p> " Before , my brain was like a locked computer , " she says . " The ECT rebooted it , so that suddenly the thoughts , instead of being too many , were coming at a speed I could cope with . " <p> Twelve years later , Ball is happy and whole . She has n't had any relapses and is not on medication . " It 's amazing , " she says . " Electroshock therapy saved my life . " <p> With the possible exception of lobotomies and blood-letting , it 's difficult to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of which brings to mind a punitive , almost medieval procedure involving straps and electrodes , a last-resort therapy administered in hospital basements where no-one can hear you scream . But as I recently discovered while watching ECT at a private hospital in Sydney , it 's not nearly that dramatic . <p> The patient , whom I 'll call Carol , is an elderly woman whose depression has not responded to medication . When I meet Carol , she is lying on a trolley in the treatment room , staring at the ceiling while her doctor , ECT specialist Professor Colleen Loo , attaches brain monitors to her temples . <p> For a procedure of such ghastly renown , ECT is remarkably quick . Carol is given a short-acting general anaesthetic , followed by a muscle-relaxant . Once she is unconscious , a mouthguard is slipped between her teeth . Loo then smears one end of the electrodes - two small plastic batons - with conductive gel , before placing them on Carol 's head : one on the right temple , one on the crown . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Carol clamps down on the mouthguard ; her head jerks back and her neck arches , but , thanks to the muscle relaxant , there is no grunting or thrashing about . All that remains is to monitor the resulting seizure , which in Carol 's case lasts for 40 seconds and is accompanied by nothing more than a twitch of her left foot . Within moments , the anaesthetic wears off , and Carol 's eyes are fluttering open . Barely 10 minutes have passed , and the procedure is over . <p> Loo is a tiny woman with a penchant for dark satin jackets and long work days . A psychiatrist and researcher at UNSW 's School of Psychiatry and the Black Dog Institute , she is , in her mid-40s , an international authority on ECT , which she has been carrying out for 20 years . <p> " When I first started giving ECT , it was much simpler , " Loo says . " We gave exactly the same electrical stimulus to all patients , for all treatments . But in the past 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the patient 's condition and seizure threshold , which means we can get the right balance between effectiveness and side effects . " <p> Those side effects - headaches , short-term memory loss and , in some cases , difficulty making new memories - do still occur . And yet ECT has come a long way , particularly in Australia , where it was first practised in 1941 at Adelaide 's Glenside Hospital , on a machine built by the Superintendent of Mental Institutions , Dr Hugh Birch , from " meagre technical information " and bits and pieces of electrical equipment . ( " Extreme caution was necessary , " Birch later wrote , " as the apparatus was constructed by myself , a mere amateur , and not by any electro-medical company . " ) <p> These days , ECT is considered , in the words of veteran clinician and Sydney University psychiatry lecturer , Dr Bill Lyndon , as " the most powerful antidepressant we have .

Not only that , but ECT is fast . " Medications can take a number of weeks to work , " Loo says . " With ECT , we are looking at half that time . " <p> The severely depressed can suffer not only morbid anxiety and suicidal melancholy - what writer William Styron described as a " horrified sense of ... interior doom " - but a near-paralysis known as psychomotor retardation ; patients stop eating and drinking , their bowels shut down , they ca n't talk , sleep or dress themselves . In these circumstances , talk therapies are next to useless ; nor do doctors have time to let medications kick in . ECT , then , can prove crucial . <p> But ECT is also used where patients with ongoing depression find medications ineffective , or find the side effects from those medications intolerable . Recently , Loo even gave ECT to a woman with catatonic schizophrenia : " Her condition was quite dangerous , " Loo says . " She was ' freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she went to the bathroom . She had not responded well to medication , but she did to ECT . " <p> Beyond the understandable reluctance of a patient to have someone electrify their cranium , scepticism about ECT can best be summed up in six words : One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Unflattering portrayals of the treatment have featured in print , most notably in the 1963 novel , The Bell Jar , by American poet Sylvia Plath , who received ECT in the early 1950s . ( " Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee , it shrilled , through an air crackling with blue light , " she wrote , " and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant . " ) <p> But it was the 1975 film that sealed the deal , with its scenes of Randle McMurphy ( Jack Nicholson ) being fried alive , his torso bucking , his face white-lipped and gasping . <p> Notwithstanding the fact that anaesthetic and muscle-relaxants have been used in shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " doing for ECT " , to quote British psychiatrist Dr Susan Benbow , " what Jaws did for sharks " . <p> In the decade following Cuckoo 's Nest , ECT virtually disappeared , before staging a quiet comeback in the 1990s . These days , despite public misgivings , ECT use continues to rise : almost 26,000 treatments were given in Australia in 2011 , up from 19,000 in 2007 . ( A course of ECT commonly consists of three treatments a week for three to four weeks . ) <p> And yet even advocates of ECT concede that a rise in treatments is not without costs . Mariana Oppermann is a 33-year-old lawyer who lives in Canberra . In 2008 , after repeated hospitalisations for depression and a suicide attempt , she was ordered to undergo several courses of ECT . ( This is not unusual : more than 200 people received involuntary ECT in NSW last year . ) Whatever initial benefits the ECT provided soon wore off , leaving Oppermann not only more depressed but cognitively " devastated " . Her memory evaporated ; for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the recommendation of her doctor , she returned to work , but was promptly asked to resign . " I could n't remember the law or my clients ; my boss said I was having difficulty using simple things around the office . " <p> What really hurts , she says , is the long-term impact . " I had ECT in 2008 , and I do n't remember almost any of the three jobs I had before that . I do n't remember my legal training - a $15,000 post-grad qualification that I do n't remember doing ! I have first-class honours in law , but I ca n't remember what the honours were about . " <p> Old friends come up and say hello , but Oppermann ca n't remember them . " I have holidays that I 've been on that I ca n't remember : I see photos of them , but to me it looks like I was Photoshopped into them . I 've tried returning to those places to try to trigger memories , but it does n't really work . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oppermann remembers flavours well , and some friends better than others . " I can even draw you a map of an office I had in a job I have no memory of having . " While she accepts that ECT has a place - " I know people who 've had good experiences with it " - Oppermann believes that doctors routinely downplay the negatives while overstating the positives . <p> " My memory loss from ECT is relatively severe , " Perth GP Dr John McAuliffe says . " But I 've learnt some techniques , like ' memory aids ' , to help me get back to work faster . " <p> In the early 1990s , McAuliffe , who is now 50 , was married with two young children . He was working as a GP in Perth , but also owned several medical centres and was , in his spare time , playing the sharemarket . When a trade went bad , however , McAuliffe lost $200,000 in a single day . Panicked , he set about selling the medical centres to cover the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling apart . " <p> McAuliffe had always been a " big character " , but the stress now tipped him into a full-blown manic episode , which culminated with him walking onto the tarmac at Perth International Airport and getting arrested by federal police . " It was my 31st birthday , " he says , " and I got it into my head that I 'd fly away on holiday . " <p> After receiving ECT at Joondalup Private Hospital , McAuliffe recovered . He has had it several times since , the last being a year ago . " I still work as a GP , " he says . " I was n't deregistered , because the medical board understands that I 'm a responsible doctor who seeks treatment when I 'm unwell . " <p> Memory is " an issue " for the first couple of weeks after treatment , so McAuliffe keeps particularly detailed records of case histories and conditions . " I also tell all my patients that I have bipolar . Some people do n't come back , but for every one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and like the frankness . It helps them relax . " <p> The therapeutic benefits of seizures have been known for millennia , with Hippocrates recognising as far back as the 5th century BC that malarial convulsions could cure the insane . But the first researcher to systematically pursue the link between fever seizures and mental illness was the Austrian professor ( and later enthusiastic Nazi ) Julius Wagner-Jauregg . <p> As a young doctor in the 1880s , Wagner-Jauregg observed how mental patients improved after surviving a severe fever . Early attempts to induce fever by infecting patients with typhoid proved unsuccessful . He kept going , however , and in 1917 took the radical step of injecting malaria-infected blood into nine men who were already suffering from chronic paresis , or syphilitic madness . The results - complete recovery in four patients and an improvement in two - led to a malaria treatment for paresis that eventually won Wagner-Jauregg the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1927 . <p> By this time , other doctors were experimenting with seizures ; some used insulin overdoses , others used chemicals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cerletti suggested electricity . Even by the standards of the day , zapping mentally ill patients was highly experimental : curious physicians at Cerletti 's clinic in Rome would be summoned bedside to witness the treatments by two short blasts of a trumpet . <p> But while ECT proved spectacularly successful in relieving depression , it was physically brutal , sometimes resulting in shattered teeth , broken backs and bone fractures . To counter this , doctors restrained their patients with bed sheets or weighed them down with sandbags , or even , in the 1940s , paralysed them with curare , the toxin used by Amazonian tribes on their blowpipe darts . <p> These days , there are no sheets or curare , and definitely no more trumpets . EEG monitoring , anaesthetics , synthetic muscle relaxants and more sophisticated delivery systems have transformed the procedure into something that is surpassingly mundane and relatively safe . One of the biggest changes in the past five years has been the introduction of ultrabrief pulsewidth ECT , which uses one-third the normal current . ( " It 's gentler , " Loo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) <p> Yet doctors remain unable to explain exactly how these treatments work . It 's clear that ECT boosts blood flow to the brain , but the most profound changes occur on a nerve-cell level . By stimulating the release of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor , ECT not only promotes the birth of new neurons but aids neuronal regrowth , restoring to the brain cells the myriad tree-like projections that shrink back and wither in depressed people . Whether it is the electricity or the seizure that does this , nobody can say , a fact that critics are quick to pounce on . <p> " We know a lot about how it works , " Loo says . " But it 's like a billion-piece jigsaw puzzle . Just because I ca n't tell you where every single piece goes does n't mean the treatment is n't valid . " <p> Besides , she says , no-one understands exactly how a general anaesthetic works , but " you would n't have your leg amputated without one " . <p> At a residential psychiatric clinic in Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month-long course of ECT .

##419950 <p> Last week , the United States Census Bureau released its Current Population Survey , documenting the economic wellbeing and access to health insurance of American families . The new data reveal that a shocking number of people living in the world 's richest country are living in poverty ( an annual income of less than $US22,000 ( $A23,250 ) for a family of four ) . <p> As the recession has hit hard and the social welfare safety nets have eroded , the number of American poor has soared to the highest level in 50 years . In 2009 , nearly 44million Americans , including 15.5million children , were living in poverty that 's one-in-seven Americans and one-in-five children . The burden is borne disproportionately by minorities , especially women ; one quarter of all blacks and Hispanics are poor . <p> In 2009 alone , four million Americans fell into poverty . The situation might have been much worse , if there had not been a number of progressive policies put in place by the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress in the face of enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , which the Congressional Budget Office estimates has saved or created up to 3.3million jobs , and the expansion of tax credits , additional food stamp assistance and emergency unemployment compensation which together have kept more than 6million Americans out of poverty . In addition , Social Security benefits helped keep <p> 13million elderly Americans from falling below the poverty line . The implications of these shocking figures are substantial . For example , more than 50million Americans are now without any form of health insurance and some 2.5million people are homeless . Up-to-date Australian statistics on poverty are hard to find . Although the US publishes annual data on poverty , there is no official measurement in Australia . <p> Estimates are made from time to time by some researchers who study social policy issues . There are a number of ways that poverty can be measured ; in Australia this is generally done by applying the updated indicators established by the Henderson poverty inquiry in 1973 . This is now equivalent to an annual income , including housing , of $39,213 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate that following the failure of any government to address the 1987 election commitment made by Bob Hawke that by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty bureaucratic decisions were made to ensure that the full scope of the problem would not be recognised . The Australian Council of Social Services estimated that about 2.2million people , or 11per cent of Australians , were living in poverty in 2006 , a figure that had increased substantially over the previous decade , up from 7.6 per cent in 1994 . <p> At the time Hawke made his infamous promise , the number of Australian children living in poverty was estimated at 580,000 today it could be 50per cent higher . A 2007 OECD ( Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ) report card which looked at the percentage of children growing up in relative poverty defined as living in a household where the equivalent income is less than 50per cent of the national median for 24 OECD countries had Australia ranked 11th . <p> It is impossible to compare the American and Australian poverty levels , neither of which takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cost of living . But it is also impossible to ignore the increasing financial inequality in both countries , and the failure of all political parties to shift tackling poverty and its ramifications to the centre of the political and policy debate . Indeed , at least in Australia , the biggest policy arguments seem to be around the accuracy of the estimates of poverty rather than what can be done to address them . <p> Regardless of how poverty is measured despite the resilience of the Australian economy and a buoyant employment market the fact remains that many Australians do not have enough income to cover the necessities of life such as food , secure housing , education and health care . That inevitably means that they do not get to share in the most iconic Australian value a fair go . <p> Dr Lesley Russell is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington DC .

##420452 <p> There are two species , or kinds , of camel . The Dromedary has one hump on its back , and the Bactrian has two humps . <p> Some people say that camels are bad-tempered animals that spit and kick . However , they are actually quite good-tempered , patient and clever . <p> Body Camels come in every shade of brown , from cream to almost black . <p> A camel 's ears are small , but it can hear very well . The ears are lined with fur to keep out sand and dust . Its nostrils are slits that close up in a sandstorm to keep the sand from blowing into its nose . <p> Its eyes are large , protected by a double row of long curly eyelashes that also help keep out sand and dust . Thick eyebrows shield the eyes from the desert sun . <p> Camels have broad , flat , leathery feet with two toes on each foot . When the camel places its foot on the ground the pads spread , preventing the foot from sinking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side of its body , then both feet on the other . <p> Camels do not pant , and they perspire very little . Unlike other animals , a camel only sweats when the temperature is very high , so that it keeps moisture inside its body . They pass very little moisture from their bodies for that reason . <p> All camels moult ( shed their fur ) in spring and have grown a new coat by autumn . <p> Thick patches of dry skin appear on a camel 's chest and knee joints when the animal reaches five months of age . These leathery patches help support the animal 's body weight when kneeling , resting and rising . <p> A fully-grown adult camel stands 1.85m at the shoulder and is about 2.15m high at the hump . <p> Food A camel can go 5-7 days with little or no food and water . The fat inside the hump is used to keep the animal going when there is no food or water . Camels in the wild eat whatever they can find , including even leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cycle After mating with a male ( bull ) camel , a female ( cow ) is pregnant for 13 months . A camel cow usually gives birth to a single calf , and sometimes twins . The calves walk within hours of birth . She feeds her calf milk . Calves stay close to their mothers until they are about five years old . The normal life span of a camel is 40 years . <p> History Camels were used for centuries to carry people and heavy loads across the deserts of Africa , the Middle East and parts of Asia . <p> As well as being transport , the camel supplied the desert people with shade , milk , meat , wool and hides . <p> Today , camels are used for racing .

##425450 <p> NOTE : This species was formerly known on the Forum as Sakishimaia kondoi <p> The surface of the animal is a dull and opaque red . The rhinophores , latero-dorsal appendages , gills , oral shield and foot sole are similar in colour to the body , though the dorsal appendages are whitish over the proximal half of their length . The body is elongated and limaciform , with no pallial margin . There are 4 dorso-lateral appendages along each side of the dorsum , with a single appendage appearing in the midline in front of the gills . Hamatani considers the 6 appendages behind the rhinophores to be different from the anterior pair which he calls ' oral tentacles ' . Although they may function as anterior tentacles they do not arise from the oral shield and I would consider them to be the anterior-most of the dorso-lateral appendages .

##429150 , living in harmony with our planet 's ecosystems . Read more ... <h> Heresy at the Herald : capitalism may not be perfect <p> By Allen Myers <p> It was almost unheard of . Last month , a Fairfax business writer hinted that capitalism - at least , the Australian capitalism that we all know and love - might be not quite perfect . Something , Stuart Washington wrote on February 7 , is " broken " in Australia 's " pricing system " , and " I believe failures in pricing are posing grave dangers to what we know as capitalism " . <p> Washington 's article , which attracted considerable on-line comment on the Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne Age home pages , was occasioned , he wrote , by an electric fan from China that was on sale at Bunnings for only $8 . Given the costs of raw materials , labour , packaging , shipping , wholesaling , retailing , advertising , taxes and so on , Washington wrote that it was difficult to see how anyone could make a profit from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss leader " for Bunnings - intended , not to make a profit , but to get customers in - " there are enough other examples of absurdly low prices around the place " to justify his fears . <h> ' Wrong ' prices <p> If profits are possible on the fan , Washington argued , it must be because " certain inputs are not being accurately priced " . Explicitly leaving aside the cost of labour , i.e. exploitation , " for another day " ( do n't hold your breath ) and after blaming the global financial crisis on mistaken " pricing " of money ( the interest rate ) Washington tipped his hat to environmental concerns : " our current economics fail us " on resource depletion and environmental impacts . The overall impression left is that climate change and most economic problems can be solved by a little judicious tinkering with " the pricing system " . <p> Would n't it be nice if it were true ? But how do you reform a " system " when it does n't really exist ? The owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - set prices as high as they think they can get away with .

##460051 <h> About Phuket <p> Travelers to Thailand should add the sights and sounds of Phuket Island to their itinerary . This magical island paradise with shimmering white sand beaches , deep blue waters , and lush , green jungles is a major tourist destination attracting the rich and famous and the everyday traveler alike . <p> Phuket Island ( pronounced " Pu-ket " - the ' h ' is silent ) is located just off Thailand 's south western coast and surrounded by the crystal-clear , topaz waters of the Andaman Sea . Roughly the size of Singapore - about 30 miles ( 48.7 km ) long and 13 miles ( 21.3 km ) wide - the island is Thailand 's largest and is connected to the mainland by two bridges . <p> Phuket 's wealth largely originated from tin and rubber , and the island was once used within a major trade route between India and China for Arabian , French , Portuguese , Dutch and English merchants . Today , tin mining has largely ceased , and Phuket 's primary source of income is from tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide . <h> Phuket in a nutshell <p> The island 's name is derived from a Malay word meaning " hill " , which is exactly what the island looks like from a distance : a majestic emerald vista rising out of the sea . About 70% of Phuket 's area is covered with mountains , stretching from north to south along the western side of the island . Forests , rubber and palm oil plantations still cover a large part of the island , and a significant area of rainforest and coastline is nationally protected for its native flora and fauna . <p> Throughout the course of history the spirit of the people has n't wavered , although the island 's name has changed and the island 's beauty has been remodeled by mother nature . Tourism has gained strength since rebuilding from the 2004 Tsunami , with Phuket now one of the top vacation destinations in the world . <h> Island transportation <p> Air travelers to Phuket will arrive at the Phuket International Airport in the island 's northern area . For those arriving from the mainland , rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via " songthaews " , a passenger pick-up vehicle , is popular . Take a songthaew , motorbike taxi , or bus to the island 's popular , stunning white sand beaches , where they carve pristine inlets along the west coast for swimming or soaking up the sun . Or , for a quieter excursion , the more solitary east coast features tropical , tangled mangroves . <h> What to do in Phuket <p> Visitors to Phuket will enjoy breathtaking vistas only thought possible on a Hollywood film set , and an activity list that ranges from exploring temples , fishing , bicycling , and rock climbing , to seakayaking , canoeing , or snorkeling . Adventurous travelers can drink in the island 's picturesque beauty on horseback -- or even on the back of an elephant for an authentically Thai Phuket experience . <h> Beaches of Phuket <p> The beaches of Phuket are legendary , attracting visitors of every age from around the world . Perhaps the most famous is the wide , sandy strip at Patong , a must-see wild and crazy city for visitors looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something a little quieter , beaches in the north like Hat Nai Thon to Hat Kamala , or Karon , Kata , Nai Han , and Rawai in the south , will have the more tranquil , laid-back style you 're seeking . <h> The Cities of Phuket <p> Phuket Province 's territory is the entire Island , and the terms are used interchangeably . Patong is the island 's main center for tourism , attracting visitors from around the world to Phuket 's west coast . The province 's capital city is Phuket Town , located in the island 's southeast . <h> Phuket Town <p> Back in the day , Phuket Town -- now called Phuket City - attracted greedy merchants and businesspeople from the Arabian Peninsula , China , India , and Portugal . As a result , Phuket Town is a melting pot of cultural influences . Travelers to the city will enjoy exotic Sino-Portuguese Architecture as they stroll along Ths Thalang , Dibuk , Yaowarat , Ranong , Phang-Nga , Rasada , and Krabi . And , as it seems with everywhere you 'll go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or night to keep any visitor 's itinerary full . <h> Patong <p> Also known as Patong Beach , Patong has something for everyone . From world-class snorkeling and diving to exotic nightlife where just about anything goes , visitors will no doubt find exactly what they 're looking for . During the day , laze on the shimmering white , kilometers-long beach and wiggle your toes in the surf that 's only a hop , skip and a jump away . Shop-til-you-drop at the market , or enjoy a leisurely lunch at one of Patong 's fine restaurants , or even a hot tin street shack . <p> At night , all bets are off with adult entertainment even Vegas is jealous of , with go-go bars , discotheques and cabarets with their ladyboy dancers pulsating and grinding their way well into the wee morning hours . <h> Temples and architecture <p> If exploring temples and admiring architecture is more your cup of joe , Phuket has a diverse collection of temples , ruins and restored buildings that are awe-inspiring to any traveler .

##464251 <h> A Story of the Days to Come <h> 3 . The Ways of the City <p> P ROMINENT if not paramount among world-changing inventions in the history of man is that series of contrivances in locomotion that began with the railway and ended for a century or more with the motor and the patent road . That these contrivances , together with the device of limited liability joint stock companies and the supersession of agricultural labourers by skilled men with ingenious machinery , would necessarily concentrate mankind in cities of unparalleled magnitude and work an entire revolution in human life , became after the event , a thing so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated . Yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the miseries such a revolution might entail does not appear even to have been suggested ; and the idea that moral prohibitions and sanctions , the privileges and concessions , the conception of property and responsibility , of comfort and beauty , that had rendered the mainly agricultural states of the past prosperous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and novel stimulations , never seems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind . That a citizen , kindly and fair in his ordinary life , could as a shareholder become almost murderously greedy ; that commercial methods that were reasonable and honourable on the old-fashioned countryside , should on an enlarged scale be deadly and overwhelming ; that ancient charity was modern pauperisation , and ancient employment modern sweating ; that in fact , a revision and enlargement of the duties and rights of man had become urgently necessary , were things it could not entertain , nourished as it was on an archaic system of education and profoundly retrospective and legal in all its habits of thought . It was known that the accumulation of men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of pestilence ; there was an energetic development of sanitation ; but that the diseases of gambling and usury , of luxury and tyranny should become endemic , and produce horrible consequences was beyond the scope of nineteenth-century thought . And so , as if it were some inorganic process , practically unhindered by the creative will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark the twenty-first century accomplished itself . <p> The new society was divided into three main classes . At the summit slumbered the property owner , enormously rich by accident rather than design , potent save for the will and aim , the last avatar of Hamlet in the world . Below was the enormous multitude of workers employed by the gigantic companies that monopolised control ; and between these two the dwindling middle class , officials of innumerable sorts , foreman , managers , the medical , legal , artistic , and scholastic classes , and the minor rich , a middle class whose members led a life of insecure luxury and precarious speculation amidst the movements of the great managers . <p> Already the love story and the marrying of two persons of middle class have been told : how they overcame the obstacles between them , and how they tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on the countryside and came back speedily enough into the city of London . Denton had no means , so Elizabeth borrowed money on the securities that her father Mwres held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest she paid was of course high , because of the uncertainty of her security , and the arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy and optimistic . Yet they had very glorious times after that return . They determined they would not go to a Pleasure city nor waste their days rushing through the air from one part of the world to the other , for in spite of one disillusionment , their tastes were still old-fashioned . They furnished their little room with quaint old Victorian furniture , and found a shop on the forty-second floor in Seventh Way where printed books of the old sort were still to be bought . It was their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing phonographs . And when presently there came a sweet little girl , to unite them further if it were possible , Elizabeth would not send it to a Creche , as the custom was , but insisted on nursing it at home . The rent of their apartments was raised on account of this singular proceeding , but that they did not mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of age , and Denton had a business interview with her father that was not agreeable . An exceedingly disagreeable interview with their money-lender followed , from which he brought home a white face . On his return Elizabeth had to tell of a new and marvellous intonation of " Goo " that their daughter had devised , but Denton was inattentive . In the midst , just as she was at the cream of her description , he interrupted . " How much money do you think we have left , now that everything is settled ? " <p> She stared and stopped her appreciative swaying of the Goo genius that had accompanied her description . <p> " You do n't mean . . . . ? <p> " Yes , " he answered . " Ever so much . We have been wild . It 's the interest . Or something . And the shares you had , slumped . Your father did not mind . Said it was not his business , after what had happened . He 's going to marry again . . . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only a thousand ? " <p> " Only a thousand . " <p> And Elizabeth sat down . For a moment she regarded him with a white face , then her eyes went about the quaint , old-fashioned room , with its middle Victorian furniture and genuine oleographs , and rested at last on the little lump of humanity within her arms . <p> Denton glanced at her and stood downcast . Then he swung round on his heel and walked up and down very rapidly . <p> " I must get something to do , " he broke out presently . " I am an idle scoundrel . I ought to have thought of this before . I have been a selfish fool . I wanted to be with you all day . . . . " <p> He stopped , looking at her white face . Suddenly he came and kissed her and the little face that nestled against her breast . <p> " It 's all right , dear , " he said , standing over her ; " you wo n't be lonely now -- now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can soon get something to do , you know . Soon . . . Easily . . . It 's only a shock at first . But it will come all right . It 's only to come right . I will go out again as soon as I have rested , and find what can be done . For the present it 's hard to think of anything . . . . " <p> " It would be hard to leave these rooms , " said Elizabeth ; " but -- " <p> " There wo n't be any need of that -- trust me . " <p> " They are expensive . " <p> Denton waved that aside . He began talking of the work he could do . He was not very explicit what it would be ; but he was quite sure that there was something to keep them comfortably in the happy middle class , whose way of life was the only one they knew . <p> " There are three-and-thirty million people in London , " he said ; " some of them must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The trouble is . . . Well -- Bindon , that brown little old man your father wanted you to marry . He 's an important person . . . I ca n't go back to my flying-stage work , because he is now a Commissioner of the Flying Stage Clerks . " <p> " I did n't know that , " said Elizabeth . <p> " He was made that in the last few weeks . . . or things would be easy enough , for they liked me on the flying stage . But there 's dozens of other things to be done -- dozens . Do n't you worry dear . I 'll rest a little while , and then we 'll dine , and then I 'll start on my rounds . I know lots of people -- lots . " <p> So they rested , and then they went to the public dining-room and dined , and then he started on his search for employment . But they soon realised that in the matter of one convenience the world was just as badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice , secure , honourable , remunerative employment , leaving ample leisure for the private life , and demanding no special ability , no violent exertion nor risk , and no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment . He evolved a number of brilliant projects , and spent many days hurrying from one part of the enormous city to another in search of influential friends ; and all his influential friends were glad to see him , and very sanguine until it came to definite proposals , and then they became guarded and vague . He would part with them coldly , and think over their behaviour , and get irritated on his way back , and stop at some telephone office and spend money on an animated but unprofitable quarrel . And as the days passed , he got so worried and irritated , that even to seem kind and careless before Elizabeth cost him an effort -- as she , being a loving woman , perceived very clearly . <p> After an extremely complex preface one day , she helped him out with a painful suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair when it came to selling all their joyfully bought early Victorian treasures , their quaint objects of art , their antimacassars , bead mats , repp curtains , veneered furniture , gold-framed steel engravings and pencil drawings , wax flowers under shades , stuffed birds , and all sorts of choice old things ; but it was she who made the proposal . The sacrifice seemed to fill her with pleasure , and so did the idea of shifting to apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another hotel . " So long as Dings is with us , nothing matters , " she said . " It 's all experience . " So he kissed her , said she was braver than when she fought the sheep-dogs , called her Boadicea , and abstained very carefully from reminding her that they would have to pay a considerably higher rent on account of the little voice with which Dings greeted the perpetual uproar of the city . <p> His idea had been to get Elizabeth out of the way when it came to selling the absurd furniture about which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sale it was Elizabeth who haggled with the dealer while Denton went about the running ways of the city , white and sick with sorrow and fear of what was still to come . When they moved into their sparsely furnished pink-and-white apartments in a cheap hotel , there came an outbreak of furious energy on his part , and then nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked at home . Through those days Elizabeth shone like a star , and at the end Denton 's misery found a vent in tears . And then he went out into the city ways again , and -- to his utter amazement -- found some work to do . <p> His standard of employment had fallen steadily until at last it had reached the lowest level of independent workers . At first he had aspired to some high official position in great Flying or Windvane or Water Companies , or to an appointment on one of the General Intelligence Organisations that had replaced newspapers , or to some professional partnership , but those were the dreams of the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred gold " lions " out of Elizabeth 's thousand had vanished one evening in the share market . Now he was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the position of salesman to the Suzannah Hat Syndicate , a Syndicate dealing in ladies ' caps , hair decorations , and hats -- for though the city was completely covered in , ladies still wore extremely elaborate and beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public worship . <p> It would have been amusing if one could have confronted a Regent Street shopkeeper of the nineteenth century with the development of his establishment in which Denton 's duties lay . Nineteenth Way was still sometimes called Regent Street , but it was now a street of moving platforms and nearly eight hundred feet wide . The middle space was immovable and gave access by staircases descending into subterranean ways to the houses on either side . Right and left were an ascending series of continuous platforms each of which travelled about five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it , so that one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer way and so go about the city . The establishment of the Suzannah Hat Syndicate projected a vast facade upon the outer way , sending out overhead at either end an overlapping series of huge white glass screens , on which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-known beautiful living women wearing novelties in hats were thrown . A dense crowd was always collected in the stationary central way watching a vast kinematograph which displayed the changing fashion . The whole front of the building was in perpetual chromatic change , and all down the facade -- four hundred feet it measured -- and all across the street of moving ways , laced and winked and glittered in a thousand varieties of colour and lettering the inscription -- <p> Suzanna ! ' Ets ! Suzanna ! ' Ets ! <p> A Broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all conversation in the moving way and roared " hats " at the passer-by , while far down the street and up , other batteries counselled the public to " walk down for Suzannah , " and queried , " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf -- and deafness was not uncommon in London of that age , inscriptions of all sizes were thrown from the roof above upon the moving platforms themselves , and on one 's hand or on the bald head of the man before one , or on a lady 's shoulders , or in a sudden jet of flame before one 's feet , the moving fingers wrote in unanticipated letters of fire " ' ets r chip t'de , " or simply " ' ets . " And spite of all these efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived , so trained became one 's eyes and ears to ignore all sorts of advertisement , that many a citizen had passed that place thousands of times and was still unaware of the existence of the Suzannah Hat Syndicate . <p> To enter the building one descended the staircase in the middle way and walked through a public passage in which pretty girls promenaded , girls who were willing to wear a ticked hat for a small fee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon pedestals , and from this one passed through a cash office to an interminable series of little rooms , each room with its salesman , its three or four hats and pins , its mirrors , its kinematographs , telephones and hat slides in communication with the central depot , its comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments . A salesman in such an apartment did Denton now become . It was his business to attend to any of the incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop with him , to behave as winningly as possible , to offer refreshment , to converse on any topic the possible customer chose , and to guide the conversation dexterously but not insistently towards hats . He was to suggest trying on various types of hat and to show by his manner and bearing , but without any coarse flattery , the enhanced impression made by the hats he wished to sell . He had several mirrors , adapted by various subtleties of curvature and tint to different types of face and complexion , and much depended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these curious and not very congenial duties with a good will and energy that would have amazed him a year before ; but all to no purpose . The Senior Manageress , who had selected him for appointment and conferred various small marks of favour upon him , suddenly changed in her manner , declared for no assignable cause that he was stupid , and dismissed him at the end of six weeks of salesmanship . So Denton had to resume his ineffectual search for employment . <p> This second search did not last very long . Their money was at the ebb . To eke it out a little longer they resolved to part with their darling Dings , and took that small person to one of the public creches that abounded in the city . That was the common use of the time . The industrial emancipation of women , the correlated disorganisation of the secluded " home , " had rendered creches a necessity for all but very rich and exceptionally-minded people . Therein children encountered hygienic and educational advantages impossible without such organisation . Creches were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Labour Company , were children were taken on credit , to be redeemed in labour as they grew up . <p> But both Denton and Elizabeth being , as I have explained , strange old-fashioned young people , full of nineteenth-century ideas , hated these convenient creches exceedingly and at last took their little daughter to one with extreme reluctance . They were received by a motherly person in a uniform who was very brisk and prompt in her manner until Elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her child . The motherly person , after a brief astonishment at this unusual emotion , changed suddenly into a creature of hope and comfort , and so won Elizabeth 's gratitude for life . They were conducted into a vast room presided over by several nurses and with hundreds of two-year-old girls grouped about the toy-covered floor . This was the Two-year-old Room . Two nurses came forward , and Elizabeth watched their bearing towards Dings with jealous eyes . They were kind -- it was clear they felt kind , and yet . . . . <p> Presently it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily established in a corner , sitting on the floor with her arms filled , and herself , indeed , for the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of toys . She seemed careless of all human relationships as her parents receded . <p> They were forbidden to upset her by saying good-bye . <p> At the door Elizabeth glanced back for the last time , and behold ! Dings had dropped her new wealth and was standing with a dubious face . Suddenly Elizabeth gasped , and the motherly nurse pushed her forward and closed the door . <p> " You can come again soon , dear , " she said , with unexpected tenderness in her eyes . For a moment Elizabeth stared at her with a blank face . " You can come again soon , " repeated the nurse . Then with a swift transition Elizabeth was weeping in the nurse 's arms . So it was that Denton 's heart was won also . <p> And three weeks after our young people were absolutely penniless , and only one way lay open . They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent was a week overdue their few remaining possessions were seized , and with scant courtesy they were shown the way out of the hotel . Elizabeth walked along the passage towards the staircase that ascended to the motionless middle way , too dulled by misery to think . Denton stopped behind to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with the hotel porter , and then came hurrying after her , flushed and hot . He slackened his pace as he overtook her , and together they ascended to the middle way in silence . There they found two seats vacant and sat down . <p> " We need not go there -- yet ? " said Elizabeth . <p> " No -- not till we are hungry , " said Denton . <p> They said no more . <p> Elizabeth 's eyes sought a resting-place and found none . To the right roared the eastward ways , to the left the ways in the opposite direction , swarming with people . Backwards and forwards along a cable overhead rushed a string of gesticulating men , dressed like clowns , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that altogether they spelt out : <p> " Purkinje 's Digestive Pills . " <p> An anaemic little woman in horrible coarse blue canvas pointed a little girl to one of this string hurrying advertisements . <p> " Look ! " said the anaemic women : " There 's yer father . " <p> " Which ? " said the little girl . <p> " ' Im wiv his nose coloured red , " said the anaemic woman . <p> The little girl began to cry , and even Elizabeth could have cried too . <p> " Ai n't ' e kickin ' ' is legs -- ! Just ! " said the anaemic woman in the blue , trying to make things bright again . " Looky -- now ! " <p> On the facade to the right a huge intensely bright disc of weird colour span incessantly , and letters of fire that came and went spelt out -- <p> " Does This Make You Giddy ? " <p> Then a pause , followed by -- <p> " Take A Purkinje 's Digestive Pill . " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swagger Literature , put your telephone on to Bruggles , the Greatest Author of All Time . The Greatest Thinker of all time . Teaches you Morals up to your Scalp ! The very image of Socrates , except the back of his head , which is like Shakespeare . He has six toes , dresses in red , and never cleans his teeth . Hear Him ! " <p> Denton 's voice became audible in a gap in the uproar . " I never ought to have married you , " he was saying . " I have wasted your money , ruined you , brought you to misery . I am a scoundrel . . . Oh , this accursed world ! " <p> She tried to speak , and for some moments could not . She grasped his hand . " No , " she said at last . A half-formed desire suddenly became determination . She stood up . " Will you come ? " <p> He rose also . " We need not go there yet . " <p> " Not that . But I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . You know ? The little seat . " <p> He hesitated . " Can you ? " he said , doubtfully . <p> " Must , " she answered . <p> He hesitated still for a moment , then moved to obey her will . <p> And so it was they spent their last half-day of freedom out under the open air in the little seat under the flying stages where they had been wont to meet five short years ago . There she told him , what she could not tell him in the tumultuous public ways , that she did not repent even now of their marriage -- that whatever discomfort and misery life still had for them , she was content with things that had been . The weather was kind to them , the seat was sunlit and warm , and overhead the shining aeroplanes went and came . <p> At last towards sunsetting their time was at an end , and they made their vows to one another and clasped hands , and then rose up and went back into the ways of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . Soon they came to one of the pale blue signs that marked a Labour Company Bureau . For a space they stood in the middle way regarding this and at last descended , and entered the waiting-room . <p> The Labour Company had originally been a charitable organisation ; its aim was to supply food , shelter , and work to all comers . This it was bound to do by the conditions of its incorporation , and it was also bound to supply food and shelter and medical attendance to all incapable of work who chose to demand its aid . In exchange these incapables paid labour notes , which they had to redeem upon recovery . They signed these labour notes with thumb-marks , which were photographed and indexed in such a way that this world-wide Labour Company could identify any one of its two or three hundred million clients at the cost of an hour 's inquiry . The day 's labour was defined as two spells in a treadmill used in generating electrical force , or its equivalent , and its due performance could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it advisable to add to its statutory obligations of food and shelter a few pence a day as an inducement to effort ; and its enterprise had not only abolished pauperisation altogether , but supplied practically all but the very highest and most responsible labour throughout the world . Nearly a third of the population of the world were its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave . <p> In this practical , unsentimental way the problem of the unemployed had been most satisfactorily met and overcome . No one starved in the public ways , and no rags , no costume less sanitary and sufficient than the Labour Company 's hygienic but inelegant blue canvas , pained the eye throughout the whole world . It was the constant theme of the phonographic newspapers how much the world had progressed since nineteenth-century days , when the bodies of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead of starvation were , they alleged , a common feature in all the busier streets . <p> Denton and Elizabeth sat apart in the waiting-room until their turn came . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four young people gaudily dressed made up for the quietude of their companions . They were life clients of the Company , born in the Company 's creche and destined to die in its hospital , and they had been out for a spree with some shillings or so , of extra pay . They talked vociferously in a later development of the Cockney dialect , manifestly very proud of themselves . <p> Elizabeth 's eyes went from these to the less assertive figures . One seemed exceptionally pitiful to her . It was a women of perhaps forty-five , with gold-stained hair and a painted face , down which abundant tears had trickled ; she had a pinched nose , hungry eyes , lean hands and shoulders , and her dusty worn-out finery told the story of her life . Another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects -- for religion was now also a business , and had its ups and downs . And besides him a sickly , dissipated-looking boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- for the Company preferred women in this capacity -- and found she possessed an energetic face , a contemptuous manner , and a particularly unpleasant voice . They were given various cheques , including one to certify that they need not have their heads cropped ; and when they had given their thumb-marks , learnt the number corresponding thereunto , and exchanged their shabby middle-class clothes for duly numbered canvas suits , they repaired to the huge plain dining-room for their first meal under these new conditions . Afterwards they were to return to her for instructions about their work . <p> When they had made the exchange of their clothing Elizabeth did not seem able to look at Denton at first ; but he looked at her , and saw with astonishment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful . And then their soup and bread came sliding on its little rail down the long table towards them and stopped with a jerk , and he forgot the matter . For they had , had no proper meal for three days . <p> After they had dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to say ; and presently they got up and went back to the manageress to learn what they had to do . <p> The manageress referred to a tablet . " Y'r rooms wo n't be here ; it 'll be in the Highbury Ward , ninety-seventh way , number two thousand and seventeen . Better make a note of it on y'r card . You , nought nought nought , type seven , sixty-four , b.c.d. , gamma forty-one , female ; you ' ave to go to the Metal-beating Company , and try that for a day -- fourpence bonus if ye 're satisfactory ; and you , nought seven one , type four , seven hundred and nine , g.f.b. , pi five and ninety , male ; you ' ave to go to the Photographic Company on Eighty-first way , and learn something or other -- I do n't know -- thrippence . ' Ere 's y'r cards . That 's all . Next ! What ? Did n't catch it all ? Lor ! So , suppose I must go over it all again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ! One 'd think these things did n't matter . " <p> Their ways to their work lay together for a time . And now they found they could talk . Curiously enough , the worst of their depression seemed over now that they had actually donned the blue . Denton could talk with interest even of the work that lay before them . " Whatever it is , " he said , " it ca n't be so hateful as that hat shop . And after we have paid for Dings , we shall still have a whole penny a day between us even now . Afterwards -- we may improve -- , get more money . " <p> Elizabeth was less inclined to speech . " I wonder why work should seem so hateful , " she said . <p> " It 's odd , " said Denton . " I suppose it would n't be if it were not the thought of being ordered about . . . I hope we shall have decent managers . " <p> Elizabeth did not answer . She was not thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . <p> " Of course , " she said presently , " we have been using up work all our lives . It 's only fair -- " <p> She stopped . It was too intricate . <p> " We paid for it , " said Denton , for at that time he had not troubled himself about these complicated things . " We did nothing -- and yet we paid for it . That 's what I can not understand . " <p> " Perhaps we are paying , " said Elizabeth presently -- for her theology was old-fashioned and simple . <p> Presently it was time for them to part , and each went to the appointed work . Denton 's was to mind a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost an intelligent thing . This press worked by the sea-water that was destined finally to flush the city drains -- for the world had long since abandoned the folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers . This water was brought close to the eastward edge of the city by a huge canal , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level of four hundred feet above the sea , from which it spread by a billion arterial branches over the city . Thence it poured down , cleansing , sluicing , working machinery of all sorts , through an infinite variety of capillary channels into the great drains , the cloacae maximae , and so carried the sewage out to the agricultural areas that surrounded London on every side . <p> The press was employed in one of the processes of the photographic manufacture , but the nature of the process it did not concern Denton to understand . The most salient fact to his mind was that it had to be conducted in ruby light , and as a consequence the room in which he worked was lit by one coloured globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination about the room . In the darkest corner stood the press whose servant Denton had now become ; it was a huge , dim , glittering thing with a projecting hood that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head , and squatting like some metal Buddha in this weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denton in certain moods almost as if this must needs be the obscure idol to which humanity in some strange aberration had offered up his life . His duties had a varied monotony . Such items as the following will convey an idea of the service of the press . The thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things went well ; but if the paste that came pouring through a feeder from another room and which it was perpetually compressing into thin plates , changed in quality the rhythm of its click altered and Denton hastened to make certain adjustments . The slightest delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of one or more of his daily pence . If the supply of paste waned -- there were hand processes of a peculiar sort involved in its preparation , and sometimes the workers had convulsions which deranged their output -- Denton had to throw the press out of gear . In the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial attentions entailed , painful because of the incessant effort its absence of natural interest required , Denton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an occasional visit from the manager , a kindly but singularly foul-mouthed man , Denton passed his working hours in solitude . <p> Elizabeth 's work was of a more social sort . There was a fashion for covering the apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully embossed with repeated patterns . The taste of the time demanded , however , that the repetition of the patterns should not be exact -- not mechanical , but " natural -- " and it was found that the most pleasing arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by employing women of refinement and natural taste to punch out the patterns with small dies . So many square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as a minimum , and for whatever square feet she did in excess she received a small payment . The room , like most rooms of women workers , was under a manageress : men had been found by the Labour Company not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured ladies from a proper share of their duties . The manageress was a not unkindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brunette type ; and the other women workers , who of course hated her , associated her name scandalously with one of the metal-work directors in order to explain her position . <p> Only two or three of Elizabeth 's fellow-workers were born labour serfs ; plain , morose girls , but most of them corresponded to what the nineteenth century would have called a " reduced " gentlewoman . But the ideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had altered : the faint , faded , negative virtue , the modulated voice and restrained gesture of the old-fashioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth . Most of her companions showed in discoloured hair , ruined complexions , and the texture of their reminiscent conversations , the vanished glories of a conquering youth . All of these artistic workers were much older than Elizabeth , and two openly expressed their surprise that anyone so young and pleasant should come to share their toil . But Elizabeth did not trouble them with her old-world moral conceptions . <p> They were permitted , and even encouraged to converse with each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to variations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in their patterning ; and Elizabeth was almost forced to hear the stories of these lives with which her own interwove : garbled and distorted they were by vanity indeed and yet comprehensible enough . And soon she began to appreciate the small spites and cliques , the little misunderstandings and alliances that enmeshed about her . One woman was excessively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful son of hers ; another had cultivated a foolish coarseness of speech , that she seemed to regard as the wittiest expression of originality conceivable ; a third mused for ever on dress , and whispered to Elizabeth how she saved her pence day after day , and would presently have a glorious day of freedom , wearing . . . and then followed hours of description ; two others sat always together , and called one another pet names , until one day some little thing happened , and they sat apart , blind and deaf as it seemed to one another 's being . And always from them all came an incessant tap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to the rhythm to mark if one fell away . Tap , tap , tap , tap : so their days passed , so their lives must pass . Elizabeth sat among them , kindly and quiet , gray-hearted , marvelling at Fate : tap , tap , tap ; tap , tap , tap ; tap , tap , tap . <p> So there came to Denton and Elizabeth a long succession of laborious days , that hardened their hands , wove strange threads of some new and sterner substance into the soft prettiness of their lives , and drew grave lines and shadows on their faces . The bright , convenient ways of the former life had receded to an inaccessible distance ; slowly they learnt the lesson of the under-world -- sombre and laborious , vast and pregnant . There were many little things that happened : things that would be tedious and miserable to tell , things that were bitter and grievous to bear -- indignities , tyrannies , such as must ever season the bread of the poor in cities ; and one thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life to them , which was that the child they had given life to , sickened and died . But that story , that ancient perpetually recurring story , has been told so often , has been told so beautifully , that there is no need to tell it over again here . There was the same sharp fear , the same anxiety , the deferred inevitable blow , and the black silence . It has always been the same ; it will always be the same . It is one of the things that must be . <p> And it was Elizabeth who was first to speak , after an aching , dull interspace of days : not indeed , of the foolish little name that was a name no longer , but of the darkness that brooded over her soul . They had come through the shrieking , tumultuous ways of the city together ; the clamour of trade , of yelling competitive religions , of political appeal , had beat upon deaf ears ; the glare of focused lights , of dancing letters , and fiery advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took their dinner in the dining-hall at a place apart . " I want , " said Elizabeth clumsily , " to go out to the flying stages -- to that seat . Here , one can say nothing . . . . " <p> Denton looked at her . " It will be night , " he said . <p> " I have asked -- , it is a fine night . " She stopped . <p> He perceived she could find no words to explain herself . Suddenly he understood that she wished to see the stars once more , the stars they had watched together from the open downland in that wild honeymoon of theirs five years ago . Something caught at his throat . He looked away from her . <p> " There will be plenty of time to go , " he said , in a matter-of-fact tone . <p> And at last they came out to their little seat on the flying stage , and sat there for a long time in silence . The little seat was in shadow , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead , and all the city spread below them , squares and circles and patches of brilliance caught in a mesh-work of light . The little stars seemed very faint and small : near as they had been to the old-world watcher , they had become now infinitely remote . Yet one could see them in the darkened patches amidst the glare , and especially in the northward sky , the ancient constellations gliding steadfast and patient about the pole . <p> Long our two people sat in silence , and at last Elizabeth sighed . <p> " If I understood , " she said , " if I could understand . When one is down there the city seems everything -- the noise , the hurry , the voices -- you must live , you must scramble . Here -- it is nothing ; a thing that passes . One can think in peace . " <p> " Yes , " said Denton . " How flimsy it all is ! From here more than half of it is swallowed by the night . . . It will pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth . <p> " I know , " said Denton . " If life were not a moment , the whole of history would seem like the happening of a day . . . Yes -- we shall pass . And the city will pass , and all the things that are to come . Man and the Overman and wonders unspeakable . And yet . . . . " <p> He paused , and then began afresh . " I know what you feel . At least I fancy . . . Down there one thinks of one 's work , one 's little vexations and pleasures , one 's eating and drinking and ease and pain . One lives , and one must die . Down there and everyday -- our sorrow seemed the end of life . . . Up here it is different . For instance , down there it would seem impossible almost to go on living if one were horribly disfigured , horribly crippled , disgraced . Up here -- under these stars -- none of those things would matter . They do n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems just to touch that something -- under the stars . . . . " <p> He stopped . The vague , impalpable things in his mind , cloudy emotions half shaped towards ideas , vanished before the rough grasp of words . " It is hard to express , " he said lamely . <p> They sat through a long stillness . <p> " It is well to come here , " he said at last . " We stop -- our minds are very finite . After all we are just poor animals rising out of the brute , each with a mind , the poor beginning of a mind . We are so stupid . So much hurts . And yet . . . I know , I know -- and some day we shall see . All this frightful stress , all this discord will resolve to harmony , and we shall know it . Nothing is , but it makes for that . Nothing . All the failures -- every little thing makes for that harmony . Everything is necessary to it , we shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dreadful thing , could be left out . Not even the most trivial . Every tap of your hammer on the brass , every moment of work , my idleness even . . . Dear one ! Every movement of our poor little one . . . All these things go on for ever . And the faint impalpable things . We , sitting here together -- Everything . . . . " <p> " The passion that joined us , and what has come since . It is not passion now . More than anything else it is sorrow . Dear . . . . " <p> He could say no more , could follow his thoughts no further . <p> Elizabeth made no answer -- she was very still 
##472551 <h> There is no solvency issue for a sovereign government <p> Yesterday , I indicated that I would provide some commentary on the latest Morgan Stanley briefing ( August 25 , 2010 ) -- Sovereign Subjects -- which received a lot of press coverage in the last few days and roused the interest of many of my readers . The MS document is another example of how you can spread nonsense by ignoring the elephant that is sitting in the corner of the room . The MS briefing is essentially a self-aggrandising rant which perpetuates the standard neo-liberal myths and offers nothing new . I sincerely hope that the author 's company and all of their clients take his advice and lose significant amounts of their investment funds . The more losses are made in this respect the more quickly people will see through the cant that is served up by these clowns . The report was written by one Arnaud Mars who you can telephone and set him straight on ( 44 20 ) 7677 6302 . He used to work in the United Kingdom Debt Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from 1999 to 2004 ) . Prior to that he worked in various banks . <p> Somewhere along the way he became sure he had something to say that was important but forgot the important bit . <p> Mars claims the : <p> The sovereign debt crisis is not European : it is global . And it is not over . <p> There is no debt crisis in sovereign nations . The only public debt problems that have emerged in the current crisis have been in non-sovereign countries and even then with appropriate " fiscal support " those crisis were managed . I am referring to the intervention by the ECB when they decided to purchase outstanding public debt in the secondary bond markets -- which amounte to a fiscal act within a flawed monetary system . <p> But blurring the distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign nations is the starting gate for this absurd journey in self-importance that Mars has produced . <p> The report is " the first issue of Sovereign Subjects " which is " a new Morgan Stanley publication focusing on sovereign risk in advanced economies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication is a crock and they should save their time by not producing a second issue . <p> The first issue of this propaganda document perpetuates some classic myths and then some . <p> Mars starts by breaking out of the mould and asserting that : <p> ... debt/GDP is the most widely used debt metric , but we believe that it is a very inadequate indicator of government solvency . <p> From a Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) perspective public Debt/GDP ratios have no relevance at all . What exactly do they tell us ? The implication is that the bigger the economy the larger the tax base and so the government can support more debt . But a sovereign government does not need to tax to spend and its taxation powers serve different functions . Please read my blog -- Functional finance and modern monetary theory -- for more discussion on this point . <p> It might be that the size of the economy limits nominal government spending because it provides some indication of the real resource base but that does n't tell us anything about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sovereign government can always service its nominal debts . It simply credits a bank account when the interest or maturity payments are due . <p> So I agree with Mars the debt/GDP ratio is a " very inadequate indicator of government solvency " . The MMT indicator of government solvency is to determine the nature of currency issuance and the currency composition of the public debt held ( foreign or domestic currency ) -- more about which later . <p> His first reason is that you should focus on net rather than gross indebtedness . He rightfully notes that usually the former is a much lower figure . But still any financial ratio of this ilk is irrelevant to assessing solvency or not . Mars certainly does n't appreciate that . <p> Second , he claims that debt/GDP ratio : <p> ... only accounts for part of a government 's contractual liabilities . There exists a broad range of liabilities that are debt , yet are not captured in national accounts . To take one example , in March 2008 the UK Government Actuary Department valued the government 's unfunded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims on government accumulated to date by civil servants -- at 770 billion . That is 58% of GDP , not captured by the debt/GDP ratio . Debt/GDP does not capture contingent liabilities either . <p> Response : so what ? None of the liabilities ( public service pensions ) are of any concern unless of-course the whole public service was closed down immediately and the government had to suddenly spend very large amounts relative to the capacity of the economy to absorb the increased nominal demand . <p> But even in that case , the pensions would , in all likelihood , be held in the form of savings and would not enter the spending stream anyway . Further , liabilities such as public service pensions are actuarially assessed each year and there is no risk to the government . <p> The overriding point , however , is that a sovereign government can always fund its liabilities as long as they are denominated in the currency that it issues under monopoly conditions . <p> To put a finer point on this -- at the height of the recent financial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed , the government could have protected all recipients 100 per cent if it thought it was politically and socially useful to do so . There was never a financial constraint on the government from bailing out all funds that made losses . I would n't have advocated it doing so but it could have . <p> Mars then really starts clutching at the straws of ignorance . He claims that : <p> It is not GDP but government revenues that matter : Whatever the size of a government 's liabilities , what matters ultimately is how they compare to the resources available to service them . One benefit of sovereignty is that governments can unilaterally increase their income by raising taxes , but they will only ever be able to acquire in this way a fraction of GDP . Debt/GDP therefore provides a flattering image of government finances . A better approach is to scale debt against actual government revenues ... An even better approach would be to scale debt against the maximum level of revenues that governments can realistically obtain from using their tax-raising power to the full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's tolerance for taxation and government interference . Seen from this angle , the US federal debt no longer compares quite so favourably with that of European governments . <p> Where do you start with that nonsense ? Continuing yesterday 's theme -- there is a huge elephant hovering nearby . State and local governments that do not have currency issuing powers have to worry about their revenue bases . <p> The financial resources available to a sovereign government ( defined in the MMT sense ) are , if you like , equal to infinity minus 1 dollar . The concept of a revenue base has no meaning to a truly sovereign government . The only limitations on government spending are political in the first instance , and then , ultimately , the availability of real goods and services to buy . <p> Scaling public debt against a current or prospective tax base has no meaning in this context . A sovereign government can always fund any of its liabilities ( that are denominated in its own currency ) independent of the state of the business cycle ( and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise funds to permit spending . It helps free real resources in the private sector and in that sense provides non-inflationary space for governments to spend and pursue their socio-economic programs . But that is quite a different matter to being necessary to raise funds that the government can then spend . <p> The government does not need funds to spend . It credits bank accounts courtesy of its unique position as the monopoly issuer of the currency . <p> That is the elephant . The reason the likes of Mars can not mention it is because then they would have to have a discussion about the relationship between currency and inflation . They prefer just to assert the totally discredited Quantity Theory of Money which claims that any expansion of the money supply is inflationary . The theory does not accord with what we know from the real world . <p> The Quantity Theory of Money is written in symbols as MV = PQ . This just means that the money stock ( M ) times the turnover per period ( V ) is equal to the price level ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream assume that V is fixed ( despite empirically it moving all over the place ) and Q is always at full employment as a result of market adjustments . <p> So in applying this theory they deny the existence of unemployment and excess capacity . The more reasonable mainstream economists admit that short-run deviations in the predictions of the Quantity Theory of Money can occur but in the long-run all the frictions causing unemployment will disappear and the theory will apply regardless . <p> It is , of-course , trivial to conclude that if V and Q fixed , then changes in M will be reflected in P -- which is the basic Monetarist claim that expanding the money supply is inflationary . They say that excess monetary growth creates a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods and the only adjustment that is possible is nominal ( that is , inflation ) . <p> One of the contributions of Keynes was to show the Quantity Theory of Money could not be correct . He observed price level changes independent of monetary supply movements ( and vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monetary system operated . <p> Further , with high rates of capacity and labour underutilisation at various times ( including now ) one can hardly seriously maintain the view that Q is fixed . There is always scope for real adjustments ( that is , increasing output ) to match nominal growth in aggregate demand . So if increased credit became available and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services , it is likely that firms with excess capacity will respond by increasing real output and employment . The empirical world provides that lesson over and over again . <p> So while Mars is pretending to offer new insights that should bias us against government spending ( and debt issuance ) he is really just operating within the tired and irrelevant orthodox ( gold standard/convertible currency ) paradigm which is known as the government budget constraint ( GBC ) in the literature . <p> This framework is based on the accounting relationship linking the budget flows ( spending , taxation and interest servicing ) with relevant stocks ( base money and government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream macroeconommists as constituting an a priori financial constraint on government spending and by proponents of Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) as an ex post accounting relationship that has to be true in a stock-flow consistent macro model but which carries no particular import other than to measure the changes in stocks between periods . <p> As noted above , these stock changes are also not particularly significant within MMT given that a sovereign government is never revenue constrained because it is the monopoly issuer of the currency . <p> The way the mainstream macroeconomics textbooks build their flawed narrative is to draw an analogy between the household and the sovereign government and to assert that the microeconomic constraints that are imposed on individual or household choices apply equally without qualification to the government . <p> The narrative then shifts , without explanation , from an ex post sum that has to be true because it is an accounting identity , to an alleged behavioural constraint on government action . <p> The GBC is always true ex post but never represents an a priori financial constraint for a sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GBC literature emerged in the 1960s during a period when the neo-classical microeconomists were trying to gain control of the macroeconomic policy agenda by undermining the theoretical validity of the , then , dominant Keynesian macroeconomics . <p> The neo-classical attack was centred on the so-called lack of microfoundations ( read : contrived optimisation and rationality assertions that are the hallmark of mainstream microeconomics but which fail to stand scrutiny by , for example , behavioural economists ) . <p> This was a very technical debate ( beyond today 's blog ) but the whole agenda was total nonsense and reflected the desire of the mainstream microeconomists to represent the government as a household and to " prove " analytically that its presence within the economy was largely damaging to income and wealth generation . <p> Anyway , just as an individual or a household is conceived in orthodox microeconomic theory to maximise utility ( real income ) subject to their budget constraints , this emerging approach also constructed the government as being constrained by a budget or " financing " constraint . Accordingly , they developed an analytical framework whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called GBC . <p> So within this model , taxes are conceived as providing the funds to the government to allow it to spend . Further , this approach asserts that any excess in government spending over taxation receipts then has to be " financed " in two ways : ( a ) by borrowing from the public ; and ( b ) by printing money . <p> You can see that the approach is a gold standard approach where the quantity of " money " in circulation is proportional ( via a fixed exchange price ) to the stock of gold that a nation holds at any point in time . So if the government wants to spend more it has to take money off the non-government sector either via taxation of bond-issuance . <p> However , in a fiat currency system , the mainstream analogy between the household and the government is flawed at the most elemental level . The household must work out the financing before it can spend . The household can not spend first . The government can spend first and ultimately does not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , they believed ( via the flawed Quantity Theory of Money ) that " printing money " would be inflationary ( even though governments do not spend by printing money anyway . So they recommended that deficits be covered by debt-issuance , which they then claimed would increase interest rates by increasing demand for scarce savings and crowd out private investment . All sorts of variations on this nonsense has appeared ranging from the moderate Keynesians ( and some Post Keynesians ) who claim the " financial crowding out " ( via interest rate increases ) is moderate to the extreme conservatives who say it is 100 per cent ( that is , no output increase accompanies government spending ) . <p> So the GBC is the mainstream macroeconomics framework for analysing these " financing " choices and it says that the budget deficit in year t is equal to the change in government debt ( ? B ) over year t plus the change in the monetary base ( ? H ) over year t . If we think of this in real terms ( rather than monetary terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> However , this is merely an accounting statement . It has to be true if things have been added and subtracted properly in accounting for the dealings between the government and non-government sectors . <p> In mainstream economics , money creation is erroneously depicted as the government asking the central bank to buy treasury bonds which the central bank in return then prints money . The government then spends this money . This is called debt monetisation and we have shown in the Deficits 101 series how this conception is incorrect . Anyway , the mainstream claims that if the government is willing to increase the money growth rate it can finance a growing deficit but also inflation because there will be too much money chasing too few goods ! But an economy constrained by deficient demand ( defined as demand below the full employment level ) responds to a nominal impulse by expanding real output not prices . <p> But because they believe that inflation is inevitable if " printing money " occurs , mainstream economists recommend that governments use debt issuance to " finance " their deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher future taxes . Why should taxes have to be increased ? <p> Well the textbooks are full of elaborate models of debt pay-back , debt stabilisation etc which all " prove " ( not ! ) that the legacy of past deficits is higher debt and to stabilise the debt , the government must eliminate the deficit which means it must then run a primary surplus equal to interest payments on the existing debt . <p> Nothing is included about the swings and roundabouts provided by the automatic stabilisers as the results of the deficits stimulate private activity and welfare spending drops and tax revenue rises automatically in line with the increased economic growth . Most orthodox models are based on the assumption that full employment prevails continually anyway , which makes them nonsensical depictions of the real world . <p> Finally , you can now see why conflating the fiscal situation in the US with that of a Eurozone nation which is not sovereign is a sign that Mars does n't understand the way different monetary systems operate . He clearly does understand or does n't want his readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to that operating in nations where the national government has a currency issuing monopoly and floats that currency in international markets . <p> The fourth argument he makes about the lack of relevance of debt/GDP ratios is that : <p> Debt/GDP looks at the past . The main problem is in the future : The fourth and largest flaw of debt/GDP is that it is an entirely backward-looking indicator . It only accounts for the accumulation of past deficits . This captured reasonably well the magnitude of the fiscal challenge at the end of World War II because at that time the challenge did indeed result entirely from the past : large wartime deficits had pushed debt ratios higher , but governments were no longer running deficits , nor were there expectations of them doing so in subsequent years . By contrast , the accumulation of past deficits now represents only part of the problem for advanced economies ' governments . The other part consists of coping with the large structural deficits opened up by the crisis and compounded by the fiscal consequences of ageing . What raises questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional debt that will accumulate in coming years if policies do not radically change . Debt ratios do not capture this part of the problem . <p> First , governments in most nations ran deficits in the post World War II period and everyone ( including the markets ) came to expect deficits as being normal . It is false to claim otherwise . It is only in the last three decades as the neo-liberal onslaught ensued that deficits have been demonised . <p> Second , the accumulation of past deficits in the form of net financial assets including outstanding government bonds represent a significant portion of the wealth held by the private sector . The likes of Morgan Stanley have made profits by using government bonds to their advantage . The interest servicing payments by government on outstanding debt constitute private income . There is no problem . <p> Third , the " ageing problem " is not a financial issue for government . It may be a political problem if the younger generations rebel against providing increased public care to their parents . It may also be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough real resources to service all the competing needs . Those sorts of problems are always resolved ( more or less satisfactorily ) by political processes . <p> A sovereign government will always be able to " buy " health and aged care services if they are available for sale in the currency of issue . There is no financial problem . There are not questions of fiscal sustainability in this respect . <p> Mars conducts some analysis of the " costs of ageing " but never once mentions real resources , which are the only actual costs of any economic use . <p> He then decides to present Exhibit 3 ( reproduced below ) which purports to show " a stylised representation of the government balance sheet " . Mars claims that : <p> On the asset side is the power to tax , which is the main asset and resource of any government . It can be conceived as a variable rate claim on GDP , where the rate depends on the level of taxation . Its value on the balance sheet is therefore the net present value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' social ' liability , which represents the promise of the government to its electorate to spend resources on defence , justice , education , health and any other existing government policy . Its value is the net present value of all future primary expenditure . The difference between the power to tax and the social liability is the net present value of all future structural primary deficits ( by definition , the cyclical component of the deficit should sum up to zero over time ) . <p> This extraordinary piece of deception ignores the fact that the main economic asset a sovereign government has is it monopoly over currency-issuance . <p> This asset allows the government if it has the political will to pursue public purpose and create full employment . <p> The power to tax is an important aspect of gaining currency legitimacy ( creating a demand for the currency ) and is an important counter-stabilising policy tool . But it should never be set against the public liabilities that are serviced by government spending as if it " funds " that spending . <p> Mars then confuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revenue-constrained corporate entity : <p> The residual is represented on the balance sheet as the people 's equity , by analogy to a corporate balance sheet . This is effectively the net worth of the government in the broadest sense , and a measure of its solvency . <p> There is no legitimate comparison here . The meaning of capital in the balance sheet of a private corporation has no carry over to the public space when we are considering a sovereign government . <p> It is not a measure of the solvency of a sovereign government . By definition a sovereign government is always solvent unless it takes on debts that are not denominated in the currency of issue . Then solvency issues may arise . <p> Mars claims that if the residual if the residual ( the gap between its tax revenue and its liabilities ) is : <p> ... negative , the government is insolvent . In other words , some or all of its stakeholders must suffer a loss : either taxpayers ( through a higher tax burden ) , or beneficiaries of public services ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of default ) . <p> That is a preposterous claim . A sovereign government can run permanent deficits forever . It may not be desirable to do that -- given the state of the external and private domestic sector spending but that is a different matter . <p> What might constitute prudent policy aiming to maintain full employment does n't negate the fact that there is no solvency risk for a sovereign government . The only risk ultimately is inflation if the government spends too much relative to the real capacity of the economy to absorb it . Then taxation may place a counter-stabilising role . <p> The final section of the MS paper is focused on the form in which governments will default . Mars says : <p> It is not whether to default , but how , and vis--vis whom . What this means is that -- as indicated above -- governments will impose a loss on some of their stakeholders and have in fact started to do so ( across Europe at least ) . The question is not whether they will renege on their promises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what form this default will take . <p> Once again conflating non-sovereign nations such as exist in the Eurozone with fully sovereign nations is not valid . <p> Further , the only " defaults " that have occurred in Europe with respect to the stakeholders have been driven by the neo-liberal obsession with austerity . The Eurozone problem is not one of debt default but rather a flawed monetary system that does not have adequate fiscal responsiveness to crisis and places too much power into the hands of the bond markets . <p> Having said that , the ECB has demonstrated in recent months that it can engage in what is essentially a fiscal operation and take all pressure of national governments within the Eurozone to " finance " their spending . <p> So the only reason that other governments will start punishing stakeholders ( via tax increases or otherwise ) is if they believe the sort of nonsense that Mars is propagating and think they have a financial problem that has to be dealt with . <p> If they fully understand the nature of the monetary system they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monopoly issuer of the currency then there will be no reason to renege on any promises . <p> But Mars acknowledges that " ( t ) his is ultimately a question of political economy " but does n't seem to realise that this also means it is not a financial question . <p> At the end of the paper , he decides that governments may not engage in outright default but will deflate the debt burdens away . He had to get the inflation threat in there somewhere . He says : <p> Outright sovereign default in large advanced economies remains an extremely unlikely outcome , in our view . But current yields and break-even inflation rates provide very little protection against the credible threat of financial oppression in any form it might take . <p> " Unlikely " , " might " -- all the weasel words that the neo-liberals use when the empirical world does n't support their arguments . It is interesting that bond investors keep queuing up for more debt because they know it makes them wealthier . As it has been doing for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflation is not a policy threat at present . <p> Digression : this weekend <p> My old band from Melbourne -- Pressure Drop -- has decided to reform and this weekend I am flying to Melbourne for our first get together in 29-odd years . The band was very popular in the Melbourne scene in the 1970s and early 1980s . It went into its long hiatus when I decided that I wanted to do a PhD and drop out of the professional music scene for a while . <p> We have all been playing in other bands since then and have now decided to come back together and do gigs as Pressure Drop about once a month for the time being . We will also release a CD in the months ahead . So for me it is a chance to play with my old professional colleagues and good friends again but without having to endure the financial strains that trying to survive as a professional musician used to bring . <p> Saturday quiz <p> It will appear sometime tomorrow with Answers and Discussion being available on Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mares your commentary . I had sent an email yesterday ( Thursday 26 Aug 2010 ) , the minute I heard the Bloomberg television reporters gushing about the importance of this new report ( and how the reporter claimed she looked forward to reading it through thoroughly this coming weekend -- how could she know it was so important if she had not read it yet ? There is tremendous need to educate the talking heads of the financial press , I am afraid ) . <p> Here is the email I sent : <p> Mr Mares , <p> Since you invited comments on your new research series , let me make a few : <p> First , your comparative statistics did not include Japan . Japan have had for many years egregious debt levels by many measures , including those you recommend , and yet their currency is approaching 15-year highs , with confidence spilling over to the re-allocation of investment of Chinese reserves . Might not this give you some pause to reconsider your views ? <p> Secondly , I would recommend that you make a distinction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , Australia , Canada ) and countries that have surrendered that sovereignty ( eg Eurozone countries ) . I think some of the points you make might be appropriate for the second group , but you should not assume that these metrics are meaningful for sovereign currency issuing countries . <p> Lastly , have you immersed yourself , by chance , in any of the literature that today is collectively discussed under the term " Modern Monetary Theory " ? As you may know , this is an extension of " Chartalism " first introduced by the German , Georg Knapp in the first decade of the twentieth century , which was taken up by Keynes , Lerner , and many other economists that have not subscribed to the neo-classical synthesis . I would suggest that any discussion of sovereign debt defaults that 1 ) does not distinguish between those countries that can issue their own currency and those that can not and 2 ) does not incorporate or refute Modern Monetary Theory for sovereign currency issuing countries is incomplete , misleading , and dangerous . <p> I invite you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ( about a week , really ) reading and studying Modern Monetary Theory before you continue with your bold series . If , in light of a genuine understanding of this heterodox view , you are able to formulate serious and reasoned arguments for propagating " debt-a-phobia " amongst the sovereign currency issuer countries , including Japan , I will be a most interested reader . <p> Otherwise , might we readers assume your publications will be no more than bits of fluffy smoke screens designed to distract from the mea culpas issued by Morgan Stanley about the firm 's incorrect rate calls ? <p> Ive seen a lot of recent talk about the long run this and long run that . The response that has started to come to mind , which does nt rival Keynes ' quip about us all being dead , is that the long run is a simple accumulation of short runs . If you admit that the short run . <p> Seems that all the long run analysis is simply backward looking which lends itself to a lot of data fitting and confirmation bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain simply what on earth you 're saying ? What 's the difference between a sovereign and a non-sovereign county ; and how come a sovereign country ca n't become insolvent ? I 'm not arguing , I just do n't understand . <p> Bill : I think there should be little question or debate on the solvency of a sovereign country with its own currency issuing debts in its own currency . I also do not think there should be much debate on the need for fiscal action to keep up the aggregate demand when there are evidences that the aggregate demand is falling in the absence of destruction of production capacity and capability . However , I believe that debates should focus on the inherent skills and capabilities of the government or its structure and incentives to be able to manage the fiscal action . As well , one may question the structures and skills to drain the reserves thereafter ( when the private sector picks up the aggregate demands ) . <p> A sovereign country has its own currency which only it issues and additionally there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create and issue the currency you can never run out ( insolvency ) . In fact the currency only exists after you create it . Those that use it need you to issue it first and can become insolvent if they do nt have enough of the currency to pay a debt . <p> USA , UK , Australia , China , Canada and Japan are all soveriegn . No Euro using countries are sovereign . <p> China has decided to peg to our currency but they do not have to , they can remove the peg whenever they want . <p> From a Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) perspective public Debt/GDP ratios have no relevance at all . What exactly do they tell us ? The implication is that the bigger the economy the larger the tax base and so the government can support more debt . But a sovereign government does not need to tax to spend and its taxation powers serve different functions . Please read my blog -- Functional finance and modern monetary theory -- for more discussion on this point . <p> So MMT says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP and this is not a problem ? Or it denies this possibility due to some miraculous cancellations whereby any small amount of growth can act to sustain increased indebtedness to foreigners ? Or that exchange rates can miraculously adjust to prevent this from happening ? What if interest paid to foreigners keeps exploding both from the public sector and the private sector ? <p> That is a preposterous claim . A sovereign government can run permanent deficits forever . It may not be desirable to do that -- given the state of the external and private domestic sector spending but that is a different matter . <p> External sector here And it may not be desirable to do that which means throw the domestic sector into higher unemployment when it is never at full employment ? <p> Monetarist view here . Not to defend the Quantity Theory thereof , it is of no consequence , meaningless to the important discussions to be had . And I want to observe as a separate matter that Mares did n't bring it up , you did in the context of ensuring a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason MMTers , and most others rely upon the interest rate to manage economic growth , are dismissive of the matter of the amount of money in existence in any way being important to economic stability , or any relevant measure to be used to gauge the success or failure of our public policy goals . <p> Today 's well-done chase down another of the Peterson-esque rabbit holes involves the issue of sovereign default ; to be , or not to be . MMT is a well-thought argument that any nation with monetary sovereignty is capable of preventing default , ABSENT the self-imposed very legal constraints that it brings to bear on that sovereignty . This is an argument that is very easily won by the Austerians , and for good reason . These discussions ignore the largest elephant in the room , which is one of those self-imposed constraints . <p> While it is readily arguable that the GBC is a false and inapplicable economic concept , every one of your opponents gets to retain the viability of their arguments and scare the shit out of everybody , not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand . <p> It is very simply and very clearly to me based on the fact that the so-called sovereign United States Government has passed a law requiring that its budget be " balanced " by the debt-funding of its non-taxed expenditures . Magnanimous-sized elephant here . <p> So , to me , Bill , THAT is the largest obstacle to making any progress . The sovereign government is not obliged by its sovereignty to borrow any money , yet by law , it must . I am repeating myself here , I know , but until you and the other MMT proponents deal with this fact , and the sovereign government removes that so-called self-imposed constraint , we ca n't make progress . If the people are not aware of the voluntary nature of this restriction , it is mislabeled as a self-imposed constraint ; it is a constraint of exactly the same neo-liberal economic policies that you say you abhor , but for some reason choose to ignore . <p> At the FS Conference in DC , I asked for a layout of the self-imposed constraints that prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMT claims are achievable in today 's modern ( floating/fiat ) economies , and their relative importance in making progress . <p> The list of self-imposed constraints that must be removed to make any social progress in a neo-liberal dominated economic system is : whatever . <p> Elizabeth says : Saturday , August 28 , 2010 at 1:49 For us non economist , can you please explain simply what on earth you 're saying ? What 's the difference between a sovereign and a non-sovereign county ; and how come a sovereign country ca n't become insolvent ? Hi Elizabeth . I can add a bit to Greg 's help . Imagine you are the Country USA . You borrow one Billion from China . The borrowed money is repayable in US dollars . You the USA can simply print USD anytime you want and repay the Chinese . Therefore there is no risk for a soverign country that borrows in its own currency . Contrast that with Greece who do nt have a currency of their own . Greece cant print Euro 's and it cant devalue . So Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovereign Country like Australia that borrows in USD could be insolvent if it could not find anyone in the world to swap AUD for USD to allow it pay the loan back in USD . ( Someone else may help here . ) Below are extracts and dirctions to some of Bills material that may interest you . " There is no credit risk for a sovereign government August 17th , 2010 But the more important point is that students should understand very early in a macroeconomics course that a sovereign government is never revenue constrained because it is the monopoly issuer of the currency . That is a basic starting point in exploring the differences between spending and taxation decisions of a sovereign government and the spending and income-earning decisions/possibilities of the private sector entities ( households and firms ) . and Steven Major chooses to term a government in the former category a " true sovereign " because it : <p> ... can issue freely in its own currency , has full taxing power over the population and ultimately , if required , can create more of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to be profligate , far from it , but it does mean there is no externally imposed timetable on fiscal retrenchment . <p> I am 100 per cent in agreement with this construction . <p> Note that in saying a ( true ) sovereign government is never revenue constrained because it is the monopoly issuer of the currency one is not advocating reckless net spending by the same government . <p> A ( true ) sovereign government should define its sense of public purpose which in my view will always include full employment using technologies that are environmentally sustainable . Then its fiscal position should enable the economy to achieve levels of activity that are commensurate with this idea of public purpose .

You can find these blogs by clicking on the " one page archive " button on the home page . It took me a while to get it so I hope this helps you speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist posting this recent article written by the very confused Mort Zuckerman which is titled , The Most Fiscally Irresponsible Government in U.S. History Current federal budget trends are capable of destroying this country <p> Here are my favorite quotes from the article 1 . On the national debt , the money the government has spent without the tax revenues to pay for it has produced mind-numbing numbers so large as to be disconnected from reality . Zeros from here to infinity . The sums are hard to describe ; it is hard to describe an elephant , but you know one when you see one . <p> 2 . The government will be writing more IOUs on top of those we already ca n't afford . Why plan a second stimulus if the first stimulus could n't prevent high unemployment ? <p> 3 . An old saying that can apply to the deficit is called the " rule of holes " and goes as follows : " When you 're in one , stop digging . " <p> 4 . Hope may lie in a new bipartisan panel headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and centrist political leaders whose characters raise some degree of confidence that they might be able to come forth with productive programs . <p> " What happens if the people take their credited bank accounts and buy real assets to use as a savings vehicle driving up their price ? " <p> The same as what would happen if they take their government bonds and buy real assets with them . Remember that government bonds are tradeable assets with currency value in the hands of the holder and that there is a liquid market in them . <p> Once you realise this , you realise that what we call ' cash ' is really just a non-interest paying government issued bearer bond . It 's the same promise as any other bond . <p> " The same as what would happen if they take their government bonds and buy real assets with them . " <p> Not true . In fact , you can not buy much with bonds -- try going to a store and buying that nice and truly useful flat screen TV with your bonds , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try settling closing on a house with bonds , etc . <p> 1 . You have to sell the bonds first <p> 2 . You can buy whatever with the proceeds after you have sold the bonds . <p> Holding a bond means saving aka deferring your consumption for the duration of bond holding . Selling a bond means acquiring cash for presumably immediate consumption at the expense of another bond holder , to whom you sold your bond , deferring his consumption . <p> The " fiscal support " of the ECB is conditional on austerity measures that European states were forced to take , and it was taken to assist European bank liquidity and capital ratios . It is not a plan to ease revenue constraints of European fiscal policy . <p> Holding a bond means saving aka deferring your consumption for the duration of bond holding . Selling a bond means acquiring cash for presumably immediate consumption at the expense of another bond holder , to whom you sold your bond , deferring his consumption . <p> I 've tried to make that argument here , VJK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some holes in it . One that comes to mind is the fact that government bonds make first class loan collateral . That means that the banking system , which always stands ready to lend to any well qualified borrower , can easily monetize these bonds with freshly created bank money . Therefore , it is n't necessarily true that I have to defer consumption/spending if I hold a government bond . <p> Holding cash means saving aka deferring your consumption for the duration of cash holding . 50 in your wallet is savings . Only when there is a transaction is that converted into a flow . At any point in time all the cash in existence is savings for somebody . <p> If there is a liquid market in any asset then that asset is as good as cash , since it can be converted to a flow on demand and it can be borrowed against . <p> And if I have assets , you 'll find that I can go into pretty much any store and with a couple of signatures walk away with pretty much anything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mode of operation as they get a fat kick back . <p> And then there is always the Pawn shop for anything else . <p> Only that fraction of assets that ca n't be converted is really deferring consumption . The rest is just a choice not to spend . <p> What happens if the people take their credited bank accounts and buy real assets to use as a savings vehicle driving up their price ? <p> I agree that initially they will push up prices , however Bill 's premise has always been that governments will go into debt when there is a shortfall in aggregate demand . Excess money will tend to have market participants attempt to increase market share rather than increase the clearance price . Thus , this private activity should restore aggregate demand , rather than have an inflation bout . <p> With this private sector activity , the government is no longer compelled to go into any more debt , and its restored tax base should see deal with any nominal debt . <p> If A holds a bond , he can not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B can not buy stuff at the same time . Someone has to wait until someone else exchanges the bond for cash . If A and B held cash , they could buy stuff at the same time thus competing for the same good , let 's say a pair of shoes . Apply the same logic to the totality of bond and cash holders . Simplifying , purchasing power equals amount of cash , bonds defer such power until later . <p> I 'm sorry but I get a real headache reading how MMT works in your fantasy world . So you ' print money ' to pay back a loan to China . In the real world your currency gets trashed , no one will borrow money from you again and then inflation goes through the roof as your money supply blows out and purchasing power plummets . A high school economics student will tell you that . Your ultra-left views that the government will somehow create full employment just by spending and total disdain for the free market are really nothing short of communist philosophy . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public education system . <p> If A holds a bond , he can not buy anything until he sells the bond to B. " <p> No , you misunderstand the simple argument . In a modern economy with sophisticated credit arrangement nobody has to wait to buy anything . Simply my reputation is sufficient to get money created that will allow me to buy today . <p> " Simplifying , purchasing power equals amount of cash , bonds defer such power until later . " <p> No they do n't , because you have ignored the modern credit system and modern communications . I know I have the assets and I can make that liquid right now in numerous different ways . So there is no deferral at both micro and macro level because there is no issue of liquidity . In fact simply knowing I have assets probably makes me more likely to spend . <p> A bond is as good as cash , a house is as good as cash , even the fact that you have a job and a reasonable reputation is as good as cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site that will allow me to swap my government bonds directly for what I want via barter exchange . After all I have an entire world of people to go at . <p> Cash is just oil in the works of the exchange -- a good without name . It 's the real stuff that people want to exchange . <p> Is it true to say , then , a state CAN go bankrupt if it links its currency to something over which it has no control , like gold or other commodities ? So " the Bank of England promises to give the bearer 10 grains of gold . " They used to say something like that , I think . So now it 's all funny money . <p> And this is starting to get me REALLY interested : if sovereign states just devalue the money , this means those that loaned money at the old rate will get completely stuffed . Now in some economies ( UK , US to a lesser extent , lots of others too ) , the banks are owned by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts ' , they tend to do the following : Since private individual and private business debts are terrible , it stands that sovereign government debt is also terrible to behold . It appears that our economics education ( thereafter economic policies ) either leaves out or jumps over the concepts of sovereign government and its definition which is the power to issue its own currency and demand tax using that currency . If this amount of mental dexterity is too much to handle , then we may have to devolve back into some sort of fixed exchange rate regime , even going back to the gold standard ? Not that I am thrilled about the gold standard , but should it not be that a monetary system be in sync with the mindset of its users ? <p> I find the MMT world view interesting , if a bit twisted . The main trouble is this view makes people conclude that a government creating money without end is no trouble . But in real life it causes the currency to go down and often hyperinflation , which is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not just X units of their own currency , it is also the support of a large fraction of the population ( government employees , people on welfare , people on social security , etc. maybe 40% of the population or more ) . Much of this support comes from just printing money , which is really an " inflation tax " . In hyperinflation , when the money becomes worthless , the " inflation tax " stops working and governments can no longer support such a large fraction of the population . They are really bankrupt at that point . You can get more of my thoughts on MMT by clicking on my name . <p> " The main trouble is this view makes people conclude that a government creating money without end is no trouble . " <p> That 's how it is perverted by people who do n't understand it . Money is just oil in the engine -- you need enough to keep the engine at optimal velocity but not too much as to cause smoke . The problem at the moment is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The restrictions on an economy are real not fiscal . That is the key message that MMT conveys -- get away from the numbers on your computers and start looking at the real situation , the real resources and the real people . If a government can do something with the real resources at their command and they have a sovereign currency , then they can always afford to do it . <p> imo any form of Monetarism or a Quantity Theory has lost much if not all credibilty this time around . This chart tells all ( http : **35;8035;TOOLONG ... ) . Many prices at least in the US have fallen since the ' spike ' in ' money ' , and the USD has risen against the Euro , fallen v Yen , unchanged v Yuan ... all sorts of price reactions after this 12,000% increase . imo if a 12,000% increase does not have any appreciable predictive effect , then you should at least start to question the Theory if not throw it out . <p> " That 's how it is perverted by people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine -- you need enough to keep the engine at optimal velocity but not too much as to cause smoke . The problem at the moment is that there is too little and the engine is ceasing up . " <p> But if you look at the title of this article , it is " There is no solvency issue for a sovereign government " which makes people think that MMT policy is that you can print forever with no trouble . But if the US has hyperinflation , how does it pay for oil for the military or support the 40% of the population that depend on it ? Saying that liabilities are no trouble when you can print money is not really accurate . Governments have ongoing liabilities measured in real things , not just debts measured in currency . Even saying " the limits are real not fiscal " make people think you would never worry about printing too much money . Anyway , MMT comes across as thinking that governments making tons of money is no trouble , but anyone who studies any history , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when governments print too much money bad things happen . So MMT looks like it is not in touch with reality . <p> As for the graph showing the reserve balances going up , I have a theory on that . I like the MMT view that the Fed is really part of the sovereign government . So lets view the Fed and the Treasury as in the same box . When the Fed is paying interest on " excess reserves " it is just like the treasury paying interest on bonds . Money is really being loaned to the government . It is really the same thing as if the banks had bought treasury bonds . So this is " crowding out by the government " but hidden in the Fed , or in MMT terms it is reducing aggregate demand . In any case , this is just a new trick that people have not caught onto yet . Maybe MMT types , who are used to viewing the Fed as part of the government , can explain this to people . <p> The PR problem with MMT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the MMT view is that deficits do n't matter . Articles like this one add to that perception . Now clearly MMT says that taxes make demand for currency and if there were no taxes there would be no demand for that currency . And in history countries that did not have the tax base and relied too much on printing money got hyperinflation . But has anyone with an MMT mindset tried to quantify the conditions for this ? I have seen one MMT paper saying that the US situation is different from Zimbabwe or Germany of 1923 , but situations are always different so that is not saying much . Has anyone made a rule like , " if the amount of government money creation divided by the taxes collected each year is greater than X then there is a risk of hyperinflation " . There have been on the order of 100 cases of hyperinflation in fiat currencies so there should be plenty of experiments to look at . Even the US has had hyperinflation twice ( in the revolution and civil war ) . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just saying that deficits only matter after " full employment " is just not clear enough . Imagine that unemployment is partly caused by minimum wage laws and government policies that drive jobs overseas so that no amount of money printing can ever get " full employment " . Would MMT think there is no risk to any amount of money printing in this situation ? If a government drives jobs overseas they can print all the money they want at no risk ? Most people do n't really expect to ever see full employment again , so saying that is the only danger sounds to them like saying there is never any danger of too much money printing . <p> If MMT people were very clear about when money printing became a problem ( like a math formula ) it would go along way to solving the PR problem where everyone thinks that MMT people never worry about money printing . <p> ' The inability to tax and dependency on foreign currency are central to hyperinflation or national solvency . Moreover , in Zimbabwe and Weimar , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply versus demand ) . ' <p> There is no parallel -- hence why Japan is bumbling along fighting deflation . <p> " Has anyone made a rule " <p> Yes . It 's the same one that is currently used in monetary policy . If inflation starts to take hold then you adjust taxes/spending/interest rates to compensate based upon the political policies in play at the time . <p> MMT gives us a new set of weaponary against instability and suffering . There is much to do to determine political policies that use those weapons effectively . It 's much like designing the control rod layout of a nuclear reactor . <p> Personally I prefer automatic systems that require no ' judgements of Solomon ' -- particularly from politicians . My starter suggestion would be that the minimum wage is nationalised and paid to all citizens doing ' useful work ' , disabled or retired . That effectively subsidises all jobs , voluntary work and anything else politically defined as ' useful ' so that people can earn a living income by doing it . The state then provides buffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of other ' useful ' work of the required quality . <p> Profit taxes are adjusted to compensate for the worker subsidy but at a level that maintains aggregate demand , and the central bank is given a land value levy charged on freeholders that they can wind up and down to control inflation . Interest rates remain at zero . The minimum wage is abolished and the jobs market becomes a ' pure market ' , with the quality of the buffer jobs controlling the minimum standards of employment required from the private sector . <p> This way everybody has to work to get any money from the state , worker heavy industries get more benefit from the structure than worker light ones ( import heavy industries for example ) , and domestic demand is maintained . The deficit is then automatic , not structural and moves up and down inversely to the waxing and waning of the private sector . So the amount of money created and/or destroyed is always enough , never too much . <p> MMT has nothing to do with money printing and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MMT says that the " We ca n't afford it " excuse is invalid if you 're sovereign in your own fiat currency . We can always afford it . The question is whether there are real resource available and whether the idea is a sensible use of those resources . <p> " If inflation starts to take hold then you adjust taxes/spending/interest rates to compensate based upon the political policies in play at the time . " <p> Hyperinflation hits hard and sudden . If you wait till it starts it is probably too late . A good economic theory needs to be able to anticipate the future . Do MMT people not draw a distinction between inflation and hyperinflation ? <p> " MMT has nothing to do with money printing and I 'm not at all sure why you 're fixated on it . MMT says that the " We ca n't afford it " excuse is invalid if you 're sovereign in your own fiat currency . We can always afford it . " <p> When you say if you issue your own fiat currency you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us common men calls this " printing money " . When we say this we know that maybe it is just adjusting accounts on computers and no money was actually printed . We are trying to learn the terms of MMT but you guys should also learn our language . To us it looks like MMT is one of the biggest advocates of " printing money " . When MMT guys say things like " we can always afford it " it is coming across as saying " deficits do n't matter " and " we can always print all the money we need " . So is that the real MMT position ? Was Krugman right ? <p> There have been something like 100 cases of hyperinflation and they are all different , but the common thing is too much spending and money printing compared to the taxes . I do n't think the hyperinflation of " The Continental " during the US revolutionary war and the Confederate money in the South had anything to do with debts in foreign currency . Arguing that the US is currently different than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak argument . Much better is to look at the common things in hyperinflation ( too much spending and money printing relative to taxes ) and see how the current US situation compares to other cases . <p> If you look at all these governments that had hyperinflation , another common thing is that as their currencies became worthless none of them were in a situation where " they can always afford it " . So I think it is worth understanding how far you can go with " printing money " before things go bad . I think history shows there are limits . When people lose confidence in a currency that country and government are in for much pain . I think the US has a real risk of this sometime in the next few years . <p> Vincent Cate , government has monopoly over money and as any monopoly it has full pricing power over money . Hyperinflation results when government abuses its pricing power over money in order to get a claim on real resources whatever they are . And by definition there should be a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that one needs to understand about hyperinflation . <p> What you are arguing for ( and neoliberalism ) is that the constraint on pricing power should be made exogenous to the economy via " independent " central bank , some rules about debt to gdp ratios or budget deficits or similar mechanical levers . What MMT argues for is that this constraint should be made endogenous to the economy which by design also allows fuller real resource utilisation used to advance public purpose defined by political consensus . <p> US and any country in the world has full risk to use wrong levers or apply proper levers but to wrong points at any point of time in any problem . In particular given current level of economic thought which is actually absence of any thought at all as the only thing I can clear recognize in any macroeconomic debate is pure ideological drive . So who has louder and stronger voice and thicker budget wins the public . In this sense your comments fit 100% to ideology of " how far you can go with " doing things bankers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in money creation . <p> There was massive counterfeiting of the Continental Currency by the British , and therefore it is hardly an example of a sovereign government that is a monopoly issuer of currency . Additionally , the individual state governments also issued Continental currency independently of the federal government . See : http : **34;8072;TOOLONG ... <p> Confederate money was notoriously counterfeited ( so much so the Confederacy imposed a death penalty for counterfeiters ) , and the South 's productive capacity was decimated as the war continued with the lost of its primary resource : African slaves . I do n't see how either of these cases fail to fit the MMT paradigm . <p> " Hyperinflation results when government abuses its pricing power over money in order to get a claim on real resources whatever they are . " <p> So the question is when does " printing money " reach the level of abuse ? Trader Vic says that when 40 cents out of every dollar a government spends comes from printing money that hyperinflation will follow . He also says the US has reached that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that when 40 cents out of every dollar a government spends comes from printing money that hyperinflation will follow . He also says the US has reached that point . Sounds plausible to me . <p> There is absolutely no basis for your conclusion . You have to analyse how the net financial assets created by the vertical transactions between the government and the non-government sector permeate through the nominal demand structure and the state of excess real productive capacity before you can conclude anything . All the extra currency could simply sit in bank reserves and have been exchanged for other financial assets which would have virtually zero impact on nominal demand ( have a look at the US Federal Reserve balance sheet , for example ) . <p> Alternatively , a very small net injection of public spending could be inflationary under other circumstances . <p> Bill lets say there is a fabulous stimulus success and all equity , property , precious metal , etc markets increase 10x over the coming decade then there is a simultaneous asset crash and all the money managers know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible inflation danger ? <p> " There is absolutely no basis for your conclusion . ... Please provide some decent analysis before you continue your " hyperinflation " thread on my blog . " <p> Trader Vic says he analyzed 30 cases of hyperinflation and that in each case the government first got to printing money for 40% of their spending . I have not done the analysis myself . In Google searches his was the closest I could find to someone claiming to have looked for the common features of hyperinflation the way I was talking about above in " has anyone made a rule " . I am sort of surprised that I could not find any more decent info . <p> Nice blog and interesting stuff . I really think MMT is a very interesting and different view that more people should try to understand . <p> It looks like Trader Vic is getting his info from a book by Peter Bernholz called " Monetary regimes and inflation : history , economic and political relationships " . Bernholz studied 29 cases of hyperinflation and came up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking for and so I have ordered the book . <p> @Vincent I paid a short visit to your page . Just one question : You really intend to sell a 19K 4.23g gold bullion for US$ 200 ? This means a Vincent 19K 1oz bullion costs US$ 1,340.40 . As of today I can buy a 24K 1oz Austrian Philharmonic bullion for US$ 1,309.90 . Given that there 's reputation gap between the Vincent and the Austrian Mint , the Austrian 1oz bullion is legal tender and there 's no liquidity in Vincent bullions I must conclude you are either naive or this is another gold scam . <p> My cheap tester showed it at 19 K. Using XRF test my first 4 coins are 24 K and 5 through 16 are 23 K. I have updated the page . It is just the first 16 coins that are 23 K or 24K and more expensive . These are the first 16 coins ever make in my country , so they will probably be collectors items someday . After this I plan to make 14 K coins , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will probably offer discounts to locals that get very close to the value of the gold . <p> I believe my coins are harder to counterfeit and easier to verify than any other gold coins . With time I think the reputation gap will work in my favor . <p> In general small coins , like 1/10th oz , have a higher percentage premium over the gold value than do larger 1 oz coins . <p> Vincent Cate , I guess the message from history is that when an empire collapses the only thing of any value what so ever is the goodwill of your neighbours . The idea that gold or silver can maintain any value in such circumstances kind of flies in the face of the numerous examples of gold and silver wantonly abandoned in such circumstances eg http : **35;8108;TOOLONG and http : **35;8145;TOOLONG . <p> Buried treasure does not imply people thought it was worthless . Buried treasure means they did not want anyone else to take it . In dangerous times it can be risky to have gold in your house or on you while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are robbed they have a chance of to dig up the rest of their treasure and being rich again . However , sometimes people are killed or not able to return to a place taken over by invaders . Then the gold stays buried . This in no way implies that they did not want that gold . <p> Vincent Cate , if I try and put myself in the mind of one of the Romans or Vikings burying the treasure , I 'd be thinking " I need to get as far away as I can from the people who know I had all that gold and silver " . To me that does not classify as the treasure having a positive value to me . <p> Vincent Cate , I think the crucial point is that those elite Romans and Vikings were people who were expelled from their UK homeland at the time they buried the treasure . We do have Viking and Roman genetics remaining in the UK so some descendants were able to survive 
##473352 <h> A : It depends . There are some cases where it is generally safe . <h> Have your say <p> We 've all been there . You go to make a quick sandwich for lunch , only to find the cheese is sporting a blue and white bloom and the bread is covered in white fluffy spots . <p> Can you attempt a rescue operation by cutting off the mould or should the whole lot go in the bin ? <p> Well , Dr Ailsa Hocking , of CSIRO Food and Nutritional Sciences , says hard cheese is one of the few foods where what you see is what you get , at least from a mould perspective . <p> The low moisture content of hard cheese and its dense structure means mould will usually survive only on the surface , rather than spreading invisibly into the cheese . So it should be safe to cut around the affected area and eat the rest of block . <p> But many other foods , including mouldy bread , are better off thrown away . Not only might the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if a food like yoghurt is old enough to have mould , it might also contain harmful bacteria which could cause a bout of diarrhoea . <p> " If you can see a mould growing , there can be other microbes in it as well . It 's really not worth making yourself sick , " Hocking says . <h> What 's the concern ? <p> There are many different types of moulds that can grow on our food ; the most common include Aspergillus and Penicillium , and Botrytis which you might see as a fur on your strawberries . <p> Some moulds can produce compounds known as mycotoxins . <p> If we eat enough of certain mycotoxins for a long enough period of time , we can become seriously ill . <p> In the worst case scenario , ongoing exposure to certain mycotoxins has been linked to liver cancer , Hocking explains . <p> That would be very unlikely to happen in Australia , where we have very strict food production standards , she says . But it is seen in developing countries where communities sometimes inadvertently use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of damaging your health is always there , so it probably pays to take a careful approach . <p> " A lot of these compounds are carcinogenic . It 's just common sense really . We have enough dangers in our lives , we do n't really want to expose ourselves unnecessarily to toxic compounds , " Hocking says . <h> What 's safe ? <p> Authorities suggest that a good rule of thumb to judge whether a mouldy food can be saved is its moisture content . <p> Foods with a high moisture content such as cooked casseroles , soft fruit and veg and soft cheeses can have mould growing below the surface ? branches and roots they send down into the food ? and you wo n't necessarily be able to see them . <p> The same rule goes for porous foods such as bread and cakes which have become mouldy . All of these foods should be binned if you spot mould on the surface . <p> Of course , certain domesticated moulds are deliberately introduced into our food as part of the production process - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are safe to eat , if a soft cheese that has been made with domesticated mould starts growing other types of mould , it should be discarded . ( It can be tricky to tell , but Hocking suggests looking out for any patches that are a different colour from the rest of the cheese . ) <p> One area of some debate is whether fruit jams and jellies can be rescued if they have developed mould on their surface . <p> Hocking says if you are careful , you can try to scoop off the affected jam ? but it can be hard to do this without spreading the mould around and back into the jam . This happens because all moulds produce spores . These can float in the air and once they settle , start a fresh crop of mould on your food . <p> The US Food Safety and Inspection Service says moulds on jam could be producing mycotoxins and the whole lot should be discarded . However , Hocking expects Australian jams would have a lower moisture content and would not support mycotoxins . <h> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fridge and will even survive freezing . They can also survive in salty , sugary and acidic environments . <p> As mould on our food is so hard to avoid , here are some general guidelines from the US Food Safety and Inspection Service on responding to the problem : <p> Discard all of these foods if mouldy : <p> Luncheon meat , bacon , and hot dogs . <p> Yoghurt , sour cream and soft cheese . <p> Soft fruits and vegetables <p> Bread and baked goods . <p> Peanut butter , nuts and legumes . <p> Jams and jellies - but note Hocking 's advice on Australian jams . <p> These foods can be saved from mould : <p> Hard salami ? scrub mould from the surface . <p> Hard cheese ? cut off at least an inch around and below the mould . Do n't let the knife touch the mould and recover the cheese with fresh wrap . <h> hjt : <h> La la : <p> 10 Aug 2012 1:38:35am <p> Thank you .

##501050 <h> Interpreting the Mean Sea Level Pressure ( MSLP ) Analysis <p> The Mean Sea Level Pressure Analysis is one of the most familiar images in the community . It is compiled from hundreds of weather observations ( synoptic data ) taken simultaneously around the Australian region . It can be seen daily on television , in some newspapers , and on the Web . <p> Its dominant features are the smooth , curving patterns of sea level isobars -- lines of equal atmospheric pressure -- which show the central elements of our weather systems : highs , lows ( including tropical cyclones ) and cold fronts . It incorporates the effects of atmospheric processes at higher levels . Forecast ( prognostic ) maps are also available . These indicate how the weather patterns are expected to develop . <p> Meteorologists use a wide range of information and techniques to formulate weather forecasts . The MSLP analysis does not and can not show all of these factors . It is a fairly simple representation of past and probable future locations of surface weather systems ( highs , lows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useful guide to the weather . <p> Everyone benefits from a better understanding of the MSLP analysis and prognositc charts , especially people whose activities are particularly weather-sensitive -- pilots , farmers , mariners , builders , outdoor sports enthusiasts -- who often find the maps valuable , sometimes essential , to enhance their understanding of media forecasts and help form their own ideas based on local experience . <h> Preparing the MSLP analysis <p> The MSLP anlaysis can be likened to a giant jigsaw puzzle , assembled several times a day ( usually six-hourly ) from thousands of observations taken at internationally agreed times . The Bureau of Meteorology , like all the world 's Meteorological Services , operates a network of its own stations to gather surface and upper air observations . More than 440 paid and volunteer part-time observers also make daily surface observations essential to the national picture . <p> Surface reports usually comprise observations of mean sea level pressure , wind direction and speed , present and past weather , temperature , dew-point ( a measure of atmospheric moisture ) , cloud and visibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally , often globally . Complementary , if less detailed , surface data come from the Bureau 's expanding system of more than 100 automatic weather stations , ship reports , and from drifting buoys in the surrounding oceans . <p> Specialist observers gather upper air information on wind speed and direction by radartracking weather balloons , which may also carry instrument packages to transmit temperature and dew-point information at various heights ( pressures ) in the atmosphere . Some aircraft transmit upper air data . <p> Weather satellite data are a vital part of the analysis process . Australian meteorologists focus on hourly images from the Meteorological Satellite operating in geostationary orbit 36,500 kilometres over the equator . Computer enhancement adds colour for easier interpretation . The animated sequences often shown on television are a particularly powerful analysis tool . <p> The Bureau 's National Meteorological Centre in Melbourne also draws on similarly enhanced images from US and European geostationary satellites , as well as high-resolution images and atmospheric temperature profiles from polar orbiting US satellites . <p> Vast numbers of observations on national and global scale flow to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mathematical models ( equations ) simulate atmospheric processes to produce three-dimensional broadscale weather analyses and prognostic maps which form the basis of weather forecasts for up to four days ahead . The models simulate the physical processes that determine how , the atmosphere reacts to constantly changing pressure , temperature and humidity . <p> Fine-scale surface weather maps are prepared manually in Bureau forecasting offices , particularly the Regional Forecasting Centres in each State capital and Darwin , and Meteorological Offices in Canberra and Townsville . <p> Meteorologists take account of the centrally produced computer surface and upper air predictions , local data and manual charts , and animated satellite and radar images when preparing forecasts and warnings . <h> What do MSLP analyses show ? <p> The most obvious features of the MSLP analyses ( Figure l. is an example ) are the patterns of high and low pressure , and the barbed lines identifying cold fronts . In the southern hemisphere , the earth 's rotation causes air to flow clockwise around low pressure systems and anticlockwise around high pressure systems . ( The opposite applies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes the winds to be deflected slightly inwards towards low pressure centres , and slightly outwards from high pressure systems . Wind strength is inversely proportional to the distance between isobars -- the closer the lines , the stronger the winds . This rule does not apply in the tropics where the effect of the earth 's rotation is weak . For this reason , tropical meteorologists usually replace isobars with streamline arrows which indicate wind and direction without directly relating to the pressure gradient . Shaded areas on weather maps show where there has been rain in the previous 24 hours , and wind direction is shown with arrows that have a series of barbs on their tails to indicate speed . <p> The coverage on media weather charts is usually limited to the continent and surrounding oceans . The Bureau also produces global charts to take account of weather systems interacting with each other over great distances . Global charts are necessary when preparing forecasts up to four days ahead , and framing the monthly climate monitoring bulletins . <p> Figure 1 . Typical MSLP analysis . <h> Typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns is needed when interpreting a map . <p> Easterly winds over the tropics and subtropics incorporate wave-like disturbances which usually travel westward . Important features of the tropical easterlies include the southeast trade winds , monsoon lows and sometimes tropical cyclones ( known as hurricanes in the Americas and typhoons in Asia ) . <p> A high pressure belt in the mid-latitudes ( usually 30-50 degrees latitude ) contains centres of varying strengths which generally move from west to east . Fluctuations in the intensity of these highs ( ' anticyclones ' ) strongly influence the behaviour of the trade winds and the development and decay of tropical lows . <p> The belt of westerly winds south of the high pressure region contains disturbances which usually travel from west to east . Barbed lines indicate the leading edge of travelling cold ( and occasionally warm ) fronts , the boundaries between different types of air . The term ' front ' was applied during World War 1 by European meteorologists who saw similarities between atmospheric structures and the large-scale conflict along battle fronts . <p> Nearer the pole , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-60 degrees South . <p> A high pressure area over Antarctica -- associated with extremely cold and dense air is ringed by easterly winds which form the boundary with the subpolar low pressure belt . <p> These typical features vary in intensity and location according to the season . For instance , in summer the high pressure belt is usually found just south of Australia , while the subtropical easterlies cover most of the continent . Monsoon flows and associated lows over the tropics bring significant summer rain ; tropical cyclones may develop . In winter the high pressure belt is usually located over the continent , allowing westerlies and strong cold fronts to affect southern Australia . <p> It is important to be alert to significant exceptions to this ' normal ' situation when , for example , strong high pressure systems move slowly across the oceans well south of Australia . Closed or ' cut off ' lows may then move across southern Australia or intensify over the Tasman Sea , possibly causing prolonged heavy rain . <p> It is also important to remember that all weather systems have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They occasionally show unusual behaviour . They may become stationary or even briefly reverse their usual direction of travel . <h> Hot or cold ? <p> North to northwesterly winds over eastern Australia on the western flank of a Tasman Sea high . They carry hot , dry air from inland Australia southward over Victoria and Tasmania . With strong winds associated with an approaching trough and cold front , this represents a classic weather situation with extreme bushfire risk . <p> Moist , easterly flow from the Coral Sea onto the Queensland coast causes very warm , humid and sultry weather east of the Great Dividing Range . This air , often susceptible to the development of showers and thunderstorms , is described as ' unstable ' . <p> The cold front approaching Tasmania will replace the hot , dry northwesterlies with southwesterlies carrying cooler , often relatively humid air from waters south of the continent . <p> Such summer fronts are often quite shallow and may not penetrate far inland , particularly if they are distorted and slowed over the Victorian mountains . <p> Very cold , unstable air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria and southeast New South Wales , reducing normal day temperatures typically by five degrees or more . Note the cold front , the low pressure centres over Tasmania and the south island of New Zealand , and the high ( 1036 hectopascals ) over the Bight . Occasionally , rapid interaction with other weather systems around the southern hemisphere can almost halt the pattern 's eastward movement , causing successive cold fronts to bring a prolonged spell of cold , showery weather to southern Australia . <p> Figure 2 . A summer MSLP analysis <p> Figure 3 . A winter MSLP analysis <p> Easterly winds over inland Australia . Although southern cold fronts become shallow and diffuse as they move into northern Australia they often trigger a surge in the strength of the easterlies and this , combined with their extreme dryness , creates a very high fire danger in the tropical savanna region . <h> Rain or fine ? <p> Features on the surface weather chart indicate likely rainfall patterns as well as temperature distribution and wind strength . In general , highs tend to be associated with subsiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows are associated with ascending ( rising ) air and usually produce rain or showers . <p> While cloud can exist without rain , the opposite is not the case . <p> Clouds form by the condensation of water vapour through cooling . Causes of cooling include <p> Convection , which may be caused through air mass instability . It may be initiated by warming of low-level air , forced ascent over mountainous country , or dynamic causes associated with severe weather systems . Cumulus clouds often form as a result of convection . The most exceptional forms are often associated with severe thunderstorms and occasionally , tornadoes . Cumulonimbus , for instance , may reach altitudes above 15,000 metres . <p> Systematic ascent of moist air over large areas linked with large-scale weather systems such as low pressure systems , including tropical cyclones . In mid-latitudes this systematic ascent often occurs ahead of active fronts , or with ' cut off ' lows . This type of rain may be persistent and heavy and cause floods , especially if enhanced by forced ( orographic ) ascent over mountains . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier of mountains or hills . Cloud formation and rainfall is often the result . Australia 's heaviest rainfall occurs on the Queensland coast and in western Tasmania , where prevailing maritime airstreams are forced to lift over mountain ranges . <p> Cold and warm fronts which also cause systematic ascent . A cold front is the boundary where cold air moves to replace , and undercut , warmer and less dense air . Associated cloud and weather may vary enormously according to the properties of the air masses , but tends to be concentrated near the front . As a typical cold front approaches , winds freshen from the north or northwest , and pressure falls . After the front passes , winds shift direction anticlockwise ( ' backing ' to the west or southwest ) and pressure rises . Cold fronts are much more frequent and vigorous over southern Australia than elsewhere . Warm fronts , relatively infrequent over Australia , are usually found in high latitudes where they can occasionally cause significant weather . They are often shown on weather charts over the Southern Ocean . Warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convergence lifting which occurs when more air flows into an area at low levels than flows out , leading to forced rising of large air masses . Convergence is often associated with wave-like disturbances in tropical easterlies and may also occur with broad tropical air masses flowing to the south . Given sufficient atmospheric moisture and instability , it may cause large cloud clusters and rain . <h> How strong will the winds be ? <p> A mean sea level pressure chart shows the direct relationship between isobar spacing ( pressure gradient ) and orientation , and the strength and direction of surface winds . The general rule is that winds are strongest where the isobars are closest together . Thus the strongest winds are usually experienced near cold fronts , low pressure systems and in westerly airstreams south of the continent . Winds are normally light near high pressure systems where the isobars are widely spaced . <p> However , because of a latitude effect winds in middle latitudes are lighter than those in the tropics with similarlyspaced isobars . <p> In Australia , the most destructive winds over broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with some severe thunderstorms , have the potential to generate higher wind speeds , but areas affected are much smaller than these tropical storms . ) <p> Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems in the tropics which , in the southern hemisphere , have well defined clockwise circulations with mean surface winds ( averaged over ten minutes ) exceeding gale force ( 63 kilometres per hour ) surrounding the centre . Tropical cyclones exhibit a relatively clear eye , surrounded by dense wall clouds and a series of spiral rain-bands . The Bureau tracks cyclones with weather watch radar , special service reports and frequent satellite images . Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b)show a tropical cyclone approaching , and crossing the Queensland coast near Rockhampton . <p> Figure 4a . <p> &gt;Figure 4a . <p> Figures 4 ( a ) and ( b ) .

Use of NSAIDs can cause serious side effects , including stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding . NSAIDs can also be harmful when used with other medicines ( including blood-thinning medicines ) and alcohol .. <p> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are commonly used to manage the pain and inflammation ( swelling and redness ) associated with some types of arthritis ( such as rheumatoid arthritis ) and other musculoskeletal disorders . <p> NSAIDs are also used to treat non-inflammatory conditions such as migraine , period pain and postoperative pain , and to reduce fever . Aspirin , in low doses , is an NSAID with blood-thinning properties used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in high-risk patients . <p> Some commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin ( in brands like Disprin ) , ibuprofen ( such as Nurofen ) , naproxen ( such as Naprosyn ) , diclofenac ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How NSAIDs work <p> Prostaglandins are hormone-like chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation , pain and fever , by raising temperature and dilating the blood vessels in the place they are released . NSAIDs block a specific enzyme called cyclooxygenase ( or COX ) used by the body to make prostaglandins . By reducing production of prostaglandins , NSAIDs help relieve the discomfort of fever and reduce inflammation and the associated pain . <h> Side effects of NSAIDs <p> While NSAIDs are effective in relieving pain , fever and inflammation , they can cause unwanted side effects . <p> Gastrointestinal side effects such as indigestion , stomach upset ( including nausea or feeling sick ) or stomach pain are commonly caused by NSAIDs . Use of NSAIDs can also cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract ( gut ) . This is mainly because these medicines also attack the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme ( COX-1 ) that protects the stomach lining from normal stomach ( gastric ) acid . <p> Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors ( or COXIBs ) were developed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of NSAIDs are more selective in blocking the COX-2 enzyme that leads to inflammation and pain , and have very little to no effect on the COX-1 enzyme . However , COXIBs have not completely removed the problem and they can still cause gastrointestinal side effects . <p> Other common side effects of NSAIDs include : <p> Raised liver enzymes ( detected by a blood test ) <p> Diarrhoea <p> Headache <p> Dizziness <p> Salt and fluid retention <p> High blood pressure . <p> Less common side effects include : <p> Ulcers of the oesophagus ( food pipe ) <p> Rectal irritation ( if suppositories are used ) <p> Heart failure <p> Hyperkalaemia ( high levels of potassium in the blood ) <p> Reduced kidney function <p> Confusion <p> Bronchospasm ( causes difficulty breathing ) <p> Skin rash <p> Skin irritation , reddening , itching or rash ( if skin products are used , such as a cream ) . <p> In general , using NSAIDs occasionally rather than every day , and at the lowest dose possible , reduces your chances of developing serious side effects . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with NSAIDs , talk to your doctor or pharmacist . <h> NSAIDs can provide relief <p> While NSAIDs can potentially cause many side effects -- some of which may be serious or life-threatening -- if prescribed under the right conditions and used as instructed , they can be of great benefit . Your doctor can help you consider the benefits and risks of taking an NSAID to ensure they 're the right treatment option for you . <p> When you 're taking an NSAID , always use it cautiously and for the shortest time possible . If you need to use these medicines for a long time ( for example , to manage the symptoms of arthritis when other therapies do n't offer relief , or when you 're taking low-dose aspirin to prevent a heart attack or stroke ) , make sure you see your doctor regularly . <h> NSAIDs high-risk groups <p> Some people are at higher risk of developing serious complications from taking NSAIDs . Risk factors include : <p> Increasing age ( side effects are more common in people aged 65 years and over ) <p> Previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helicobacter pylori infection ( the germ that can cause ulcers ) <h> Be wary of over-the-counter medicines <p> If you already take an NSAID , you may increase your risk of side effects or an accidental overdose if you also take an over-the-counter preparation that contains aspirin or another NSAID . Always check the active ingredient before buying any over-the-counter preparation and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you 're unsure whether it 's safe for you to take . <p> Except when your doctor recommends it , you should not take more than one medicine containing an NSAID at the same time . If you 're taking low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke , you still need to consider the use of another NSAID carefully with your doctor . <p> If you are taking any over-the-counter NSAIDs , tell your doctor or pharmacist , particularly if you are due to undergo surgery or are starting a new medicine . <p> Other general suggestions when taking or planning to take NSAIDs include : <p> Always tell your doctor and pharmacist about any other medical conditions you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ) , including over-the-counter and complementary medicines , such as herbal remedies and vitamin supplements . <p> See your doctor if you think your NSAID may be causing side effects . <p> Be cautious of long-term or high-dose treatment with an NSAID if you are at risk of side effects .

You get built up as the " unstoppables " then get beaten , and it makes the ensuing rage from your fans hilarious . It 's like a group of people who fall into zealotry due to propaganda , and then get found out . Hilarious . <p> Mate EQ is one of if not the most credible journalist who covers AFL today <p> I actually saw this discussed on another thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter with the draft .

Has nothing to do with the value of my example rising or falling , simply that values do n't remain fixed . So you think the reasoning that values do n't remain fixed is wrong ? No point insisting on getting stuck on a rigid interpretation of the example , all that does is fix you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually pretty spot on . <p> No , but that was n't your argument . You did argue one way over the other - there is no denying that . <p> You initially said " given this kind of inflationary perspective , it looks like you 've not only reached that level , you 've possibly surpassed it " . You attempted to use inflation to bolster your argument - but comepletly botched it . <p> No need to get hung up on this though . You only had to admit your mistake and move on . Yet you seem intent on arguing that your reasoning is " spot on " when clearly it is anything but . <p> I actually saw this discussed on another thread elsewhere . Quayle till now has made her bread and butter with the draft . Lots of analysis , feel good stories , and the need to have a good relationship with the recruiters to get a good read on their likely preferences . <p> This is a different beast though , footy politics is much murkier , a hell of a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex . Will be interesting to see how she handles it , and what her final hit rate will be at the end of this . <p> Good call . I like Quayle as well , but I think the moment a journalist starts getting into these kind of stories is the moment they start building a group of people who dislike them . She has been very good with her draft stories , but really , that 's a pretty good gig , if you 're hoping to avoid any enmity from your audience . <p> Every article EQ has written on this topic , you have been calling for the crows to sue her . <p> Will be funny when shes found 100% on the money . <p> again , no I have n't . <p> the particular one , in which she outed VB is the only article I mentioned about suing , at that was on the baisis that it could be considered to have defamed VB . <p> As I said , my issue is not with negative articles on the Crows , my issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . <p> EQ may be " 100% on the money " but that does n't make what she is saying now , a fact - hindsight may support her theory , but that does n't mean she had any factual basis in writing it , she appears to be pretty good and getting a feel for the situation and writing an article that sounds plausible . <p> I realise it can be quite daunting thinking things through for yourself , but give it a try one day <p> Nope ! Think Frank Costa and his comments relating to Gary Ablett . Most clubs have been involved in orchestrating these agreements . <p> Although I 've got ta agree that line about the AFL being aware of the Balfours ' agreement was a little ambiguous . I though it meant they were aware of the agreement with the Crows , but not that Tippett was being directed some of the sponsorship as a third party payment . I could definitely be wrong though . <p> Nope ! I think you 're wrong - just found these articles from 2010 when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revelations of the discussions come as Geelong faces continued scrutiny over president Frank Costa 's admission the club has been scouring the local business community in search of fresh third-party arrangements to help keep Ablett - a move that would contravene strict AFL salary cap rules . <p> Ablett 's agent , Liam Pickering of IMG , yesterday confirmed he was in discussions over new " independent " contracts for Ablett but would not comment on specific deals . <p> He said Costa was wrong to suggest the arrangements were in any way linked to Geelong . <p> " It 's actually not right . Am I trying to source deals as his manager ? Yeah , of course I am . But we do that with other players as well , not just Gary Ablett , " Pickering said . <p> " They 're called independent agreements for a reason , because they ca n't be club endorsed . <p> " It 's not about playing with the footy club . They 've got to be deals that are done separately by his management and in this case it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't actively out there trying to get deals , put it that way . " <p> Geelong chief executive Brian Cook weighed into the furore , saying Costa had been " misinformed " when he said the Cats were seeking personal sponsors for Ablett . <p> " Sometimes presidents get it wrong and this time Frank got it wrong . Third-party or independent arrangements are not supposed to be catalysed or initiated by the clubs and we ca n't do that and have n't done that , " Cook said on SEN radio . <p> Cook yesterday admitted Costa was misinformed and " wrong " with his ambitious plans to target businesses , given any payments arranged by the club must be included in the salary cap . <p> Geelong 's offer is expected to be significantly less in dollars , though it can close the gap somewhat if Ablett 's management can secure third party deals that cash in on the commercial value of his name , especially in the Geelong area ; under the rules , those deals have to be deemed independent of the club in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and you know it . Even since his deal got knocked back by the AFL you Dees fans have up in arms about these agreements . <p> It 's got nothing to do with Scully specifically , it 's got to with the fact that the AFL has one rule for some and another for others - their backflip now on the Judd/VISY deal is incredulous and shows it should never have been endorsed in the first place . I do n't know how they think they can get away with changing the rules mid-stream but that 's the AFL for you . <p> However , serial killers are usually not caught after the first murder , there is usually a number of incidents leading up to them getting caught and they usually get sloppy and make mistakes the more they become complacent . I wonder if this is a similar scenario were they just got sloppy with the Tippett case and if there are a number of minor breaches which lead up to them making the Tippett deal . <p> You do n't think cheating leads to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability that the AFL have caught the Crows on the first offence ? As we have seen with other clubs and other sports , once you get away with it then they usually escalate . <p> You do n't think cheating leads to a pattern of cheating ? I am just asking what is the probability that the AFL have caught the Crows on the first offence ? As we have seen with other clubs and other sports , once you get away with it then they usually escalate . <p> I justthink you give to much Credit to the current administration <p> Trigg is a career AFL pencil pusher ( this is my opinion ) , career pencil pushers do n't generally do things that wo n't have a direct benefit to their future . <p> This debacle reeks of utter incompetence or a never of niavity not seen in football since we rquired Laurence Angwin <p> However , serial killers are usually not caught after the first murder , there is usually a number of incidents leading up to them getting caught and they usually get sloppy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is a similar scenario were they just got sloppy with the Tippett case and if there are a number of minor breaches which lead up to them making the Tippett deal . <p> That is because you are not classified a serial killer unless you have committed multiple murders . I am pretty sure plenty of murderers have been caught after one murder that had the potential to commit multiple murders and become classified as a serial killer ! ! <p> A serial killer is traditionally defined as an individual who has killed three or more people 1 2 over a period of more than a month , with down time ( a " cooling off period " ) between the murders , and whose motivation for killing is usually based on psychological gratification . <p> it will be interetsing to see how the AFL is going to address this wide spread disease , and the comparitave level of justice they decide is appropriate for adelaide and the serial match fixers at melbourne . <p> I also ca n't wait until Monday where our club actually gets to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles from the media . If this is no way near as bad as the media have portrayed it , I expect a lot of 360s on BF Monday arvo . <p> 5AA does it anyway ( would love to find out Graham Cornes Toyota were the 4th unnamed party who facilitated payments ) - did n't they have the Crows Chariman on there 2 weeks ago defending itself ?

##538651 <h> Future shock <p> After a worrying report on the effects of climate change on Victoria by 2030 , Liz Minchin looks at how key bodies are preparing for the challenges . <p> IT IS bad news , but do n't panic . <p> Yesterday The Age revealed that a new report for the State Government had concluded that by 2030 climate change is set to be a signifi cant threat to key services and infrastructure across Victoria , including everything from water and power to roads and bridges . The seriousness of the report 's findings surprised even one of its key authors , the CSIRO 's Paul Holper , who said that " we have to plan as if we ? ll be living in a different country " . <p> And that 's the key . While Victoria can ? t stop global greenhouse emissions from continuing their current steep increase , we can cut our own emissions within the state , and just as importantly start planning to adapt to life with hotter , more extreme weather . <h> EMERGENCY SERVICES <p> Victorian Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads wherever he goes : climate change is already happening , so start thinking now about how it might affect your home , your business and your community . <p> " If you want a classic example of what we 're in for , how is it that we can get snow during the middle of a bushfire on Mt Buller on Christmas Day ? And on the same day in New York , a day when people should be ice-skating on Central Park lake , they were sun-bathing in the park and it was 25 degrees ? That may well be the sort of situation we 're thinking forward to , and planning to have to deal with . " <p> A 20-year veteran of emergency services , Mr Esplin has been involved with major disaster relief efforts such as last summer 's massive bushfires , as well as Victoria 's response to terrorist attacks such as the September 11 and Bali attacks . <p> Mr Esplin backs predictions in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that Australia will be at far greater risk of natural disasters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as worse heatwaves , storms , and floods &lt;0x2014&gt; all of which could stretch the emergency services to their limit . <p> " So some of the things we 're already thinking about is that we ca n't take our volunteers for granted . It 's one thing to expect people to be available to help out , but it really does challenge the system when you have fires that last as long as the ones we had over summer , and when several states have major fires burning at the same time . That meant we had to bring in people from New Zealand and the US to help us out . So we do have to rethink the way we manage bushfire risk . " <p> Addressing a Victorian tourism conference in Melbourne yesterday , he suggested people with " their head buried in the sand " should start listening to " the majority of scientists around Australia and around the world , ( who will ) tell you it 's real " . <p> " I 'd like to stand here and tell you climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't plan for it . But I ca n't . We will plan for it , you should plan for it . <p> " If it does n't happen to the extent that scientists are predicting , well that 's great , that 's a really good outcome . But if it does happen and we have n't planned , then we are all responsible . There is enough warning for all of us to know that we need to do something about it . " <h> HEALTH <p> Life in Victoria is set to get much hotter . <p> Every year , Melburnians sweat through an average of 30 days above 30 degrees , while up on the Murray at Mildura , it is more like 82 days a year . <p> But if global greenhouse emissions continue to climb at today 's rates , temperatures are also expected to rise sharply . <p> By 2030 , that means Melbourne is likely to experience up to six more days a year of 30-degree-plus days , while Mildura could experience an extra 28 days of hot weather . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as increasing the rate of respiratory problems and infectious diseases , medical experts have warned that more people are likely to die because of the expected increase in heatwaves . <p> Professorial fellow at Monash University 's School of Geography and Environmental Science , Neville Nicholls , explains that whenever the thermometer tops 30 degrees , the number of people over 65 who die on that day jumps by 20 to 25 per cent . <p> " The situation we expect will get worse with excess deaths from heatwaves unless we improve the way we adapt to hot temperatures , " he said . <p> For that reason , Professor Nicholls is working with Victoria 's Department of Human Services to develop a heatwave alert system to reduce the number of older people who die on hot days . <p> After the European heatwave in 2003 , in which 35,000 people died , parts of Europe developed their own alert systems to try to prevent a repeat of the catastrophe . " The system varies from country to country but most of the European nations have very well thought-out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're just starting to do it , " he said . <p> " Since we 're not sufficiently well adapted to avoid these excess deaths now , our worry is unless we change something then we 're going to struggle in the future as these numbers of hot days and hot nights increase . " <p> The alert system is likely to start in Melbourne and eventually be rolled out statewide . The Bureau of Meteorology would warn in advance of very hot days , and people would be urged to make sure they are hydrated to minimise the risks to their health . The department would also send people to nursing homes to advise the most at-risk people of how to protect themselves from the heat . <p> The work is still in the early stages , but the department is doing research to gauge how hotter temperatures affect ambulance callouts , hospital attendances and mortality . <h> BUSINESS <p> Timothy Piper got a nasty surprise when he picked up The Age yesterday morning . <p> The Victorian director of the Australian Industry Group says news that the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable to climate change was not a total shock . <p> But Mr Piper , who represents the state 's major employers , admits he was taken aback at the speed and extent of the potential damages identified in the report , which he says will have major implications for industry planning . <p> " The main issue that struck me was just how soon it 's likely to affect us , " Mr Piper said . <p> " I mean , we 're not talking about this affecting the next generation even , we 're looking at changes that are going to happen in our lifetime . So we ca n't put off the need to plan for this and make more electricity and water savings . " <p> But Mr Piper warns that consumers need to realise that if industry starts paying more for basic resources like water and electricity , prices are likely to rise . <p> While some industries and individual companies have been alert to the threat of climate change for several years , a recent poll of big and small Victorian businesses found that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their greenhouse gas emissions . <p> The survey also revealed that although business leaders overwhelmingly wanted to do more to become more sustainable , many do n't know where to begin . <p> For that reason , the Victorian Employers ' Chamber of Commerce and Industry together with the Environment Protection Authority recently launched a free scheme to help small and medium businesses cut their greenhouse emissions , along with lowering water and energy use . <h> WATER <p> Two years ago , the CSIRO warned that climate change would eventually become a massive drain on Melbourne 's water supplies . But few people expected to see that forecast come true quite so soon . <p> In 2005 , Melbourne Water commissioned the CSIRO to model likely long-term impacts of climate change on the city 's water , sewerage and drainage systems , in what was thought to be the first study of its kind prepared for a water authority . <p> That study warned that water yieldsin the city 's catchments were likely to have fallen by around 8 per cent in 2020 , and by 20 per cent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in drought since late 1996 , the past year has been particularly bad , with the lowest rainfall in Melbourne on record . <p> Even with the hope of better rains on the horizon , Melbourne Water managing director Rob Skinner says the water authority now expects that the past decade 's much drier conditions are likely to be repeated in coming decades , rather than switching back to the wetter weather of the previous half century . <p> " Whether that change has been due to climate change ca n't be proven , but we 're assuming a fundamental change has occurred and planning accordingly , " Mr Skinner said . <p> After receiving the bad news from the CSIRO in 2005 , the State Government agreed to speed up the reconnection of the Tarago Reservoir , boosting capacity by up to 21 billion litres by 2010 . <p> Last October , the Government released its 50-year planning strategy to secure enough water for Melbourne and surrounding areas , the Central Region Sustainable Water Strategy , nicknamed the " blue bible " . <p> That strategy is now set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Melbourne Water scramble to answer their critics that they have been too slow to adapt to a changing climate . <p> The State Government is now looking into four options to deliver more water for Melbourne : recycling stormwater ; pumping recycled water down to the Latrobe Valley to use in power stations and pumping freshwater back to Melbourne in return ; desalination ; and a revived plan to bring water south over the Great Dividing Range , assuming irrigators would be willing to trade the water away . <p> The three latter schemes in particular would all require massive amounts of power to work , putting extra strain on Victoria 's power infrastructure , which the State Government 's report on climate change risk identified as being vulnerable to blackouts in the hotter , drier decades to come . <p> While the State Government has promised to make any new water source " carbon neutral " by buying enough renewable power to offset that extra energy , they are yet to reveal key details about those four options , including their greenhouse impacts and the increased costs to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is being examined right now : " I think the public will see solutions that do take these ( impacts ) into account and that they will appreciate that it ca n't be done - that it takes months rather than weeks to resolve these more complex issues ...

##546551 <p> BIS Shrapnel was out this week with some startling predictions for the Australian economy and housing markets . It 's worth taking a look , although let 's remember that their recent form on both the economy and housing has been questionable . <p> For example , in July 2010 -- near the peak of Australian house prices -- BIS Shrapnel 's chief economist , Dr Frank Gelber , made the following bold prediction on the future direction of house prices in Australia my emphasis in all quotes below : <p> Frank Gelber gave members at a Real Estate Institute of Victoria lunch a very optimistic forecast for house , as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald . <p> " At the end of the day , we have n't got a bubble in our residential market . We 're undersupplied , not oversupplied ... House prices will go up another 30 per cent over the next three years " ... <p> " We 're not over-geared , we 're not overvalued and we 're not oversupplied , " he said . " I ca n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more comfortable and optimistic about investment in the market " ... <p> In that same speech in July 2010 , Dr Gelber also made overly ambitious forecasts for the Australian economy , noting that it would be largely unaffected by the turmoil in Europe and the USA : <p> Problems in Europe and America were unlikely to affect Australia 's economic outlook , he said . " They are real problems ... but they wo n't affect us a great deal , " he said . " Our recovery now is already well entrenched and they wo n't stop it . " <p> Almost 80 per cent of Australia 's exports go to Asia , Dr Gelber said . " We 're much more dependent on what happens in China . " <p> " We 're talking about average growth over next five years of GDP of about 3 to 3.5 per cent , " he said . <p> Dr Gelber said that while the GFC 's impact was n't yet over it had triggered a correction following the financial engineering boom . " That correction is pretty much over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick-up again . " <p> This week 's new forecasts predicted an economic recovery pretty much everywhere except for Victoria , with the sting that there 'll be a bit of a rally in interest rates : <p> AUSTRALIA will slowly move into a broad-based economic recovery in 2012-13 -- but Victoria is in danger of missing out , leading forecaster Frank Gelber of BIS Shrapnel predicts . <p> Unveiling new forecasts in Melbourne yesterday , Dr Gelber predicted that Australia 's growth rate would slowly accelerate from 2.2 per cent in 2011 to 3.5 per cent in the 2012-13 financial year . If realised , that would be its best performance for five years . <p> But there would be two downsides . Interest rates would start rising again , with the Reserve Bank likely to deliver seven rate rises in the next 15 months . And apart from New South Wales , the south-east of the country will continue to struggle . <p> " The Australian economy is expected to strengthen further on the back of improving consumer spending and continuing heavy investment in the mining sector , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be slow to set in . We expect the increased activity to prompt businesses outside mining to start increasing investment from later this year , after an extended period of underinvestment . <p> Ahem ... seven interest rate rises ? If that was to occur , the Australian economy would likely grind to a halt and home prices would suffer sharp falls in value . It would also destroy BIS ' own forecasts of moderate house price growth to 2014 . <p> In my opinion , official interest rates are more likely to fall than rise given the broad-based weakness in the non-mining economy as well as the deteriorating employment outlook . <p> Nevertheless , BIS does make some sombre comments on Victoria 's growth outlook , which I broadly agree with ( see here for my own analysis ) : <p> Mining investment would continue to boom , while trade-exposed sectors such as manufacturing , education , tourism and agriculture would continue to shrink . Government would also shrink , while the great mass of other service industries would keep struggling . Victoria would be main casualty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's difficult to see where Victoria 's growth is going to come from , " Dr Gelber told BusinessDay . " We see investment in Victoria falling . " <p> BIS Shrapnel predicts building starts in Victoria will plunge 20 per cent in the two years to 2012-13 , while all other states would grow by between 6 and 21 per cent . Housing starts would fall 28 per cent , bringing Victoria back to the pack after years of outperforming the rest , while non-residential building would shrink 10 per cent . <p> " Victoria has weakened considerably over the past six months . It 's lost its drivers of growth , " Dr Gelber said ... <p> " There will be a broadening of investment in Victoria , but what is really missing are infrastructure projects , " he said . " Investment is the primary driver of growth and Victoria needs better infrastructure to lift its productivity . <p> " These are things the Victorian government could do . But we ca n't see the next round of infrastructure projects coming through . Victoria is just falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Gelber 's assessment that the Federal Government is unlikely to achieve their forecast budget surplus by 2012-13 as well as his recommendation that the Government invest in innovation and reduce red tape : <p> Dr Gelber hit out at the federal government 's pledge to deliver a budget surplus in 2012-13 , but said the collapse of its revenue base would see it fail to get there . " Fortunately , they wo n't achieve it . But they should n't even try , " he said . <p> He urged the federal government instead to invest in " soft infrastructure " , such as the CSIRO and other forms of research and development , and to take an axe to the jungle of over-regulation that is clogging up business . <p> In a seperate report this week , BIS Shrapnel also delivered a subdued outlook for the Melbourne housing market , which is suffering from a dearth of first home buyers and relatively high rental vacancy rates : <p> First home buyer demand is still weak in Victoria , and one of the reasons why it is still weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-home buyer incentives fairly elevated , which has pushed forward demand . <p> " First-home buyer demand is very important because it creates demand at the bottom of the market for the next group of buyers to trade up . <p> " It 's that turnover and activity that flows to price growth and also brings more investors into the market . " <p> Zigomanis says this churning of property created by first-home buyers entering the market wo n't be felt as strongly in Victoria . <p> " In Victoria the weakness in first-home buyer demand is permeating through to the rest of the market , " he said ... <p> Victoria 's first home bonus and regional bonus , which awarded grants of $13,000 and $6,500 respectively to qualifying first-home buyers , are both set to expire at the end of 2011-12 ... <p> Looking at the overall state of residential markets , Melbourne remains one of the weak spots , with vacancies heading up towards the 3% mark , which indicates a balanced market ... <p> " In fact in some areas of inner Melbourne we feel that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is significantly less pressure in the Victorian property market than is evident in New South Wales , " says BIS Shrapnel . <p> So there you have it . Some pretty eye-predictions from Australia 's BIS Shrapnel . <h> 116 Responses to " " 7 rate rises in the next 15 months ? " <p> I thought BIS Shrapnel 's reports and prognostications were bought and paid for by the REIA ? Their housing industry pronouncements became so unreasonably bullish that commenters on news articles would frequently refer to the company as " BS Crapnel " , not unreasonably . I noticed that they faded into the background as their credibility became more and more suspect . <p> most are out of business if they are wrong too many times but not economists , 90% do worst than coin tossing but they still publish their crap.University should scrap these " Schools of Economy " and fake PhDs . <p> Yep -- more victims of the mm deep analysis by the MSM . We have a Salem witchcraft mentality with natural disasters -- first with Christine Nixon who was responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- responsible for decades of inaction and negligence resulting in properties all along the floodways of Brisbane . <p> We leverage off the mining boom 's good will to borrow more debt and spend it on residential housing . <p> I hate to say it but our economy is totally tied to interest rate movements . 7 Interest rate rises will crush the housing sector along with the services sector . I guess for every job created in mining we lose 4 jobs in other industries . <p> Just for the record , I 'd love 7 rate rises . It would allow me to build capital faster ready to pounce on the carcases faster too . It would help destroy this painful and rubbish " slow melt " . Please , I hope these charlatans are actually right this time . <p> I disagree with you . A lot of research is not profitable to the one that performs it . Unless people do it in their spare time most of the research that benefits society but not the individual has to be funded by someone . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and why most inventions of importance came about by some revolutionary thinker or someone 's garage . If it was just up to the market we would n't have most of the technology we have today . <p> Besides the CSIRO has made some profitable discoveries . As much as they are public funded from what I 've seen they do produce some good results . At least the government gets the money -- most inventors of really revolutionary technologies do n't get rewarded for their efforts at all . <p> At least if CSIRO got out from under the government thumb it could dispense with PC nonsense like having smoking ceremonies in new buildings to " dispel the evil spirits " . No scientific organisation should be giving credence to that sort of superstitious palaver . <p> I can not believe some people believe that govt has no business funding research and development -- especially here at MB , because at MB the bar is certainly high and most are able to think and argue rationally . <p> Hmm . Lets see what kind of " research " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the industry : 1 . New ways to dig the dirt , faster and faster . 2 . New studies demonstrating that " climate change " is pure baloney. 3 . Study of human emotions at the time they shop ; such study will convincingly demonstrate that happy people shop more and those who do nt spend have some psychological problems . 4 . Novel ways to make money on the property , based on enslaving one 's grandchildren . 5 . New ways to rip your customers off , all of the industry will welcome this . 6 . More competition to BIS crapnel in producing research reports that everyone wants , a report a dime. 7 . How to hold down most booze without having to pee so often ; and so on ... <p> Is this what we want ? Because that is what the " industry " here would really like to have . <p> The CSL story tends to support private investment over public . COH too . There is a myriad of Bio tech floats . A couple of them are going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large part by average people . Thats my beef ; average people do nt get new tech ? Not true . Cant expect the plebs to support new tech ? Ridiculous . <p> If I could now take the time to respond to the seven points listed above . <p> 1 . New ways to dig the dirt , faster and faster . Damn straight . Good at it too . Its been an export earner for decades . God bless The School of Mines . They are genuine life savers to those that utilise their nouse. " primarily funded from independent sources " <p> 2 . New studies demonstrating that " climate change " is pure baloney . Nothing new about these studies . It is propaganda from both sides of the argument . Ongoing claptrap . Of course a Gov't sponsored entity will never stoop to propaganda . <p> 3 . Study of human emotions at the time they shop ; such study will convincingly demonstrate that happy people shop more and those who do nt spend have some psychological problems . Done to death already by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain science that will be used by marketers as you suggest . <p> 4 . Novel ways to make money on the property , based on enslaving one 's grandchildren . Our Government , both elected reps. and public service , created this one through inappropriate incentivisation . And private citizenry took to it like ducks to water , forgetting about the grandies . A government sponsored cockup top to bottom . I wonder if the CSIRO or some other reputable research group could do a forensic expose on how best to unwind this mess ? Who would sponsor that ? <p> 5 . New ways to rip your customers off , all of the industry will welcome this . Nothing ' new ' here ; it was ever thus . A Gov't backed CSIRO will not negate this ' problem ' from any angle . Our Gov't is truly in love with its GST receipts . And it does not care how it augments them . <p> 6 . More competition to BIS crapnel in producing research reports that everyone wants , a report a dime . No one competes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an unbreakable market corner in their stock of trade . Private money wont attempt to take on such clear superiority . So what do we get ? Bugger me look at this Macrobusiness place ! It 's going off . Amazing <p> 7 . How to hold down most booze without having to pee so often ; and so on ... You see a dollar in that ? or maybe a societal payoff ? I 'm interested if the CSIRO is . But if the Gov't is involved , nuh , check ya . <p> The Big Four are some of the worst . I 've had the pleasure of critiquing some of their bought and paid for economic/market papers and they literally make things up . It 's the modern equivalent of alchemy where utter bullshit is lipsticked over with a crude layer of nonsensical arithmetic . <p> But there is a large market for that kind of advice -- my rough estimate is that at least 50% of all professional services firms are engaged in justifying the decisions of clients in opposition to facts/logic as opposed to informing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , or if they do the principles will just set up a new shop . <p> Ca n't you see , Peter , that your answer is part of the mantra that is always trotted out ! Yes , wages HAVE increased to date , but will they continue to do so with ever increasing competition to our labour costs from overseas workers ? I do n't need to re-hash the hollowed out economy bit . But for all of your reasons for a property price rise continuing , real or nominal , the thought has to be that ' what has been is not guaranteed to be " . The world has changed about us , Peter . Some see it , others do not . 2012 is not 2007 and 2017 will not be 2012 . At some stage all cycles stop and reverse . This may just have been it ' for us ' . The last 40 years has given us something that none of us foresaw in the closed economic world of 1972 . Much is different ; the game has probably ended . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying debt that supports them , Peter . It 's that simple . Interest rates are failing to support the system as they would have in previous times ; people are n't borrowing-to-spend , they are paying down debt with whatever surplus monies lower interest rates give them . And I ca n't see them putting their heads back in the debt-noose . We 're all getting older , those of us that hold the chips , and as we sell , we do n't re-buy . We sigh a sigh of relief ; take the cash and retire . Now that 's a generalisation , of course . But where are the new debtors going to come from , Peter ? Those that can afford the product that ' we ' have to sell ? <p> DRBob127 -- Janets position is that prices can not rise . That is not a reasoned argument , its a philosophical notion . To achieve a society where the value of assets did not rise , we would need the value of the currency to rise and fall as productivity rose and fell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current principles of economics , and it 's not something that I 'm prepared to argue about today , I 'm busy as it turns out . If you wish to look at that notion , the Chris Leithner has written on that , and his works should give you some insight on the issues involved . <p> I do n't accept the position that Janet argues , but I have no intention of becoming embroiled in a circular argument . <p> I made a simple statement originally that I see the market as being stronger than the general view here . People can take that on board for some further thought , or leave it . It does n't matter to me . Do you really see a world where everyone shares the same view . Is no one allowed to be either more bullish or more bearish than the concensus view here -- I hope not . <p> Your further question of where will prices be in the future is a nonsense question that can not be quantified until that future date has arrived . <p> There is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I choose to make predictions , I will choose the time and place and not be bullied into it by anyone . <p> Janet , it 's not fair to suggest that ONLY property market spruikers have misled consumers ( BTW Peter , I 'm not implying you 're a spruiker ) . I 've worked in the investment management industry for 15 years and seen it happen in all types of markets ( anyone remember asian tiger economies , the technology bubble , or dare I say it , Euro sovereign debt ) . <p> It 's up to individual investors to decide where and when they invest their capital . To suggest that spruikers are to blame for the property bubble is very one sided -- nobody forces anyone to make an investment in a speculative asset class ( including Australian property ) , they do it based on their own personal greed . <p> Personally , I try to hold a diversified portfolio of assets , including property . I 've made some gains and losses from time to time , but I only ever blame myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists or anyone else . <p> Greconomics , I agree that people have personal responsibility . However , they read news articles about property to educate themselves , seek advice from financial planners and investment professionals to be better informed , and then make major financial decisions based on the advice they are given . Can you justify an investment company still advertising super funds to be used to invest in property ? Is that ethical and professional in your view right now ? <p> One aspect of the BIS Shrapnel figures is that the NBN Co has used them in their investment figures and as such the new housing starts BIS forecast would occur are underwritten into that plan or else NBN Co has to obtain more money from the government . As the shortfall in new housing is growing the NBN Co ' cap in hand ' to Gvt is more likely . <p> " An invaluable book . . . Today 's real estate markets are booming and Lereah makes a convincing case for why the real estate expansion will continue into the next decade . This book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household looking to create wealth in real estate . " -- DEWEY DAANE , FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF GOVERNORS <p> " An important book , whether you agree with the author ( as I do ) that housing will remain an excellent investment or are convinced that home prices are poised for a plunge , David Lereah lays out a compelling vision of housing as a continuing positive investment -- and how you can profit from real estate if you already own the home you live in , are looking to move from rental housing to an owner-occupied home , or want to use real estate as an investment . " -- DAVID BERSON , CHIEF ECONOMIST , FANNIE MAE <p> That 's just sad . When did western democracy become so corrupt ? Or is it that new media allows us to see the corruption that was invisible before . Maybe it is true that democracy is the best of evils but we 're being done over constantly . <p> I 'm hoping that over a very long horizon the combination of greater interconnectedness ( ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving levels of education among the population , will reduce the ability of pollies and lobbyists to swindle us so badly . <p> This information-age allows people to gather their intellect who are united solely by their interest ( not geographic location , social status or other demographic ) in a topic and access to a web-browser . <p> I share your optimism in the potential of this new media but , like all fundamental adjustments to society ( eg. new housing value paradigm ? ) these things take time . <p> The forecasts of BIS Sharpnel , courtesy of Google . Read into them what you will ! <p> June 19 , 2006 : " Mr Mellor said investors who bought housing around the market 's peak in early 2004 will have to wait until 2011 before they see any capital gain . " <p> December 12 , 2007 : " Research group BIS Shrapnel is forecasting price rises of up to 10per cent next year despite its expectation of a rate rise about March next year . " <p> June 15 , 2008 : " BIS Shrapnel study author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause house prices to increase in most capital cities . " <p> October 14 , 2009 : " House prices may surge about 20 per cent or more in some of Australia 's largest cities over the next three years , driven higher by on-going shortages . " <p> November 30 , 2009 : " SYDNEY rents are set to climb more than 21 per cent over the next three years , the forecasting group BIS Shrapnel says . " <p> December 21 , 2009 : " BIS Shrapnel senior project manager of residential property Angie Zigomanis predicts steady growth of about five to six per cent in established residential property next year . " <p> October 12 , 2010 : " House prices in Sydney , Perth and Adelaide are expected to grow by about 20 per cent over the next three years , but annual double-digit growth is over , a housing report predicts .

" <p> June 27 , 2011 : " The report by BIS Shrapnel , released today , dismisses forecasts of sharp falls in prices over the short to medium term and predicts prices to remain steady through the rest of 2011 " with some cities even showing moderate price growth over the two following years " . " <p> I 'm not an economist , but did enroll in some economics subjects at Uni , have studied many seminal economics texts ( Wealth of Nations , General Theory of Employment , Obelix &; Co. ) , have worked in the vicinity of and had many informal conversations with professional economists , read economics blogs populated by similarly amateur and earnest enthusiasts , and once had recurrent dreams about Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand drowning in an enormous dish of salted herring . With these qualifications and depth of experience in mind , I would like to add the weight of my support to Dr Gelber 's bold -- but perfectly sane &; defensible -- forecast for continuing rate increases . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of his forecast from my own ( much derided , but strongly argued ) hypothesis of 15 rate rises in 7 months . <p> @Peter Fraser , sorry to drag you back into this but you appear to quite like the odd wordy response , so I assume you wo n't mind . <p> " I 'm in the camp that believes the housing market is stronger than all here imagine -- that 's from personal observation . " <p> Can you provide some examples of the stronger market you describe ? What is your definition of ' stronger ' in this context ? Price / quantity of transactions / FHB activity / etc ? To some , a ' stronger ' market might mean more transactions at lower prices . <p> My personal observations are that Perth is holding up reasonably well at present in the mid and lower tiers , with the Western suburbs and more premium end seeing difficulties selling at prices 10-20% below peak . Head South to the seachange / coastal districts and there appear to be few transactions and examples of even larger price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting their obligations so are able to either keep it on the market in hope of achieving their price , or pull it for a period and try again later . I would n't describe this as a strong market . <p> Ben , that 's a reasonable request . But after this I will have to do some work , so do n't expect me back soon , though I will have a look later one . <p> Firstly upon looking at my statement again , perhaps I should have said " many " and not " all " <p> I 'm rather busy at the moment , working on a larger than normal number of loans to buy and build . The only refinance that I 'm doing is also buying another house , so it 's not just a refi . <p> I know a few other brokers who are also very busy , so that indicates a market that has n't collapsed . <p> I was speaking to a BDM for an invoice discount lender ( strictly business lending ) and he remarked " what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing home loans " <p> So do you get the picture -- it 's not just me who is busy . <p> If you look at this graph - http : **34;726;TOOLONG ... you will note that Sydney has come up from its low in January , Perth is coming off it 's low quite strongly , Melbourne is up from the low around the 1st Feb although now heading down slightly , Brisbane is off its low recorded on the 3rd of December . You can research the rest yourself . <p> You can see that it is a miniscule rise , but January is normally not strong . It is also stronger than the market collapse that many are openly discussing here . <p> Now you could argue that the Google result is just a search term that does n't necessarily result in someone buying a house , but it 's an indicator of market interest , and from a reliable 3rd party . <p> So I 'm using what I can see , what others who I regard as reliable are telling me , the running data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I ca n't tell you whether the uptick is a result of price falls , it might be because my clients are very happy with the prices that they have paid . Surely the lower rates play a part , and slightly looser lending policies also make a difference . <p> Now I could have it all wrong , so you tell me what you think of that information . I would like some constructive non-abusive feedback . <p> Thanks Goldilocks -- I do n't think it is increased market competition . Banks were more competitive before the rate reductions than they are now . Banks ca n't make people buy , they have to want to first , so something is enticing them to buy -- lower prices , good interest rates -- hard to say . If that RPData graph was heading down -- which it is in Adelaide -- then I would say it was lower prices only , so I think it is more than that . <p> Thanks Peter . I am sure the lower prices are attracting people in -at the lower end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just based on macro picture of the world ) that the slow melt will continue and deeper falls are likely in the second half of the year . But as the stock market has shown in the past 6 months , real world does n't always perform the way you 'd expect based on macroeconomic reading . Cheers . <p> Goldilocks -- I just do n't know either . It 's a here and now thing for me . Usually a rate change or even talk of a rate change will make a difference . <p> Honestly I 've see the market turn in the space of a few days when I used to process documents for one of the big four . One week we were normally busy , and the next week there was nothing . It goes upwards almost as quickly . <p> I take your observations as being positive activity at the margin ( from a price outlook perspective ) . But I think the structural headwinds ( to prices ) remain strong . <p> I also think things like Google search terms are perfectly reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For what it 's worth , I 'm not one who is trying to will the market one way or another . I do believe that Australian house prices are grossly overvalued and I also believe this has been and is detrimental to the qualitative aspects of the Australian society that my generation ( I am mid 30s ) enjoyed and to the Australian psyche generally . But I also believe in calling things as I see them . I think it 's pretty hard to argue that there has n't been some stabilisation in prices in the short term . My opinion is prices will continue to be biased to the downside , for reasons outlined in detail elsewhere . <p> None of us can " will " the market . It will do what it wants to do . We all want global peace , but we 've got nothing of the sort so far . <p> I have to take into account what I see in front of me , I ca n't ignore it . I also ca n't wait for the out of date ABS reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generals waiting for homing pidgeons to bring word of the battle from the front line . <p> By the time the pidgeon arrives the battle could be lost . <p> As a result when I see a trend I open my mouth , which makes me no friends . <p> That 's life I guess . It does tell me a lot about human behaviour though . <p> Happy to give you some info anytime , but I wo n't always have time to do a detailed post , and if I 'm copping flack I kinda lose interest in getting the message through . <p> I know what you 're saying about no-one being able to will the market . But the media is full of people trying . Cite Gittins telling me the only thing to fear is fear itself , be confident , get out there and spend and everything will be just fine . <p> Yes they are in the ' it 's just begun camp ' but they are encouraged to be so . <p> I can only be sure of what I see . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see what can stop that apart from large rate falls . Really every state will perform differently , and even within each state performance will vary from area to area depending on the local industry . <p> High interest rates ... would n't that mean we have a high dollar ( ' cause the whole world is dumping their currencies into our markets to make money ) and the " person on the street " does n't have much money to spend in the over-priced retail shops ? So , we have high-unemployement then ? justaskin ' <p> " Mav -- AussiePrime anyone ? " But , surely not in Australia ? We 're different here , *aren't* we ? AussiePrime in 10 ... 9 ... 8 ....

I hate generalizing but we have become too precious which means that something like good hygiene and good manners is used too often as offensive for political and media gains . <p> I am certain the only people making a big thing about these comments are the media , Labor politicians and the well educated migrants who have had the opportunity to know that good hygiene and good manners is very important for all our well being . <p> Traveling through the Northern Territory I was shocked , disappointed and mainly sad when I realized that the fowl smell was emitted from the four indigenous women that had just walked passed me .

It is too readily available to new arrivals . As these benefits are significantly more than they had previously , they see no need to go out , get some qualications or experience and get a job . This in turn results in massive cultural ghettos like Punchbowl , Cabramatta or Arncliffe , where no one has a job ( unless you count crime as a job ) and does n't desire one . In short , we should remove this obstacle to their assimilation by removing the social security benefits ( excluding Medicare ) for a period of at least 5 years . <h> jf says : <p> 02:51pm 11/01/12 <p> nihonin says:01:40pm 11/01/12 <p> " So if they 're ignorant and just continue on the same way all the time , ' you 're all good with that ' , as the saying goes .

She mearly stated that it was relevant and a potential barrier to immigrants fitting in . <p> I am startled that so many people think that it is a good thing to make it difficult for immigrants assimilate if they wish to . <p> I 'm sure that Gambaro 's own experiences mean that she would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own immigrant family was .

You say sorry when you bump into someone . You say sorry when you steal a generation of indigenous children . You say sorry when your wife finds your secret apartment and your mistress . <p> But you do n't say sorry for contentious , divisive remarks . Ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisive because some people agree with them . <p> The most mixed and useless metaphor I have for it is the cat in a gumboot . You ever see a cat get stuck in a gumboot ? It 's f***ing hilarious . Cats ca n't walk backwards , they get somewhere they should n't be and they 're stuck . A gaffed politician is the cat in the gumboot . They ca n't walk backwards out of the boot any more than they can turn back time to before they said the stupid thing . <p> Now the media , the interest groups , whoever you pissed off , they 're giving your gumboot a swift kicking and you think saying sorry will stop it . It wo n't . Sorry is just like having a few air holes cut into the rubber . You wo n't suffocate , but it wo n't stop the assault . <p> The only way out is through . You got ta eat you way out . <p> Teresa Gambaro should have known , probably did know , that a significant proportion of people agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People who probably ca n't read for that matter . Joe and Jane Bogan in Hatesville , North Queensland . Jim and Jennifer Chigger from Chigwell , Tasmania . Bob and Beryl Boofhead from the Sutherland Shire . <p> They agree . They believe immigrants are dirty , job stealing terrorists and they think forcing them to wear deoderant is a good thing . So what do you acheive by apologising ? You make the Bogans of Hatesville and the Chiggers of Chigwell and the Boofheads and pretty much all of West Australia question wether you really believed in what you were saying in the first place . <p> That leaves Gambaro thus - the Left , hated her to begin with , still hate her because she said it in the first place . The Centre did n't know who she was , hate her for saying something so ignorant , and see right through her apology . The Right agreed with her sentiment , cheered her on , but now question her strength of character . She lost three segments of the political spectrum through her apology where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , paraphrased via Captain America , " When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move , your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth , and tell the whole world -- No you move .

" <p> Ah , no . From what I read in The Australian - which by it 's own admission is a right-leaning newspaper - they reported the facts . Just as she said them . She went on radio , too , and said pretty much the same thing . She knew she what she was saying was going to be controversial , but she is a bull in a china shop and said it anyway . THAAT is why the NLP is telling her to apologise and distancing themselves from her . Say what you will about them , but Abbott and Co. do have a brain cell or two and they know ( particularly when the rest of the world is laughing at us ) that she screwed up . <p> So get over the " blame the media " line . It 's her f*ck up and everyone with half a brain or an ounce of objectivity can see that as clear as day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambaro is an award winning Brisbane seafood restaurant and ' gambero ' is Italian for crayfish .

Huh ? <h> Wickerman says : <p> 11:40am 11/01/12 <p> OOC as a defence is valid , but only when it is valid . Quotes are frequently taken out of context , &; used by media and/or opponents .

The officer(s) agreed . <p> Media use a section of a statement or speech , without the content of the full statement or speech . This is in their quest to get the " gotcha " quotes . People who then use the gotcha quotes are feeding the downward spiral . <p> Gambaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheapening genuine OOC cases .

Tory , just because someone has BO it does not follow that they are dirty : your assumption that they are is offensive . <p> I would not for one moment assume that a person that had a hearty BO was not clean .

One of the first things the corporals did was teach all the recruits ( 18-30yos ) how to shave and to brush our teeth . We could have found it offensive and we did actually have a bit of a laugh about it , but they were smart enough to show us anyway because they knew that in a group of 30 young men there was bound to be someone who had no idea what they were doing . <p> There are Australian born citizens who do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOME people emigrating from the third world have no idea how to either .

But by applying the blow torch like Tory has ( twice now ) and wilfully refusing to understand Gambaro 's underlying message Tory has further ensured that politicians will not speak frankly and instead will resort to safe sound-bites and sanitised , politically correct press releases . <p> I look forward to Tory 's future article on the sanitisation and media-aware politician-speak . <p> ' There is an expectation that people will be washed and clean before going out in public ' . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade were not washed and/or clean .

The fact is , in modern Australia , if you have an unpleasant odor people will minimise their interactions with you .

In fairness immigrants are probably overrepresented in the stinky ponk stakes though dreadlocked hippies are no treat for the nasal cavities either . <h> jf says : <p> 02:55pm 11/01/12 <p> Gambaro did n't even say that the odor was unpleasant or wrong .

They said those things . " <p> Gambaro was taken out of context . <p> She said that immigrants should be helped to understand Australian cultural mores and traits . She then used the fact that Australians typically use deoderant and that obvious body odour was not usual . She did n't suggest that immigrants were dirty . She did n't say that cultures were body odour was n't such an issue were wrong or offensive . <p> However , Tory ( amongst many , many others ) has written two articles specifically ( deliberately ? ) taking her out of context by suggesting that Gambaro was critical of cultures where body odour is n't offensive and/or suggested that immigrants were not hygienic .

The first article was by a completely different Tory . <p> And I still do n't agree . The sentence she uttered was not taken out of context . When you see the full quote , the meaning does not change . When you see the sentences preceding and following , the meaning is the same . To actually take someone 's words out of context , the meaning must be deliberately changed , which was certainly not the case in any of the examples posited in the article . My point is , we have lost sight of what it actually means to be taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't think what she said is offensive at all - this in itself is a valid position to take . However , that does not mean that the meaning of the words she uttered have been changed by the media in any way . <h> jf says : <p> 09:04am 13/01/12 <p> James1 says:11:07am 12/01/12 <p> I did send a previous reply but it got lost in cyberspace . <p> " You have taken Tory out of context , jf . " <p> How so ? She was critical of Gambaro and I addressed her criticism . <p> " The first article was by a completely different Tory . " <p> Mea Culpa . <p> " The sentence she uttered was not taken out of context . " <p> I believe that it was . I believe it was Gambaro 's intention to say that immigrants to Australia should be given some education/information on Australian cultural mores , traits , proclivities etc ... In doing so she used , as an example , the different attitudes in Australia to body odour than in some other countries . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . In fact , it was each Tory that assumed that because someone came from a country in which body odour was acceptable that it followed that they were n't hygienic . Whilst someone with poor personal hygiene will probably smell , it does n't necessarily follow that just because you have body odour that you have poor personal hygiene . It was n't Gambaro that made this leap of logic ; it was those that were attacking her that did . <p> Thus , the context of her comment was that immigrants should be provided with education and training . Her comment was attacked for apparently being critical of immigrants for their level of personal hygience . Ipso facto , she was taken out of context . <p> I think that it is drawing a long bow for you to say on the one hand that it is perfectly valid to say her comment was n't offensive and then on the other say that critisim of her comments for being offensive were n't taking her out of context . <p> If her comments were n't offensive , then any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those comments out of context . <h> Wauker says : <p> 02:52pm 11/01/12 <p> In a nut shell it appears to be the role of a journalist to take everything out of context if they do n't agree with what they " sense ' is said .

Cultural differences abound and we should be able to talk about them without hysteria . <p> If anything , I think this issue has brought out the bigotry of a lot of supposedly high-minded people towards their fellow Australians . Will there be an apology for their particular brand of " racism " ?

So what if Gambero thinks some immigrants should wash and use deodorant ? Some of them probably do , as do some Australians.Does that mean we should just shut the f**k up and pretend its not true ? <h> paul r says : <p> 03:54pm 11/01/12 <p> Did n't take long , did it ?

I expect it may have something to do with the social strata that we draw our migrants from and their education levels - cultural and dietary variations not withstanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these immigrants start implementing personal hygiene into their daily routine after hearing this from Gambaro then it will have been worth it .

The best yet , by a longshot . <h> Wolf Schmidt says : <p> 07:20pm 11/01/12 <p> Finally a politician is honest and is villified for it . The fact is that some people stink like pole cats , in the workplace , supermarkets , library , publich transport etc . It is pretty obvious they not only do n't wash themselves , but will neither wash and change their clothes . The truth is no longer welcome in this buggered up society . <h> Stan says : <h> Andy of Sydney says : <p> 11:24pm 11/01/12 <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> That has been evident for decades , Wolf . The advent of political correctness spelt the death of truth . <p> The truth is , certain people do smell . Whether it is because of a genetic quirk or the food they consume on a regular basis , they smell unpleasant . Curries , for example , is a great producer of stink if consumed in enough quantities and for long enough periods that it starts to come back out from one 's pores . A high ( 30% ) protein diet also brings about BO and halitosis due to excess ketones ( which are poisonous , by the way , and whose build up can eventually kill you ) . Dehydration of any sort can cause halitosis , amongst other things . <p> I need not go into who are the most ideal candidates for curry overkill or protein stupidity , do I ? <p> Some groups generally stink more than others , just as some groups tend to be generally shorter and some tend towards a more muscular build . Those are the facts of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square peg of fact into the round hole of ideal is just stupidity personified . Saying that all people are exactly the same whether we are black or white or yellow is lying to oneself and others . Clearly we are NOT all the same , or you wo n't have the comparison of black , white and yellow . Even beyond that , if someone were to say that I am the same as my sister , I 'd laugh in his face for being an absolute dill ( my sister would probably get angry and kick him in the nuts , but that is another story ) . We are not all the same . If we were , we 'd all be robots trundling off an assembly line . <p> What is more important is what we do with the knowledge that we are all different ( once we have acknowledged it , of course ; something that some people would never be able to do due to blatant pigheadedness and faux moral outrage ) . Now , that would be something that is worthy of further discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Tory , <p> We all heard how some particular nationalities do have a certain kind of body odor &; it is nothing new , right ? The Chinese sort of smelling of garlic , Indians certain kind of curry and the Middle Eastern Cultures as well because of certain spices they tend to use in their cooking . But to me this is old news , just because the young generation are very aware &; careful about the way they might actually smell like to the outside world . <p> Speaking from personal experience I have never had the pleasure of meeting such people ! May be I should consider myself lucky . At this day &; age we are also smart enough to invest in a deodorant for such purposes . <p> However , I do have one suggestion for Ms Teresa Gambaro which is being very careful about making very child like , insulting comments about the rest of the population . It is very distasteful &; uneducated to say the least ! I just want to know if her ancestors travelling on boats did have the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal hygiene of course should be taught at primary school level to all school age children as well as refraining from making racist remarks &; put downs about other cultures . Kind regards to your editors . <h> Matt says : <p> 08:02am 12/01/12 <p> I do n't understand the problem here .... She thinks these people require a lesson in personal hygiene to help them assimilate , they probably do and it probably will help them assimilate . Different hygiene standards here in Australia than in other less fortunate countries . <h> prosperity says : <h> RANK FRANK says : <p> 08:51am 12/01/12 <p> HEY ANYONE EXPERIENCED THE LONDON METRO ON A HOT SUMMERS DAY ? IT is absolutely disgusting brings you close to vomitting . Gambaro is being blasted for telling the truth . Aussies like a daily shower , use deoderant - make fun of unwashed POMS and others . Would you like to work in an office with 1/2 a dozen B O workers ? Everyone should be aware of hygeine and be reminded of it ! Even tell a smelly cab driver he stinks ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity says : <p> 09:42am 12/01/12 <p> One other thing . Australians travelling in Asia get a little hot and sweaty and then smell to their hosts like a stale dairy , on account of our diet that is high on dairy products . Smelly people are like people with accents - everyone else has got one , but we have n't . <h> Paddy says : <p> 10:14am 12/01/12 <p> I think it is demeaning and racist to take the moral high ground and not to try to help people be accepted easily into our community . Having BO and low hygiene does cause substantial issues socially and in the workplace . You would not hesitate to help guests understand the way things are done in your home and it is expected new employees are assisted with an induction package when starting work . It is therefore the correct and proper thing to do to help new migrants or people coming to this country for short term work to understand the expectations of our community . <p> Whist Gambaro may have been able to phrase her message a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then have a person who may not understand or be aware of potential issues ostracised before they can address them . <p> My business employs a diverse group of individuals and the induction has been forced , by employees , to include reference to personal hygiene , the use of a tooth brush , deodorant and the expectation of the business and fellow work colleagues and cleaners in regard to how to use a male and female toilet . <p> People can be very cruel and to not assist people , who are not aware that there can be potentially an issue , is wrong . I can not understand how people can sit back and take the attitude " let 's watch what happens " and when a person is embarrassed and / or ostracised try blame someone else . Then again , many Australians have lost there pride and backbone because they can not be bothered thinking about how to help . <h> jhamiltonwa says : <p> 10:18am 12/01/12 <p> I remember many years ago reading through an information leaflet for postgraduate/postdoc students going overseas to study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal hygiene standards and counseled that if incoming students did not meet those standards it would impair impair their ability to make friends and work well with their colleagues . It specifically stated that these standards are higher than those considered acceptable in Australia . <p> The leaflet went on to recommend showering twice a day , meticulous use of deodorant , washing hands before and after touching food etc . <p> We read snippets aloud to one another in the morning tea room , made the usual jokes about crazy Americans , but I would hope that those who did travel there were grateful for the heads up . <h> pepe le pew says : <p> 01:16pm 12/01/12 <p> Come one come all ! That 's what multiculturalism is about is it not ? I think that diversity adds to who we are as a people . Neverthless I do find all these cultural ' differences ' can be confronting and uncomfortable at times . There does n't seem to be much universal cultural blending at my local Westfield 's . In the food hall for instance , where many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of diffusion or absorption . Most people stick to their own groups .

##612451 <h> Excess Baggage #2 -- doing the same thing each time &; expecting different results is the definition of insanity ... <p> This is the second article in my series dedicated to those individuals who have been struggling with their health and weight their whole lives -- remember that it is not always about exercise and eating ... <p> When trying to make any sort of positive change in our lives it is important to identify what exactly we have been doing in the past that has not worked for us . I find that a lot of the people that I come across seem to think that the only reason that they are not having success with improving their life style is because they are not good enough or have " failed " at something others told them should work . All that this situation does is make the individual feel defeated and worse about themselves . What we often do not consider is the possibility that we have not failed because we are useless , but we have failed because what we are trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight loss or living a healthy , balanced life , we need to look at that word " balanced " and realise that trying to get everything " perfect " will pretty much guarantee that we fail . Perfection , regardless of who you are , or how beautiful you are , or how rich you are , is unachievable . Many of the people that I work with have the misconception ingrained into their brains that in order to achieve and maintain a healthy life and body weight they need to categorise everything into two definite boxes -- good and bad . This can apply to everything in life and probably the biggest area that I see , is in terms of food and nutrition . This is called Black and White thinking . What we should be aiming to do is live a life that sits in the middle of these two extremes , a life that does n't reward you for eating " good " foods and punish you for eating the " bad " ones , but a life that rewards you for having a nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of resistance when I present this theory to many individuals battling to over come their weight or body issues . There are so many people that tell me " Oh no , I ca n't eat anything processed , or anything high in sugar and I can never , never eat chips because they make me put on weight straight away . " These comments are often coming from people who need to lose a considerable amount of body weight in order to be healthy . All I can say to this is : <p> " Look at your history . Has this belief system of not being able to eat certain things , or believing that certain things are good and bad , really been working for you ? Are you where you need to be ? " <p> The other thing to consider is that all of the people that I have met in my life who uphold a truly balance approach to their bodies and to food all maintain a more than healthy body weight without restricting themselves to " good " and " bad " categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hear people say " Oh she can eat whatever she wants without putting on any weight , I will never be able to do that , she is so lucky ! " . <p> She is not lucky , she is just brave enough to practice balance . <p> And this over flows into everything in life that you may have had a streak of " bad luck " with - work , being stressed , relationships , always being tired , fighting with your children etc , etc . Unless you are willing to sit down and honestly identify what you are have being doing so far that has not been working , you are more than likely going to repeat the same pattern ... and I speak from experience . <p> Homework : What have you been doing so far in your life that has not been working for you ?

##637651 <h> PAGES : <h> Thursday , September 13 , 2012 <h> Do you want a polite answer or do you want the truth ? <p> It is a national day dedicated to inspiring people to ask each other regularly , ' Are you OK ? ' . The day aims to prevent isolation by empowering people to support each other through life 's ups and downs . As someone who has suffered depression and loves to talk about how I really feel , I love that there is a day set aside to motivate and encourage other 's to show greater love and care to all people . <p> I have had my share of interesting experiences over the years with people asking me if I am OK . We all know there are people in our lives who are simply acquaintances and regularly ask us how we are and if we are good . For this type of people in my life I always smile and reply , yes .. I am good . Simply because I know when they ask me how I am , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello because they like you , they care and they want to quickly touch base with you . The polite answer is all they have time for and a lot of the time a polite answer is all I want to give them ! <p> There is nothing wrong with having polite answer people in your life . They can be great for your self esteem , make you feel like someone is thinking of you and make you smile . You can share a quick hug , a quick kiss on the cheek and even a quick laugh . What we need more of in our lives though are people who are willing and open to hearing the truth of how we are really going . Who when they ask you if you are OK , are actually prepared to hear what you have to say , are prepared to show some extra love if needed and who are not afraid of what will come out of your mouth . They ask you if you are OK because they really truly care and want to support you . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which happens on a regular basis because being a mother to seven cherubs sure is full on some days ! and someone happens to asks me if I am OK ... I often look at them and reply : <p> " Well , do you want a polite answer or do you want the truth ? " . <p> People respond in three ways to this . <p> 1 . They make a joke and laugh and leave . <p> 2 . They tell me everything will work out fine because it always does and leave or <p> 3 . They stop , they ask me again how I am really going and listen . <p> Words ca n't describe how much I appreciate those people who listen . Often all I need is to ramble out what is bothering me and then I can move on . Sometimes you just need to tell someone , you just need to say the words out loud and you really are not looking for any advice , you just want to say it to get it off your chest ! <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges , we all need support . What we all need more of is people who are prepared to hear the truth . Who will give a hug , give a listening ear , who will rub an arm , who will look at you with kind eyes and who will tell you that you are not alone with how you are feeling . Feeling alone is one of the worst feelings ever ! We are never , ever alone with how we feel ! <p> Now one last thing I want to say on this topic . <p> One of the things I have seen a lot of in my time are new Mum 's shell shocked after having a baby . I see them smiling and pretending to be alright , surrounded by other women who are smothering the baby with love but forgetting about the mother . Sure they tell her she is looking great , that her baby cherub is super cute and she has done a wonderful job in creating such a gorgeous baby but I do n't see enough people actually asking the mother if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " Are you alright ? I mean really alright ? How did the birth go ? How are you coping ? Are you getting enough sleep ? Are you feel depressed ? " <p> Women need to talk about childbirth . It is often a traumatic event . We need to know we are not alone with what we just went through . We need people to talk to about how bad we can actually be feeling after having a baby and I am sure that if more people asked new mothers how they really were and they had someone to talk to , we would not have so many women with post natal depression . <p> For me , I have done what I just described so many times . I have stood there dazed , in pain and pretended all is well . I have put on my fake face and pulled it off many a day . Many people asked me how I was but few actually asked me how I was really going . To those who did ask me I would reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have sanitary pads stuffed in my bra as I am leaking so much milk , I think I have mastitis , I have so many stitches down below I have lost count and I think after all that pushing I have hemorrhoids ... ummm ... Yeah ! I am totally fine ! ! " <p> Now I know not everyone needs to know this information and you do n't want to tell it to everyone you know but it is important to have several people you can tell it to , to laugh about it , to ask advice from and to have tell you that you will heal and things will improve ... eventually ! <p> You do n't have to be an expert to support someone going through a tough time in life . You just need to be able to listen to their concerns without judgment and take the time to follow up with them on how they are going at a later date . If you really do n't know where to start in asking someone if they are OK , there are some great tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to tell people you are not OK . We all have times and season 's in our life where we are not OK . There is nothing wrong with that . It does n't mean you are weak or crazy or stupid . It means you are real and that you feel . I also have to say that it is common sense that if you want people to ask you if you are OK , you also need to ask other people if they are OK . It works both ways . Nobody likes someone who is always dumping on them but is never available to listen when they need it . Be the type of person you would love to have in your life and you will attract people who will be loving and kind back . <p> This post kind of turned out a lot longer than I thought and I really could go on about this topic for a lot longer but my main message today is that please take the time to ask people if they are really OK and it may surprise you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way you are . <h> So , tell me if you want ... Are YOU OK ? <h> 14 comments : <p> Such an excellent post Naomi ! I asked a friend after the birth of her 3rd child how she was , she brushed me off with talking of inconsequential things , I grabbed her shoulders and looked her in the eye and said " I asked how you are ! " She burst into tears , she was not OK , she was not coping and later that week was diagnosed with PND . I always ask people twice because I care xx <p> Very powerful Naomi . And you are so right - it is more than ok to have " polite-answer-people " in your life . I think we all have those that we do n't WANT to share our problems with . But so important to have those we can divulge everything to . xo <p> Simply , no Im not ok.Im having a bad week.I have no one to open up to and my husband holds a different opinion on the subject thats tormenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on myself for solving my own issues.Probably , not healthy but it has to work for me : ) <p> Naomi , you are such a great writer , you convey emotion in your words really well . <p> Thank you for a great post . I myself have writen a post for today and although I am not yet " better " I am OK with where I am in my journey and I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel . I can see it , I just ca n't reach it yet . <p> I think for a lot of people the problem is they do n't even know how to articulate that they are not ok because a lot of the time they do n't know the reason why they are feeling depressed . I also agree Naomi that there are certain people you would n't want to open up to , but finding the ones who you can trust with your innermost thoughts is not an easy thing . <p> Naomi- what a post . You are a mind reader or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truthful and I have polite friends . I guess it hurts when you confuse the two . I am a midwife who has given birth to 3 boys . Apparently I should know what I am doing , I do n't need any help , I just am a good actor : put on the " face " and it 's all good . Thanks for being truthful on such an important day . <p> Lovely post ( again ) Naomi ! Myself , I 've been feeling lately like coming out of a fog , I have a two and a half year old and a nine month old and I 'm feeling more able to manage everything I have on my plate . Hope everyone who has posted that they 're not well gets the support they need . Also hope

##703750 <h> Getting Pregnant -- Changes You Can Make to Help Your Body Prepare <p> If you 're planning to have a baby , it 's a good idea to start thinking about your health and lifestyle as soon as you want to start trying or , even better , a couple of months before you stop using contraception . There may be medical issues you have n't thought about yet -- such as whether you 're up to date with your vaccinations -- so it 's worth going to your doctor for a check-up . <p> With some methods of contraception , such as the male and female condom , the cap , diaphragm and natural family planning , you can start trying to get pregnant as soon as you stop using the contraception . <p> With other methods , such as the combined pill and contraceptive injections , it can take some time for your cycles to return to normal after stopping the contraception . You may therefore want to come off the pill a couple of months before you wish to start trying for a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ahead when it comes to healthy eating : if you 're eating well before you get pregnant , you 'll have all the right nutrients to support your baby from the day of conception onwards . This means eating regular , balanced meals , lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and cutting down on ' fast food ' and processed food . You should make sure your diet includes <p> Carbohydrates -- complex carbohydrates such as pasta , rice and cereals are better than processed carbohydrates like white bread , cakes and biscuits . <p> Fruit and vegetables -- try to eat five portions a day , bearing in mind that the more colourful the fruit or vegetable , the more nutritious it is . <p> Protein -- you can get the protein you need from meat , fish , eggs , pulses and beans . <p> Milk and milk products -- these contain lots of calcium , which is important for bone development <p> Government advice is to start taking folic acid supplements ( 400mg a day ) from when you start trying to get pregnant and throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement helps in the healthy development of your baby 's spinal cord . <p> It 's also a good idea to make sure you 're getting plenty of vitamins when you 're pregnant . Vitamin supplements should however be taken to complement a healthy diet , not to replace it . <p> It makes sense for you to be fit before you get pregnant because pregnancy ( and looking after a new baby ) puts lots of strain on your body . If you 're fit before you get pregnant , it will be easier for you to keep active when you are pregnant . Exercise can also help improving your mood and energy levels , not to mention reducing stress , which is a good thing when it comes to conceiving . <p> If you 're underweight , you may need to put on some weight , because nature is notoriously unwilling to let women who are too thin get pregnant . Being overweight can also get in the way of a successful pregnancy . So the best thing is to try and achieve as ideal a weight as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to give you information about a healthy weight for you . <p> It 's best to avoid all these substances while you are trying to get pregnant and throughout your pregnancy . <p> If you smoke , then giving up will improve your chances of having a happy pregnancy and a healthy baby .

##704352 <h> Golden age myth exposed <p> Australian Financial Review <p> 15 February 2001 <p> The last few months have not been a good time for economic miracles . As late as November last year , we were still being told how the miraculous ' New Economy ' had put an end to the business cycle in the United States . By Christmas , however , the Internet shakeout had turned into a full-scale collapse , with dozens of failures and downsizings every weak . Moreover , the downturn has spread from the flashy but economically inconsequential dotcoms to the large , and massively indebted , telecom sector , while the chronic decline of manufacturing has accelerated . <p> Belief in miracles is still strong , however , most notably with the idea that Alan Greenspan can make the whole problem go away by making marginal adjustments to interest rates . The longer such naive optimism clouds the thinking of US investors , the more the necessary adjustments will be delayed and the worse will be the subsequent pain . <p> If the American ' New Economy ' miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have performed a statistical vanishing act . Claims that microeconomic reform has delivered massive productivity benefits are based mainly on experimental estimates of multi-factor productivity made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics . <p> Initial estimates of multi-factor productivity growth for the period from 1993-4 to 1997-8 were hailed , notably by the Productivity Commission , as evidence of a ' miracle economy ' with multi-factor productivity growth rates exceeding those of the 1960s ' golden age ' . Moreover , whereas until the 1990s , capital productivity had declined as the capital-labour ratio increased , in line with standard economic theory , the ABS estimates showed increasing capital productivity during the 1990s . <p> When I checked the latest estimates , released late last year , I was surprised to find that this miracle had disappeared . The estimated rate of recent multi-factor productivity growth had fallen from a stellar 2.4 per cent to a rate of 1.7 per cent , fairly typical for the expansion phase of a business cycle . Moreover , instead of miraculously rising , capital productivity was falling in its usual unsurprising fashion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance since 1998 . However , the main action came from a revision of the earlier estimates of the capital stock and capital productivity . On inquiry , I found that this revision was actually made at the end of 1999 , and was the subject of an update released shortly afterwards by the Productivity Commission and available on their website . <p> This finding was comforting in one way . Ever since the first claims of a productivity miracle , I had argued that a finding of rapid growth in capital productivity was inconsistent with relatively weak measured investment . By raising its estimate of the growth rate of the capital stock and lowering its estimate of capital productivity growth the ABS has resolved this puzzle . <p> On the other hand , I was dismayed to realise that I ( and as far as I can tell , most other economists ) had missed the release of the revised statistics , and had continued to argue on the basis of the Productivity Commission 's original paper . In view of the wide publicity given to the original claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of revised estimates by the ABS and PC should have attracted so little attention . <p> Using the revised statistics , and assuming we are now approaching the peak of the current expansion , it is possible to make an assessment of a complete business cycle , beginning at the last cyclical peak in 1989 . Since 1989 , Australia has seen annual labour productivity growth of 2.6 per cent , capital productivity growth of -0.8 per cent , multifactor productivity growth of 1.2 per cent , and output growth , for the market sector , of 3.4 per cent . <p> The most startling feature of these numbers is the lack of any startling features . On all counts , output and productivity growth rates in the most recent cycle have been almost exactly equal to those for the entire period since 1965 . Performance has been better than that of the 1980s , but not as good as that of the 1960s ' golden age ' . <p> In macroeconomic terms , the recent cycle stands out as one of low inflation ( an average rate of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 8 per cent ) . The last five years have been particularly unimpressive , with unemployment falling only 1.5 percentage points despite steady expansion in output . Far from being miraculous , Australia 's performance over the 1990s has been pretty ordinary . <p> Professor John Quiggin is a Senior Research Fellow of the Australian Research Council ,

Each story will also be featured on the White House blog , and we are working together to bring more strong female role models to the forefront . <p> Erin Schrode is a name that many of you may not know ( yet ) . I however , have been hearing this name for years . I started hearing about Erin in high school ( we both grew up in Marin County ) when she launched her Teens for Safe Cosmetics campaign and subsequently Teens Turning Green . She launched this program at an incredibly young age because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the mainstream cosmetic brands were using . She also knew that while people her age could n't make the decision to " put solar panels on their homes , they could change the lipstick or shampoo they used " , and just that small shift in lifestyle could be the start of a 24/7 eco-conscious life style and mind set . <p> Erin is a 20-year-old woman from Marin County , California who considers herself an " eco-renaissance " woman . When speaking to Erin you hear one thing over and over again , and that is that no matter what you are fighting for , or trying to change in the world , education must be at the center . " It is through education that you can actually change the world " she says . Changing the world that we live in is something Erin believes we can all do , and her excitement , passion , and eagerness to do something and do more is so sincere that in our short Skype session I found myself becoming restless for a challenge and a cause . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand ' tremendously . As she grew up and as her life started changing and seeing new challenges the movements she created grew up with her . When she enrolled in NYU and started preparing for her move across the country to college she used " Teens Turning Green " to show how you could have a completely green dorm room . She wanted to prove that " style and sustainability could go hand in hand " , and she did . <p> The Schoolbag is Erin 's latest venture . She visited Haiti after the devastating earthquake left the country in rambles . After seeing the damage on TV Erin says she knew she had to " get to Haiti as soon as possible , and just find someway , anyway at all , to help " . While working in Haiti Erin overheard a group of aid workers and teachers talking about how if they had the supplies to teach kids they would do it themselves , so that despite the tragedy and tremendous loss these kids could maintain their education and have hope for a better life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on Facebook to fund her latest project , The Schoolbag . She wanted to contribute to them directly and decided the best way to do that was to give them the physical tools they needed to educate . " The kids wanted to learn and the teachers wanted to teach " she said , " they do n't care where they do it , in a tent or a collapsed building , they just need the materials to get by " . The initial goal was to send enough supplies for 11,210 ( the date of the earthquake : 1/12/10 ) . After a lot of hard work they were able to send over enough supplies for 14,000 kids . Because of Erin 's work there are 14,000 children in Haiti with the physical means for a better education . The direct difference she 's made is remarkable and so inspiring . <p> Erin told me she 's constantly asked how she does so much . Her response was simple , " How can you not ? How can you stand by and watch what 's happening in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all take a cue from Erin and try a little harder to do more within our own lives and the lives of others .

##760352 <p> The internet offers a world of opportunities . But it also brings some new threats a lot of parents and young people do n't adequately understand . <p> The tragic murder or 15 year old South Australian girl Carly Ryan by a 50 year old Victorian man who travelled to Adelaide after grooming her on a social networking site brought home to many of us how badly our outdated laws deal with the new threats posed by the internet . <p> The fifty year old killer had pretended to be a 20 year old youth online in order to win over Carly 's confidence . With the support of Carly 's mother Sonya I introduced into the Senate a Private Senator 's Bill which would make it illegal for an adult to misrepresent their age while communicating with a minor online . <p> As I see it , the logic of the Bill is simple . Right now police can only act if an adult makes an explicit threat , or physically assaults a victim . <p> Why wait until the perpetrator is physically close enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give police the power to act decisively and more importantly to act early . <p> The Bill has not received the support of the Government or the Opposition and civil liberties groups have labeled it an attack on personal liberties . <p> This line of argument seems ridiculous to me . What about Carly 's right to be free from being murdered ? <p> This Bill would make lying to a minor the offence . Police could act before the attacker could get to the child . <p> The recent murder of Sydney teenager Nona Belemosoff by a man she also met through Facebook tragically showed that the sickening crime against Carly was not a one off . <p> The other troubling trend emerging from social networking sites like Facebook seems to be the tasteless and hurtful posts that pop up after tragedies like the recent murder of Queenslander Trinity Bates . <p> Do n't basic rules of decency dictate that if you would n't say it to somebody 's face , do n't say it on Facebook . <p> Adding to the problem is the fact that social networking sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after intense online lobbying . <p> That is why I proposed the creation of an Online Ombudsman who could lobby on behalf of the Australian people to have offensive material taken down more quickly . <p> The Ombudsman would only be able to make a request on behalf of the Australian government , but hopefully this would carry more weight with the social networking sites than emails from concerned readers have in the past . <p> Just today I readily agreed to support Carly Ryan 's mother Sonya with the expansion of the Carly Ryan Foundation which she has set up to encourage the safer use of social networking sites . <p> I admire Sonya , and her desire to protect children from the kind of unthinkable tragedy that befell her daughter . <p> If she is given the opportunity speak out , I am sure young people and parents alike will listen . <p> We need a 21st century approach to this 21st century phenomenon . That approach needs to be part education and part legislation . <p> I am not about censoring the internet , and do n't support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work , and may lull parents into a false sense of security . <p> But I do support trying to make the internet safer with tougher laws and by creating a greater awareness that the internet brings risks as well as opportunities . <h> 43 comments <h> Criminologist says : <p> 06:18am 20/05/10 <p> You probably have n't thought this through . <p> How many millions of times does lying on the internet occur in the world , every day ? It will be physically impossible to police due to both the frequency of occurence and also the inability to establish if an offence has occurred . For example , how will the user know that they have been targetted by someone online who has lied about their age , name or any other matter ? How will Police investigate the matter ? Will they attend every residence of every complaint to establish whether someone lied over the internet ? That 's a lot of man hours and to be honest would involve thousands if not tens of thousands of more Police to be hired , just to establish who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knives to be banned because someone was stabbed to death . <p> It probably has n't gained political support because it 's not physically able to be enforced . <p> ' The Ombudsman would only be able to make a request on behalf of the Australian government , but hopefully this would carry more weight with the social networking sites than emails from concerned readers have in the past . ' <p> Since the provider of the service may be located overseas , then how would they be bound to observe Australian law ? You yourself , say ' hopefully ' which indicates that not even you are confident it would work . <p> Additionally , if people lie and no harm is done , what is the point of investigating them ? The current laws aimed at protecting ' physical well being ' adequately provide all of the necessary elements to protect online predators , probably another reason why your proposal does n't have support . <h> Criminologist says : <h> stephen says : <p> I once read a Criminologist say , lying is the first step to criminality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and it is worth trying very hard to discourage its use . <h> BTS says : <p> 10:07am 20/05/10 <p> stephen , <p> I think that 's a little extreme . <p> People lie every day who are n't criminals . <p> Another issue , that I did n't mention , was what murderer/criminal is going to fear being caught lying if he has worse intentions ? ( He is after all a criminal , so he wo n't care about lying ) . <h> DG says : <p> 10:21am 20/05/10 <p> Stephen , <p> Lying is one of the first tools of language that a child learns to use . It 's used primarily as a self interest tool ( i.e " I did n't eat that lolly " when they fear getting in trouble for doing so ) however , as one gets older , it is used to get things as well . Our use of half truths and so forth improve as we get older and our deceptions more minute . Still , it is a far cry from criminal behaviour . <p> Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' agree ' with our boss , we compliment our partners and friends we shit blame , we appease the guilt that others feel and so on . <p> I suppose this depends on how you define lying - I have assumed that you mean the use of words to represent a thing as being a fact , in the absence of ( or contrary to ) relevant evidence of the representation . <h> At Work says : <p> 02:14pm 20/05/10 <p> Criminologist : <p> This seems like a preventative measure , that 's a good idea . As an example- let 's say my daughter meets a person online , who says they 're an 18 year old , and organises a meetup . Let 's also say , for the sake of arguement , that my daughter tells me , wants to go , and allows me to go with her . When we get there , the " 18 year old " is a 50 year old , trying to lure her into a trap . We walk away unscathed ... but so does he . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed law , he would be charged with the lie , has a record , and is now on the radar as a potential threat . So where 's the bad ? <h> Criminologist says : <p> 03:21pm 20/05/10 <p> At Work , <p> I did n't comment on whether it was a bad exercise , I said that it wo n't physcially be able to be enforced and if someone does lie and does no harm ( so not in a potential predatory way ) the fact that they lied means they are investigated and prosecuted ? <p> In your scenario , stalking laws , AVO and even a simple Peace and Good Behaviour Order adequately cover your concerns from a legislative perspective . <h> DG says : <p> 03:29pm 20/05/10 <p> An adult arranging to meet up with a minor for nefarious purposes is , as I understand it , all ready an offence under existing child grooming laws . <p> In your example : " We walk away unscathed ... but so does he . There 's nowhere to record what he 's done " - If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact with this adult ( you did say 18 year old ) then he has already committed an offence - if not , why should it be a crime for an older dude to try to pick up some young lady by lying about his age ( for example he claims to be 25 , rather than 30 , to increase his appeal to this other adult ) ? <p> The situation you anticipate is one in which the person actually does nothing , but you want them thrown on a list of potential sex offenders ( after all that is the implication of such a list ) and possibly imprisoned for doing nothing more than lying about their age and arranging to meet an other adult in a public place . <p> If the person is under 18 , let 's say 15 , the facts are essentially the same . Either they have done something under the child grooming laws ( and it is already illegal ) , or they have done nothing more than lie about their age . <h> James says : <p> 04:34pm 20/05/10 <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step to criminality . What about the people that run this country . <p> I agree , they are probably criminals , they are criminal in the way they act against the public . Why are they trying to force internet censorship ? There is no logical points , except that it helps hide criminals even more . <p> Maybe you have hit the nail on the head here . <h> Toejam says : <p> 05:22pm 20/05/10 <p> At Work , surely you can have him charged with using a carriage service to soliciting a minor for sex ( or words to that effect ) ? <h> stephen says : <p> 07:20pm 20/05/10 <p> Well , I was referring to children lying , and to the psychology of deception . Children can be willful , and it seems to me common sense that proper care and instruction from parents would ameliorate those difficulties mentioned above . <h> TrueOz says : <p> 06:52am 20/05/10 <p> " The fifty year old killer had pretended to be a 20 year old youth online in order to win over Carly 's confidence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reasonable human being online in order to win Punch readers confidence . " <p> I know you 're a lawyer Nick , but you 're also a politician - so I 'll go slow and step it through for you ; <p> 1 . Both paedophilia and murder are in fact already illegal in Australia . ( I 'll make the leap and assume that you already know about this ) 2 . By definition , the people who engage in these activities ( in this example paedophilia and murder ) are criminals . 3 . Criminals are demonstrably disrespectful of the law , making them the least likely group in our society to obey a new law - especially a law that by its nature is asking them to behave in an honest manner in order to prevent them from committing a crime or crimes . <p> Yours is the kind of loony and distorted thinking used by imbeciles like Stephen CONroy to justify an expensive and pointless internet filter . Nick , making a new law does not make committed criminals more law abiding . Got it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kneejerk attempt to jump on a bandwagon frankly . 1 ) It wo n't work as it ca n't be policed , as the comment above points out and 2 ) It would n't have saved Nona Belemesoff as her killer did not lie about his age and she was 18 and therefore not a minor - so bringing her tragic death into the discussion is pointless and clearly an attempt to add fuel to the fire . If you can get an enquiry into Scientology up you will have achieved something that really does protect people from themselves and others . Focus on that - you 're actually getting somewhere . <h> OldGirl says : <p> 07:31am 20/05/10 <p> Nick this has nothing to do with your topic now but I have been watching ABC on The Church of Scientology , please continue to press for an inquiry . I am not church goer , nor do I witch hunt those who are , I believe we all should live and let live . But that Church sounds extremely dangerous and I would hate to see Australians getting hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At first , it sounds like an interesting idea , but the big question I have is : how would this law have prevented the aforementioned tragedies ? I see little connection . <p> There 's no doubt that there 's some creepy people out there - but how is it checked ? It sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare , and I suspect would have many unintended consequences , such as invasion of privacy , police wasting hours chasing trivial complaints ( think how AVOs are abused now ) , and people getting caught in minor infringements ( eg , a woman shaving a few years of her age on her fb profile , who then communicates with a minor in any way , would be in breach ) . <p> Lying about wants age to minors should certainly arouse police suspicions - but perhaps not being an offense in itself . <h> Grant says : <p> It is clearly a reactive populist move to your perception of the publics mood on social media . <p> It is poorly thought out . Why wait until people have committed a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The Senate will dissect this bill with enough vigour to realise that this is not in the public interest and a Scrutiny of Bills Committee would identify that this is an unduly trespass on individual rights and liberties and fails to observe proper legislative safeguards <h> SpamSandwich says : <h> K says : <p> 09:11am 20/05/10 <p> Bless you Nick dear , but you seem to have left out some vital details here , perhaps because you were in a hurry , but maybe more because you 're trying to garner support - details be damned ! Could you tell us , in plain , simple English exactly what will be illegal ? All you 've said here is that lying to children will be illegal - with little or no mention of context . Does this mean we can be locked up for telling our kids there is a Tooth Fairy ? <p> Yes of course I realise I 'm being a little ridiculous , but the question is still a valid one . How will it be applied ? Who to ? Under what circmstances ? Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more support . As it stands now , it sounds more like some Big Brother-esque law , people will be left wondering if the word thoughtcrime will enter our vocabulary and legal system . <p> Just a little tip also , if you 're going to try and state a passionate case , it 's best to do some research lest you be left looking foolish . Nona Belemosoff met her attacker on a different site , a dating site in fact , and subsequently added him on Facebook . A minor detail I know , but it does make a large difference to the scenario you laid out regarding her murder . <h> Andrew says : <p> Actually , what he said is that misrepresenting your age to a minor would be illegal , were you of the age of majority . There 's nothing in there that suggests deception in general would become a crime . <p> The questions arising from this is whether the offence would become a strict liability offense or not , and whether it would simply be misrepresenting yourself as being younger , or misrepresentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What about Carly 's right to be free from being murdered ? " <p> That 's dealt with under the Crimes Legislation in various jurisdictions . Murder is a crime whether you lie to your victim or not . As such your linking of one person 's decision to lie with the crime of murder is , well , ludicrous . <p> " This Bill would make lying to a minor the offence . Police could act before the attacker could get to the child . " <p> You 've hit it on the head - you want to make lying a criminal offence , This is n't about murder , that 's already a crime . This is about the criminalisation of lying about a persons age . <p> How would you deal with a person who claimed , when asked about their age , " I started Uni this year " . It 's not a lie about their age . It 's not even an answer to the question , but it leads the reader to conclude that the author is only 17/18 . Should this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just started uni ( as a mature age student ) ? <p> " The recent murder of Sydney teenager Nona Belemosoff by a man she also met through Facebook tragically showed that the sickening crime against Carly was not a one off . " <p> There has been no suggestion that the attacker in that case lied about his age - only his capacity to get someone a Job . So if this is only about lying about ages , your reference to Nona 's case is sloppy , intellectually dishonest , scare mongering . The alternative is that you wish to expand this to prohibit lying about things other than ones age . <p> " Do n't basic rules of decency dictate that if you would n't say it to somebody 's face , do n't say it on Face book . " <p> This was the winner for me . People lie to each other all day every day . " Nice hair cut " , " That 's a good policy Senator " , " Thanks for the birthday wishes , I 'm 29 again this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of an Online Ombudsman who could lobby on behalf of the Australian people to have offensive material taken down more quickly . " <p> Given that individuals already have the right to ask companies to remove material that they find offensive - what is this ombudsman actually supposed to do ? Why would this new position holder would have any more weight than any other person to a foreign corporation - unless you are threatening to throw people on Conroy 's blacklist ( that you do n't support ) if they fail to kowtow to this ombudsman ? <p> Aside from all of the above I 'll give you credit for your decision not to support Conroy 's filter . I agree that education is essential and we must be wary of lulling parents into a false sense of security . But to then criminalise lying about ones age ? I think you have fallen into your own trap of pointless legislation that lulls parents into a false sense of security . <h> Tim says : <h> mags says : <p> Most parents do , Tim . It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . You can only monitor what you can access . <p> I do n't see the answer to this problem except to drive home the message that the danger is real to our kids . <h> ArtVandalay says : <p> 10:21am 20/05/10 <p> Why do that when it 's easier to introduce legislation after legislation that history has shown solves nothing and does n't make any impact to the underlying problem at all ? ? Legislating us to death also has the added benefit of meaning I do n't have to think for myself anymore . I 'm free to just sit back and adhere to what the government tells me is good for me . That frees up a lot of valuable thinking time to devote to believing everything I 'm told . <h> TH says : <p> 01:51pm 20/05/10 <p> Maybe to further Tim 's opinion parents should discuss with their children not to beleive everything they read about someone online , that they may be some 50 year old predator ? if they are old enough to be on facebook ( assuming the parents did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old nephew is on their but just for games ) then they are old enough to be told about the dangers facing youngsters these days and what to watch out for . Prevention starts at home <h> Tim says : <p> 02:17pm 20/05/10 <p> TH , that was my point . When I was a kid our parents drummed " Stranger Danger " into our heads . It may not have been the most effective method but it definitely allowed us to realise that we live in imperfect world where not everyone wishes us well . <h> L. says : <p> 09:55am 20/05/10 <p> " The lying behaviour starts young , and it is worth trying very hard to discourage its use . " <h> Georginorx says : <p> 10:57am 20/05/10 <p> I agree it is important to protect minors from being mislead about the nature of the relationships they form online - I do n't see any reason why people should have a right to lie about their age to minors . It is a vulnerable group , open to forming meaningful reationships without ever meeting that person face-to-face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthy of increased protection . However , policing this seems impossible without infringing on people 's privacy . I would suggest families take steps to monitor the friendships of their children , limit the amount of personal information available online about the minor , and most importantly discuss with the child ways to stay safe online . <h> Ben says : <h> Just Sayin ' says : <p> 12:58pm 21/05/10 <p> Really ? Ok , I take it back . <p> The point stands for people below 13 , and there are many people below 13 on facebook , but obviously the point does not stand for Carly . <p> Perhaps the makers of facebook should create a " facebook junior " for people under 16 , where parents get sent a view of everything they do on facebook , and get to veto friend requests etc . Once they turn 16 , their account can automatically change to regular facebook . A nice little birthday gift and validation of their increasine age and ( hopefully ) maturity . <h> Dr McKay says : <p> 01:29pm 20/05/10 <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be the tasteless and hurtful posts that pop up after tragedies like the recent murder of Queenslander Trinity Bates . " And if they had known how t use Facebook they would have used the privacy controls . Ca n't legislate againts stupidity , no matter how hard you try ( Our experience with driving , ISP Filter , running towards closing train doors etc seem to back this up pretty well . ) <h> Just Askin ' says : <p> 01:30pm 20/05/10 <p> So if a young woman , for reasons of vanity , puts her age on facebook as 21 instead of 24 , and she has some 17 year old family friends on facebook , that woman has broken the law ? Maybe Xenephon would be better off trying to legalising the stuff he has been smoking . <h> Ms Smack says : <h> Ben says : <p> Yes we want to protect children from being abused . But tasking the police with investigating people lying about their age on the Internet is a horrible waste of resources . <p> How will this bill affect 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives ? From your article , it will have the same effect as a paedophile lying to a child intending to abuse the child . <p> Let 's keep the status quo - police track down paedophiles and people intending to abuse children . When the police arrest the people , they 're going to do it for abuse/attempted abuse of a child , not lying about their age , as it should be . <h> Chase says : <p> 03:58pm 20/05/10 <p> Why wait until anyone , anywhere , is physically close enough to kill someone ? Your bill does n't go far enough Senator . I propose that in your bill you should include putting tracking devices on everyone and if this is to costly make it illegal for people to be within two metres of one another . That , Senator , would reduce crime against everyone substantially . <h> Sceptic says : <p> How , exactly ? If the child has believed the lies , who is going to report the liar ? Who is even going to know they were lying until it 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect children on the internet . The way to protect children on the internet is for more parents to realise that letting your kids loose online on their own is like letting them out in public on their own . You have to be sure they can take care of themselves . As you teach them " stranger danger " for the outside world , teach them safe net practices

##796451 <p> We will be sending an e-mail shortly with regard to the migration of services which use IAX ( or green Freshtel ATA devices ) to the new SIP protocol which is used for the majority of our services . <p> Looks like they 're abandoning support for IAX as well now . Every change they are making is to the detriment of the service . Time to bail out , I would say . This business is going to go from bad to worse until , one day , it will stop working like what is happening to Sipme . <p> The major revenue during this period was the receipt of $334,339 from the ATO for R &D; activities . Now that the VoIP service is run by 1 person , there is little doubt that Freshtel is doing it really tough these days ( ie unlikely to carry out more extensive R &D).; <p> They had an excellent product ( the IAX protocol was excellent for getting around firewalls in hotels particularly when overseas ) , so lets hope they survive . <p> If they close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps suggesting ) this advantage will be lost . <p> If they close their IAX servers ( as their email to you is perhaps suggesting ) this advantage will be lost . <p> That ( support for IAX ) and the fact calls to 13(00) numbers are just 10c are the only things they had going for them . Now that IAX is going , their only advantage is the cheap rate for 13 numbers , for as long as it lasts . Once that goes , they may as well shut up shop . <p> Please be advised that as of the 1st of July , 2011 Freshtel will no longer be supporting the IAX VoIP protocol . This means your existing IAX device ( pictured above ) will no longer work on the Freshtel network ( from 1 July 2011 ) and you will be unable to make phone calls using this technology . <p> ------------- <p> I run a small B &B; up in the Dandenongs , with no mobile reception . So giving guests access to cheap VOIP is a major bonus for them . Freshtel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those green ATAs , and the IAX worked just fine through my m0n0wall router -- even over wifi . <p> I have four of those green ATAs , and the IAX worked just fine through my m0n0wall router -- even over wifi . <p> Time to shop around I guess <p> hi Alex , Possible solution for you . Faktortel support IAX . Maybe some other VSPs do too . Choose an IAX provider -- if Faktortel , you could get 2 prepaid accounts ( so your guests do n't go crazy on the calls ) and I think each account would come with 2 lines ( = 4 lines to cover 4 ATAs ) . <p> Then via each ATA 's IP address on your network , change the network provider ( from freshtel to new VSP -- eg if Faktortel = IAX server will be prepaid.faktortel.com.au ) ; replace your user name and password and you 're done . I just tried this with my Faktortel a/c and it works fine ( although I have only tried dialling out using the 600 echo test number ) . <p> Faktortel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote below : <p> I think that zdnet article is reporting old news . The Vixtel arrangement has been in place since December last year , apparently , so zdnet are only about 5 months behind the curve . It 's not actually Freshtel taking new sign-ups -- they are effectively out of the business -- it 's Vixtel , using the Freshtel brand . <p> So it 's really a question of whither Vixtel , for voip services . If they can turn even a modest profit with the current scaled-down ( one employee ? ) operation , there is no reason they ca n't continue indefinitely . <p> I 'm not losing any sleep over my $6.20. exposure . : - ) And I 'll be topping up with another $10 when that credit runs out . Why not ? Even if I lost $10 , I 'd still be ahead compared to if I 'd not signed up a couple of months ago ... <p> They said they will sell it -- so maybe vixtel will ' buy ' it this time instead of just doing support/operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
