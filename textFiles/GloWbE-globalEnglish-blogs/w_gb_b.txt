They had looked at him in his yachting shoes , and listened to what he said , and they made a decision in their hearts and minds to ignore the evidence and to imagine something bigger and something infinitely more beautiful than the obvious . " ( Harold Fry becomes a bit of a celebrity ) <p> Harold Fry , an elderly pensioner with a lot of regrets and no real engagement in life any more , receives a letter in the post one morning and accidentally begins a walk of nearly 700 miles from his home in Dorset to Queenie , an old friend who is dying in Berwick-upon-Tweed . <p> I say accidentally because Harold begins by not quite knowing how to reply to Queenie 's letter and while he is thinking and editing his reply between postboxes he walks out of his village and decides to keep going . Of course he 's not dressed for this adventure and has none of the things he needs , least of all a map or decent shoes , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife Maureen sees it a little differently . Harold has been withdrawn and quiet for years and has seemed lost since he retired . She 's disturbed by the ease with which he has walked out of their life and is scared of what he might become if he ' finds ' himself . <p> As Harold spends day after day learning to cope with the physical demands of his walk he is forced to examine his past : his difficult childhood , his friendship with Queenie , his relationship with his son , David , and his decades of marriage to Maureen . There are things he should have said , things he should have done , things he regrets deeply and with little company for most of his journey he has plenty of time to think about them . Left in a suddenly very silent family home , Maureen is forced to do a lot of contemplation about her life too . <p> I have very mixed feelings about this book though . <p> I really enjoyed the story of Harold and Maureen split up by this unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believable as retirees and made me realise how unusual it is to see older characters in the lead role of a book . I do n't think I 've read one since The Sense of an Ending , which featured the much less sympathetic retiree Tony . Harold and Maureen 's relationship is by far the strongest strand of this story and I found myself feeling for them and cheering them on several times . <p> The weaker strands of the story are the ones where the author gets in the way of her characters or the tone drifts into tweeness . <p> On his journey Harold has many conversations with strangers where they share their stories and he slowly learns to open up and share his . At the start of the story this is beautifully handled but as he progresses Harold transforms into a kind of zen guru who has saccharine thoughts like this : <p> " He had learned that it was the smallness of people that filled him with wonder and tenderness , and the loneliness of that too . The world was made up of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time . Harold could no longer pass a stranger without acknowledging the truth that everyone was the same , and also unique ; and this was the dilemma of being human . " <p> When Harold 's story is discovered by the media he becomes a cult figure and attracts other walkers who want to be pilgrims with him . Joyce is so present in these chapters and has such definite points to make about the media that I skim-read these sections . It was unnecessarily eccentric and gave the reader little room to breathe . <p> The story thread of what happened twenty years ago involving Harold and Queenie ( it 's not an affair , it 's much more interesting ) was genuinely interesting but there were a few too many hints dropped throughout the book and I found myself irritated with the carrot being dangled so obviously in front of my nose . <p> Overall I loved the characters , the set up and the chapters where Harold was just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book . I really was n't keen on being steered by the author , the gradually increased levels of schmaltz or the occasional repetition . I think it 's somewhat ironic that a book all about letting go and having faith shows signs of an author afraid to trust in her readers ' ability to connect the dots ... but there 's lot to enjoy here and I can see why it 's on the Booker longlist . I 'll give it a 6/10 for me personally . <h> One thought on " Review : The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce " <p> I totally agree , especially with the line about the author not trusting her readers to figure things out . Also , I did n't like having major plot twists only hinted at until the very end . Certainly Harold and Maureen would have known those things from the get-go . I felt cheated and manipulated , 
##3002650 <h> Wenger : It is Easter , and it is time for a resurrection <p> Despite Barcelona having scored two away goals at the Emirates , and ' out-Arsenaled ' Arsenal in the first half of their Champions League tie , manager Arsne Wenger is confident that the tie is still finely balanced . <p> The score is currently 2-2 on aggregate , and as it stands , Barcelona will go through on the away goals rule . We need to score more than we concede , unless we score more than two , in which case a draw will see us through . If it is a repeat scoreline at 2-2 , the match will go into extra time and then penalties . <p> Wenger was in a light-hearted and relaxed mood at his pre-match press conference in Spain , reminding the pessimistic press that it was Easter and it was time for ' resurrection ' . He also welcomed Thierry Henry to score an own goal for his former club . <h> Excellent European away record <p> The Frenchman also reminded us of the club 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins in the San Siro against both Milan sides , and against Real Madrid in the Barnebeu . <p> Manager Arsne Wenger said : " It 's Easter you know , a time of resurrection . That 's what we want to do tomorrow night . We have won away everywhere in Europe , but Barcelona is a place where we have not done it . <p> " It is a good opportunity and there is no better opportunity than tomorrow night . I am confident despite the injuries we have that we can do it . <p> " Of course , we will need to get 100 per cent from everybody and give a great team performance . <p> " This team has such a great mental strength and I believe they can fight against the odds anywhere in the world . I am very confident they can do it . <p> " I want to do well for my club and want to do well for this team . It 's important we go there with the right attitude . We know that tomorrow we have to turn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The quality of Barcelona gives me an extra excitement , because we can all expect a good game . The first game was very promising and matched people 's expectations . <p> " People are waiting with excitement because they know they 'll see another interesting game , and I 'm sure we will . " <h> Coming back from the dead <p> Wenger continued : " The players have come back from the dead once and can do it again . They know they escaped being out of the competition and we have a chance we have to take . <p> " At 2-0 down I felt we needed a miracle , but always had hope . I know this team will never give up and I knew that when we managed to get through their passing we always looked dangerous . <p> " I knew , of course , we could concede a third or fourth goal against a team like that , but knew we would never give up so I always had hope . <p> " The late comebacks this season show that this team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . <p> " We were written off before the season started , but there are five games to go in the Premier League and we are still in there . <p> " In the Champions League it 's the same . People have written us off , but we 're halfway through this tie and will give Barcelona a good game . " <h> Barca are the best we have played against <p> " I do n't know where this challenge ranks . At the moment Barcelona are the best team in Europe and we have to show that we can beat them . <p> " They are the best team I have faced because they played at a higher pace collectively . And I do n't think we have ever been dominated so much at home . Certainly Cesc Fabregas has n't ! <p> " He is used to having the ball . I think there was the psychological influence of us being so used to having the ball that suddenly not to have the ball , the impression was deeper on the players than it should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

##3009250 <h> UK Minister Visits the Territory : ' A Friend of the BVI ' <p> October 30 , 2012 <p> There is a saying that you wait for ages for a No. 12 bus and then two come along at once . Well the BVI , having not had a visit by a UK Minister since 2009 , has just had its second such visit inside six months . Henry Bellingham MP , Minister for the Overseas Territories visited in April 2012 . Last week his successor , Mark Simmonds MP , spent two days here . And of course we also had a visit by His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester in March 2012 . <p> Why all the attention you might ask ? And why did Mr. Simmonds make the BVI his first visit to an Overseas Territory since taking up his new job in September ? <p> The reason for this rapid succession of visits is that the Coalition Government in the UK is genuinely interested in the Overseas Territories . In June they launched a White Paper " The Overseas Territories : Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Cameron said in his Foreword to the White Paper : " The Government is as ambitious for our territories as we are for the United Kingdom . We want to see our communities flourish in partnership , with strong and sustainable local economies . " <p> Mark Simmonds MP speaking at the press conference , with the Premier and Governor . <p> Mr Simmonds spoke in all of his meetings of the White Paper and of the UK Government 's commitment to strengthen ties with the BVI , to offer support for capacity building , where requested , and to stand up for the Territories in international fora . <p> During his visit , he saw a number of areas in which past attachments and training had made a real difference and learned how we are looking actively at more of this for the future in areas where BVI identifies a need . <p> Mr Simmonds was also interested to hear of the growing links between the BVI and the county of Hertfordshire and of ways in which this had already brought benefit to the BVI , not only through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic athletes , but also through advice provided to the Ministry of Education in the fields of special needs and school leadership . <p> And why did Mr Simmonds select BVI as the first OT to visit since taking up his new job ? <p> Firstly because he had been here before , in 2007 , and had loved what he had seen . But primarily because , as he said at his Press Conference , he was impressed by the progress made by the Territory in the field of public finance and wanted to see fist hand what was being done . <p> He publicly welcomed the signing by the BVI Government of the Protocols for Effective Financial Management ( PEFM ) and the recent passing of amendments to the Public Finance Management Act , which translated the Protocols into local law . <p> These were signs , he said , of a responsible and prudent Government , adding that said effective financial management was a pre-requisite for inward investment coming into the BVI from the UK and elsewhere : " I think that the steps that the Premier has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it far easier for myself and others to persuade UK businesses to look seriously about investing in the BVI . " <p> The Minister made clear that his role was not to get involved in the day to day running of the finances of the BVI , but he would work in a partnership to ensure that the Premier and his Cabinet continue to follow the good governance measures that they had put in place , to ensure that they continued to make strides to re-balance the finances of the BVI and ensure that the capacity in the Government was built up even further than it had been already to maximize and deliver effective and efficient public services for people on BVI . <p> Mr Simmonds made the usual calls on the Premier , members of the Cabinet and Leader of the Opposition . But he also wanted to get a closer understanding of the two economic pillars of the BVI -- financial services and tourism . In addition to meeting with the Managing Director of the Financial Services Commission and a cross-section of the business and wider community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch on Scrub Island and a few hours on Virgin Gorda , where he saw some of the high-end tourism developments , which have been driving the construction sector over the last year or so . <p> The Minister left the BVI with even more positive impressions of the Territory than on his first visit a few years ago . As he told the press , he is a " friend of the BVI " . <p> One thing he did not accomplish was to meet his local namesake , Mark

Unemployment numbers are some of the best to watch as a barometer . Only when businesses feel confident do they hire , expand , and increase production .

Its growth is getting worse , not better . <p> The meetings between Greece and the EU/IMF/European Central BankA troika broke up on Friday without a common understanding of how bad things are getting in Greece ? ? and they won ? ? t meet again until mid-September when Greece has prepared its 2012 budget . <p> I keep hearing that the Greek people simply will not agree to yet another round of austerity . Will German taxpayers agree to let Greece miss its targets that were agreed in order to get the bailouts ? <p> Greek bond spreads hit euro-era highs on Friday .

##3013050 <p> cat scratchers : Question by fghfgjhghh : How do I keep my kitten away from our christmas tree ? If we keep her in the other room , she cries . If we let her out , she runs to the tree . We spray her and say " no " but then she just goes crazy . Should we just keep her in a cage or what ? The apartment is kinda small and we do nt really have any room for anything too big . Is their something we can spray the tree with that will make her stay away from it ? What do I do ? <p> Best answer : <p> Answer by Andrea Y even adult cats climb the christmas tree just keep her out of the room and if she cry distract her with something Else christmas is n't a long hoilday do nt sweat it <p> Actually , there IS some kind of spray that makes her stay away from the tree . There 's this kind of bittersweet apple spray , or something like that that keeps her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could try putting up a baby gate , and just try keeping her distracted , with a shoelace , or something like that . Cats will play with anything and everything . ( My cat will play with my dogs tail , bouncy balls , and bugs ! ) Maybe you could add some stuff to make the room you put her in , like little toys she loves , and you guys could go in there and play with her too . Also , you could get a fake tree , but there 's one hazardous thing about Christmas trees ... actually , maybe two . ( a tinsel , and ( b It falling . Sorry I wrote so much , but I hope it helps ! <p> The tree must obviously be decorated . maybe she likes the shiny balls hanging from it . our cat used to do that too . So I took a couple of ornaments from the tree and hung it on the door knob of my room . then my cat would just play with it all day . try that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hang the ornaments from there . Hope I helped . = ) <p> Theres a bittersweet apple spray you can get at petco , or this ' No Scratch ' spray . The apple one kinda stinks to humans , and takes away from the christmas spirit . the no scratch stuff does n't have any scent to me at all and keeps my cats away . i would suggest trying to sleep with her in your room at night , because cats d crazy things when they know they are nt being watched . if possible , do nt put bows on the presents ( i know theyre pretty , but cats love playing with them ! ) . be careful and keep an eye on your kitten ! <p> Make sure that your cat , or cats , are locked in a safe room large enough to hold it/them when everyone is either asleep or out of the house . This will keep your kitties from knocking down the tree on the floor . Use a piece of high test fishing line to connect to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree from tipping . Put any valuable ornaments somewhere on the top two-thirds of the tree . That way the cats ca n't reach them . Hang ornaments by using wire ornament hangers . Use a pair of pliers to clamp the hook part around the branch . Use duct tape . If the tree is shorter than 6 feet , use duct tape to tape the legs of the holder to a piece of wide ply-wood and put the whole thing on a short , sturdy table . This keeps the tree above their level and the cats wo n't be as interested . Plug the tree lights into a short indoor extension cord and tape the plug into the socket with electrical tape . Simply unplug the lights from the extension cord to turn off . Put something like orange peels under the tree to make your cat less likely to go near it . ( Cats also dislike the smell of rotten apples . ) <p> imagine you are your cat . you see this green thing with lights and reflections and movement and jingle bells . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same as taking a four year old to toys r us and saying touch nothing buy nothing , but we 'll just sit here and look at the toys . i know that my kitten 's first christmas is coming up . for us we 're getting him declawed before we put the tree up to dicourage it a little , but you just need to let him climb . make sure you have nothing overly precious on there you would hate if it broke . hang stuff with bells on the bottem so you hear when they go under or near the tree , 
##3013051 <p> aggressive cat problems : Question by MRose : How do you get a cat to quit biting ? i bought my cat from the humane society over a year ago , and he was taken from a very neglectful and possibly abusive home . he s sweet to me , because i live alone and he is my child of sorts , theres no one for him to compete with . <p> the problem is , i stay with my parents sometimes , or i leave him there if i have to travel . and he s not nice to ppl he does nt know . he gets intimidated and scared and is prone to attacking . ( if im with them theres no problem , but if they go to feed him while im not there , he gets scared of them ) he got my mom and my aunt pretty good while i was gone this week . my dads really REALLY angry and upset with me about it . i understand why , and im sorry my cat acts this way , but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s not going to be any less scared with my dad chasing him and threatening his life . so how do i train him to stop being so aggressive ? will he grow out of this ? HELP i should add that he s nutered , front paws are declawed. water does nt work becuase he likes it . he plays in it and everything . there is another cat that lives with me , but shes female , he chases her constantly , but i do nt think he s threatening , just playful at my parents , they have two cats , the female is the same way as the one i have here , but obviously the male has a problem with him , theyre both very territorial . sometimes we keep them in seperate areas of the house , but that seems to make my cat more aggressive . i have tried introducing him to ppl , but when i leave him alone , he seems to get scared that ive left him and he takes it out on others . ( ive never left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i hardly ever have a problem with him , its just not fair to my family that he s like this . is there any way to tame his wild side ? i hate to make this seem so impossible , but its the prediciment im in , and i really need help . i love him and want my family to love him too ! <p> Best answer : <p> Answer by x60157 Maybe you could introduce him to your mom and aunt so they get to know each other . Have them come over and play with him and pet him . <p> Do you only have one cat ? To me , cats seem to be lonely if they do n't have a cat-friend . I suggest getting another cat . A 4-month old is what has always been suggested to me because at that age they are big enough to defend themselves , but small enough that they do n't challenge the established cat . <h> 6 Responses to " How do you get a cat to quit biting ? " <p> Your cat has developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been through . Animals go on instinct not thought . He 's only trying to survive the best way he knows how . He may get over it , or maybe not . You can never tell , some human victims of abuse never heal . <p> I think dear MRose that the solution of the problem reffered in your question need not be centered on your cat . The biting by your cat is self-defence induced by those who have approached it most probably in a threatening manner ( even if it is for feeding ) . Animals even pet ( including cats ) snare or bite only when they are threatened or scared . So when you are away from your cat please instruct those who look after it to leave it alone and donot go near it . It should not get the feeling of being cornered . While feeding they should keep the food infront of it but at a distance and leave it alone to eat peacefully . If it gets into place where it is not supposed to then chase it from a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When left alone cats do approach us and become friendly . <p> He s just not use to them . Put him an automatic feeder and and water bowl while your gone . And do n't leave him alone so much . Animals need human contact all the time . He probably thinks that you do n't like him 
##3013052 <p> aggressive cat : Question by catniles : Best way to add a 2nd cat to the family ? We have an older female cat and want to get another cat . What is better to get -- male or female and how do you introduce them so that they will get along ? <p> Best answer : <p> Answer by Kiki Anytime .. and watch them together . Any hissing separate them . Then try again . Make you love your older want and keep assuring her . In due time , they will be happy together . good luck ! ! ! <h> 5 Responses to " Q &A:; Best way to add a 2nd cat to the family ? " <p> First I hope you are adopting from your local animal shelter or pound ........ I would get a female .. they are usually not as aggressive as the males .. second keep the cats apart for a couple of days so the new one begins to get the scent of the house on their fur ... some cats take to each other right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slow have the new cat sleep on a towel ( you can put it in a box ) then introduce just the towel to your older cat .. keep a spray bottle of water near you when they first meet .. just in case .. and last give your original cat lots of attention .. they do feel neglected as people when a new one comes in ... soon you will be the PURRFECT family .... <p> If you get a kitten , the sex wo n't matter . If you get an older cat , preferrably get a female . <p> I strongly suggest you get a kitten that will aclimate better than an adult . However even kittens can be little balls of fire . They see a foreign cat and arch their backs , do that little " spider side step dance " all the while spitting like a ferocious tiger . It is more humorous than dangerous though . <p> Two ways to introduce cats sanely as well as kindly . Select a room for the NEW cat . Put it in the room and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves through the door . Cats have a wonderful sense of smell . They acquaint by odors . Yes they will hiss and fuss through the door , but better through a door where no claws are involved . <p> The other way is via a carrier . Keep the new cat in a carrier where the older cat can investigate this " intruder " . The carrier provides protection for the new cat . Let the cat out for exercise in a room for given periods of time and then return it to carrier where your older cat can view it and vice versa . When the hissing starts to settle down you can allow the new cat out with supervision . <p> NEVER lock the resident cat away . This can and will cause resentment problems toward the new member of the family . Rejection is not healthy for an older cat . And it will view it 's confinement as punishment . <p> No matter how gentle a cat has been ... intruders = competition and can create aggression . So better safe than sorry . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but if it is a " senior citizen " , it will require a lot of warm fuzzies and reassurance that it is not being replaced and NOT being ignored for the " cute newbie " . <p> Most cats bond just fine within a few days to a couple of weeks . Worst case scenario , they will develop a system of tolerance toward each other . <p> I have heard of this method being successful when introducing a new baby to a dog -- not sure if it would work with two cats , though . Try using a blanket or favorite toy , give it to one cat and then to the other . This may help them get used to the other cats scent . Anyone heard of this before ? Does anyone know if cats use scent like dogs do ? <p> We just introduced two new kittens into a home with two cats that are 10+ years old . We left the kittens in their own room for a couple of weeks and let them all get used to the scent and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for an hour or so at a time . After about a week

##3014252 <h> Shambles ! <p> What a night on the International front hey ? I have to say I watched more of the ITV coverage of the England game than I probably would have if it was played . ITV strung out their coverage as the referee , FIFA , and co .... made a shambles of what was supposed to be a World Cup Qualified . A stadium with a roof and you get the game called off because of rain , mental ! It made it even worse the ref took three trips to the pitch to roll the ball , without the ball rolling , and still persisted in the farce ! All I was think about was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain , that was High Street Green , leg broken in the mud conditions ! ! Apparently the game will be played at 4pm today ! Lets hope the Ox is watching from the stands . <p> The other shambles came in Serbia where the U21s qualified for the Euro 's .

This was an U21 match and the Serbs aimed racist abuse , throw stones , chairs , cones , and all sorts at the players , and even some of their players were involved . <p> To be fair to a couple of Serb players they looked like they were protecting a couple of the lads but the majority where pushing and shoving like spoilt brats in the playground . I recent year punishments have been so low but this has got to be time for UEFA to stand up and be counted . Serbia should be removed from all International football for a year ! End of World Cup !

##3015452 <p> India 's home ministry has cleared a limited-overs tourby the Pakistan team , prompting the BCCI to say the tour " is on " at the end of the year . The clearance was given at a meeting in New Delhi on Tuesday between ministry officials and senior representatives of the BCCI -- including its chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty , IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla and chief executive Sundar Raman . <p> " We have discussed all security aspects ( and ) the tour is on , " Shukla told reporters after the meeting . <p> The tour -- which now needs only a formal announcement by the two boards to be official -- will comprise three ODIs and two Twenty20s at Chennai , Delhi , Kolkata , Ahmedabad and Bangalore . Pakistan are due to arrive on December 22 and Shukla said the tour would continue till January 7 but the detailed schedule is yet to be announced . However , there is little room for flexibility because the series is sandwiched between two legs of England 's tour of India . <p> It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toured India in end-2007 , though they have met in multinational tournaments .

But there has been no international cricket in the country between Full Members since the March 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka team bus and it is understood that India were not keen to play at a neutral venue , as has been the case with all Pakistan 's ' home ' series since the attack . Subsequently , Ashraf said India had the prerogative to decide on the dates and host the series , but the PCB would want the BCCI to share revenue as they were apparently yet to recover from the financial loss 
##3018150 <h> November 6 , 2012 <p> It turned frosty last week , just after I got back from my autumn cruises , and just before the country turned back the clocks , that sad Saturday in late October when British Summer Time gives way to Greenwich Mean , and we know winter is really baring down upon us . <p> This morning was the coldest so far , with a thick frost outside and ice in all the puddles . I huddled under my two duvets until the sun pouring in the back porthole that I always keep uncovered shamed me into finally getting out of bed . <p> From the back of Pangolin , where my bed is , I ca n't tell whether the fire is still lit -- all I know is it 's cold . I try to keep the stove going all night , but it is a delicate balance -- burning it low enough so it consumes the fewest nuggets of coal , but not so low that it goes out altogether . The plan is , if I keep the ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire that seems all but dead at dawn will be summoned back to life the moment it 's needed , though I must n't push my luck and lay abed too long . <p> Last night ( hurrah ! ) I husbanded the fire as I ought , and this morning the routine of brisk riddling , pulling out the ash pan and laying it to cool on the hearth , leaving open the bottom door of the stove to give the fire air was all it needed . By the time the kettle was boiled for tea , the coals were glowing bright red . <p> On the towpath the local excitement -- and sadness -- is the cutting of the willow trees on the other side of the canal . The sound of chainsaws let me know they were at it again this morning . <p> I 'd chatted with the woodcutters when they first arrived last week . We 've got to keep the waterways clear , they said , and I reluctantly agreed they did . On my recent cruise I lost my expensive , tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof -- you ca n't cruise under the low bridges with anything but a stub of a chimney , and tall ones have to be taken down , but I should have put mine safely away ) . A batch of wayward willow branches stretching low across the canal swept it into the water . A pretty pelargonium went overboard with the chimney . <p> I chatted to our woodcutters again a few days into their pruning fest . They were eyeing the only willow that seemed to me a problem , one that nearly overhangs a neighbouring boat , and they asked if I knew when that boat owner might be back . They wanted to move the boat , in case the tree fell the wrong way . <p> That boat 's abandoned , I said . The mooring fees and license are paid , but no one comes . The woodcutters and I agreed , looking it over , it must have been a lovely and well-loved boat . On the roof is a row of wooden planters and ceramic pots , now growing only weeds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still waiting for new season bulbs . The neatly coiled ropes on front and rear decks are covered in algae and green slime . Black mold makes peering into the windows almost unrevealing , but I can see enough to see that the insides were once carefully fitted out for comfortable cruising . <p> I 'd heard from Dusty , the fuel boater who knows everything , why no one ever came to such a fine boat . It belonged to an elderly couple , and the husband died -- I think Dusty said he died suddenly , on a cruise on the Thames , only a few miles from here , but I admit I may have embroidered those details , because someone else told me it was cancer , and slow and expected . Anyway , British Waterways sorted the widow out a mooring , here on the edge of Oxford , such moorings being usually rare , and rarely expensive . This seems to me a typically human face of British Waterways , though it is fashionable to grumble about them . <p> However it happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their boat , moored next to mine , has been empty , and slowly turning from blue to green , since I moved here . <p> When I 'd told the woodcutters this story , and we 'd muttered about how sad it was , and I 'd said that no one would ever notice if they moved the boat to cut the tree , and gave them permission to move my boat as well , I went out . I mentioned I might go over the canal when they were done and scrounge some wood , if that was okay . We talked a bit about which sorts of wood burned best and longest , and they loyally championed willow . <p> I came home to find outside my boat a neatly stacked pile of willow logs , trimmed to just the right size for a boat 's fire , left for me by the woodcutters . <p> Still , I am sorry for the chopping . It is much more extensive than I had imagined . The tree where kingfishers darted amongst the branches is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know the willows will come back ; I hope the kingfishers will . <p> Speaking of Dusty , he 's due . I 'm on his border , one of the last customers he visits before he moors up for the night on the outskirts of Oxford , or one of the first he calls on on his way into town -- I never know which it is going to be . <p> Dusty 's first call is early , and since I have n't seen him tonight I expect to feel his boat banging up beside mine , and hearing him ring his bell , well before 8 tomorrow morning . He 'll fill my tank with diesel , toss half a dozen bags of coal onto my roof , and leave a bottle of propame gas on the bank , taking away the empty I 've left for him . <p> For me , it wo n't be the best morning to wake early , as I expect I 'll be cuddled up to the radio all night , like the mid twentieth century wayward child I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida , New Hampshire , Nevada , Virginia and the rest . <p> Four years ago I sat up all night with my two younger , almost grown , children at their father 's house in Oxford and drove home alone at six in the morning listening to the words of a victory speech that filled me with extraordinary hope and joy . <p> This year , a more sensible woman would just go quietly to bed . Whatever , first I 'll drag another 25kg bag of coal from the roof , fill the coal scuttle , stoke the fire , riddle the grail and twiddle the knobs ; that way , there probably wo n't be a disaster in the morning -- at least not with the fire . <p> I was one of the people giving out ballots in my election district .

##3024750 <p> There are no two ways about it -- this year 's olive harvest has been by far our worst since we 've been here . I think the main problem is the rain that we have had . It must have knocked most of the olives off . Also , although many of our neighbours are still harvesting now , I ca n't help but think that we have been too late and should have picked them weeks ago . Alas , this was n't possible as I was in the UK . <p> Anyway , earlier this week , we took advantage of some dry weather and picked what we had . It took us just as long as usual , as we did the same amount of trees -- they just had fewer olives on them . After three days we only had just over three barrels ( about 80kgs ) to show for our hard work . This was about half of what we got last year which in itself was n't a great year . More bad news was to come when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a ' normal ' amount you can see your olives through the press and out the other side as oil . However for small amounts it is not worth their while to do it separately , so they just weigh what you 've got and give you an equivalent amount of their own oil . So , I knew I would have to swap it but when the bloke only offered me six litres , it was disappointing to say the least . I bought another four litres from them and as we still have plenty from last year , that should see us through the year . <p> One harvest which should be better is the oranges . There are plenty of them and they are already turning orange . No shortage of marmalade then . <p> Meanwhile with all the rain and a bit of sun , the grass has shot up -- yes , it 's time to fire up the strimmer again . Because of last year 's drought , I think I only cut the grass once last Autumn . With more rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . Betty was disappearing in the long grass but now it 's done it looks great . Just as well I did it today as there is more rain forecast this weekend . <p> There has also been better news with the big hairy one . She was really ill just a week or so ago and even had to stay overnight at the vets attached to a drip . However , she has made an amazing recovery and here she is to prove it . <p> Of course Betty is still up to her usual tricks -- she often disappears for hours on her own but also likes nothing better than her regular walk on the lead ! <p> among the vines <p> ... and the hens are also fine . We have now put them in the pig field and they are enjoying the fresh grass . <p> OK , not quite an invasion , but the other day while I was inspecting the hives , I noticed a large wasp and while I was watching , it swooped down and snatched one of my little ladies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a large European hornet which is carnivorous and eats many insects including bees . I 've only seen one so far and it is hardly decimating the colony ( apparently up to 1000 bees can die per day at some times of the year ! ) and I 'm hoping that it will disappear for winter . I did n't get a photo of the snatch but here he is waiting for an opportunity and here are some bees returning home . You can see one of them with her little suitcases full of orange pollen . So they are still building up stores . <p> European hornet and honey bees <p> In better news when I opened up the hives , the ' weedy ' bees seem finally to have made a fair amount of honey and the hard-working bees which produced all of this year 's honey crop have almost refilled all their frames ! I could therefore take some more honey but as we 've got enough and I want to make sure they have enough for winter , I 'll let them bee . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still warm and sunny here ( like October last year ) . Not at all . We 've had a fair amount of rain and it 's been cold enough at night to have the wood buring stove on . And it has led to a reappearance of mushrooms after the absence of last year . <p> We have plenty of poisonous Jack O'lanterns around the base of the olive trees but also we 've managed to pick quite a few field mushrooms . Together with our free range eggs , and home produced bacon ( Yes ! ) , we can have winter fry-ups -- just the job ! <p> Jack O'lanterns <p> edible mushrooms and walnuts <p> One harvest which has n't been so good is the walnuts . However , it has to be said , there are more than enough for the two hairy ones , who love them and have no problem cracking the nuts with their teeth . <p> The deed has finally been done . They had escaped just once too often -- instead of jumping over the fence they had now started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were also ready . Yes , the pigs are now pork . As I now look at the empty pig field , I feel a twinge of sadness . It was quite funny to see them scurrying around their paddock but we got them to eat and they were n't pets . It was just as well we did n't even get to like them that much , what with their escaping and grunting and ear-splitting squealing . That made the end much easier . <p> In short , they were killed one day , hung up overnight and then butchered the next . The butchering was the most traumatic as the butcher was producing cuts of meat at a hectic pace and me and Jackie were feverishly trying to label and bag various bits and put them in the freezer . We very quickly realised that Portuguese butchery is very different to British . If we had n't stepped in to change things , the two pigs would have been completely converted into costelletas ( chops ) , febras ( steaks ) , entremeadas ( bellies ) and entrecostos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done here . As it was , we managed to save various larger pieces which we deemed ' roasts ' , some of which will also become sausages and a leg which is now resting in brine and shall become ham . We also have a few other bits and pieces such as liver , kidneys , trotters etc . <p> I have to say the butcher was very surprised but happy to receive the heads and a few more unsavoury bits and pieces . Making brawn was just one step too far at this juncture . <p> All in all we now have two freezers , packed with 135 kgs of prime pork . Financially , it is difficult to put a price on it as we would certainly say our pork is far more valuable than the stuff we would ordinarily buy in the supermarket . But even based on supermarket prices we could say that we have broken even ( not taking the pigpen construction costs into account ) , but this was not the point . <p> Looking at the sheer volume of meat from these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetarian . Not quite though , as could be gauged from the satisfied smile on her face as she wiped the plate from the first of many roast dinners . Delish ! <p> I remember ( almost fondly ! ) of the time we first arrived at Casa Azul and the weeks of bramble bashing I had to do to clear the land . Well , three years down the track I 'm at it again . This time , it 's clearing the roastie run for a new intake . It 's amazing how quickly brambles can take over . I 've not even gone right up to the wall as I want to provide a bit of shade for the little darlings . <p> before <p> after <p> We do have some more beneficial prickly customers though . Our neighbours gave us some prickly pears last November . We reckoned they would be good for us as they need little water . We were right as they have thrived in our arid conditions and we have been rewarded with quite a bit of fruit . Here 's a photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit was stripped clean before I got the camera out ! <p> prickly pears <p> It 's not the end of the fruit though , or fruit processing . Most of our neighbours are busy taking in the grape harvest . We only have a few vines , so Jackie 's dad , who thought he was here on holiday rather than being employed as a ' woofer ' , has been taking in our meagre harvest and we have been making some grape juice . We decided that as the local wine is so good and cheap we would n't bother trying to make any grape wine . <p> However , it 's not the last fruit to ripen . That falls to the quinces which are also now ready . And that means Jackie springs back into action to make Quince jelly . No rest for the wicked ! <p> Ca n't sign off without a mention of the pigs . They escaped again ! This time one managed to lift the gate off its hinges and then headed off towards the veggie patch . Fortunately not much damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them back in their paddock . It was just after this that Jackie happened upon an article in the Guardian where a pig farmer was eaten by his little babies . and apparently it has happened before ! At 105kgs each , I think it 's time for the chop . Watch this space . <p> ... but it 's the perennial complaint -- not enough ! Our UK readers will decry me for this comment but we had been looking forward to thunderstorms and heavy rain which had been forecast for last night . This morning however we were greeted by nothing more than a damp squib . We are now well and truly scraping the bottom of the barrel or rather in our case , the well , which will be bone dry very soon . <p> The pigs were happy though , as their dustbowl of a field is at least damp . They also continue to grow . they are now 90kgs each and getting ever closer to the chop ! <p> The bees have also done well . Or at least one hive has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had a total of 14kgs of honey from this one hive and absolutely nothing from the other hive . At least the bees from the second hive have produced some honey which should see them through the winter . As I have no honey extractor , I cut the honeycomb off the frames and then strain the honey out . With the remainder , I can then extract the wax by heating it and then straining it through a pair of tights . <p> So we 've now got almost a kilogramme of wax so once we get some wicks we 'll be able to make some candles . <p> I 've also been busy doing more woodworking and made another chair : <p> Although there is plenty to eat from the garden , we 've also been doing a lot of foraging hereabouts . There are a number of ruined houses in our village and a lot of them have mature fruit trees . Therefore we 've been enjoying fresh peaches , apples and especially damsons . Jackie has made damson jam and a most delicious damson ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sloe gin should be ready by Christmas . <p> I have been very remiss at blogging recently , but the intention has been there while snapping the veg patch . I took these photos 15/16 July when I pulled up the last of <p> the potatoes and replaced them with a second batch of courgettes and some buttercup squash . Then , amazed how fast everything had grown in just 3 weeks , I took another pic and today a shot of one of the squashes , almost ready to eat . <p> Needless to say we 're eating the courgettes now , the first batch took 13 weeks from sowing to harvest -- this lot 6 ! In fact that 's something I still have to get the hang of -- trying to get a succession of produce . Either the second lot grow much faster and we end up with more than we need , or it 's too hot / cold and nothing much happens . And if it worked one year it did n't the next , and why one melon plant has given us 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I have no idea . It all still feels a little hit or miss at times ! <p> I think the purple sprouting broccoli , sprouts , leeks , onions , sweetcorn , garlic , cucumber ( the round , yellow ones ) rainbow chard and all the solanaceae group fall into the ' do well every year ' group . Perhaps the toms a touch disappointing compared to last year but the aubergines and peppers are fab , and the potatoes a great success . <p> Then in the ' do well one year but not the next ' go the remaining brassicas including swede and turnips , ( and what happened to the cauliflowers this year ? ! ) , squash , roots ( well , the carrots and parsnips -- the beetroot do well ) and the beans . <p> And in the ' why am I even bothering ' category fall the peas ( alas ) and broad beans . Am still determined to give these a go this autumn though , last winter we had a frost most nights which took their toll so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are definitely not being sown in the spring though , that has never worked . <p> And always willing to experiment there are some new crops in the veg patch this year . The celeriac , flageolets beans ( grown from a packet of dried beans my dad bought over ) , beefsteak toms have all done well , whereas the red cabbage became pig fodder . <p> Talking of pigs -- they have certainly made a large and significant contribution to the veg patch : <p> Unfortunately , the weeding , digging and sh*t shovelling has done little to reduce my ever expanding waistline . The plethora of plums , abundance of apples , bucketfuls of blackberries and now ( fistfuls ? ) of figs have seen me baking cakes , tarts and pies galore . Oh , and there goes the oven bell ... <p> No posts for three weeks but we 've still been busy . Jackie on the veg patch ( she will post when she 's finished bottling the tomatoes ! ) and me with more woodworking projects . <p> One of these projects was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floorboards from the local sawmills and this is the result : <p> I 've also made a table for the courtyard ( the purple colour is Jackie 's idea in order to match the colour scheme of the courtyard which is ... purple and blue ) . <p> It 's not been all work and no play however . Our Spanish friends Scott and Delia visited and one of the things we did was go swimming in a local river . Of course the hairy ones loved this and Betty learned how to swim ! <p> It 's a little strange when you see the same thing every day , you just do n't notice it changing . This is especially true of nature which is constantly changing but usually too slowly to notice . This seemed to be the case for the pigs . <p> Actually , the changes should have been obvious , as they have been going through over 2kgs of pig food in addition to food scraps every day . Anyway , I measured them recently . I 'm sure it would be nigh on impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximation by measuring their length and girth . My rough calculations came out at over 60kgs each . Boy have they grown ! <p> So now the 60kg beasts have decided they are big enough to flex a bit of muscle , especially if their carers are a bit late with dinner . And that is what happened the other day . Dinner was late and so they decided to go after it themselves . The fence stood no chance and Jackie was soon screaming , " The pigs are out ! the pigs are out ! " Fortunately I had the food bucket to hand and they were soon chasing me back into their field . While they chowed down I made the necessary repairs ( fingers crossed ) . <p> We wo n't be late with dinner time again I can assure you . <p> Meanwhile , they still enjoy a bathe and as temperatures have risen into the thirties recently , here they are enjoying life . <p> pigs in heaven <p> Got some grub for us ? <p> Not just the pigs , but other things have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's pruning seems to have done the job with the apples and very soon , the peaches . So we are presently enjoying quite a few apple crumbles and apple and sultana cakes ( recipe to follow as it is seriously delicious ) . <p> Following on from the last post , I got 7kgs of honey ( that 's 14 jars ) from just 4 frames in one hive . I can take another 4 full frames out of the same hive but I think I 'll leave that for a few weeks to enable them to recover a bit . I think I 'll leave hive number 2 this time around -- they should make enough honey to last themselves over the winter but I wo n't take any . <p> As I do n't have an extractor , as I described in the last post , I had to cut up the comb to let the honey drip out ( a proper extractor just takes the honey and leaves the comb intact ) . But this had the advantage that I could use all the wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a pair of tights ) , I managed to get over 500g of pure beeswax . We just need to decide what to do with it now . We 're going to try and make candles but need to do a bit of research first . <p> As many readers will know , after producing stellar amounts of honey last year , our bees buzzed off last November , never to return . Undeterred we doubled up this year and now have two hives . <p> I 've been keeping an eye on them over the months and it has been a little odd to say the least . One hive has been going ahead great guns as far as honey production , while number two , although seemingly very healthy , and with loads of flowers about -- especially lavender , it just has n't been producing . <p> The bees in hive 1 have only just started to produce cells in the top box after which they can start to think about making honey . Meanwhile in hive number 2 , the top box is almost full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today I took off 4 frames . Here is one below . <p> As we only have two hives and an extractor costs in the hundreds of Euros we have to get the honey out the hard way . Basically I cut the honey out of the frames and allow it to drain through a colander as below . <p> So , I 'll take off 7 frames from hive number 2 in the next couple of days and see how we go . <p> We bought our chickens almost two years ago for a couple of euros each . We decided that three would be enough but got four because we were sure that they would n't all make it . Since then four healthy chickens have given us 1750 eggs and , of course , we 've become a little attached to our galinhas ( as did my Dad ! ) . We 've also got used to their clucking after they 've laid an egg and turned a deaf ear to their complaining from the bramble bushes when it 's been too hot . But yesterday afternoon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . She was in the connecting field to the one where their house is and calmed down a bit when I came out ; I did n't worry too much that I could only see three . But when she carried on squawking after I left we decided something was up . Richard went into the field and sadly , under the brambles , he found a headless chicken . No wonder there was so much noise , she had n't wanted to pass her sister to get back home . We now noticed the feathers everywhere and I hoped she 'd been attacked quickly . <p> This morning the remaining three were rather reticent to leave their caged run let alone go into the next door field , something they usually do first thing . What to do ? We decided that the third field , empty now except for a house and run because the ' roasties ' had all been dispatched , would be the perfect option . It does n't connect to the exterior stone wall , it 's a little nearer the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all cleaned and re-strawed and the hens found themselves a new home . <p> So what was it ? Not a fox , it would have killed all four and there would 've been more carnage . Richard reckons an Egyptian mongoose ( we 've seen them here ) or some kind of weasel . No doubt it 'll be back for a second helping of hen head but right now they 're locked away ( with much complaining ) and will be earlier in the day now until , I hope , the enemy gives up .

##3024751 <h> Main menu <h> Post navigation <h> Sunday Lunch at The Cross Keys , Water Lane , Leeds .. <p> The Cross Keys is probably our favourite pub in Leeds so I will apologise up front if this review appears a tad biased . Although we visit The Cross Keys around five or six times a month on any given day it is the on a Sunday that we find it a comforting sanctuary and enjoy most regularly . We tend to start by walking " The Lad " aka Chester our old dog along the canal and end up at the pub . This Sunday the Great British weather was behaving and the sun was out to play , the canal side is really wonderful and Leeds looks so different from this perspective , kind of comfortable in it 's post industrial makeover . We sat in the courtyard at the back of the pub and enjoyed a beer/wine before moving inside for lunch . The place is wood and stone floors , the beers are true and varied , the food just great quality pub dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy the Manager and is knowledgeable and very service orientated , table waiting , although you can just stand at the bar and enjoy the selection of real ales and a packet of scratchings if you prefer .... The a la carte menu changes regularly according to seasons but for us on a Sunday it has to be , beef , pork or lamb with all the trimmings . The Lad is spoilt and as a regular his bowl of water is generally served even before our drinks are ! Andy is in the habit of bringing out some off cuts ( which to my eye look suspiciously like prime bits of beef ) for The Lad , which are eaten with absolute joy and followed by a nap under the table ! A really nice touch for Sundays is the Feasting Menu which has to be ordered 72 hours in advance and is a choice of rib beef , pork shoulder or leg of lamb brought out and carved ( by yourself if you so wish ) at the table . Each cut of meat serves about 8 hungry people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever condiments you desire . We have done the feasting menu with family and friends on cold rainy Sundays when the log fires are roaring away , it truly is the perfect Sunday . No wonder then that the Guardian Food Magazine regularly has The Cross Keys as the runner up in their Sunday Lunch Pub competition , funny enough 
##3033551 <p> After joining up with Roy Hodgson 's England squad at Euro 2012 , Jordan Henderson stepped back down to the U21s for their own European Championship qualifiers , and yesterday captained them to a 1-0 win over Serbia in the first-leg of the final qualifying tie . He 's been a mainstay as captain at that level , and if today is any indication , a more permanent stay in the full England setup might not be too far away . <p> That 'll sound ridiculous to many , especially those who are still stuck on the price tag and have n't taken any time to actually pay attention to the type of performances that Henderson has been able to produce in limited action in the middle of the pitch . He certainly wo n't do it on the strength of public opinion , mostly for the aforementioned reasons , but rather if he 's able to continue to maintain the type of work ethic he 's displayed during a challenging season and change at Liverpool , as well as an attitude that 'll see him overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> " You just have to believe in your own ability , believe that you are a good enough player and then show it . Obviously when a new manager comes into a club then things can change , that 's natural . Brendan Rodgers has come in and has been brilliant for me personally . He has definitely helped me improve different parts of my game already . <p> " I think in the games I have managed to play , you can see that I have improved upon certain things , and that is because of him . The areas he has asked me to work on were mostly to do with discipline , and tactical awareness in the team . I 've developed my understanding of when to go forward , when to stay and things like that . I think you can see there is a lot more maturity in my performances , and I think that is down to his guidance . " <p> It 'd be easy for the player to be more disgruntled or displeased , particularly after Kenny Dalglish played him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of position and undeservedly ahead of players who were more experienced and effective . But Henderson 's perspective--one of learning from challenges and accepting that growth is necessary--will hopefully pay dividends down the road , and my hope is that those rewards are reaped at Liverpool rather than somewhere else . <p> You would n't think that displays against Udinese in the Europa League and West Brom in the League Cup are going to drive him any further away from Liverpool , although if rumors over the summer are to be believed his status at the club will continue to be tenuous . If that 's what we get from him while he 's still with the club , though , we ca n't complain , 
##3037450 <h> Twitter , customer service and employee trust -- @SouthernRailUK <p> So on route to #trulondon this morning , my train was running both late and over-crowded . My ticket was valid , but not for first class . The entire train was packed , standing room too , except first class -- completely empty . No guard or conductor in sight to check with , so I just jumped in and settled down to work . <p> At this point , I thought I 'd tweet the rail operator . Partially because they claim to provide customer service on Twitter which I wanted to test , but also because if I was going to get grief ( or even fined ! ) I wanted to check that situation out quickly . I got a swift response , which was at least a partial result -- though it only expressed some light regret at the situation rather than offering anything more constructive . I followed up , making my concerns a little clearer regards how a ticket inspector might react . At this point , the official account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party jumped in to defend the role of the ticket inspector . Clearly s/he was trying to defend the poor inspector who probably finds themselves on the sharp end of disgruntled customers regularly , but I was intrigued . A quick scan revealed the user regularly responded to other Southern Rail customers , defending the staff . <p> A little further correspondence reveals yes , s/he is a railway insider -- who thinks of the customer service staff on Twitter as being " parrots " . <p> The exchange being concluded , a few thoughts : <p> If you 're going to offer customer service on Twitter ( or any other online platform ) offer something USEFUL . " We 're sorry for the screw-up " does n't quite go far enough , in person or on line . <p> If your own staff do n't respect your efforts to monitor and respond , what makes you think the general public will ? <p> The user finished by asking me to delete the tweets concerned , suggesting a culture of fear/blame exists . Why else would removal be requested .... ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believes strongly in Employer Transparency ... Irony ? <p> The identity of the user in the screenshots is obscured for obvious reasons and original tweets deleted . <h> Share this : <h> Like this : <p> ...

##3038450 <p> We had some really good chances but at the moment we are not taking them , the same thing happened last week . We are making them and conceding few chances to the opposition but we lost two points again today . <p> On the new players <p> We need three , four , five games together and then we will see ( how good they are ) . They have the quality . " <p> On two points from two games <p> It is not good enough . We wanted the three points , but it is a hard place to come and try to get the points . <p> Arsene Wenger on the result in the wake of last week <p> I would say it 's two points dropped , on the game . We 've played against two teams that as a unit defend very well . When you see some other games , you know , they are open games . We played against two teams who were really focussed on defending , defending , defending . They did very well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , they play , they open their game -- after , of course it 's easier to score . But today it was a cup fight , for 90 minutes . What is most important is what you learn about your team , that we are capable to stand up ... and we behaved like men who are ready for a fight , and that is the most important thing for me . <p> On the positives and negatives <p> We were very strong spirit-wise , dominant in the challenges , defensively strong . Offensively still have some work to do , there is still something missing . <p> On missing van Persie <p> I had the same questions when Henry left as now . This time last season I was being told not to play RVP as centre forward . <p> On Jamie Redknapp saying Giroud and Podolski were weaker than RVP <p> I do n't listen much to what people say <p> On the rumours linking Arsenal with a move for Newcastle midfield Chiek Tiote <p> That Captain Scarlet lookalike prick ca n't get it into his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations so he can now stop being biased . How the man keeps his job I have on idea .

He was n't that bad , i 'm pretty sure he had a shot that was close to going in .

He had his chance all season and he was average at best and this season is no difference . Why trying to prove the world wrong ( look at Almunia ect ) about players we all know he will never make it at The Arsenal while we pay you more than ANY manager in the league to WIN not develop players to make us a FEEDER CLUB . <p> Cygan , why do you come here ? I get the feeling a majority of us skip your posts , and no one really wants to hear you be that negative . Go start your own blog on why Arsenal are awful and if you were a true fan you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , when we were getting desperate and yes he lost the ball , but get a grip of yourself man . Diaby played 90 and did sweet FA . Nothing good , nothing bad . NOTHING . If you 're happy with that contribution , then we are watching two different games . <p> What playing week in week out , in his first full season , after the loss of Cesc and Nasri , in a makeshift midfield with long term injuries to Wilshere and Diaby , and with Rosicky still playing shit . AND . After a horrific injury which broke the tibula and fibula in SIX places . I 'm sick of repeating this all the time . <p> when was the last time ramsey had a decent game for arsenal ? im sick of hearing the injury excuse.it was a long time ago.if he s not over it by now he shoudnt be at arsenal.i like ramsey.i want him to do well.but the fact is he s been piss poor for a long time now . <p> Speaking as someone who has broken both my arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar manner to how Ramsay 's leg was broken , I can attest that it takes a very , very long time to recover your former strength and dexterity even after they 've healed ( although they never really do heal completely ) . I like Ramsay , although I accept he 's not perfect , but he needs to be given some slack . After an injury of that magnitude and spending that long out , it will take a while for him to recover his form . He 's most definitely not the finished article yet . <p> Diaby seems to be having a nice stroll on the park each week . Kind of hanging out near the circle , just in case . When he gets the ball , he does well enough . He 's obviously got talent . Seems disinterested in anything going on around him . <p> Do n't mistake his calmness for disinterest . Diaby can read the game exceptionally well , and keep calm in most situations to pick out the right pass . Just that for the pass two games , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neville is being fairly fair in his assessment of Arsenal -- he basically said that we killed the crowd and kept Stoke quiet all afternoon , but we 're a little toothless at the moment . Redknappy can fuck right off . <p> Do love Arteta , though . Real workforce in Midfield and he played excellently today . Positive thinking , Gooners . We did n't play badly today , and lots of teams will struggle at the Shittania . <p> I think that as a team we 're looking in good shape . We 're creating chances , and looking really solid defensively . Once the new boys up front start clicking we 're going to be a force to be reckoned with <p> Is it me or does Diaby seemed more " restricted " compared to last time . Seems like he is instructed to maintain the midfield shape instead of his old self caught up field and jogging back . On the whole this Arsenal team seems well drilled and discipline thus far . Vermaelen not much cavalier runs upfield . Shape of the side defensively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Man Marking to Zonal ) <p> Yeah Liverpool chose to play ' football ' today , the Brendan Rogers way , passing the ball around . Unfortunately , that was their downfall as well in the end when Skrtel gave the ball away . Like every other team , I do n't think they would get on as well with those tactics against us but would be a great game . <p> It 's funny how all other team supporters say we are shit but when they play the Arsenal what do they do , sit back and defend . We 've had two draws , and really we should have won atleast one of these but Arsene had a point , both teams were quite defensive against us , and unfortunately it 's going to be like that most of the season , got ta step it up a gear . Play with the intent we did last season whenever we were a goal down , that kept us coming back so many times . <p> Look at the starts of Manu , City and Spurs . For heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play for . This is not the time to throw the baby out with the bath water . It 's the time to bed players in and take stock maturely . <p> The defensive performances have been the silver lining . It 's really encouraging to see them all gel so well . Keiran Gibbs has been fantastic in my opinion -- I am really happy to see the dude put some good games together . Hopefully we can stay fit with our back four and get some cohesion . Sagna and Kos are only going to make things sweeter . <p> I think our problem in attack is that a ) we have n't had a whole lot of time to gel , and b ) with the way Sunderland and Stoke have played , it is very difficult to get any rhythm going with the new guys . We have n't been afforded too many opportunities to break things up and play with speed and efficiency . Just standing around a clogged up final third and shooting through piles of blithering numbskulled dolts is not at all conducive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , because there will be more than enough teams who will give us these sorts of games and be happy to slug off with a point , so we need to find ways to adapt and overcome , but I think that will come with time and patience . <p> Opening fixtures are a bit tough and that 's why the sunderland draw seems quite the missed opportunity right now . We had like almost what ? 18 corners in these two games but nothing came of ' em . I 'd like to think per , giroud , verm would do the business for us but maybe that 's just me . <p> Look at the table . Of the teams above us how many wil be ther at the end of the season ? Chelsea , but then if you spend 80 mill on top of what they 've already spent and run a massive loss every year you bloody well should . As it stand Man U are 1 point ahead ditto City . And there are a measly 108 points still to play for . Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Wenger has shown that he knows a little more than all those who post on Internet fora ..... <p> Very early thoughts on premier league ( obviously this could change very quickly ) : Title contenders Manchester City-Defending champions Manchester United- Have great attacking depth . Defense will improve as players return from injury Chelsea- Torres looks much improved and Hazard is an absolute stud . Fighting for fourth : Newcastle- good starting XI , lack depth Everton- hard working over achievers Arsenal- Best team on paper in this category but we need to start scoring soon Liverpool- they will improve under brendan rodgers , look good against man city . <p> Not convinced by United 's midfield or Chelsea 's defence though , it 's all very well saying that you 're going to outscore the opposition but with a few injuries it only takes a striker to have an off day and you 're struggling to score whilst leaking goals , not a good position as we all know . <p> Too early to say anything for sure but everybody in the top 7 has a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resolved , shaping up to be an interesting season . <p> we have to believe in this team , i agree with wenger when he says something is missing , but am sure he will get it right . <p> 2 games , 2 points it is not great but not bad either , i feel we will do well this season , there is something missing , may be wenger should look at the formation , we play 433 , maybe next game try 442 , or even 451 but i trust wenger , he will get it right for sure , no doubt about that . jamie redknapp , saying giroud and poldi is weaker than rvp , this was the same guy that was criticising rvp when he had his bad moments . wenger is right , we should forget about this people and focus on the positive . we will come good <p> I 'm pleased that about the two clean-sheets . If we have a good foundation then we can work our way up . We need an DM as our midfielders seem too preoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset this means that there 's an over reliance on Carzola to create chances . <p> I think that 's another issue with lack of gametime together , unless we sign someone who strictly Makeleles it 'll be something we 'll run into with a new DM too ... would n't complain at someone else coming in to play there though . <p> On a brighter note the defense looked a lot better , hope the the attack starts firing too as there are some tough fixtures on the horizon . I do n't think Gervinho should ever start before OX and Theo , he has some good quality 's but he give 's the ball away way to often . <p> cazorla , podolski and giroud are awesome . now wenger go find a player who can act as a bridge between cazorla and the frontman.i do n't see cazorla as the final ball player.cazorla creates the game . but i get a feeling we are missing the link between cazorla and the frontmen. a false nine type player . bring on jesus navas . <p> Playing a no.10 off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I see it , there 's no dropping deep and no gap left . The link is n't there due to a lack of synergy in our passing , rather than a tactical shortfall . If it does n't improve in time then we get worried and start thinking about tactics imo . <p> We are competing in four competitions . We are about to clear out all the striker we had in the squad last season surely there will be a striker or strikers coming in because cant see Arsene risking our only two forwards for carling cup since both campbell and afobe are out on loan as well . <p> actually , he 'll probably play them so that they can bed into the team . And also so that we can win the damn thing and shut all the morons up about silverware . <p> And I do n't think he should play Podolski &; Giroud together -- they should alternate as the striker , depending on who we 're playing -- Podolski on the wing is not disciplined to stick on the wing , he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none for Diaby and no real overlap play for Gibbs . So for folks on here dissing Diaby , if you watch the game again , you 'll see he did n't have anywhere to go . <p> Personally , I 'd rather see Arteta up there creating chances , as I feel he 's more disciplined and less liable to let go of the ball , but I understand he has quite a job to do in the back , and he does it well . <p> When a manager skips off the pitch with a smile on his face after scraping a draw then that tells Pulis got what he wanted the loser . Goals will come but I thought gervinho was pretty average today , especially when the ox is sat o the bench . <p> Jamie rednapp needs to keep his trap shut at all times ! Goals will come my fellow gunners keep the faith and do nt worry ! Forget about rvp and song they werent real full blooded gunners but money grabbing traitors ! <p> It 's embarrassing the way we treat some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seemingly was quite happy to stay . Even if you think selling him was a good choice , there 's no reason to trash the guy . <p> Sunderland and Stoke fall into the category of teams that go into games with us looking for a point and hope to snatch a win . In the past , they have been able to snatch wins thanks to less than stellar defensive displays , however I feel that this time around a point will be the best these teams will achieve against us if they are lucky ( especially once Giroud and Podolski settle in ) . Alas these are early days but i will keep an eye out for when these two teams play the likes of city , utd , chelsea ( a.k.a the cunts , cunts and blue cunts ) , have a feeling that we will see the " snatch a win " thing in those games . <p> i would like wenger to try some thing out ... we should play these players : -- -- -- Giroud -- -- -- -- -- Carzola Aoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermy Mert Coquellen -- -- -Mannone -- -- - <p> all 3 must keep interchanging positions ........ we should not sell arsh and must rotate him Podolski and gerviniho with Carzola Aoc and walcott . Also we need a back for diaby and arteta and Mvilla suits the role perfectly . Also we need a def who can play cb and rb . <p> Another deluded fan who still thinks Walcott should be playing for Arsenal over The OX ! " Oh but he is great when he can run into space " So is Usain bloody Bolt ! Two touches today and two passes to Stoke . 100k contract ...... Get rid ASAP <p> No , he means the exact opposite to what you think he means . Without the colon , the title reads as though the author is quoting someone who thinks that Arteta is not good enough . With the colon it reads as Arteta saying " not good enough . " <p> I really like Arteta . I honestly ca n't remember the last time one of our players came out in an interview with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked solid , composed and well drilled and the midfield had good shape and discipline . The only thing missing was a goal . But that will come . Yeah , looked really good today -- must be the ' BF ' -- Bould Factor . Up the Arse ! <p> I do n't want to write Giroud off as he may come good as the season unfolds , but based on the 1st 2 games , he does n't have what it takes to lead the like at the present moment . Guys like Hazard are rare that they can just walk into the premier League from another league and adapt and contribute straight away without any fuss at all . We are expecting that from Podolski and Giroud and that just is n't fare to them . Saying that , I thought Lukas played much better today but I 'm not sold on Giroud just yet . It would have been no different if we had our misfiring Moroccan playing instead today . Diaby is still way too slow and takes too much time on the ball for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter when the rest of the midfield is healthy . That would be a crime when Wilshire and Rosicky are healthy again . Disgusted with the boos for Ramsey but his 10 min cameo was hardly impressive and was in fact quite the opposite with a couple of giveaways in dangerous positions . Felt sorry for him because of the boo birds , but he is a poor substitute for Cazorla . Again , when the rest of the lads in midfield are healthy , young Aaron should have trouble even making the bench . Wenger has until Friday to strengthen this team . I would opt for another creative midfielder and if he can buy a proven striker , that 's what I hope he would do . Micky Artete is doing a great job back there and Song wo n't be missed as much as first anticipated . On the positives -- Bould 's work on the defence and organization looks great . I know Kos might be ready for the L'pool game but the Vermanator and our BFG have looked assured in the 1st two games and deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan ! Not doom and gloom as media would like to portray it , but Wenger does need to do some shopping before Friday . Good that L'pool took some points from City so all potential contenders have slipped up bar Chelsea -- but that will happen eventually as well . We just got to stay within 4-5 pts while our new boys settle . Come on Wenger , surprise us with at least one more big name signing ! <p> Most definitely there are positives to take from this game , for me they are ; <p> Cazorla looking very comfortable on the ball , and moving it forward at every opportunity . He will create a lot this season and score some too , likes to shoot . <p> Arteta again showing how important he is to us , excellent distribution , solid tackler and never stops running for the team . <p> Podolski linking up well with Gibbs on the left , he had a great 1st half and looked one of our most potent threats , he can cut in too and is a powerful runner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Defence looking really solid , I did n't have butterflies in my stomach today at set-pieces or high balls into our box , credit to Mannone , he commanded well . <p> I do think the forward line will gel , they are experienced players who can all score goals , it nearly clicked a few times in the 1st half today , scoring goals is never really a problem for us , I have no reason to believe it will be this season . After Henry left , Adebayor stepped up , then RvP , our forwards have the quality , it just might take a couple of more matches to get them firing . <p> After the first two games , my predictions are : 1 . Podolski will predominantly play through the centre and become the ' White Wright ' . 2 . Giroud will be responsible for a lot of Arsenal 's male fans questioning their sexuality . 3 . We need to sign Jesus Navas ... actually any player called Jesus will do . 4 . AOC will win the Young Player of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personally I think things are building nicely . Some good steel and organisation shown at the back leading to two clean sheets -- an area of real concern over the past couple of years looks to be on its way to being improved . <p> The front third will improve as they get used to playing with each other ( pun intended ) and once Wenger understands how/where they best operate . <p> The back five ( 6 ? ) need to provide a good solid base on which the new chaps up front can build as they find their feet in the Prem -- and they are at present ( although finding anyone 's feet in the meadow that was Stoke 's pitch would be tough ) . Cazorla looks very good , as does Podolski and Giroud looks like he might need more time -- Arsenal play quite differently to his previous club . <p> I 'm excited to see how it develops over the next few weeks and I have no doubts that they will all come together in the end , like a well timed gay porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goals win you games , defence and clean sheets win you championships " . I must say I loved what I saw defensively yesterday . Steve Bould has been a major influence on the team . When I read the interview from players pre-season I felt it was the usual PR job , but as I was watching the game yesterday , I realised when was the last time players had raved about a new coach ! ! I could see exactly what he has done , and the defensive unit was brilliant . If I am not mistaken we are the only team who have not let in a single goal this season . <p> The goals will get there , do n't worry . Carzola is a great signing , though he sort of went missing the second half , but I loved his impact in the first half . He looked tired the second half but he will get there . I am starting to like Giroud , and he is definitely not one who is lacking confidence . You would think that after his miss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a spectacular overhead attempt from a corner , and an audacious half line shot that was inches from winning us the game , laid all such doubts to rest . This guy is here to stay . <p> Offensively we are not attacking as a group , and that is the problem . Its more like one guy takes it upon himself to score and takes those shots from outside or just tries to run past 4-5 defenders into the box . That understanding will come , and so will the goals , once the attacking movement and understanding develop . Remember this group is very different from the one that finished last season , and they are still trying to find each other on the field . <p> Defensive though I have no complaints , and Mertasacker who looked a little off the pace last season , has really come up , and sort of reminds me of Kosceilny in his second season , and we all know what a big improvement he was . I like the way this team is shaping , the no goals thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nil-nil would be a good result there as well , so lets not over-react if that happens . One would a nil nil from Liverpool away any season . It is still +1 and not -2 . <p> On players , Walcott ddi n't look the part , and has disappointed in his two appearances , as has Gervinho . Jenkison has been HUGE and so far the best player in the two games . Stoke really exposes you , and Jenkinson looked as solid as anyone . Diaby is another player who has developed in leaps and bounds , or atleast appears to have developed in leaps and bounds , defensively . I had always thought of him as being avg offensively and a liability in defence , but he has looked the part in his new role . <p> Lots of positives ....... yes we should have beaten Sunderland , but the positives far outweight this one negative so far . I look forward to 
##3039950 <h> The Age of Miracles -- Karen Thompson Walker <p> Title -- The Age of Miracles <p> Author - Karen Thompson Walker <p> Published - 21 June 2012 <p> Genre -- Young adult / Science fiction <p> Many thanks to Simon and Schuster for this review copy . <p> I was drawn to the premise of this book -- that slowly , gradually , the earth has slowed and the days have gradually lengthened . The change has passed unnoticed until it 's announced that the night has grown by 56 minutes . <p> The story is told by eleven year old Julia , an only child and daughter of an obstetrician and a part-time teacher and former actress . Until the news of the change Julia 's only concerns have been school , soccer practice , and piano lessons . Suddenly her world is full of uncertainty . <p> The changes start off slowly - darker nights , hotter days , gradually increasing gravity , and these changes are the back-drop to Julia 's life at school . But the days keep getting longer and longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities to match the " time " or at least the light or dark , but then the decision is announced that the country will revert to a 24-hour clock . Then night and day are no longer tied to dark and light . Not everyone chooses to act as if nothing has happened and there are those who try carry on adapting to the days , " real-timers " and those who to build a life in " daylight colonies " . But society soon shuns those who do n't toe the accepted line . <p> But during all of this Julia 's story is also personal -- the changes have implications for her family and her friends , as well as a budding romance . <p> I did enjoy the book and I liked the style of writing . It was an easy read and Julia is a likeable central character . If I have a criticism it 's that it did n't feel like quite one thing or the other -- it was n't quite a coming of age story but neither did it really explore the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just my age , but Julia felt a little too old for her years -- all I knew about boys at her age were that they were the opposite of girls . There 's something disconcerting about the way in which she tells the story when she obviously knows how it will end ( " It was the last time I ever tasted a grape . " ) . <p> Interestingly the book made headline news in the publishing industry for the size of the deal to secure the rights to this debut . A great book for the beach or plane . You can see another review of this over at The Little Reader Library . <h> 4 Responses to The Age of Miracles -- Karen Thompson Walker <p> I do n't know if I would mind that Julia felt older than her years -- maybe because of the premise . Sometimes I actually like that in book characters so I may have to read my copy of this book . I have an ARC too , but I have n't looked at it as I hate reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great buzz AND is was one of the highest auctioned 
##3047050 <h> Going to the darkside - roadbiking and commuting - advice sought <p> So due to personal circumstances i find my offroad riding seriously curtailed ( my missus had twins 4 weeks ago ) . Faced with the option of either blimping out or finding a plan b , i have dipped my toe in to the world of commuting by bike . The one thing that has become apparent quite quickly is how totally inappropriate a full sus bike is for the 17 mile road trip on mainly A roads . I have had a quick look around online for an appropriate Bike but a little bewildered at the number of options . <p> So whats some good options to look into ? What should i look out for ? Do n't really want to pay too much as the bike will get locked up outside while in work . I want to go fast but avoid some rigid boneshaking missile that destroys my back and gets stolen . Maybe spend up to 500 . <p> If you have to carry stuff , work clothes , paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in said panniers , regardless of how waterproof they are meant to be , put in plastic bags . Do you have shower facilities at work ? If not , leave a wash bag at work , take a small towel and flannel and wash your bits in the sink when you get in . Disclaimer ; take care if communal washroom ! Shirts if you need them are an art to fold for the journey or drive on Monday and take a weeks worth in . Or , get them cleaned and pressed near work if that 's an option . Enjoy it , I love my commute , it gives me time to forget all my shit from work . <p> 17 miles each way requires something reasonably smooth and fast . A road machine , tourer/audax/cyclocross . You 'll defintely want full mudguards and a rack , and lights that mount to the rack . For 500 , I 'd buy <p> 1 ) That btwin for 300 - it is amazing value 2 ) New set of tyres : Scwalbe Durano S 40/pr from https : //www.sportpursuit.com/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) SKS chromoplastic guards 30 4 ) B and M Toplight rear light on the rack plus a Cateye Rapid 1 on the seatpost 30 5 ) A decent Ortlieb city pannier 60 6 ) A Front light - proabably a discontinued Cateye el600 if you can find one , or go for Exposure Flash/Flare . <p> If you want a used bike , higher spec , then something like a used Dawes Audax/Giro - unfashionable brand , so better value . <p> EDIT : I have assumed you have a decent set of shoes and pedals , plus some form of lycra shorts and clothing . <p> That decathlon looks good . Usual situation while checking the website out - for only 200 quid more theres that white one in the nicer colour ( serously thats the only way i can differentiate ) . And for 200 more thn that theres that cyclocross thingy . <p> I 've got the Sport 2 , next one up in the range . If you can , the paddle 105 shifters Kato mentions are an advantage - I 've got Sora and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rings , and a " mouse-ear " shifter on the hood for going down . This means you ca n't do half the shifts from the drops . <p> Not a huge problem , but if you can stretch to 105 they 'd be better . ( You can of course always just leave it as an upgrade for the future ) . <p> You can see the second lever here , it 's the silver bit in the middle of the shifter on the right : <p> Sounds like you have some facilities which is good . If you take 3/4 sets of work clothes in on a Monday along with extra food ect in the car you can probably remove the need for racks etc . Drive on a Friday too to clear out the locker of stuff . Should give you up to 3 days or just alternate Tues/Thurs . <p> As for bike Cycle 2 Work is your friend . Keep eyes peeled and ear to the ground for the enthusiastic guy who managed 2 runs on the bike before giving in . I got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 years old 200 miles for 200 . Doubled it 's miles in the first week and got the cables stretched <p> Winston . I 'm sorry but its all about the bike.i 'll bike to work in my pyjamas if its the difference between an upgrade groupset or a carbon frame . Actually i got loads of good kit however I ' will be the one looking a bit confused on the carbon race bike with baggy shorts . Do n't need luggage .... yet . Can store at work and i got enoughforward facing lights for las vegas . Need rear lights tho . <p> Give it a month of day in , day out all weather riding through the winter . Those mudguards , rack and yes , some form of luggage , will be more than worth the groupset upgrade . Especially as the salty grime corrodes the parts and the chain is ground down by road paste and washed clean of lubricant every other day . There is a lot of truth in what Winston says . <p> For the record , here 's my commuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 220 of ebay ) plus some nice new wheels , so about 500 all in . <p> And when you add in clothing , very roughly bike expenditure is the same as the accessories is the same as clothing . In fact clothing may be the outright winner based on the cost of nice winter boots , wind and rainproof tights and a nice coat/shell . Come January , it 's all about the clothes and accessories <p> As a counter to the racks etc. if your not doing everyday ie can drive a supply of nice clean clothes and a towel in the stick with a non racked bike . Prepare you kit and have some spares in the office . <p> My initial advice would have been an audax/cyclocross bike but that b-twin does look good for the money . Definitely get the full guards and a rack . Full guards will keep a lot of crap off of you and the bike making both the ride and maintenance less of a chore and after a few rides you really do n't notice the loaded rack at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a rack get a light that attaches to the back of the rack as it 's less likely to be obscured by panniers/ jackets etc . ) <p> As for clothing , waterproof gloves and decent winter shoes and/or overshoes if you are intending on going right through the winter . Fleecy top with a wind-stopper lining and a light rainproof shell jacket would be my preference for up top . And I 'd go for bib tights with either a roubaix or windstopper lining on the legs . <p> I never really solved the issue of cold wet feet on a commute although full length guards did delay the onset of trench foot for a while . <p> On a well set up bike 17 miles each way is n't so bad , probably just over an hour on a normal day so long as you have a decent route without too many stoppages . Plenty of people do that sort of commute and come the Summer

As we are talking about children there is also the question of whether or not there was adequate supervision provided by the BBC whilst in thier care . <p> I reckon any decent plaintiff lawyer will come up with half a dozen causes of action , plead them all and of course you only need to prove one of them .

In cases involving priests and teachers that defence has been unsuccessful because they hold a position of trust as part of their job , so courts have accepted a breach of that trust as creating the connection necessary to justify a claim of vicarious liability . <p> Whether or not Savile could be argued to have been in a position of trust while working as a DJ or TV presenter is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fail on that point , leaving plaintiffs with the job of proving negligence as their only route to compo . <p> It will likely be much more of problem for the hospitals where he worked as volunteer , but then that may well turn into a legal wrangle over the extent to which an employer can held liable for the actions of someone who is n't actually an employee . <p> As ever , I strongly suspect that the only sure fire winners in any of this will be lawyers . <p> But Unity 's gaming this as if the BBC is sitting at the table playing with it 's own money .

There is far more power in a 3rd sector/media driven panic than in the Parliament . That 's why I wrote that post back in the day at Cats , about how we 're in a similar " who runs the country ? " situation to the one Grocer Ted faced in the 70s , except this time it 's not the Unions , it 's the pressure groups , charidees and NGOs . <p> Another point here is that although this is civil litigation ( the MO imported from that vile legalist stew , the USA ) , evidentiary standards in criminal cases of alleged historic rape/abuse/goosed on Top Of The Pops are , thanks to the Feminist hegemony , appallingly low .

There is simply no way that this testimony could have been credible .

His lawyer pointed out that it was a long established principle of British law that a man could not rape his wife . The Prosecution argued that the local equivalent of the Married Women 's Property Act , even though it did not mention marital rape , ended that . The Courts upheld that idiotic decision all the way to the High Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a crime . They held that Hale 's logic -- that the person of a wife becomes extinct on marriage -- no longer applied . Marital rape did not become a crime until recently . Even in Australia . A highly creative bit of legal smoke and mirrors . <p> SMFS : you 're saying that the court held that rape in marriage was a crime , but marital rape was n't ? <p> In any case , why is this a problem for you ? If parliament inadvertently passed a law making murder legal , and subsequently passed a law making it illegal again with retrospective effect , would that be an injustice 
##3054451 <p> " Your pong ball is in my cup " or , why the fraternity system at Dartmouth sucks for everyone but especially for girls <p> The Dartmouth clock tower . Photo by Louisa Dunnigan . <p> In a dimly lit basement , I am playing my second game of pong with a guy I just met . <p> Feet sticking to the grimy floor , we try to hit a ping-pong ball into a crowd of red cups at the other end of the table , while our opponents do the same . If the ball lands in the piss-warm beer , you drink . The ball has also been in the bin , on the floor , and down the dusty back of the benches , but no matter -- this is a Friday night at Dartmouth and if you want a beer , you have to play the game . As I hop around the room , I think fondly of the pub back home . Suddenly , a friend from England appears , and draws me to one side . He 's clearly feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says that those guys over there told him to tell me that I should " watch out " , because playing pong with someone is essentially like going on a date . I feel as awkward as the messenger looks , and we leave . <p> What strange world have I stumbled into , where men ca n't talk directly to women , where playing a drinking game is equivalent to a date , where sharing a cup of scummy beer might lead to unmentionable consequences ? I am in a fraternity . A " frat " is a members ' club that only men can join . Found at universities all over the US , Dartmouth has a particular overabundance of them , and one of the most active Greek systems in the country ; the summer I spent there in 2011 , around 80% of the sophomores were affiliated with a frat , or its female equivalent , a sorority . Features of a Dartmouth frat house include a large living room on the ground floor , littered with furniture in various states of disrepair , upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , and finally , exerting its presence over the rest of the house like a festering subconscious , a huge and stinking basement . <p> In the isolated town of Hanover , in a country where most undergraduates are below the legal drinking age , fraternities in Dartmouth are the hub of student social life ; almost all parties and drinks evenings take place in their sweaty basements , dominated by the ubiquitous pong tables . While some sororities allow drinking , most do n't , and few hold parties . For women , going out means being a guest or a date in a space controlled by men . Women are seemingly better treated , often served quicker at the bar , or allowed access to hidden selections of spirits , but this outward generosity creates an atmosphere of ambiguous social debt . In a space where , as one girl puts it , " what brothers say is practically the word of god " , women are dependent on the goodwill and protection of the men that own it . As another student says , women " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they enter a fraternity . " <p> This power imbalance is compounded by the lack of alternatives on the Dartmouth scene . In the UK , students have countless options for nights out : pubs , bars , and clubs all provide neutral spaces where the sexes are on an equal footing . At Dartmouth , there are only three co-ed houses , which host one or two nights a semester , and the alcohol-free nights occasionally put on by the college are poorly attended . This leaves only the frats . Although there are seventeen to pick from , each with its own particular reputation , they are all variations on a theme , and , as in the student cafeteria where the plethora of options eventually reveal themselves to be the same greasy cheese and meat combination , choice here is an illusion . <p> In such an environment , relations between the sexes are warped . When I ask ex-fraternity member Andrew Lohse , who was profiled in Rolling Stone after writing an article exposing initiation rites at frats , about the way men in frats regard women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as a validating force of the fraternity 's ' social capital . ' " This is reflected in women 's experiences ; according to student Rochelle Brown , " Guys just test the waters of what a girl is going to be comfortable with by ' doing ' rather than ' asking . ' " <p> At their best , these replies point to the immaturity that the frat system encourages , a childish " I want " reaction rather than an attempt to relate maturely to another person . This is partly connected to students ' relationship with alcohol -- the way beer only seems to be drunk after it has baptised a ping-pong ball , grown men and women drinking in basements like they 're hiding out from their parents . For a Brit , it 's like going back in time to teenage house parties , only this time all the boys ' voices have broken and the vodka comes not from dad 's drinks cupboard but from economy sized plastic bottles . The legal drinking age is not the frats ' fault , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basements . Men and women traverse the campus in separate groups , uniformed in their frat or sorority t-shirts , or sit at separate tables in the cafeteria like something from a high school sit-com . Though men and women do sometimes form friendships , it is not immediately evident in the social landscape . <p> But this is a relatively tame problem . At their worst , Lohse and Brown 's comments point to something much darker . Sexual assault is an alarmingly prevalent issue at Dartmouth , and one that dominates discussions of women 's experience of fraternities . In 2001 , Zeta Psi fraternity was banned after it circulated a newsletter giving tips on how to date rape girls . This frat , newly allowed a return to campus before my arrival , was described to me by a friend as " rapey . " Another frat was " sleazy " -- " Do n't go there alone . " Dartmouth 's own Sexual Abuse Awareness Program estimated that in 2006 , there were 109 rapes on campus . <p> The college is trying to tackle this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards-Sexual Assault Review , and a Safe Ride program , among other initiatives . But , as student Juan Sanchez notes , " addressing sexual assault in itself is like curing the symptom of a disease and not the cause . " When the sexes are so divided , it becomes much easier for them to objectify , and , in the extreme , assault each other . The faculty has tried to change the fraternity system at Dartmouth many times over the course of its history ; in the 80s they argued for the co-mingling of all frats and sororities , but were met with severe opposition from the clubs themselves . Today , women are not a silent victim of the system ; there are open and frequent discussions of how women feel at frats , and about the sexism they encounter . But this is not just a ' women 's issue ' , and it is dangerous to sideline it as such . A system based entirely on the segregation of the sexes is n't positive for anybody . It affects men 's development and their experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Lohse 's expose and the national attention it attracted , change is slowly coming to the fraternities , but it will be a while before real gender

##3058150 <h> Poor Wolves fail at Burnley <p> Wolves fell to defeat at Burnley after a performance that was lacking in defensive stability and creativity and was low on attacking ideas . Its 2 points out of the last 12 now and on this showing there will be more disappointments to come . Solbakken decided to play with the same starting 11 that had failed to inspire against Charlton last week ; <p> It was a dull first period with neither team threatening to score until Burnley found a way through the Wolves defence out of the blue after 18 minutes and promptly opened the scoring . Mee 's through ball sent Patterson through a gaping hole between Foley and Johnson and he scored confidently with only Ikeme to beat . The remainder of the half will have been a familiar watch to those who were at Molineux last week with Wolves playing the ball around at a pedestrian pace and never looking likely to open up the home defence . <p> When Johnson gave the ball away near his own area , Ikeme came to Wolves rescue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking vulnerable for Wolves with poor passing out of defence and only Berra looking solid in defence . Doumbia was doing ok ahead of the defence but the strikers were rarely in the game and Pennant was failing to produce on the right . The only brightness for Wolves in an attacking sense came from occasional bursts from Sako . And he almost conjured an equaliser three minutes before the break . After being sent through on the left of the area by Ward he cut back inside the defenders and hammered the ball across the face of the goal with the ball passing agonisingly between the far post and the in rushing Ebanks Blake . <p> The only change at the start of the second half saw Sako move to a more central role behind the strikers with Ward playing further forward on the left . But Burnley despite playing with only one up front were looking the more likely to add another goal . Johnson gave the ball away in his own half and Austin was able to get in a shot that was deflected for a corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorer Austin had a free header to increase the lead . All the Wolves defenders were guilty of poor passing and Johnson almost gifted a third goal when his attempted clearance went straight to Austin on the edge of the area with Ikeme blocking the strikers shot . <p> Edwards and Forde replaced Johnson and Pennant as Solbakken tried to change things and the lineup for the last 20 miniutes was ; <p> Wolves did dominate possession late on as Burnley tried to sit on the lead but only Sako looked likely to open up the hosts . His free kick picked out the head of Ebanks Blake who should have done better than send a soft header straight at the keeper . Then in Wolves best attack of the game Sako beat two players before sending in a deflected shot from 25 yards that came back off the post and when SEB seemed to have a chance to turn in the rebound he trod on the ball which ran free to Doyle whose shot was saved . <p> Ikeme -- his kicking was n't always good but made a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on his game today and struggled with his defending and distribution Johnson -- had a really poor game with some weak challenges and misplaced clearances Berra -- probably the best of the back four defensively but some very poor passing Ward -- struggled against his winger early on and made little impact when pushed further forward Pennant -- has been quite disappointing so far and this was his least effective performance since joining on loan Henry -- steady enough but not able to push into the more attacking role needed when Wolves were chasing the game Doumbia -- better than most in midfield before being moved into defence when Johnson was taken off . Did ok before he caught the bug and lost possession on the edge of his own area Sako -- far and away Wolves best player and its starting to feel that Wolves would offer very little attacking threat without him Doyle -- made a few runs from deep but made little impact . To be fair to him most of the passes to the strikers were high balls lumped forward that were food and drink to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into scoring positions a couple of times but was n't able to make the most of the chances Forde -- was at least positive with some runs late on Edwards -- no real impact in what had become a crowded midfield <p> Real food for thought here for Solbakken because Wolves look vulnerable defensively and lacking in numbers in the attacking third . The play is ponderous and at a pedestrian pace and suddenly they look a long way short of a team that could challenge for promotion . An unchanged team for Tuesday 's game at Hull looks unthinkable after this poor performance and it could be that the manager will give opportunities to the likes of Batth , Forde and Sigurdarsen in an 
##3058151 <h> Wolves comeback not quite enough <p> Wolves fell to their 3rd away defeat of the season after going 2 down in the first half but then staged a second half fight back that probably made them worth a point by the end of the game . They remain in the top 6 on Saturday evening and there was nothing about this performance to make you believe they could n't maintain that position as the season moves on . <p> With Karl Henry suspended , David Davis took his place in midfield and Kevin Doyle took the captain 's armband while Kevin Foley was restored to right back with loanee Jermaine Pennant coming in on the right of midfield ; <p> It was a quiet start to the game but Huddersfield were working hard and closing Wolves down well all over the pitch in a lively first half from the home team . The movement of home strikers Vaughan and Beckford were causing plenty of problems for the visiting defence with Johnson in particular finding Vaughan a handful . And it was Vaughan , on loan from Norwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far post header after a raking cross from the right wing saw Foley exposed on the back post . <p> Doumbia had a decent long range effort but Huddersfield were inches away from increasing their lead when Beckford could n't quite get a touch to Vaughan 's low cross . Then Wolves really did threaten and inevitably it was Sako that went close when his free kick from 30 yards went inches over and clipped the top of the net . Hunt should have done better with a clear shooting chance for the home team who then increased their lead after Ward gave away position in the opposition half and the home team exploited the space behind him to get free on the right wing . When the cross came in Beckford scored spectacularly with an overhead kick . <p> At Blackburn in the last away game Wolves were able to build the game from the back in their own time and controlled the game , but Huddersfield were giving no space away and made Wolves rush their passing and not be able to knock it around even in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the home defence and Pennant hardly got a touch in the first half hour . Sako was again the main attacking threat and he curled one shot just wide . But Vaughan and Beckford were the stars of the first half and they both went close to increasing the lead late in the half . <p> Davis had received treatment late in the first half and he did n't appear for the second half with Edwards the replacement . Ikeme made a decent save early in the half but it was a different Wolves after the break and they were dominating possession , and sub Edwards was doing as much as anyone to wrestle Wolves back into the contest . Pennant was making more of an impression on the right and Ward was getting forward more on the left and there was always Sako . When Ward played it to him down by the corner flag he had two defenders for attention but after a couple of step overs he managed to conjure up a cross and Ebanks Blake was able to turn the ball in at the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty appeal when he was sent tumbling near the bye line while Edwards was proving to be a real inspiratoin and his deflected shot was only inches over , and from the resulting corner he headed against the post . Sako had a good chance but it fell to his weaker right foot and his shot was poor and as the home team introduced two defensive substitutions to hold on to the lead , Wolves completely dominated the last 20 minutes but could not find an equaliser . <p> Ikeme -- no real chance with the goals and made a couple of smart diving saves Foley -- had a decent game generally but both goals came from his back post Ward -- his mistake lead to the second goal but made some good attacking forays after the break Johnson -- had an uncomfortable first half against the lively Vaughan Berra -- the best of the backline on the day with some goal saving blocks Pennant -- took him a long time to get into the game and did n't seem too suited by being asked to tuck in rather than play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half Doumbia -- typically powerful in midfield and I made him the best player on the day Davis -- did n't do badly but Wolves do miss Henry when he is absent Sako -- always the man most likely to make something happen in the attacking third Doyle -- did n't get much change out of the home defence Ebanks Blake -- took his goal well but rarely threatened otherwise Edwards -- made a significant difference when he came on , as well as he has played for a long time Surprisingly only one sub used although it looked like Sigurdarsen was about to replace SEB when the striker scored <p> The Solbakken style is for a patient and steady passing game and the defeats Wolves have had this season have generally been when teams have forced a higher pace to the game , and Wolves must learn to adapt to that . They also do miss Henry when he is unavailable . But there was only one team in it for the last half hour and there was not too much despondency from the visiting fans after the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday and Charlton on Saturday and hopefully they will 
##3058152 <h> Wolves continue Northern tour <p> Wolves last two away games saw them visit Lancashire and Yorkshire for clashes with Blackburn and Huddersfield . And on Saturday and Tuesday its the same two counties again with Burnley on Saturday to be followed by Hull on Tuesday . The last two games brought one win and one defeat and Wolves will have to do at least as well to maintain their place on the tails of the play off places . <p> Burnley will go into Saturday 's game under the management of Sean Dyche for the first time . Dyche retired as a much travelled lower division player in 2007 and after spending some time as coach of Watford became theiir manager in 2011 . He took the Hornets to mid table with an improved points record compared to recent seasons for the club but was displaced when they decided to bring in Zola . He has since been added to the England U21 coaching team and now landed the Burnley role . <p> The Clarets have been involved in some high scoring games this season and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 3-3 draw . They are fairly inconsistent and have a poor home record over the years against Wolves . Going all the way back to 1964 Wolves have won 14 , drawn 8 and lost only 2 of the last 24 league games between the teams at Turf Moor . Their squad is likely to include former Wolves striker Sam Vokes who signed for them in the summer . He has played 13 times since signing permanently but has yet to score . <p> For Wolves , Stale Solbakken must decide whether to persevere with the same starting 11 that have stalled a little in recent games . But there are not that many options for change . He is unlikely to change the defence unless he gives an immediate recall to fit again Wayne Hennessey in goal , but in truth his replacement Ikeme has done little wrong . The midfield is also settled but it would be good to see young starlet Zele Ismail , who signed a new contract this week , get a chance from the bench . And up front it may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ebanks Blake . <p> After two home draws Wolves will need to win one of the two away games this week to keep their season on track . And there is a view that the current playing style , with two defensive midfield players ahead of the defence , is better suited to playing away than at home against a team that are also covering their defence . The game at Burnley sees a clash between a home team that are better in attack than defence against the new look Wolves that have this season been more effective defensively than in scoring goals . What would be good to see is a good second half performance from Wolves after recent fades that have raised questions about fitness and about finding a plan B when the game is not going for them . <p> I liked up to you 'll obtain carried out proper here .

The relationship between Arsenal and its ever-loving , faithful fans can be likened to a man and his wife that shows off her flaws every week .

##3063752 <h> Pages <h> Sunday , 7 October 2012 <h> Student Survival Guide A Thrifty Mrs <p> Ever since I made these videos for my A Thrifty Mrs YouTube channel about going off to university I 've had students and those looking at going to university nexy year dropping me emails asking for more advice . Finances and the types of educational institutions you may be studying at will vary but a common factor seems to be - most students have to deal with their finances for the first time and it can be a big shock . Plus it is oh so easy to make mistakes . I should know ! <p> With increased fees , lack of jobs and a student rent hike of 25% in some areas , clawing every penny back and not landing oneself in too much debt is an important subject for 2012 . Here are a few tips from me . <p> 1 . Your loan is not free money So many people , at the time of receipt , see their loan almost as free money . Hurrah a chunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to go crazy . Stop and think . Your loan is a loan not free money . In a few years time you may be working in some crappy job , unrelated to your degree and the student finance folks will be taking money from your pay packet every month . Do you want to buy that 45 top which you wo n't remember in 6 months or do you want to use it for books , rent and food ? You have to pay that money back , think about it when you 're spending it . I wish I had , I really hate paying back money for bloody maroon knee high boots . Oh 2004 . <p> 2 . Do n't eat out - learn to cook Eating out bumps up the price of every meal you eat significantly . Learn to cook a few basics really well and then adapt with time . Make great big portions so you can freeze some and have leftovers for a packed lunch . Great recipes to learn are - - spag bol - which you can adapt into chilli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . - a basic veggie curry - play around with spices and serve with rice , pittas or cous cous. - soups - start with basic tomato soup and work your way through cheap seasonal vegetables . <p> 3 . Make use of your university city Whilst it is really easy to get into the swing of the student lifestyle it can be great to step outside of the same cycle and try spots elsewhere in the city in order to save some money . - Sign up and utlise the local library . Whilst that very much needed book may be out of stock in your uni library save your cash , you do n't have to buy it , it may well be available in the local or main city library . - Buy from local markets , especially when it comes to food . You 'll find great seasonal basics and you can even try a cheeky haggle. - Take advantage of the free museums , galleries and parks if you 're looking for entertainment . The local museums and galleries in my university city often hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Walk or cycle Getting into lectures can eat up a big chunk of your budget . Public transport is n't cheap and cars come with more costs than I can name . Walk or cycle to your lectures , it is great free excersise and a bit of head space from hangovers and lecture notes . Sure , everyone may be catching the bus or train but just keep in mind how much money you 'll be saving . If you do n't have a bike try eBay or even Freecycle . <p> 5 . Make friends with Excel This sounds so damn boring but if I 'm honest nothing else has helped me deal with my finances better than noting down everything I spend . It is pretty simple . Open up Excel and have a column for incoming money and one for outgoing and make sure you update it every single time you spend or recieve money . Students have a reputation for being irresponsible but why live up to it ? A quick update of your excel sheet takes less than 30 seconds can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning in the debt the day you finally get your degree . <p> P.S. If you have any basic tips which will help students now that they are firmly back into the swing of things they do feel free to leave them down below in the comments . And students - do have a read of the comments because my readers have some genius tricks and tips . <h> 31 comments : <p> I actually dropped out of university before term started last month because I realised how ridiculous the situation could be in four years time if I 'm unable to find a job and end up with around 70,000+ worth of debt ! <p> Thats a shame , I graduated this year , although with lower fee 's , I had a full loan , grant and bursary .

There of course is every chance that you wo n't find you perfect life changing job opportunity as soon as you step outside graduation , but I think it puts you in such good stead and gives you the confidence and life skills to think , actually it does n't matter , I 'm passionate about my subject , I can achieve whatever I want with or without the debt , because to be honest , there probably are n't many people who do n't have some degree of debt , small or large . <p> I hope however that you do or have found something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not University , and one day you have that job that would have led you to be able to hypothetically pay that debt back ! : ) <p> Thats a shame , I graduated this year , although with lower fee 's , I had a full loan , grant and bursary .

Despite my degree costing approx 3,000 a year , I had about 9,000 loan 9,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have maximised every aspect as I needed every penny studying media . I was never under any illusion that I would fall out of uni into my life changing perfect job and pay my debt of in a couple of years . That is why they only take a small percentage . With no interest , I do n't consider it a problem . There are people in this world who have as much or more debt for whatever reason , be it buying a car or a house . I would n't let the fear of debt put me off doing something I felt passionate enough about . <p> I have met some of the best people at uni including the love of my life , and had some of the best experiences and met some amazingly talented people and industry professionals as well as having my work exhibited in a top London gallery . Had I not gone to uni , I have absolutely no idea what I 'd be doing now or what I would have done for the past 3 years . I hated doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not something I could ever see myself doing long term . Though I have n't got myself my dream job yet , ( having only graduated last month ) I have every hope that I will find something perfect for me and am confident that I have the right skills to do it well . I do hope that you have found something that you want to do instead though and do n't regret your decision . <p> You may never have to pay back all that debt . You only start paying back when you earn over a certain threshold , and after a number of years it gets wiped . So many people get hysterical about a debt they will probably never have to repay in full . So much so , graduates leaving university get a low paid job and immediately start trying to pay off their debts . <p> It 's madness ! I have debts and the chances are I will never have to repay the full loan . It 's the cheapest form of debt you 'll ever have . Do n't drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive debt ! <p> I 'm doing an english lit course and our humanties department recenty set up a 2nd hand book shop in which older year 's pass down there used books for a discount of the price . Brillant idea ! . Also I found that last year on a REALLY tight budget , I was buying proper food but not the best quality . Stores like Aldi do great veg and fruit bargains each week and my housemates just bulk buy together now ! . Also it 's nice to pop in and check the bargain shelfs of the bigger supermarket if you have a substantial freezer . My question about student life is , well being a non drinker . Everyone is very acceptable of my choice not to drink but uni life is really sociable around drink and with the new craze of pre drinking , it 's even worse for me . I fond myself just not going out now because I end of being a minder / left standing in a club by myself . <p> fantastic tips , two years after graduating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in student overdraft and student money . I 've just cleared my student overdraft now which crippled me , wish I 'd have been more wise at the time x <p> As a student watching her money , I always withdraw my weekly money and then hide my card away - especially on nights out ! It makes it much easier to keep an eye on your spending with physical cash , rather than a magical card xx <p> The pound shop is your friend ! Most household and bathroom products are way cheaper and they do some good food offers too - big bags of pasta , eggs , milk etc . <p> Roast a chicken - great value , you can get a couple of meals out it and some sandwiches ! You can also use the carcass for a soup . Soup is really easy , cheap and healthy too - just boil things for a long time lol <p> My tip ( which I used at Uni and use it now ) is to plan out what you are going to eat for dinner everyday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shopping focused and you have enough food for every meal that week ( or at Uni I did enough for 2 weeks ) . x <p> My advice to students is wait to go to university until you have decided what to do . It 's better to take any job in a bar , shop , on a farm , in a factory with your A levels and go to college later when you know what you 're aiming for . You may want to be a journalist now but change your mind later . If you are going to pay best part of 30K for a degree then make sure it 's in something that will get you a job . If there 's a shortage of doctors then do that , if the shortage is shoe makers , do that . I waited until I was 33 and had any old job before that and have worked at degree level since . There are too many people with non specific degrees , such as history who have studied a subject they like but without a specific purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all - do an apprenticeship - they want bright students for that - learn a trade . <p> History is an interchangeable subject , like English , there 's a lot you can do with that , but I see what you 're saying . It 's not something to rush into . My brother is 16 and he 's not going to university , he 's at college studying carpentry . But I do n't believe that university is just about what job you get at the end of it , for me it was a life experience , I met the best people and gained so much confidence . Before I went to uni , I was shy and timid , now I have so much more confidence and every belief that I can get a job in which I am fully qualified for . <p> Definitely agree with learning how to cook properly - I saved so much money when I went into second year and forced myself to learn how to cook . Plus it 's way healthier too - unlike the oven chips and cheese toasties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true - fantastic tips ! ! And equally true for recent graduates . One thing I found a challenge is that I wanted to cook for myself but did n't really know how . My mother got me a ' student ' cookbook but all the recipes called for organic chicken breast , extra virgin olive oil , fresh herbs , food processors etc . But at least the experience meant I was able to give my mum very specific advice when my sister went to uni - ' you want a recipe book that is basically twenty things to do with sausages and twelve variations on scrambled eggs etc ' . <p> One thing I might add is that investing money in some good quality items is n't necessarily a bad thing . A good sturdy pair of shoes , a really comfy pair of trousers , a good winter coat . May seem like a lot of money at the time , but it 's cheaper than replacing these items every year when the time of year rolls round they are required , and it 's better than impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these kind of things too though , and it 's awesome when you get lucky ( Dr Marten 's for 7 was was of my awesome wins : D 5 years and they 're still going strong ! ) . <p> Invest in a slow cooker ! you can make soup , stews , casseroles and roast meat joints in it . Throw a load of ingredients in it in the morning and when you come home from uni you 'll have a lovely hot meal . Leftovers can be used for next 's day 's lunch or frozen for later in the week . <p> This morning i put two chopped two leeks , four chopped potatos , a chopped onion , some butter , chicken stock and seasoning in mine and tonight i 'll blend it and add some single cream for a lovely leek and potato soup for my dinner . <p> Oh Mrs Thrifty you are a goddess with your helpful wisdom ! I 'm not a student , however , this information and advice is really helpful for someone like me who is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape together all my finances to be able to pay my rent , for the running of my car and all those other essentials . So thank you ever so much : ) xx <p> English students , definitely check out local bookshops before you hit Amazon for your set texts . I found a cracking bookshop locally , who used to reward me for buying a pile of books at the beginning of term with a very generous student discount , and chucking in the odd freebie . They even used to put books aside for me that they thought I 'd like . I miss that shop . <p> Make sensible investments for your food . Things like a slow cooker or a good blender ( soup ! ) will be really useful and you can take them with you when you go . <p> After a disastrous financial first year at uni , I set up a separate bank account to my student one . I let all my summer earnings , loans etc sit in my student ac , and let all my direct debits come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ( bog standard , free ) current account , and only took that debit card out and about . Knowing I only had a certain amount of money in the account really made me think about purchases even when using my card , and when I first started the system , I stopped all my online banking ( and this was before mobile banking apps ) so I could n't ' just ' transfer some extra to the account- I had to go into town and into the bank in opening hours to do so . If you 're not certain about yourself and spending this 
##3066151 <h> Relationships Are Hard : Separate Beds <p> I would hate to share a bed with myself . I thrash about , sleep-talk and grind my teeth . I also slurp water from a plastic bottle throughout the night , noisily . I am possibly the worst sleeping partner imaginable . <p> Not a single bit of this bothers Herbert . Do n't ask me how . H is the sort of person who can sleep through a wild party next door . Whereas I will get all rage-y about it , H can simply observe that there is an large amount of noise going on , and fall asleep anyway . He truly sleeps the sleep of the just . <p> I , meanwhile , am a sensitive sleeper . Everything wakes me up . And so , even though I know it 's unfair , I take enormous issue with his snoring . It . Just . Drives . Me . Crazy . He has a cold at the moment , and so there is no position in which he wo n't snort like a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accept it , but I ca n't . I just get angrier and angrier . This , of course , only makes it harder for me to get back to sleep . <p> For this reason , H has moved into the spare room lately . It happened spontaneously in the middle of one night , when he reached the limit of times he was willing to be jabbed in the ribs . It was all very un-acrimonious . We both woke up the next morning feeling , well , refreshed . So much so that the next night , he suggested he went straight to the spare room , seeing as his cold was no better . And the next night . And the night after that . <p> It 's turned into a rather a luxurious habit . We cuddle up in ( my ) bed , watching TV or chatting , and then , when one of us gets sleepy , H retreats to the spare room . We both spread out in our own kingsize bed for the night , free of any infuriating distractions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug on the landing , usually with baby Bert sandwiched between us . It 's all rather civilised . <p> Will it last forever ? I do n't know . Sadly , other people sleep in the guest bedroom sometimes . But it 's made me realise that we romanticise sharing a bed for no real reason . Some commentators have lamented the fact the most couples sleep with their backs to each other , but , really , does anyone actually sleep with their limbs entangled after a few months together ? <p> I 'm going to say something obvious here : we do n't have sex in our sleep ( actually , there is a condition called sexsomnia , but that 's not what I 'm talking about ) . <p> When sex begins to fade in a relationship , I think we often kid ourselves that it will happen by magic at some point : we will both be inspired , suddenly , to ravish each other . Sharing a bed is part of that faith . But in actual fact , that blissful moment when we finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sex ; we 're usually so exhausted that we 're seconds away from sleep . <p> What 's more , the time at which most couples enjoy their hottest , most urgent sex comes before they share a bed , when they 're still living apart . Perhaps this is no coincidence . And scientists are beginning to agree : Neil Stanley 's research found that separate sleepers are healthier , happier and have better sex . <p> Could it be that separate bedrooms could inspire great sex , by bringing back privacy , mystery and separation into our over-familiar relationships ? <h> 14 Responses to Relationships Are Hard : Separate Beds <p> Each to their own I say , but from a personal point of view -- I ca n't imagine sleeping without my man ! After 5yrs together , we do still intertwine in one another to fall asleep and I love that feeling of closeness to him after spending the day apart and busy with other things . Both of us have commented on how hard we find it to sleep when the other is not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are both ( relatively ) still sleepers , so I ca n't promise my opinion wo n't change in the future ! <p> As to whether sleeping apart improves a sex life -- I think it 's a dangerous experiment to try for that reason alone , as I would think the chances of losing intimacy and closeness are probably just as likely . But combined with other factors , like you suggest -- such as a difficult sleeping partner , lack of sleep etc. -- then I think it 's perfectly logical to assume a bedroom boost might be the happy side-effect of a good night 's sleep ! <p> Thanks for your comment Nik -- it 's made me reflect that I would never have considered separate beds until I got pregnant . After a few weeks of finding it impossible to sleep , it was easy to switch to separate beds ! Either way , it certainly has n't been the death-blow we feared . <p> My wife and I have been discussing having separate bedrooms for a few years now fee have been together for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in a small one bedroom , but in the future when we move somewhere bigger we wanted to try having our own rooms/retreats decorated in how we each please ( this also plays abut into my wife loving how a room put together by just a man looks and feels ) . I am pretty sure if anyone gets randy in the middle of the night there will be a bit of seeking into each others rooms ... We are not sure what the outcome will be but I am sure it will be a fun experiment ! <p> Anthony , you make it sound wonderful ! I must admit , I did sneak into H 's bed one night for a cuddle , which felt really illicit and fun . I 'm not sure I could face middle-of-the-night sex at the moment though ! <p> I am a very deep sleeper and i move around a lot , and talk and shout and laugh in my sleep and steal all of the kingsize duvet . My husband is a really light sleeper so almost anything wakes him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He works long hours so sometimes I 'm in bed before he gets home and I would hate waking up without him there . We do n't fall asleep cuddling ( who does ? ! sounds really uncomfortable ! ) but every morning whilst pressing snooze a million times we have a cuddle . I 'm not sure about the sex life thing as we 're more of a weekend lie-in/afternoon couple as work gets in the way but I could n't imagine sleeping in separate beds . We do have the biggest bed we could fit in our room though which definitely helps ! <p> However , we are due to have a baby soon so I think in the first few months separate beds might be the way to go so he can get some sleep as he 'll have to still be working the same long hours to feed and clothe us all ! <p> That sounds just like us , Kate ! RE : baby , we 've found the separate beds thing really brilliant because we now take it in turns to host the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep without listening to Bert grunting . This is a huge improvement , I can tell you ! <p> We are separate bed people -- it started before we were married when we were working incompatible hours and now during the week we value a decent sleep over the pseudo-romanticism of being in the same bed <p> The only problem with it is a loss of cuddles and affection -- one we have to work at but then being rested I at least have the mental space to focus on it more <p> I go through a bit of a grass is greener thing with this- my husband travels a fair bit , and when he 's not around I struggle because I miss him . Conversely , like you , I have no hesitation kicking him out when he is ill , or snoring etc though ! <p> We have slept in separate beds since our eldest was a toddler . We co-slept and as she took up more and more of the bed , H moved into the spare room . When she went into her own room he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fat , grumpy , snoring pregnant woman I was n't fun to share a bed with . He has been in the spare room since , I co-sleep with child 2 and if we fancy some intimacy it happens in the spare room or downstairs ! <p> I do miss lying and falling asleep together sometimes 
##3067051 <h> Fairtrade : Do you know what you 're buying into ? <p> Are you like the growing many that get a feel good factor from the purchase of Fairtrade , organic or ethically traded goods ? Do you feel like you have done your small bit in helping a farmer somewhere in the world ? However , do you ever stop to think just how much of an impact your purchase will have ? <p> In this article I hope to make you think twice before buying into another marketing campaign which I believe has gone astray from what it claims to be . In most cases Fairtrade products fail to deliver on most of the promises that it makes . In my opinion it has turned into more of a branding ploy than a programme that actually provides substantial means to positively contribute to sustaining the income of farmers . That does not mean that we should boycott the Fairtrade movement , just simply take a second thought on exactly how such programmes have/could have a tangible and lasting impact on those that it is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnt is that when it comes to supporting developing countries all too often outsiders/ " experts " step in with these " amazing " ideas without too much thought of culture , traditions or the context within which these countries are in . As an economist , I strongly believe that we are all rational agents and respond to incentives , i.e. there 's a reason for everything we do -- whether good or bad . This means that our actions today are a consequence of previous choices and those choices where based on our circumstance/environment at that time . In order to bring lasting change for the future we can not forget our past and where we came from . <p> Fairtrade is an alternative to conventional international trade . It promises a stable price and a long-term trading relationship , guaranteeing disadvantaged producers in developing countries a better deal . The additional Fairtrade Premium they receive can be used to improve their working and living conditions , and for community projects such as providing clean water . <p> Now watch this video : <p> The rest of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote and the video . <p> The Fairtrade movement states that buyers ( the people that buy the products directly from farmers ) must pay a minimum price for produce ; a level set to cover the real cost of sustainable production of produce and minimise the effects of price fluctuations in between years . If the price on the open market is higher than the Fairtrade minimum , then the Fairtrade buyer must pay the market price . <p> Although this sounds good in theory , in practice it has not made much of a difference . For example the price of cocoa ( the key ingredient in the chocolate bars that we love so much ) has actually been increasing in the past few years which means that the price difference between that received from fair trade buyers and commercial buyers is almost non-existent . <p> In the book by Orla Ryan " Chocolate Nations " ( 2011 ) she explains how on the ground there is no real difference between commercial buyers and Fairtrade buyers . Farmers make the decision to sell their produce to different buyers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indebted to a particular buyer or they choose to sell to a number of buyers to spread their risk in the event of a payment default . Or it could simply be that they offer cheap additional products such as fertilisers and tools . This is more attractive to the average farmer as it will have an immediate impact on their ability to work and increase production levels which means a bigger yield in the following season and potentially more income in the year ahead . <p> " The Fairtrade Premium they receive can be used to improve their working and living conditions " <p> There is no doubt that Fairtrade has enabled a lot of projects such as schools , clean running water and health centres to be completed . But when you think about the impact in real terms , you begin to realise that the benefits are limited . For example in the case of Kuapa Kokoo , the chocolate Fairtrade co-operative ( Ryan 2011 ) , a $4.3 million premium a year split between a co-operative with 40,000 farmers equates to about $12 a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive an additional $36 for their year 's production , which really is n't that much of a significant increase . The problem with cooperatives is that unless profits are supercharged or the group is relatively small the final rate received per farmer is quite minimal relative to their total earnings for the year . <p> Starbucks have decided to take a different route as they are not convinced on the Fairtrade Premium approach . Working mainly with coffee farmers , they prefer a code known as the CAFE practices ( Coffee and Farmer Equity ) , which aims to help coffee farmers develop sustainable businesses through a mixture of technical support , microfinance loans , and investment in infrastructure and community development where the farmers live . <p> Focusing on the sustainability of the businesses is more beneficial for both parties . If farmers are given the tools to improve their production practices , they have the chance of increasing their income levels and the companies that are heavily reliant on these products for the viability of their business ( coffee beans , cocoa ) can be rest assured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer receives about 1% of the cost of a chocolate bar " <p> The truth of the matter is that the value in a chocolate bar is in the processing of the goods , which takes place outside developing countries because the infrastructure and the costs involved are too high to do it within that country . The only way to change this is to bring production into these countries which will require investment and overcoming political and other potential barriers . Even the Fairtrade chocolate producers like Divine , do n't make their chocolate in these countries -- which really disappointed me when I found out as they are meant to be the ethical example that others follow . <p> " They use Children on farms " <p> There are some Fairtrade campaigns that claim that the brand guarantees that child labour has not been used . This is a strong claim to make as it would require a lot of administration to visit the thousands of farms used to cultivate the product to ensure that no child labour what so ever has been used . The truth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure of ownership of these farms , means that harvesting is usually undertaken by the entire family , including children . This may sound bad , but reports by farmers themselves state that without the help of the children they are unable to produce the cocoa beans that go into the chocolate that we love so much . I am no advocate for child labour -- but here is a classic example of how lack of understanding of culture could lead to detrimental effects for the community . If they receive the occasional help , their production levels risk falling which means lower income . The problem here is not that children are included in these activities but rather that they are in a situation where they have no other choice . <p> Like all things , this is n't the end of the story . There are a lot of other issues that have been raised including , large " administration " fees for the right to use the trademark . So although , the sale of Fairtrade goods has increased by almost 40% over the last five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not benefited developing countries . <p> But things are improving . More and more chocolate companies are buying into Fairtrade such as Cadbury 's and Mars . But the supply of the Fairtrade cocoa is limited . <h> Comments <p> I see two problems with your reasoning , which I 'll present in reverse order of where they appear in your post . <p> First , you use a double standard when comparing Fairtrade with what you 've presented as a Starbucks approach . In the former , you take the total Fairtrade benefit for Kuapa ( citing only the Fairtrade Premium , incidentally ) and divide it by the total number of members of Kuapa to give an averaged out per member benefit . For the latter , you do no such calculation , which would involve dividing the total investment by Starbucks for the initiatives you cite by the total number of farmers associated with the projects ( e.g. all of the members in the co-ops SBUX is buying from ) . <p> There 's no doubt that Fairtrade impact for farmers is limited by the total demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any system contingent on products sold . The same limitation applies to Starbucks ' CAFE practices . One of the many differences between the two is Fairtrade requires that the many is invested by the coop , and not on their behalf . It does n't mean SBUX 's initiatives are bad , but your treatment of the same is consistent . By the way , the features of the SBUX approach you mention ... they 're common aspects of Fairtrade as well . The reasonable response to a demand constraint is n't to advocate less demand on the grounds that total benefit is n't as high as you 'd like to see ... pursuing greater demand is . <p> The second issue is has to do with your stated belief in the notion that people respond to incentives in a rational pursuit of their own interests and subsequent dismissal of Fairtrade when : the farmers voluntarily choose to join and sell to their coops , their coops ( at their members ' behest ) voluntarily seek and maintain their Fairtrade certification , and the coops are n't required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries virtually no benefit , then how do you reconcile farmers ' participation with it if they 're rational actors ? <p> One final comment about the " external experts " characterisation .... You do know that democratic producer networks are heavily represented on every major committee in Fairtrade International , including the Standards Committee and the Board of Directors , and that they control 50% of its General Assembly as well , right ? And then , as mentioned , the Fairtrade premiums , prices , etc. go to democratic coops or associations of farmers to allocate as they see fit ( not experts on their behalf ) . Not to pick on Starbucks ( but you brought them up as a point of comparison ) , what sort of farmer control do you think there is over their Board of Directors , CAFE Practices program , or technical assistance ? <p> In response to your comments I will simply put my personal reasoning for believing what I do . My problem/issue with Fair Trade as a concept is not its ideology but rather the approach by which it attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first regarding rational behaviour by producers , I do not believe that I said that producers are behaving irrationally . In the introduction to the piece I mentioned that we all make decisions based on our circumstances and environments , therefore for the producers who willingly choose to become part of the initiative , implicitly they believe that this will bring the best possible outcome . However , we can only make decisions based on the information available to us . The idea of asymmetry of information ( principal -- agent problem ) benefits some and not others . Again , I am in no position to know what information has been shared with producers , but based on the way the Fair Trade initiative has been promoted to consumers I can only suppose that the true picture has not been shared with producers -- they will not have the same access to full information as those working within the Fair Trade movement . Either way , there will be some producers that will get a lot of benefit from the initiative , and some that wo n't get as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different costs ( including a certification cost of more than 1500 ( IEA 20 ) in order to belong to the initiative ) which may cause confusion . The way in which information is shared to consumers suggests that all producers are benefiting in the same way -- this is not the case . <p> In support of my argument , an IEA , Fair Trade without the Froth ( 2010 ) report notes that : " The benefits of Fair Trade also come at a cost . There is a levy on the wholesaler as well as a certification charge for producers . The certification charge starts at 1,570 in the first year -- a huge sum of money for producers in the poorest countries . ... The main claims that the Fair Trade organisation makes relating to their ability to protect producers from price instability are exaggerated : few consumers will realise that , although there is a price guarantee through Fair Trade , there is no guarantee of the quantity that can be sold at that price . ... Primary product producers will often gain much more by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting the Fair Trade label " . <p> You suggest that I imply that we should reduce our demand for fairly traded products when I explicitly stated that we should not boycott the initiative but take a closer look at what we are buying into . For me I think that better informed consumers will be better placed to make the decisions that will support producers in the long run , whether it is through Fair Trade specifically or other initiatives . <p> I guess that primarily , it is the way that Fair Trade is promoted as being the sole way in which producers can make a positive , lasting and sustainable change . This has hindered other initiatives which can and do support producers , and which for a particular farmer may be the best option for them . This leads me to respond to your other comment on using the CAF practices as a comparison . <p> You stated that my analysis of the Fair Trade and CAF practices initiatives are inconsistent as I do not take the overall investment from Starbucks and divide by the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed to compare on a like for like basis . But my reasoning for selecting such an initiative is because of what I believe to be the sustainability aspect . From literature , it shows that the CAF practices initiative supports farmers through various programmes including training which will in the long term be of greater benefit for their sustainable development rather than just a price support mechanism . <p> And finally , my comment on " experts " is not aimed at the many " democratic " organisations that support the movement , but rather more generally the lack of consideration of culture and traditions in place of **31;3543;TOOLONG practices . It implies that these two can not work profitably together , when in fact if you visit many African markets , they seem to be working just fine . As a side , when you have multiple players in a game , it is difficult to work to a common goal if you all have your individual objectives -- i.e. each organisation has its own goals that it needs to achieve and may not necessarily always align with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote from the IEA report : <p> " Fair Trade is not a long-term development strategy , and the model is not appropriate for all producers . It is also unable to address structural problems within trading systems . Fair Trade 's proponents need to show some humility and accept that it is a niche market designed to benefit some producers ; nevertheless , it does achieve that limited objective . " <p> Clearly some producers will benefit more than others , and benefit will be a function of total sales to Fairtrade buyers as well as any other variables that affect trade generally ( access to ports , roads , etc ) . <p> But it seems as though you 're implying the Fairtrade system is deceiving both producers and consumers in order to ... well , that 's not entirely clear . <p> On the producer side , you do n't seem to have much more than conjecture . <p> " Again , I am in no position to know what information has been shared with producers , but based on the way the Fair Trade initiative has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture has not been shared with producers " <p> Even if this was true , presumably producer coops would recognize when their costs outweighed the benefits within the first year of certification , and would simply let their certification lapse . It 's not as though they are n't able to gauge the opportunities in non-Fairtrade markets ... after all , they are almost assuredly operating on several markets at once . <p> The issue of producer certification fees is interesting . The system used to be free ( the only system of its kind to be so , as far as I know ) , but this carried its own problems , not the least of which was a considerable backlog for producer certification and an otherwise unsustainable system . Of the solutions considered , the producer fee approach had the most support including the unanimous support of the democratic producer networks . Those networks later proposed a different approach to producer fees , and that approach has remained in place ever since . <p> Worth noting is that a Producer Certification Fund was established to subsidize up to 75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this cost represented more than 10% of Fairtrade International 's budget last year . More than 40% went to direct producer services , and that does n't account for the additional expenditures to ensure robust producer involvement on standards development and governance . It also does n't take into account that producers contribute no revenue to Fairtrade International -- the certification fees are paid to FLO-Cert and those fees , on balance , are at less than cost of producer certification . <p> Your first quote from the IEA piece does n't actually lend support to your information asymmetry argument unless you 're suggesting Fairtrade certifiers actively conceal from producers that certification can not guarantee a sale . This ... does n't seem especially plausible for a number of reasons , so I presume you are n't suggesting it . <p> In dealing with the rest of the quote , I 'll simply say that producer certification fees are charged to coops , not individual farmers . Also , if a coop could achieve more by selling to speciality brands than seeking Fairtrade certification , then presumably they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue several options simultaneously . <p> Which brings us to something curious you said , <p> " ... Fair Trade is promoted as being the sole way in which producers can make a positive , lasting and sustainable change . This has hindered other initiatives which can and do support producers , and which for a particular farmer may be the best option for them . " <p> First , I 'm not aware of any place where Fair Trade has been promoted as the only way to make positive , lasting and sustainable change , to producers , consumers , or businesses for that matter , and certainly not by the certifiers themselves . More importantly , as mentioned , producers can and do pursue multiple livelihood strategies at once , and Fairtrade is often one of them ... sometime it 's also a way for them to more easily access additional options ( organic transition 's an example of this ) . <p> Second , even if they did n't pursue other options , there is nothing about Fairtrade certification that precludes pursuing prevents them from doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it 's become fairly common for other initiatives to seek out Fairtrade certified producers for their own initiatives precisely because the certification provides them with confidence that a given coop is organized and connected to supportive resources . <p> Moving on , you lose me a bit when you mischaracterise Fairtrade as simply price support in comparison with the CAFE practices program , mostly because you express favour for the system that provides less farmer-directed development with training , etc. being given on the farmers ' behalf ( and in the interest of maintaining Starbucks ' supply chain , coincidently ) , immediately before you express an aversion to the " expert " -based approach that is precisely what underpins the CAFE practices program . In contrast , the Fairtrade system is designed ( both in the standards that govern trade AND the governance structures of the system itself ) to support a very producer-led self-development approach that allows for greater cultural and regional nuance than most other systems . <p> To your point about the democratic organizations that support the " Fair Trade " movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earlier actually have a pretty strong hand in defining the entire Fairtrade system . <p> Your final quote from the IEA report is more or less correct , and I suspect you 'd have a hard time finding anyone deeply engaged with Fair Trade who 'd disagree with

##3073051 <p> So I arrive at the check-in desk at Heathrow airport and tell them where I 'm going and what my name is . I always feel a little doubtful when I do this that it 's actually going to work , that they 'll look at me incredulously and demand a huge docket of paperwork that demonstrates my entitlement to travel . Years of following this procedure though , ( and on occasion turning up not actually knowing what city I 'm going to , just a vague idea of which country it might be ) has made me a little complacent , I guess . <p> I know that Tour Manager Marguerite will have been as dotted-of-i and crossed-of-t as she ever is , so I know that somewhere in my phone will be the email with my flight confirmation details . I eventually find the required code and recite it to the lady behind the desk who repeats it to someone on the phone . She shakes her head and laughs . " Well he does n't *look* like an Anne-Rose " . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto " I offer helpfully . She 's still engrossed in the phoneceall though . <p> " Yes probably Copenhagen " . <p> Now I like Copenhagen , but it 's not really on my list of places to be today . <p> She tries to explain , but it 's beyond me . Someone with the same surname as me , but a double barrelled first name , has checked in over in Copenhagen . Someone there pressed the wrong button , so she has become me and now I 'm her . I never knew that these people wielded such power . I say I 'm cool with it if they are . I 've still got a posh seat and we both land in the same place at the same time . Let 's just get to the lounge , eh ? Names are for tombstones , baby ... <p> I take my dubious documentation and plough onwards . The airport is in full Olympic chaos mode . <p> I decide to proceed direct to the gate , in the hope that there is a little respite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . The carriage is resplendent with the same flocks of the world 's most lost . I miss my stop because it 's impossible to move . Never mind , I think . This thing is a loop . I 'll wait ' til they 've all gone and start again , but I can snag pole position by the door for the next lap . <p> We reach the last stop and a woman who has clearly never thrown away her Prefect badge tells me ( in no uncertain terms ) that I 'm to get off the train immediately . I argue , I plead , I beg , but she is a formidable opponent . She is here to ensure that the Olympics are secure and I am not to interfere . She waves me off up the stairs with talk of checking in again and going through security again . <p> " Yes , hello " I wince as I arrive at the transfers desk " my name is Anne-Rose ... " <p> I 'm standing at another counter in front of another confused individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my boarding card . " Well he does n't *look* like an Anne-Rose ..... " . I begin to slump in my shoes and think of getting back home to bed . I 'm starting to quite fancy it . <p> " Ah yes - Copenhagen - right ... " <p> I 'm waved onwards and twenty minutes later I plop down into seat 20A to YYZ feeling as though I 've already completed an assault course . <p> The flight attendant is wheeling the drinks trolley past and absently enquires over the partition " would you like a drink , Miss ? Er ? Oh .... " <p> " Cup of tea and a double vodka please " . <p> And so to Cananda ... <p> Now I did promise to have a yarn-clearout , did n't I ? This has got pretty long already though , so I 'm going to channel the 2002 Christopher Martin . On the first tour I did with the band ( Rush Of Blood ) , Chris was forever legging it back to the mic after the house lights had come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coldplay concert is over , but I 've got this song I 've been fiddling with - if you want to hear it , you can stick around - if you think it 's shit , you can go home . " <p> Same goes . Those with time to kill can stick with me as I gas on about wet pianos and stadium shows . Anyone with a better offer ( which has to include pretty much anything , really ) you are formally excused . <p> Still here ? Right , this began as a blog from Dallas show one on the last leg - about getting back indoors , under a roof and in the dry . Here goes : <p> Me , I 'm all for it right now . I loved the stadiums and always have , but arenas do feel very , very comfy . No rain , no worries and no need to plan your trips to catering around the half hour round trip which that can sometimes entail . <p> While we 're talking transitions from huge outdoors to merely ' very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the stadium shows , which I 've not mentioned in these pages yet . Now , I 'll say right here , that the following is not a tale for the faint hearted . Certainly too , I should mention that what follows has a very narrow focus on what happened in my world on these shows - not the *only* things that happened . But they happened to me and I 'm writing , so ... <p> It all began on the second Emirates Stadium show . I was under the stage trying to solve a somewhat perplexing technical issue that had caused Rihanna to arrive somewhat later than planned on the video screen the night before . There 's actually a crowd of us working around my rack trying to work out at exactly what point in the signal chain goes from glorious harmony to crazed technical fizzle . <p> Suddenly , through the speakers perched on my rack , I hear a piano firing one note like a machine gun . Either someone is sat playing something extremely avant-garde at one of Chris 's pianos out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first thought . <p> By employing a methodology commonly referred to as " unplugging one thing at a time until the fucking noise stops " , I determine that the problem is coming from the piano out on the B-stage . Not good . Andy , my co-conspirator , takes off with a laptop to run some tests . Soon he 's radioing back that the poor old b-stage upright has had a complete nervous breakdown . Even with gentle coaxing ( turning it off and on again ) it ca n't be convinced to play nicely - it just wants to perform the jackhammer sonata . Very not-good . <p> We do , of course , have a spare piano , so it 's hurriedly thrown up onto the ramp ( equipment failures always make me want to hurriedly throw up ... ) and the pianos are switched out . This leaves us good for a show , but nowhere to go should there be more problems . ( Which , at the rate we 've been going , is more likely than not . ) <p> We get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull it apart . Besides enough butterflies to stuff a mattress , there is a pretty impressive amount of water in there . We get to work clearing it out and putting fans on it for a bit of air drying . From memory , the show passed with pleasantly little in the way of surprises . <p> Fast forward to Sunderland a couple of nights later . My folks are in attendance , making any visits from the fuck-up-fairy particularly unwelcome . It 's rainfall the like of which would have any sane individual refusing to leave the house . Perfect for a Coldplay stadium show , then . <p> Chris launches into Paradise and it sounds pretty different from the standard version . Improvisation ? Freeing himself from the bounds of rigid harmonic structures ? No . The piano is fucked . <p> There 's a full on **31;5427;TOOLONG moment and there is a new piano in place for him . They make it through Paradise and head for the C-stage . As they 're out there , the familiar machine-gun-sonata begins through my speakers . Oh Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downpour . <p> We 've got the length of " Speed Of Sound " to get the piano out from underneath the B-stage , up the ramp and onto the mainstage in time for Clocks . <p> There 's two dead pianos lying on their backs on the skate-ramp stage right . Some gigs have a bunch of broken drumsticks behind the drum riser by the end - we 're going through timber at a slightly more alarming rate . <p> We skin-of-the-teeth it through to the end of the Sunderland show , but the horror begins to dawn , that we have one good piano now and after the day off , we have two stadium shows in one day - at opposite ends of the country - and the helicopter that 's getting us between them is not piano-friendly . <p> Our Wembley Stadium Radio festival is already being handled by the old piano that Vicki Taylor painted for the Viva Grammy awards . We also know a hire company that has the same model ( in black ) they can hire to us as a spare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reliably lead-footed driver to get these two pianos from London to Manchester . He 's convinced he can get the journey done with enough time for the pianos to be onstage by showtime that night . <p> There 's talk of getting the pianos a police escort into the Manchester show in case he gets stuck in gig traffic . Andy is still in Manchester holding the fort . His number comes up on my phone and I answer " Please do n't be bad news , please do n't be bad news , please do n't .... " <p> " None of the pianos up here is working properly - not one " . <p> " That 's bad news " . <p> Potentially , this could get really rubbish . We could easily be sat pacing anxiously ten minutes to show with no working pianos and a van stuck somewhere outside Manchester . <p> It 's the stuff of nightmares and then something beyond my wildest dreams happens . I get a call from Yamaha UK . I 've mailed them asking if there is any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan , anything . The piano we use was discontinued years and years ago , so they do n't even carry it anymore , so my hopes were n't high . The ones we use we have to bid for on eBay against folks who want them because it 's " as used by Coldplay " . They 're rarer than rocking horse shit . ( And right now , all of the ones we have in Manchester are about as much use ... ) <p> Felicity from Yamaha tells me of a fella in their service department who refuses to throw anything away , because it 's all " bound to come in useful " . This sounds embarrassingly like myself and a lot of us on the crew . Apparently though , the chap in question has a special room in the warehouse that is known as his dump . In there , there is not one , but TWO of our beloved pianos with a huge sign on them saying " DO NOT THROW AWAY , COLDPLAY WILL RING UP AND ASK FOR THESE ONE DAY " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like a gift from the roadie-gods . The ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card . I eventually have to stop frothing my thanks and praise in their direction for long enough to arrange a van to get them to Manchester immediately . I go to call Andy to tell him the good news , but notice that there 's a voicemail from him . <p> Turns out that Xylobands inventor Jason , has recently bought a " Coldplay piano " from eBay for his son . An hour ago it was sat in his living room , but now , it 's in a van speeding towards the Manchester show . Word also reaches us that Paris is in town . And he 's got his spray cans ! Incredible . He reckons if he gets to work right away when the new pianos arrive , he can have them Mylo-ed up and ready to go by showtime . Just staggering . By rights , we should not have had a show tonight - on paper , we were completely beaten . Someone , somewhere though , is looking out for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , most of the vans coming from all corners have arrived and the Manchester gig is positively awash with pianos ( Eight of them , I believe ) . I pass stage manager Craig Finley , as I head up to the stage to check things out . " You 've got a LOT of effin pianos here today young man " <p> ( Photo from Mr Finley 's Facebook ) <p> " Yeah , and with any luck , a couple of ' em work ! " <p> We round up the dead and send them back to Yamaha . <p> The final two Manchester shows are two of the only ones on the tour with not a drop of rain . Whoever has our backs is going well above and beyond ... <p> To cap it all , I get a message on my phone on the day of the final Manchester show . It 's " Gaz " the fella I bought one of our eBay pianos from last year . Up until Sunderland , it had been Chris 's main piano . Gaz had listed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sussed that it was us buying it . His first words when he found out were " you 're not gon na paint it mad colours are ya ? " . <p> " Um , sorry fella ... " <p> Today , he 's got tickets for the show and he quite fancies meeting up to have a look at his old pride and joy in the centre of the Coldplay stage . I break it to him that not only have we graffiti-ed it up to the eyeballs , but we 've spent the summer standing it in the middle of torrential downpours with just a shower cap for protection . <p> I meet him and his missus and tell him the tale I 've just told you .

There are plans afoot for much further down the line which require a bit of work now to start getting right . As is often the case with future plans , there 's as much talking as there is playing . The five man Coldplay brain-trust has some decisions to make . A few things are tried . Some work better than expected , some suddenly seem like less of a good idea than they did on paper . That 's kinda the point of the operation ... <p> There are a few tunes that have been on a break since Viva that get another run through . I 'm pretty sure they gave 42 a go , but I could swear we sold that guitar in the eBay auction ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dylan covers come out that soundcheck is pretty much over ... <p> The Toronto shows themselves are a good pair to come back to . Canadian Coldplay crowds are reliably spectacular and so it goes on both of these nights . For myself , I 'm battling the jetlag somewhat , which gives everything that slomo underwater feel .

##3074550 <h> Magician 's Hat Interactive T-shirt <p> I 'm bringing a guest post home . I made this a while ago for the Boy 's Own Style series hosted by Narelle at Cook Clean Craft . Click on the button below to go to her round-up of all the other fantastic projects in the series . <p> *** <p> Hello everyone , I 'm Laura . I blog over at Craftstorming where I write about sewing and baking mostly . As the mum of two boys I am always really happy to see more boy sewing ideas so I 'm very excited to be joining you for this series today . <p> Often a good pattern and an interesting fabric are enough when making clothes for boys . Sometimes though you want to add a more personal touch to a garment . On those occasions I like to look for ways to include a fun and playful interactive element . For todays 's post I had the idea of making a T-shirt with a magician 's hat appliqu . And now , Ladies and Gentlemen , Casper Houdini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully <p> You will see that my pockets are empty so I will begin <p> Abracadabra hocus pocus and before your eyes I will make .... <p> .... a white rabbit appear . <p> Magic hey ? <p> The hat is made up of two layers with a pocket in the middle for the rabbit to hide in . I have sewn buttonhole elastic into the bottom of the pocket and added a small button for the rabbit 's tail so it can be removed . You could still do this for any soft toy you have made or bought . <p> There are many other ways you could apply this idea , such as having a tunnel with a train coming out of it or maybe a jack-in-the-box . If you want to make a magician 's hat too then here 's how I made it . I 've included a downloadable template to save you time . <p> All seam allowances are 3/8 ? . I made the brim of the hat as narrow as possible while still making it possible to turn . It was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bit easier use a 1/4 ? seam around the brim . I will mark this clearly later . <p> Cut out 2 hat pieces in main fabric plus 2 pieces in interfacing . <p> Iron your interfacing onto the wrong side of the hat pieces and cut out your pocket pieces . Mine were 5 and 3/8 ? wide by 6 and 1/2 ? high , just a bit smaller than the rectangle part of the hat . <p> Mark centre of top of front side of each hat and pocket piece . Take one hat piece and one pocket piece . Arrange so the tops and centres line up , with the fabrics right sides facing . Sew together then press the pocket piece upwards so both right sides are visible together . Repeat for other hat and pocket pieces . <p> I added some ribbon to one of the hat pieces at this point . You will need to work out the placement of the brim after you have sewn and turned the hat . Just mark a line that is 3/8 ? ( or 1/4 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the brim and line up the bottom edge of the ribbon with it . Secure the ribbon with pins and edge stitch both sides of the ribbon . <p> Place the two pieces right sides facing and pin . Make sure to position buttonhole elastic between the bottom of the pocket piece if you are using it . I made the elastic longer than necessary and just trimmed it to the right length when I attached the rabbit . <p> I find it helpful to mark on all the spots where I will need to pivot and change direction . <p> Sew around the edge as marked below with dashed lines . Leave a gap at bottom of the hat of at least 2 ? . Start and end at to edge of fabric where the gap is as helps to flip seam allowance inside when you turn the hat . I have marked the brim seams in red so choose for these whether you prefer a 3/8 ? or 1/4 ? seam allowance . Pivot with needle down and turn whenever you need to change direction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to cut through the stitches . Trim the seam allowance around the brim to around 1/8 ? <p> Wrestle with the edges of the brim first . Then turn rest through . <p> Trim the elastic so level with bottom ( which is in fact the top ) of the hat . Sew up the gap by hand using a blind stitch . <p> Take your T-shirt and work out where you want to sew on the hat . Interface the inside of the T-shirt behind where the hat will go . I sewed it on by hand so the stitches would n't show but you could just sew around the edge with your machine . <p> Make or buy a rabbit and sew a button on for the tail . Attach it to the elastic and hide in the pocket . <p> I wo n't be doing a tutorial for the rabbit , except to say do n't do it the way I did , really . To fit the pocket I needed a fairly small rabbit that was also not too deep , oh and it had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description in the shops so realised I 'd have to make one . I started by drawing out how I 'd like my rabbit to look . That was easy enough , how hard could it be to make a rabbit that looks like my sketch ? Turns out the answer is pretty hard , and slow . Here 's a comparison . <p> So I 'd recommend using a soft toy you already own or , if you do need to make one then check out these cute felt animals . Helena from Craft and Creativity made them using a tutorial and pattern from Mollie Makes -- they look much easier and a lot quicker . Whatever pattern you use just remember to add a button on the back to join it to the elastic you sewed into the pocket . That way your child wo n't lose it but you can still remove it easily . Hopefully your child will love doing magic tricks as much as mine . <p> Some good examples of ' interactive clothing ' I 've made before are shown below . You can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links below . <p> A couple of ideas I love from other blogs are the ' Stuff ' n ' Stay ' Tutorial by Sophie at Cirque du Bebe and the ' Bumblebee Pocket Tutorial ' from Vanessa at Designs by Sessa . If you 're short on time then you could use a shop-bought T-shirt for many of the projects I 've mentioned . I have another post coming soon on a project I 've been working on for a long time where I 've created some highly personalised clothes for my youngest son , so stayed tuned to my blog if you 're looking for more ideas . <p> Thanks so much Narelle for

##3082050 <p> If this game does mark the end of Anthony McGrath 's distinguished career at Yorkshire , he can depart in the knowledge that he played a full part in restoring a great club to a place in the top division of the County Championship . McGrath , who will be 37 and out of contract in a month , began his first-class career in 1995 and is one of just two men in this team who played in the Championship-winning side of 2001 . <p> There have been a fair few downs to accompany the ups since then - McGrath has twice experienced relegation as well as those four Test and 14 ODI caps for England - but , if he has played his final first-class innings for the club he has served so well , he leaves with his head held high and knowing that he has helped Yorkshire return , in the words of their captain , " back where we belong " . <p> When McGrath and Azeem Rafiq came to the wicket in the second innings , Yorkshire were in danger of allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yorkshire 's lead was 246 and there was little batting left to come . Adam Lyth , who but for an awful 2011 would surely be streets ahead of Joe Root in the race for an England cap , was unfortunate to have been caught off the full face of the bat at short leg , while Gary Ballance had been brilliantly caught at point attempting to cut the impressively tight off-spin of Tom Westley . <p> But , instead of stumbling with the end in sight , the Yorkshire pair added 110 runs in 41.4 overs to take this game beyond Essex . Negating the increasingly sharp turn of Tom Craddock , who produced some diamonds amid the rust , the pace of Tymal Mills and the perseverance of Graham Napier , who strived in vain for a maiden 10-wicket haul , McGrath and Rafiq demonstrated composure , character and resilience to keep their side 's hopes of winning the Division Two title alive . <p> We should not be surprised . McGrath also played a key role in the victory over Leicestershire - he scored 90 in Yorkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leicestershire 's first innings - and a key role in the victory over Gloucestershire - he finished unbeaten on 76 as Yorkshire chased 314 to win by two wickets . He still pulls with as much assurance as anyone in the county game and , when defending , there are still times when his bat looks as broad as a barn door . If he is not offered a new contract at Yorkshire , there will surely be a few other clubs interested . <p> Rafiq , meanwhile , seems to grow in stature by the day . Having underlined the impression he gave in the first innings - that he has a decent defensive technique and temperament - he also showed a welcome ability to change gear as Yorkshire accelerated towards promotion . He struck four of his last 11 deliveries to the boundary and finished unbeaten on 75 . It is perhaps premature talk but he might just be Graeme Swann 's spin-bowling successor in the England team . <p> The Yorkshire declaration left Essex needing 388 to win in a minimum of 107 overs . To put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourth innings of a first-class game three times in their history and never at home . Bearing in mind the turning pitch and the somewhat uneven bounce , they are most unlikely to change that record on the final day . They lost Tom Westley , caught behind prodding at a good one that left him , and Jaik Mickleburgh , top-edging an ill-advised sweep to Rafiq 's fourth delivery , before stumps . <p> Yorkshire are not guaranteed to top the division even if they win . If Derbyshire defeat Hampshire , the two top sides will be equal on points , but Derbyshire will prevail as they have won more games . The same logic would see Derbyshire prevail in the unlikely event that both sides draw . <p> In truth , Yorkshire would have secured promotion even without McGrath and Rafiq in this game . Kent 's loss to Glamorgan allowed Derbyshire , the surprise package of 2012 , and Yorkshire to go into the final day of their games knowing that promotion was secure . For a team that was third and trailing Derbyshire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine achievement . <p> Their captain , Andrew Gale , was understandably delighted . But , while saying his team can already compete with anyone , admitted they were in the market for a couple of new players before the start of next season . The fact that they will be playing Division One cricket will do no harm in convincing the likes of James Harris and Jack Brooks to come to Leeds . <p> " It feels like we 're back where we belong , " Gale said . " Last year hurt a lot . Yorkshire are a first division side and a massive club so we did n't want to play in Division Two . We knew we had the talent and the ability to get straight back up . We want to be competing with the best sides in the country and we 've given ourselves the chance to do that . Given good weather we would have been up three weeks ago but those are the cards we 've been dealt and now we 're over the line . <p> " We had everything against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won two out of three and we 're in a great position in this one , obviously we want to go up as champions . We have a squad that can go far and compete seriously in Division One . We 're one or two players light at the moment , but I hope we can fix that over the winter . " <p> @hhillbumper Hmm . The fact that Yorkshire remain unbeaten all season suggests they do n't really belong in the bottom division as you suggest . As @yorkslanka says , you ca n't really win this argument . <p> Posted by yorkslanka on ( September 14 2012 , 06:17 AM GMT ) <p> huge congrats to the mighty Yorkshire ! ! ! @Hhillbumper- " when we come back up " - that 's after being RELEGATED then ? you cant really win that argument can you mate ... <p> Posted by 98-10157-0 on ( September 14 2012 , 00:21 AM GMT ) <p> Much as it pains me to admit it - I think the Sheffield Shield points system works better : ( i ) For an outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) For an outright win after a tie in the first innings 6 ( iii ) For an outright win after being behind on the first innings 6 ( iv ) For a tie where both teams have completed two innings ( irrespective of the first innings result ) 3 ( v ) For a first innings lead ( to be retained even if beaten outright ) 2 ( vi ) For an outright loss after leading on the first innings 2 ( vii ) For a tie on the first innings ( and no outright result ) 1 each ( viii ) For an outright loss after a tie in the first innings 1 ( ix ) For a loss on the first innings 0 ( x ) For an outright loss after being behind on the first innings 0 ( xi ) Abandoned or drawn matches with no first innings result 0 It is easier to apply , fairer if there are washouts , gives something tangible to go for if an outright win is impossible due to pitch/weather , eliminates contrivances . <p> Posted by mutley89 on ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I thought the same thing . You have to admit though , even if it puts us at slight disadvantage , it 's good how it incentivises teams to attempt a win , rather than settle for a draw .

The team looks like it is really together under Gillespie and with a few improvements we can make an impact next season . McGrath has to stay . he can still do a job and I would n't want to see him doing it for another county . There are too many other similar cases already . Well done everyone . <p> Posted by yorkshire-86 on ( September 13 2012 , 19:39 PM GMT ) <p> We only got relegated last season ( and Lancashire win the league despite been nowhere good enough as proven this season ) due to the ridiculous CC points system that destroys teams who suffer washouts and make games played more valuable than games won - a defeat earns teams roughly 5 points while a washout only grants you 3 . Since a win gives a team around 23 points and a defeat 5 ( depending on bonuses ) , meaning a completed game shares 28 points between the teams , surely fair compensation for a total washout should be equal division of points - ie 
##3082051 <p> A blood sample taken from Graeme Swann shortly after his arrest on suspicion of drink-driving last year may have been contaminated , according to a forensic expert who gave evidence at the player 's latest hearing at Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday . <p> Swann , who is currently on paternity leave before linking up with his England team-mates ahead of their World Cup opener against Netherlands on February 22 , was stopped near his home in West Bridgford shortly after 3.00am on April 2 last year , as he drove a white Porsche Cayenne towards a local supermarket , having arrived home to find his cat trapped under the floorboards . <p> During his original trial in August , Swann admitted to having drunk three or four glasses of white wine to celebrate his birthday , and was alleged to have told the arresting officer , PC Steven Denniss , he " should n't have probably been driving " , when pulled over for driving a high-performance car in an area beset by a spate of recent burglaries . <p> The second of two blood samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is over the legal limit of 80mg , although his solicitor argued that he had no case to answer , because it ought to have been the first that was used for testing .

##3084851 <p> What are you talking about man ? I told you do n't rely SO MUCH on bg software , I did not tell you do n't rely AT ALL . BG software will not tell you the style of play , as for the luck factor assessment allow me to say they often are ridiculous . You are not the only one who uses them you know .... Hats off to bg software for their assessments on the cube though . Styles do exist one very well known is the arabic game or backgame , there are people who are experts on this and constantly revert to it . <p> Ah yes , the backgame geniuses from the middle east . Well I think we all know how well they do against modern players ! It is I grant you a recognisable style , much as a vertical kamikaze dive is a recognisable method of landing an aircraft . Rarely seen on Fibs , never on the Grid and never in this era on live tournament tables . Cubeless in single games , ie Mediterranean cafe style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . I look forward to playing you one day . Thanks for the chat , enlivened a dull rainy day for me . <p> Shocked really from your " never " statement . But it seems we all got used with your bold over-generalizations of the type " every expert player uses them , every one of them relies on them , as if you are the spokesman of everyone . And btw I said they REVERT to backgames , this means they start with a hitting tactic then revert to backgame if the hitting goes wrong . The whole thing constitutes a style . Felafel who is one of your admired heroes does it frequently <p> Just curious why do you look forward in playing with me ? I am just an amateur <p> Name one expert who does n't use a computer to analyse . Falafel plays in exactly the same way as a bot , as his astonishing PR rates shows . He can of course revert to a back game when he has to do so , but to nominate him as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth as it is possible to get . He is the very model of a modern player , aided of course by his great individual powers of analysis . When he does play a back game , he will play it in the much the same way as XG does . <p> .... As far as i know only the server of " sorrytiger " uses rolls coming from another server that uses a natural generator based on earth 's vibrations or something . <p> Interesting idea . Who told you that ? Maybe you caught some of my very early ideas of employing random.org which maintains to be able to deliver white noise random numbers . <p> No - it is just a Mersenne Twister from the Python standard libs ( http : **35;995;TOOLONG ... - look around the 3. paragraph ) . The seed comes from the gnu/linux operating system and ( is said to ) incorporates random events from peripherals , such as mouse movements . Dice generated are handed to whichever board ( table ) is in need for a pair of dice . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were in court and had to prove that a sequence of dicerolls that were rolled during a match came from a RNG and not from manually rolled dice , HOW would you prove it ? <p> If you were in court and had to prove that a sequence of dicerolls that were rolled during a match came from a RNG and not from manually rolled dice , HOW would you prove it ? <p> Excellent question . There is a lot of talk about dice sequences that are " truly random " as opposed to those that are n't . But when the challenge is posed to describe the difference between random and non-random , it quickly becomes apparent that it is unclear what kind of answer could possibly satisfy . The problem is compounded by false and misleading notions such as " any pattern will occur if only you roll often enough " ( a widespread erroneous conclusion from the " law of large numbers " ) . <p> Is 123456123456 a non-random sequence ? How many times does the pattern have to repeat until it becomes non-random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused : It is conceptually impossible to attribute randomness ( or non-randomness ) to finite sequences of rolls . ( Which will yet not prevent us from disposing of a dice generator that repeats 123456 fifty times . ) <p> For our purposes , the appearance ( or non-appearance ) of sequences is of no consequence . All we need to know is that on the next roll we ca n't predict what that roll will be with any greater accuracy than probability . You ca n't do that on Fibs or the Grid , so the dice are by backgammon standards , random . <p> For our purposes , the appearance ( or non-appearance ) of sequences is of no consequence . All we need to know is that on the next roll we ca n't predict what that roll will be with any greater accuracy than probability . <p> This is confused . The predictability or non-predictability of rolls is inextricably bound up with the appearance of sequences . In order to determine whether a dice generator 's next roll is predictable or not , one has no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to remember that probability represents knowledge : With no prior knowledge of what a number generator has come up with in the past , all options of prediction become the same . Suppose a dice generator named DG1 only ever rolls the number 1 and one named DG123456 rolls a more or less even distribution of all numbers between 1 and 6 . Suppose further that we have no knowledge ( yet ) of what either DG does . Then DG1 will initially be just as unpredictable as DG123456 . Obviously that does n't make the two generators equal with regard to predictability in the long run . After DG1 has produced 11111111111 , we can hypothesize about its future rolls and successfully predict them .

##3084852 <p> What are you talking about man ? I told you do n't rely SO MUCH on bg software , I did not tell you do n't rely AT ALL . BG software will not tell you the style of play , as for the luck factor assessment allow me to say they often are ridiculous . You are not the only one who uses them you know .... Hats off to bg software for their assessments on the cube though . Styles do exist one very well known is the arabic game or backgame , there are people who are experts on this and constantly revert to it . <p> Ah yes , the backgame geniuses from the middle east . Well I think we all know how well they do against modern players ! It is I grant you a recognisable style , much as a vertical kamikaze dive is a recognisable method of landing an aircraft . Rarely seen on Fibs , never on the Grid and never in this era on live tournament tables . Cubeless in single games , ie Mediterranean cafe style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . I look forward to playing you one day . Thanks for the chat , enlivened a dull rainy day for me . <p> Shocked really from your " never " statement . But it seems we all got used with your bold over-generalizations of the type " every expert player uses them , every one of them relies on them , as if you are the spokesman of everyone . And btw I said they REVERT to backgames , this means they start with a hitting tactic then revert to backgame if the hitting goes wrong . The whole thing constitutes a style . Felafel who is one of your admired heroes does it frequently <p> Just curious why do you look forward in playing with me ? I am just an amateur <p> Name one expert who does n't use a computer to analyse . Falafel plays in exactly the same way as a bot , as his astonishing PR rates shows . He can of course revert to a back game when he has to do so , but to nominate him as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth as it is possible to get . He is the very model of a modern player , aided of course by his great individual powers of analysis . When he does play a back game , he will play it in the much the same way as XG does . <p> .... As far as i know only the server of " sorrytiger " uses rolls coming from another server that uses a natural generator based on earth 's vibrations or something . <p> Interesting idea . Who told you that ? Maybe you caught some of my very early ideas of employing random.org which maintains to be able to deliver white noise random numbers . <p> No - it is just a Mersenne Twister from the Python standard libs ( http : **35;1032;TOOLONG ... - look around the 3. paragraph ) . The seed comes from the gnu/linux operating system and ( is said to ) incorporates random events from peripherals , such as mouse movements . Dice generated are handed to whichever board ( table ) is in need for a pair of dice . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were in court and had to prove that a sequence of dicerolls that were rolled during a match came from a RNG and not from manually rolled dice , HOW would you prove it ? <p> If you were in court and had to prove that a sequence of dicerolls that were rolled during a match came from a RNG and not from manually rolled dice , HOW would you prove it ? <p> Excellent question . There is a lot of talk about dice sequences that are " truly random " as opposed to those that are n't . But when the challenge is posed to describe the difference between random and non-random , it quickly becomes apparent that it is unclear what kind of answer could possibly satisfy . The problem is compounded by false and misleading notions such as " any pattern will occur if only you roll often enough " ( a widespread erroneous conclusion from the " law of large numbers " ) . <p> Is 123456123456 a non-random sequence ? How many times does the pattern have to repeat until it becomes non-random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused : It is conceptually impossible to attribute randomness ( or non-randomness ) to finite sequences of rolls . ( Which will yet not prevent us from disposing of a dice generator that repeats 123456 fifty times . ) <p> For our purposes , the appearance ( or non-appearance ) of sequences is of no consequence . All we need to know is that on the next roll we ca n't predict what that roll will be with any greater accuracy than probability . You ca n't do that on Fibs or the Grid , so the dice are by backgammon standards , random . <p> For our purposes , the appearance ( or non-appearance ) of sequences is of no consequence . All we need to know is that on the next roll we ca n't predict what that roll will be with any greater accuracy than probability . <p> This is confused . The predictability or non-predictability of rolls is inextricably bound up with the appearance of sequences . In order to determine whether a dice generator 's next roll is predictable or not , one has no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to remember that probability represents knowledge : With no prior knowledge of what a number generator has come up with in the past , all options of prediction become the same . Suppose a dice generator named DG1 only ever rolls the number 1 and one named DG123456 rolls a more or less even distribution of all numbers between 1 and 6 . Suppose further that we have no knowledge ( yet ) of what either DG does . Then DG1 will initially be just as unpredictable as DG123456 . Obviously that does n't make the two generators equal with regard to predictability in the long run . After DG1 has produced 11111111111 , we can hypothesize about its future rolls and successfully predict them . With DG123456 this may be harder ( unless it comes up with 123456123456123456 or some other easily discernible pattern ) .

##3086250 <p> When you start off reading a football autobiography , your hopes are n't always that high . Perhaps a few inside stories on players you know , insight into managers , the odd anecdote -- the usual stuff . Having said that , nothing quite prepared me for the contents of this book . I had fairly clear memories of Andy Morrison , and his role in the resurgence of Manchester City football club . I knew he liked a drink , that his knees had caused him trouble , and that his role at City did n't last that long for those reasons . Little did I know just what else had gone on in his amazing , and often shocking life . <p> Morrison was born in Kinlochbervie , a small fishing village of 500 people a 100 miles north of Inverness . He had a happy childhood , but at a young age , took the 750 mile journey south with 3 brothers to Plymouth as his father moved away for work . Morrison clearly fears and respects his father in equal measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son . Soon his parents had split up , but his focus turned towards football , and aged 10 , he was selected for Plymouth schoolboys . As he grew older , his football skills developed at Plymouth , but there was a new thing in his life too . Alcohol . " The booze cured me of my chronic shyness . I felt relaxed and the world was a better place . Drink filled in the void in my life and I knew from that moment on , I had something I could turn to when I need to blot out a memory or just feel better about myself . " <p> And with alcohol came fighting , and lots of it with his elder brother Ian , as they tried to be like their father , who himself was n't averse to the odd " scrap " . Nights out almost inevitably ended in violence , and the consequences often spread to his football career . The fans did n't mind , as long as he did the business on the pitch , and he was a fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who always gave his all . He seemed fortunate that various managers gave him second ( and third ) chances and accepted him for what he was . It was even more fortunate that he did n't end up in prison -- fighting even crossed the path of Plymouth football club 's hooligan element . <p> After over a 100 games for Plymouth , Kenny Dalglish surprisingly signed Morrison up at Blackburn as he began building his title-winning side , in 1992 . Morrison got few opportunities there though , now a small fish in a big pond . Missing Plymouth , depression began to set in for the first time also . It also marked a cycle of fights with team-mates -- the red mist often descended under the influence of alcohol , memories of what happened hazy or non-existent most of the time . <p> Eventually Morrison moved to Blackpool , experiencing more success , though once more violence reared its ugly head , Morrison narrowly avoiding prison after a fight . On the day he was cleared , the night 's celebrations ended with yet another fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on the pitch , a disastrous collapse meant Blackpool blew an almost nailed-on promotion push , and Morrison soon moved to Huddersfield under Brian Horton . It was n't long before injuries started damaging his career , and a serious knee injury meant he only played sporadically for the Terriers over three seasons . <p> And then came Manchester City , in 1998 . Joe Royle needed a leader in the City dressing room , where morale was rock-bottom in the third tier of English football -- the rest is history . Morrison 's arrival made all the difference along with a few other shrewd signings , and the season ended at Wembley , and a famous play-off victory over Gillingham . Soon the knee was controlling his life again though , and Morrison would not feature much more for City -- on his return to fitness he made a couple of loan moves to try and reach his previous levels of performance , even returning briefly to Blackpool , but his career was effectively over , and eventually he was forced to retire . <p> Life did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on retirement landed him in court once more , this time for benefit fraud . His younger brother was lost to a drug overdose , his brother 's propensity for violence led him to prison with a conviction for manslaughter , and his wife had to have a cancerous growth removed -- three events that happened within a mere six-month period . And Morrison 's link to violence had n't ended either -- after turning out for a pub team , a barrage of abuse by three opposition players led to him following them to a pub post-match and wreaking his own brand of revenge . <p> But somehow he survived , turning his hand to management , and that is how he found himself on the management team at Northwich Victoria , and now in the Welsh Premier League with Airbus UK . <p> The book stands well against other footballers ' autobiographies , the bland , featureless tomes of recent years having been replaced by a raft of good stories like this or Paul Lake 's . Morrison 's book does not tug at the heart-strings like Lake 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is still excellently styled , and pulls no punches , written in an honest , straight-forward manner . Never has the word candid been more apt . There 's so much in there that no incident gets more than a page of comment , so in a book that is not overly-long , you are pushed along on a roller-coaster ride . Morrison does not hold back , his honesty resulting in great criticism of many famous names from the past twenty years of British football , and plenty of praise too . Clearly Joe Royle is the man that he respects more than any other , as it is he who provides the foreword to the book , showing the feeling was mutual . <p> There are also little gems in there , like the time Shaun Wright Phillips tried to fight him after a bruising first training session together , and who could forget him getting sent off for licking Stan Collymore 's ear ? He even ended up at Philosophy School after Willie Donachie helped him to try and defeat his demons . He also ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book , it is not just about football , it at times is barely about football . This is the man who has been charged with a Section 18 , wounding with intent , GBH ( twice ) , affray , actual bodily harm , threatening behaviour , and many public order offences . Morrison does not have to have played for your club for the book to be of interest . In the end , the football is skimmed over much of the time , a backdrop to the craziness of his personal life . At times you feel the relief when you read four pages without anything bad happening to him -- but with the anxiety that comes with knowing another fall is just round the corner . <p> It 's hard not to like Morrison at the end of it all , despite feeling guilty for doing so considering all the wrongs his life has contained . I guess that 's often the way when a story is told from one man 's perspective . But he does not seek to excuse many of his actions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . Whatever you think of the man , it 's an interesting read . And let 's hope that he has at last found some peace in his life so that the sport that made his name can provide for him for the foreseeable future . This is an 
##3087552 <h> How to make collaboration and social business work <p> At the heart of most notions of social business is collaboration : helping people work together better with social technologies . This is a reductive definition , social business is much more than that ... but that is for another blog post . <p> I have been thinking a lot recently about collaboration and organisational culture , and why social business will fail if we leave it to the software providers . No piece of software is going to fix a culture that is n't committed to collaborating . <p> On a personal level , since we all prize team-work , many people think collaboration comes naturally to them . And when it works well , we think we 're doing a good job naturally . In easy situations , where we all like each other and we 've collaborated before and it 's been a success this is the case . But to assume this is all an involuntary behaviour is wrong . True collaboration is actually hard work and a bit painful at times . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do to fix it ? <h> Great collaboration <p> A couple of weeks ago Brazilian Terezinha Guilhermina won gold in the womens ' 100m sprint . One of the reasons this was remarkable is she is blind . She ran the race alongside her guide Gilhermay Soares de Santana . <p> Seeing Terezinha and Gilhermay storm down the track was awesome , in its most literal sense . To train to win a 100m sprint is an incredible endeavour . To do it blind is unimaginable . To be the guide that trains just as hard to get someone else down that track to win .... that is amazing collaboration . <p> It reminded me of a quote from Group Genius by Keith Sawyer who describes the Wright brothers who are credited with inventing the first plane . He says : <p> The Wrights drew on the power of collaboration . They allowed their innovation to unfold from constant conversation and side-by-side work . <p> In other words great communication and proximity . <p> Sawyer is a Professor of Education and Psychology at Washington University and has studied creativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He believes that true creativity is not a singular process -- an individual having a light bulb moment and inventing a car . Rather it is an iterative additive collaborative thing . So he set to work studying the ultimate collaborators : improv artists -- in the theatre and jazz bands . <p> I do n't have time to do his work justice . So I shall play fast and loose with his work and focus on three attributes of great collaboration according to Sawyer and then flip them to see if we can learn anything about why it can be so problematic . <p> One : " Successful collaborative teams practice deep listening " <p> Do we spend enough time listening to and observing others ? Are we truly open to someone else 's input ? This might require subordinating our egos . This requires confidence . <p> Two : " Team members build on their collaborators ' ideas " <p> Are we wrongly dogged in pursuing a different agenda ? We might need to admit that our idea needs more work or is even wrong . This requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom up " <p> Improv performances are self organising -- no director and no script . The best collaborative teams form spontaneously . So if we get hung up about our status or others -- " it 's not my job to do that , " or " I 'm too senior to play a supporting role " -- we will not succeed . This requires flexibility . <h> Think about culture before software <p> So if collaboration is n't effective in your business , before reviewing the many collaboration software options out there , it 's worth considering whether there are five cultural issues that need addressing . <p> Communication -- are your teams in regular effective conversation ? <p> Proximity -- are they working together closely ? <p> Confidence -- are they self assured enough to listen to others and subordinate their own opinions ? <p> Bravery -- will they admit they 're wrong ? <p> Flexibility -- will they make a contribution based on their talents in spite of corporate hierarchies ? <h> 2 Comments <h> Marianna Mills : <p> We are a non-profit organization , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work tasks .

##3092650 <p> Assuming the search was lawful ( and nothing the Speaker said suggested otherwise ) then the Serjeant-at-Arms was right to allow the police to search Parliamentary premises . Parliamentary privilege does not prevent arrests for crimes , and it would be quite wrong not to admit the police to exercise their lawful powers . Speaker Martin clearly did n't think a search warrant was necessary last week -- why should he have ? it 's not -- but now that all this has blown up he is trying to put the Serjeant-at-Arms in the frame . Weak , pathetic and deeply unimpressive , this : if there were any sense in this idea that a warrant should be insisted on ( there 's not : it 's merely a procedural hurdle that 's being put forward now , as a sop ) then he should have insisted on one last week , rather than bringing it up after the fact , as a way of blaming his staff . Jill Pay has done nothing wrong , and should not resign . If anyone in Parliament has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also unimpressed that the debate on all this will only take place on Monday -- it should have been this week . <p> Why is so much being made ( a ) of the fact that the police did not appear to have a warrant and ( b ) the suggestion that the police should have told Jill Pay S-at-Arms , that she was not obliged to consent ? <p> No-one seemed inclined to put the boot into the Speaker who does appear to have played this particular game of constitutional and political chess by using the little known ' Jellyish defence ' . <p> The story is not over yet . We have Jacqui Smith 's peroration and perambulation yet to come . I 'm not overly impressed with Brown or Smith in this farago . <p> It puzzles me , too -- I think lots of MPs must assume a search is only lawful with a warrant and that they 've been told the search was unlawful -- which of course they have n't . <p> I think this has a lot of legs , too . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- but is his position really sustainable ? He was clearly kept in the loop and did not insist on a warrant . He should have taken the line that a warrant was n't needed and the S-at-A acted properly ; but he was afraid of that and wanted to offer something to MPs . <p> As well as ministers , we 've more to hear from the police , I think -- they may dispute the accusation that they failed to give the full information . <p> This from the BBC website tonight ... " When asked about this , a Scotland Yard spokesman said there had been " no deliberate attempt to mislead " . <p> A separate police source added that if the official who signed the consent from for the raid -- Sergeant at Arms Jill Pay -- had not known police could be refused permission to enter , it would be " surprising " . <p> It is a bit worrying when neither the Police nor the people who actually made the goddam laws know what the law is .... wonderfully British . <p> More to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the muffled sound of dissimulation . <p> Maybe my new diet of only one meal a day + a bottle is getting to me -- but what is Jacqui Smith going to say in her statement . She says she did not know in advance ... <p> I would like to know why she was out of the loop when others were told . She probably does not know the answer to that very simple question -- and will say that the Police must pursue their enquiries and go where the evidence leads them . <p> It appears that the police are doing a bit of back tracking ... and Acting Met Commissioner must be extremely pissed off as he sees the top job disappearing over the horizon ? <p> I can not accept your comment that parliamentary priviledge does not extend to criminal matters ! If those criminal matters touch in any way the freedom of speech or procedures within parliament , then the 1689 BOR would still protect . Let us say for example that an mp was reported to the police for an offence of incitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then surely The rights of the house would still take precedence ! <p> Fair enough , Anon -- you have a point , and I 'm not sure what the position would be if the police were to try to arrest an Mp in the circumstances you oultine . <p> I 'm talking about the freedom from arrest , though , rather than freedom of speech -- they 're two separate aspects of privilege and of course no action is being taken against Green for anything he 's said . <p> An MP is not protected by privilege from arrest for a crime ; so I think it 's right to say , as I said in the original post , that Parliamentary privilege does not prevent arrests for crimes . <p> but my point is that it would be very easy for an MP to commit a crime in the process of parliamentary proceedings or parliamentary free speech , <p> I would put it forward that that argument applies to the green case , if he stated that the information was being sought for use ONLY in parliament , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for parliamentary research or to formulate written questions for example , then the constitutional law would surely provide an absolute protection as it would fall under the proceedings in parliament clause of the BOR <p> I do n't think so , Anon . If he had conspired with Chris Galley , he did that out of Parliament . I 'm afraid the obsession many commentators have with Parliamentary privilege re : Damian Green is wholly irrelevant . <p> Let 's face it , how often do the cops raid MP 's offices -- in or out of Parliament ? It 's plain that Ministers would have been informed . <p> Indeed this whole exercise was -- we are told -- started in the Cabinet Office , so did no one think it politic to talk to the Minister well before the guano started flying ? In any event , Normington did not get to his exalted position by taking risks with his own backside . My view is that many of these people were in the loop but that they 're all trying desperately to avoid any form of responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetence that gets me . If you 're going to stitch up your opponents just do it properly , eh ? Is this really the best conspiracy that Mandelson can come up with ? It really is a third-rate effort . No finesse at all . <p> Charon , that may have been Erskine May 's opinion , however the 1999 parliamentary commission on it seems to suggest its FAR more complex , and that the position of exactly what constitutes parliamentary proceedings is less than settled : <p> I agree it was lawful under s.18 . Too many red herrings are being smoked to cause confusion . Both the Labour and Tories are lying in this affair . What happened 
##3092651 <h> Ballots , figures and the right to strike <p> Last week 's Court of Appeal judgment in Metrobus v UNITE must make frustrating reading for the union 's officials : it upholds King J 's grant of an injunction preventing bus drivers from striking in Croydon , Crawley and Orpington last autumn on the basis , firstly that UNITE had not promptly informed Metrobus of the result of its strike ballot , and secondly that its strike notice did not give Metrobus sufficient information to work out how many drivers at each depot would be called out . <p> Three arguments had persuaded King J to grant the injunction . First , although the strike ballot had closed at noon on 1st September , a mix-up between UNITE and Electoral Reform Services involving a missing fax was at least in part the cause of the union 's only telling Metrobus the outcome almost 48 hours later . That was too long . Second , the union 's correspondence did not properly explain how it arrived at its figures for how many drivers would be called out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreed about how the relevant legislation applied , the majority ruled that insufficient explanation was given . I expect unions are already drawing up guidance for officials about how to comply with this I think quite demanding requirement . The only point on which the majority in the Court of Appeal disagreed with King J was the importance of a statistical typing error -- a UNITE secretary , Sandra Evans , had at one point typed 766 instead of 776 . The Court of Appeal , surely rightly , thought this error far too trivial to justify an injunction . <p> The other interesting point about the case is that the Court of Appeal saw all the relevant legislation as compatible with 
##3094752 <h> Secondary menu <h> Search form <h> Rethinking finance for development in city ' slums ' <p> Very little aid is actually available to low-income urban groups and grassroots organizations . If it is , it is subject to the conditions and priorities established by the aid-provider . The Asian Coalition for Community Action ( ACCA ) is challenging this funding model by providing small grants to low-income communities for the initiatives they choose and supporting these communities to work together and work with their local governments . <p> Around one in seven of the world 's population live in informal settlements in urban areas . City economies would collapse without their labour and the goods and services from informal enterprises -- yet city governments often ignore them or see them only as a problem . In the absence of support from local governments , aid agencies or development banks , they have had to manage by themselves . They 've built a high proportion of all new housing in informal settlements with insecure tenure because they can not get land legally and have often built on land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on good quality land . They struggle to cope with problems such as regular flooding , and face high levels of fire risk ( caused by widespread use of candles , kerosene lamps and stoves in houses constructed from flammable materials located very close together ) . They face the constant threat of eviction -- or actual eviction . The Asian Coalition for Community Action ( ACCA ) sees these people , and the grassroots organizations they form , as the basis for urban development . <p> Since 2009 , ACCA has developed a working finance system in which urban poor organizations have the power to choose what they will undertake . ACCA has provided small grants to 950 community-initiatives to upgrade ' slums ' or informal settlements in 165 cities in 19 nations . Up to ( US ) $3,000 of grant finance is available , and communities use this to , for example , construct or improve their water supply systems or toilets , drains , roads , paths or bridges , community centres , household waste management , playgrounds or parks . Up to $40,000 has been available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem very small in relation to the scale of the problems they seek to address . They are . But the funding is available quickly for what a community identifies as their key priority and what they themselves will undertake . <p> There is not enough development money to fund everything that needs to be done in all informal settlements sufficiently . But as the organizers of ACCA explain , this insufficient funding catalyses new ways of using finance -- people have to think harder about what resources they can contribute , what additional support they can negotiate , and who they can work with . This can lead to the forging of new partnerships to address other needs . As the funding is sufficient for several communities in a city to undertake an initiative , these communities frequently visit each other to learn from others ' experience . <p> These small grants can lead to important changes within the city . The efficacy of the grassroots groups may be recognised for the first time . When a community constructs some public amenity that is meant to be provided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The improvements are visible evidence of what communities can accomplish on their own . <p> This often leads to local government support -- and the development of a city-wide platform in which representatives from grassroots organizations sit as equals with local government officials and other stakeholders . It often leads to the development of a City Development Fund in which all the active community organizations have a financial stake by pooling their resources and to which city government or external agencies can contribute . ACCA has supported the setting up of 107 City Development Funds across the countries where ACCA works and has also financed 100 larger housing-related initiatives <p> ACCA initiatives are planned and undertaken by the residents of informal settlements as collective processes : <p> collective funding systems managed by networks of savings groups ( the City Development Funds ) , <p> new collective relations , as linkages are built between those living in informal settlements and local governments . <p> These ACCA initiatives are assessed by their peers -- other urban poor groups . Perhaps surprisingly , this is unusual . Development projects that are meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers ( community groups and NGO supporters ) but by outside ( usually foreign ) professionals who visit the project briefly and who have no expertise in living in informal settlements with very inadequate incomes . <p> A new paradigm for development funding ? <p> Perhaps it 's too early to suggest that this shows a new trend or ( to use a much over-used word ) even a new paradigm in development . But there are certain features ACCA shares with other successful development initiatives . First , it makes funding available direct to low-income groups . But many forms of social protection now do this . Second , unlike social protection initiatives that provide income-supplements to individual families , it funds collective initiatives chosen by grassroots organizations . This encourages organized networks of the urban poor to plan and act collectively and , as noted above , to bring this planning to the city level by engaging with local governments . This often leads to city or national funds being set up that can continue , widening and increasing support for community initiatives . The Urban Poor Fund International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to grassroots organizations and federations for collective initiatives that they choose . It too has supported hundreds of community initiatives where the use of funding is determined by the federations of slum or shack dwellers . <p> Can aid agencies and development banks effectively help the urban poor ? <p> Official aid agencies and development banks were not set up to work directly with low-income communities . They were set up to work with and fund national governments . Bilateral aid agencies have to be accountable to the government that funds them ( and beyond this to the voters who put the government into office ) . Multilateral development banks , such as the World Bank and the Asian , African and Inter-American Development Banks have to be accountable to the governments that sit on their boards -- especially those that provide them with funding . These funding agencies have no direct accountability to low-income groups , even though these groups ' ( unfulfilled ) needs are what justifies these agencies ' work and funding . <p> Initially , it was assumed that international funding agencies would support national ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also believed that stronger economies would lead , through increased incomes and larger government capacity , to , in turn , providing the basics -- secure housing , water , sanitation , health care , education , the rule of law and political systems that were accountable and democratic . But this has not happened for a large and often growing number of urban dwellers . Perhaps aid agencies and development banks have actually inadvertently inhibited this process because national or city governments are focussed on maintaining links to their donors , international agencies , and not on being accountable to their own population . <p> If large , centralized development assistance agencies can not work directly with urban poor groups and their community organizations , can they learn to work with and through intermediary institutions , which are on the ground financing , working with and accountable to urban poor groups ? <p> ACCA sees these people and the grassroots organizations they form as the basis for urban development . The collective initiatives that it has supported draw on their ingenuity , their capacities and their contacts ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives support the growth of their collective political power to change both how city and local governments work , and 
##3094851 <h> Tyler : " It 's time for me to let go " of ' Idol ' <p> The Aerosmith frontman has been on the judging panel for the past two years , but has today revealed that he will not be returning to the TV show next year . <p> In a statement , he wrote : " After some long ... hard ... thoughts ... I 've decided it 's time for me to let go of my mistress American Idol before she boils my rabbit . <p> " I strayed from my first love , AEROSMITH , and I 'm back -- but instead of begging on my hands and knees , I got two fists in the air and I 'm kicking the door open with my band .

##3102752 <h> How To Review A Product <p> I get asked a fair bit about what is it I look for in a product , how do I know it 's good and when do I know it 's bad . The answer is , long ... I look for a whole number of things and a product ideally has to tick most of , if not all the boxes . Sometimes there are exceptions , for example if one criteria is so outstanding that it allows the overlooking of the others . Anyway , here is what , how and why I look what I look for . <h> Price Point <p> A low price is n't always cheap and an expensive price is n't always luxury , it 's about if the price is justified . Products such as Hairbond for example , have a comparatively low price , but they are some of the most outstanding products I 've used based on their good performance in other criteria . Products with a low price are sometimes ' let off the hook ' if some corners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , if it ends up in the bin , even though it 's a waste , you 've not really lost anything . Products with a high price tag always receive a higher level of scrutiny as I feel they need to justify themselves for being marketed at such a high price . I need to know that there is something about it that sets it above its 1.50 counterpart . <p> Also how long does the product last , this really is linked in with the price point . It may cost 18 but if it lasts 6 months compared to a product available for 6 that might only last me 30 days , is it economical in the long run ? <h> Ingredients <p> Ingredients are a huge part of how I analyse a product . Shortcuts , time savers and money scrimping never go undetected when looking at an ingredients listing . My biggest bug-bear is fragrance , I find it an almost completely unnecessary ingredient and will judge a product for using it . Why ? Well , what are they trying to cover up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mask the scent of ? This is also a very powerfully known irritant that makes many products unusable to a lot of people . I can and will react to a lot of fragrance , but sometimes not . <p> As well as fragrances , are artificial parabens used ? These are again , another set of known nasties . Preservatives are then something else to consider and come in a whole variety of shapes and forms , from ' good ' preservatives to ' bad ' preservatives . Making sure you know your ingredients is key , otherwise you ca n't accurately recommend a skincare product to a wider audience without taking into account the fact they may react to common irritants or have a general disagreement with their skin . <h> Packaging <p> Not hugely important in the grand scheme of things , but I like something that 's going to look good in my Bathroom and a product that I 'd be happy to whip out in public . Is it well thought through ? Does it hinder or help the product inside ? How long does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Efficacy <p> Does it do what is says on the tin ? For me a product has to give me both short term and long term benefits . If there are no real short term benefits , so for example it has been designed to correct a problem over a period of time , the product has to at least not cause a short term hinderance . How well does it deliver its promises ? Also just because it did n't give me the desired effect , does this mean it wo n't for someone else ? If I ca n't test a product myself , for instance if it does n't suit my skin type , then I will always find a willing Guinea pig ( an actual human being , do n't worry ) to test it on and monitor the progress and outcomes . <p> I look for phrases such as " Gives shinier , healthier LOOKING hair " or " Improves the APPEARANCE of wrinkles " and my favourite " Skin FEELS younger " -- these cleverly worded marketing strap-lines do not in fact promise anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " often means that a shampoo and conditioner is laden with silicone that coat the hair leaving it shinier and healthier in appearance but in the long run causing damage to the integrity of your hair . " Improves the APPEARANCE of wrinkles " often denotes light-reflecting particles that when hit with light , make wrinkles look visibly smaller , but without actually making an ounce of difference to the size and depth of them . " Skin FEELS younger " means that moisture is bonded to your skin cells making it feel smoother to the touch when compared to not using a moisturiser , any moisturiser will do this , it 's really nothing special . " 9 out of 10 women said they 'd recommend this " is all about how a survey is worded . If I was asked " If you had a choice , would you either recommend this moisturiser , or , shove a badger up your bum " , I know what my answer would be ! <h> Brand <p> Is it from a new brand that still have a lot of growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know better ? New brands do n't always get it right first time around , and even though you should n't let them off the hook , there should be a little room for you to mention this . If the product has come from one of the giants who have the time , resources and money to invest in the highest level or R &D,; they really should n't be cutting unnecessary corners and releasing a product to market that has n't received the benefit of all their years of work and experience . <h> 5 thoughts on " How To Review A Product " <p> Hi Thom , love your ' HOW TO REVIEW A PRODUCT ' very refreshing to read , once you have cleared out your stock room if you would like to review any of the Metique range I would be delighted to send you something Kind Regards Jenny -- Metique Tea Tree Oil Products <p> " If you had a choice , would you either recommend this moisturiser , or , shove a badger up your bum " , I know what my answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing .

##3106352 <p> After the bombshell announcement that Bridgepoint was putting Dorna in charge of both the MotoGP and World Superbike series , the media were keen to get a reaction from either of the Flammini brothers , the two men who had helped to grow the series into the success it is today , and who currently run WSBK . After an initial deafening silence , Paolo Flammini finally made an appearance at Magny-Cours on Sunday morning , to explain his , and Infront 's , point of view . Our friends at the Italian website InfoMotoGP.com were present to record the press conference on video . <p> Flammini did not say much - indeed , he started his speech with the words " I do n't have much to add to what is written in the press release , " - but what he did say helped clarify the situation a little . Starting off with an understatement - " This step represents a very big moment in the history of World Superbikes " , Flammini told the assembled media - the Italian was at pains to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many people are worried for the 2013 season , but nothing special will happen , " he said , emphasizing that his aim was to keep stability in the series . <p> Flammini , his brother Maurizio , and his team at Infront had worked hard to make World Superbikes , and would continue to do what they could to ensure its success in the future . " We will do whatever is necessary for the good of the World Superbike championship , " Flammini said . " Whatever will be the end of the reorganization process , whatever will happen during the next weeks and months , we want that the World Superbike championship will continue to grow , will continue to be a very strong product . " Flammini accepted that changes were inevitable , though he told reporters that he believed that the most logical step would be for the current Infront team who run the series to remain in place . Flammini emphasized that any changes to be made should have a positive effect on the series : " The only important thing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain that we are happy . " <p> He was uncertain about his own position , Flammini told reporters , but he acknowledged that it was a risk that companies run when they partner with larger companies . " Clearly , when you open your company to external investors , you give an advantage to your company , but you can lose power at a personal level , " Flammini said . " This is not a problem , as long as this reorganization process will bring a good result for the World Superbike championship , we will cooperate , we will push for the good whatever will be our position in the new structure , if there will be a position . " <p> The championship would not change radically in the short term , Flammini told reporters . The Superbike Commission - WSBK 's rulemaking body - was due to meet on Monday to ratify the changes discussed during the current season for 2013 . Those changes include the adoption of 17-inch wheels and the application of fake headlights to bikes , as adopted by Kawasaki for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year . Another change Flammini mentioned was less expected : pit stops will be introduced during wet races , to avoid races having to be stopped and restarted . That was in itself a consequence of the introduction of a single bike per rider , a move which made running flag-to-flag races with bike changes an impossibility . The straitjacket of TV schedules means that Infront have had to explore alternative options , however . <p> Flammini would not be drawn on the future beyond 2013 . " From what I can tell you , the 2013 season will go ahead as it is already planned . For the future , I can not give you any information , this will be part of the strategy that will be implemented and we will see what will happen . " <p> That does not mean that other sources were not providing information . Though 2013 is set more or less in stone , or at least will be once the Superbike Commission publishes the minutes of its meeting today , the years after that look to be rather different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the World Superbike machines limited , in order to maintain the gap between WSBK and MotoGP . With Dorna now in charge , it is widely expected - both inside and outside the World Superbike paddock - that such limits will be imposed . Reducing modifications to Superstock level seems unlikely , though the regulations could be closer to Supersport than the current WSBK rules . Standard electronics seem almost inevitable , however , to contain the costs which are spiralling out of control in both WSBK and MotoGP . With a spec ECU to be introduced in 2014 in MotoGP , it seems likely that a similar measure could be imposed on World Superbikes at the same time . Such a move would be unpopular with the factories currently involved in World Superbikes , but would be welcomed by the private teams , which have struggled to compete in recent years , with a few notable exceptions . <p> The most interesting rumor to emerge from Magny-Cours , however , concerned the future of the spec tire . Current suppliers Pirelli were rumored to be ending their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rumors were not clear on whether they will serve out the full extent of their contract , which runs until the end of the 2015 season , or whether the contract would be terminated prematurely . Nor was their any word on who would replace the Italian tire manufacturer . If the rumor is true - and it is a very big if - it would be a surprise , as Pirelli is also the sole supplier for the British Superbike championship . The series - both World and British Superbikes - are an excellent fit with the current consumer market : Pirellis remain a popular choice for sportsbike fitment , both as OEM equipment and as an aftermarket choice when riders replace their standard tires . <p> Below is the full video of the press conference Paolo Flammini gave , courtesy of InfoMotoGP.com : <h> Comments <p> " Australian Superbike bosses have bucked a popular racing trend and ditched control tyres in favour of a numbers and price cap policy for 2013 in order to bring down costs . <p> Dunlop had been the official tyre supplier - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WSBK , and Bridgestone in MotoGP - but other manufacturers including Michelin are now being allowed back into the series . <p> " The move was made to allow riders a wider choice and will bring the cost of racing down , as well as add another exciting element to the tactics and strategy of racing . IEG thanks Pirelli and Michelin for their interest in being involved once more and Dunlop for their continued support , " said Yarrive Konsky , boss of right holders IEG . <p> The price cap ( converted from Aussie dollars ) and number of tyres per class are as follows : <p> Firstly .. I said " .. slicks , qualifiers and whizz-bang electronics .. " It was early .. what I meant to say was " .. slick qualifiers and whizz-bang .. " <p> But on second thought .. would it be such a bad idea for WSBK to run road legal tyres ? It may appeal to manufacturers as correlation to their product is more direct and , it would widen the gap to GP as desired ? <p> If the spec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you want to stop teams leaning towards a certain brand ? <p> Tyre contracts save money for teams but lock them in .. perhaps to the detriment of the race budget in other areas if tyre performance is below the level of another brand . <p> If there were no contracts and teams were free to choose from tyre manufacturers set up in the paddock , at a reasonable set cost , surely this is true competition ? <p> Nothing to stop a team having a contract if they wish .. but moaning about tyre performance and using it as an excuse would make teams/riders look a bit silly perhaps ? .. given the above choice available . <p> Pricing could be awkward as cost of the same product is different from country to country , continent to continent . <p> Those prices do seem a little high but in principle , I think the idea is a good one . <p> Would it be such a bad idea for WSBK to run road legal tires ? Yes because the average rider in level 2 of a track day kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power the world superbike bikes make would kill a set of road tires even quicker . Unless of course the race was shortened to say 5 laps or so . <p> " If the spec tyre rule was scrapped , opening up competition , why would you want to stop teams leaning towards a certain brand ? " <p> Back then in MotoGP , Michelin were the winning tyres because they were allowed to utilise their " overnight specials " capability due to vast factories located in the Europe while Bridgestone could not because their only facility is located in Japan . Michelin hand selected teams that " qualify " for the royal treatment . <p> When the rules changed to such that race tyres for the whole weekend had to be pre-submitted before the prototypes turned a wheel in FP1 , Bridgestone became the preferred brand because they were more consistent , while Michelin starting to spike in the number of defects and lost of grip because they were not used to predicting the weather/track conditions ahead of time which Bridgestone were forced to get used to all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by demanding a switch of tyre brands during the following race season . When majority of the racers started to demand for Bridgestone in the next season , the Japanese tyre company responded that being the smaller company , it is not capable of extending it 's service to more teams . Nobody asked for Dunlop . Dunlop had to pay Tech 3 to use them . <p> Couple of years later , when Dorna started the bid for a single tyre manufacturer , Michelin claimed they do not race in a spec tyre series and therefore between Bridgestone and Dunlop , we knew who got the deal . Speaking of Dunlop , is n't them the " spec tyre " brand for Moto3 &; Moto2 even though there is not a spec tyre regulation in the junior classes ? <p> This is what I meant to ask . Teams and racers will always try to get the best , and cream will rise to the crop ( in this case , a particular tyre brand ) . How to prevent that ? In MotoGP , the manufacturers try to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even humanly as much as possible . <p> It 's great to see Showa and Nissin in the sea of Ohlins and Brembo , likewise I do not like the spec tyre rule . <p> Tyres are of most importance for credibility of sport . But remember WSBK in 90 's . Michelin was THE tyre , and others using pirelli or dunlop , had no chance tor podium . So , multiple tyre supliers at top of top levels ? this does not work . We have seen it too many times . Australian way can benefit some national championships , but in the big picture ? I do n't think so . <p> Pirelli has done wonders to F1 ! ! just as Bridgestone allmost killed the series with their " we are borg " philosophy . As they re doing int in GP ! Musthave ally chasis , must have Ohlins must have ultra compact engine . Pirellis are doeing it on V4 , V2 and 4inLine . Ally chasis or steel tubular frames , and Panigale seems to be OK with them too . it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is is much worst with them in the game . <p> It would be easiest to invite Pirelli to GP , alt let them do their thing in the big class to : D <p> If you watch the USA commercials of what Bridgestone can do to the games ( NBA , MLB , etc ) , one ca n't help but feel they want to change how games play with their technology . Funny commercials though , but not so funny if they came true ... <p> At the very least this is a good chance for motocycle racing to work on its mass appeal , and be able to guarantee that for a part of the year there will be high quality motocycle racing every weekend without any overlap . <p> Hmmm , WSBK ( Infront ) is doing well , MotoGP ( Dorna ) is not , so lets put Dorna in charge of BOTH series ... What a joke ! DORNA will neuter the competition , i.e. World Superbike ! The Flammini 's need to team up with the manufacturers and start anew ! <p> Your or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being run probably varies considerably from Bridgepoint 's . <p> Remember that money men with no interest in the ' racing ' side of the sport own both series , and they may see poorly negotiated TV rights and selling off races cheap as bigger crimes than shrinking grid numbers . <p> As long as the big numbers look good on paper , Dorna would seem the better choice to manage their ' investment ' . Of course , if interest in MotoGP dries up ... <p> Precisely . Investment bankers do n't , and are n't supposed to , care about anything other than return on investment . The quality of the racing is just one of the factors that affects the series owners ' ROI . <p> ' Giving ' away races is an interesting phrase . It means that WSBK was leasing the event for less than what Bridgepoint expected to/needed to make in terms of profit . A private concern ( say , the Flammini brothers w/o Bridgepoint oversight ) can be happy with making a smaller profit . It 's their day job . <p> BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment for investor dollars . So it has to maximize its return at every turn . Honestly , how a spec ECU and losing manufacturers from the grids is going to help them do that , I do n't see . But these guys are smarter than me . <p> Oh wait , it was the investment banker shell game that nearly bankrupted the entire freakin ' U.S. a few years back . Wonder what they can do to motorcycle road racing ... <p> re : " Remember that money men with no interest in the ' racing ' side of the sport own both series , and they may see poorly negotiated TV rights and selling off races cheap as bigger crimes than shrinking grid numbers .

Email me at this handle @yahoo.com and we can gleefully continue this discussion off-board ... : ) <p> Back to the topic at hand - maybe we should make MotoGP bikes run on bias-ply tires . That should liven up the show . <p> Modern capitalism has become almost entirely focused on quarterly or at most annual results . <p> " Giving away " races would be a great long term strategy if WorldSBK were doing it to develop potentially important new markets ( India ?

But the sad truth is that both WSBK and MotoGP as they exist currently are not commercially/financially sustainable . How many WSBK riders are earning a good wage ? Hardly any ! How many teams turn a decent profit ? Hardly any ! Change is needed in both

I would be happy to help you out , but it just can not be there was too much of it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <h> You could watch some of the films set in the 60 ? s in Britain such as Blowup or Quadrophenia . <h> Most of the stuff you read about " The Swinging Sixties " , happened in London . Life in small , provincial towns or villages was n't that different from the Fifties , although the spread of people owning television sets did bring the modern world more into focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pops " which went out every Thursday evenings at about 7.00. p.m.This was where we got our ideas of the new fashions and hairstyles from as well as from the new teen magazines.There was a huge explosion of popular or " pop " culture . Mary Quant invented the mini-skirt , which outraged parents , which was half the fun . Skirts had never been so short and so the fashion of " tights " or pantyhose was born . The boys wanted to look like The Beatles and wore really tight " drainpipe " trousers and Chelsea boots , ankle high , elastic-sided boots from the Edwardian era.And , of course , long hair , which also enraged the older generation brought up on the " short-back-and-sides " regulation Army haircut . Hairdressers became as famous as pop stars and models , for example , Vidal Sassoon who invented the " geometric 5-point bob . " People went to the cinema 2 or 3 times a week and there was an upsurge of gritty " kitchen-sink " dramas , shot in black and white and addressing real issues such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , " Saturday Night and Sunday Morning " , " Kes " , " The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner . " " Billy Liar " , " Georgy Girl " and " A Kind of Loving " are all now regarded as classics and can still be found on DVD . Before this films depicted British people as upper-class with " cut-glass " accents and strangulated vowels . Very unrealistic . Either that or people were depicted as " cheery Cockney sparrers " , always laughing and joking . Equally unrealistic . Most girls at that time still dreamed of getting married in a white dress and giving up work to stay at home and look after the home and children.Your job was just something you did between school and marriage . Only the upper class , well off young people went to University . As for slang , girls were " birds " , drinks were usually " a pint " , very few working class youths drank shorts or spirits . The pubs would be closed by 10.30. p.m. and the dance halls " chucked out " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was unusual for girls to have their own car.The boys were divided into " The Mods " , who were fussy about their appearance , spent a lot on their clothes and travelled by motor scooter , their pride and joy.These were usually Italian , " Vespa " s or " Lambretta " s and they crammed as many shiny chrome mirrors and decorations on them as they could get . The other camp were " The Rockers " or " Greasers " , who modelled themselves on Marlon Brando , James Dean and Elvis Presley.They rode big , powerful 500cc motor bikes , leather flying jackets and cowboy boots with their hair greased back in a D.A. ( Duck 's Arse ) style , like john Travolta in " Grease " . This was really a hangover from the 1950s but the Mods and the Rockers would meet up for huge pitched battles , usually at a seaside resort like Brighton or Bournemouth at Bank Holiday weekends . The other huge change that occurred in the 60s was the advent of " The Pill " . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era of so-called " free love " was born and women became much more sexually liberated . As for politics , we were in the middle of the " Cold War " . The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 , ( I was there at the time ) and there was huge suspicion and mistrust between East and West.The Space race was in full swing between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. and Britain watched fascinated . The young President John Kennedy and his beautiful young wife were great favourites with us Brits , especially as he had , we felt , averted a nuclear war at the Bay of Pigs crisis in Cuba . We still looked to the U.S.A. for the latest films and fashion and loved reading about our favourite film stars although we were fed an official studio version of their glamorous lives . Nothing like the exposes of today . In general , it was a great time to be young and we felt a freedom that we had n't felt before and , certainly in terms of fashion , style , music and general " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given you a good background to our leisure lives and fashion . Useful info:1 shilling was worth five pence This a bit about my life at that time : I married in August 1959 when I was 21 to someone who was 26 . We decided on a Register Office wedding because we had vastly different Religious backgrounds . My engagement ring cost 40 and we paid half each because he had only 20 in his Bank . The Marriage Licence cost 7s 6d. ( 35.5 pence ) to the Registrar . I made my own dress -- in a silver blue because it was his fav colour and bought a pair of plain blue shoes which cost nearly 3 . We had a dozen guests and after the ceremony all went to a Steak House for lunch . After we caught a train to St. Ives in Cornwall for a honeymoon -- we did n't have a car .

I was a secretary earning about 7 per week less deductions . We had no bedroom furniture to start -- we slept on a studio couch in the very large living room , had a cut-down washstand for a side-board , we were given a dining suite , two wardrobes and a dressing table and a Teasmade as wedding presents from family . Saved up for a Dunlopillo bed which cost 40 . My crockery was " scrounged " from my parents . We were buying an electric cooker approx 85 at8 shillings a week and a fridge ( costing 99 18s. 6p ) at 10 shilling and six pence a week , from the electricity board showrooms -- these went on our electricity bill . Our floor covering was lino squares and stained boards . I made bedside rugs from lambskin cut-offs stuck with copydex to hessian . Our only heating a paraffin drip-feed heater in the living room -- paraffin was 2/- a gallon which I fetched from a hardware shop . I made lampshades , curtains , etc . I still have the bills for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding shoes . ( all part of Family History ) My housekeeping money for a week was 3 and we had 1 each per week for paying fares to work , clothes , presents , leisure etc . To celebrate birthdays , etc. , we usually went to an espresso coffee bar where we could buy a half portion of spaghetti bolognese each for 3s 6p. ( 17.5 pence ) . Shopping : Could n't afford to buy chicken which was 4s. 6p. a pound ( 27.5 pence ) same price as butter which we could n't afford either . Mostly bought minced beef at 1s. 8p. a pound , cod 1s. 8p lb and haddock 1s. 10p lb . Halibut was 4s. 6p. , too . I think fillet steak was about 7 s 6p ! We used a lot of eggs -- you could buy mushroom stalks which made a good filling for omelet . Cheddar cheese was about 2/- lb I think . We walked everywhere to save on busfares and went to my parents most Saturdays for High Tea -- my father collected us and took us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk there sometimes . Condoms were 1 shilling each ( no pill ) . I became pregnant ! ! Lived in the one-bedroomed flat till daughter was 3 desperately trying to save a house deposit at 1 a week -- I bought the new Premium Bonds . Eventually had to go to the Bank Manager for a loan to cover legal and moving fees . Our first house a twixt wars , semi cost 1,800 . Should you want more/background/etc .

His then small congregation failed to reconcile having a broke pastor preaching about making money and being rich . <p> Prophet Angel ' s fortunes changed when he relocated to Zimbabwe . He now drives a Bentley and lives a luxurious lifestyle in a leafy part of Harare , a far cry from the struggles in the UK . His rags to riches story has sharply divided opinion in Zimbabwe and beyond . <p> Many who flock to hear him preach and prophesise sing his praises while many others see him as nothing but a smart and smooth man who uses juju to enrich himself .

That 's rare in K-pop and in order for the scene to really hit the mainstream , artisits need to push that idea of celebrity a bit more . <p> continued ... <p> Bands such as Shinee or Girls ' Generation are kind of anonymous , whereas Psy or G-Dragon from Big Bang have emphasised personalities , and that 's why they 've managed to cross over . You can see this happening more and more though . <p> It 's the insane art direction in K-pop music videos that got me addicted to it .

##3112351 <p> Commenting on the new set-up at the Wales Office , which includes Government Whip Stephen Crabb and Baroness Randerson taking on an unpaid role , Owen Smith MP said : <p> ' This is a highly unusual and unsatisfactory state of affairs . It looks to me as though Wales has only been considered at the fag-end of David Cameron 's reshuffle and when they did look at it they found they 'd run out of money for a full-time Junior Minister at the Wales Office , having almost certainly reached the ceiling allowed under the Ministerial and other Salaries Act . <p> " Even before the reshuffle this was already the biggest Government ever with 118 Ministers and whips . Now , as David Cameron has expanded the Cabinet even further it looks set to be bigger still and it will be completely unacceptable if Wales is being asked to pay the price of having lesser representation in Government in order to accommodate others on the Ministerial payroll . <p> " The Government will now need to make clear whether , for example , Ken Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessor , Baroness Warsi , did not , and whether her successor as party Chairman , Grant Shapps MP will be paid in his new role . <p> " The new Secretary of State for Wales wrote recently that in his former post as the Wales Office Junior Minster his duties were so onerous he only had time for ' bed and work ' so he will have to explain how he thinks his new deputies , essentially a part-timer and a volunteer , will be able to adequately represent Wales . <p> " People in Wales will also want to know whether he fought this decision or whether his first

##3112651 <h> Sturgeon named politician of year <p> Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been named The Herald 's Scottish Politician of the Year . <p> Ms Sturgeon was given the honour in recognition of her work on minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of same-sex marriage , as well as her key role in the 2014 independence referendum . It is the second time Ms Sturgeon has scooped the top award - although this year for the first time ever the three shortlisted candidates were all female . <p> The SNP depute leader saw off competition from Labour leader Johann Lamont , who had been nominated for the way she had led her party 's fight back from last year 's Scottish election defeat and Holyrood Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick , who was in the running for her reforms to Holyrood . <p> Collecting the award Ms Sturgeon said : " On a previous occasion when I won an award at this event I forgot to thank my husband . I want to start tonight by thanking Peter , because there have been times over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I spent more time with Michael Moore than I did with my husband . " <p> She added : " I 'm not sure that there are many other countries in the world where they would have a shortlist for Politician of the Year that was all women . We might have a long way to go to achieve true gender equality , but I think Scotland should be proud that we are leading the way . " <p> The judges praised Ms Sturgeon 's handling of the health portfolio for five years , culminating in Holyrood approving legislation to bring in a 50p per unit minimum price for alcohol . She also announced the Scottish Government planned to change the law to legalise same-sex marriage , despite the vocal opposition of some religious leaders , and more recently a cabinet reshuffle has seen her become Secretary for Investment , Infrastructure and Cities , with specific responsibility for the constitution . <p> While Ms Lamont failed to win Politician of the Year , she won the award for political impact after she hit out at Scotland 's " something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as concessionary travel , free personal care for the elderly and free prescriptions for all . <p> Scottish Secretary Michael Moore , who co-signed the Edinburgh Agreement ensuring the referendum will give Scots a straight choice between independence and remaining in the UK , was named Best Scot at Westminster . <p> SNP backbencher Dennis Robertson collected the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year award for making an emotional speech to Holyrood about his daughter 's death from anorexia , while Humza Yousaf was named One to Watch after joining the government at the age of 26 when he became External Affairs and International Development Minister . <p> The Politics in Business award was given for the first time to recognise politicians who have worked with the business community . This went to SNP MP Stewart Hosie and Labour MP Jim McGovern for their joint work to support Dundee 's computer games industry .

##3129750 <p> It was once again a race of differing fortunes for both Sahara Force India drivers today in Korea . Nico Hulkenberg was one of the stars of the race and was able to finish sixth , whilst his team mate Paul di Resta fought on to a twelfth place finish . <p> Hulkenberg was pleased to make progress from his eighth place grid slot and performed one of the overtakes of the season as he managed to pass both McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton and Lotus ' Romain Grosjean around the outside in one corner . <p> " That race was a lot of fun and it 's great to get such a mega result . It was n't easy though , and for most of the race I had the Lotus of Romain Grosjean pushing me and some great battles . Even the first pit-stop was very close with Romain , but the team did a great stop because it was important to stay ahead at that stage , " he said . <p> " I think the best moment of the race was the fight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ahead of both of them in turn four . They both went to the inside so I just saw the opportunity to use the outside line and made the move work . That certainly put a big smile on my face .

" <p> Unfortunately for di Resta , it was a more frustrating afternoon once again for the Scot as he finished outside the points . <p> " A tough race in many ways and it 's fair to say that the result in qualifying hampered us quite badly . We expected the supersoft to be a better race tyre and so we saved it for the second stint .

##3129951 <h> Tuesday 30 October 2012 , 11:54 <p> The American Department Of Justice has filed papers with the US courts arguing that if MegaUpload founder Kim ' Dotcom ' Schmitz relaunches his file-transfer platform next year , as he is currently planning to do , he could put himself in breach of his bail conditions in New Zealand , and might face additional criminal charges . <p> Prosecutors in the States , who are trying to extradite Dotcom and three other former Mega execs , filed new legal papers after the Mega founder announced plans to launch a new file-transfer business that would offer very similar services to the original MegaUpload , which was shut down by the US authorities in January amidst allegations of copyright infringement , money laundering and racketeering . <p> Dotcom says that his new service , to be called Mega , will encrypt files as they are uploaded to his company 's servers . This would , in theory , make it harder for users to help themselves to unlicensed music and movie files stored in other user 's digital lockers , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And that would possibly make the new Mega less likely to become a prolific source of free but illegal music and movie files ( which , US prosecutors argue , was by far the most popular and profitable element of the original MegaUpload ) . <p> Dotcom 's lawyers also reckon that , as the Mega company would n't be able to see what files were stored on its servers once the auto-encryption system is in place , even if the whole thing did become a piracy haven once again ( via the free trading of unlock codes ) , the business itself would n't be able to distinguish between legit and illegitimate files , so could not be held liable for the storage of unlicensed content , as has happened in the criminal case against MegaUpload and its founders in the US . <p> Whatever , it 's not the specific legalities of Mega v2 that the DoJ is currently objecting to , rather the fact that Dotcom is involved in launching a new venture very similar to the one the American authorities shut down back in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after being arrested by the New Zealand authorities at America 's request at the start of the year , Dotcom said he had neither the motivation nor the means to relaunch MegaUpload . <p> Indeed , Techworld has published Dotcom 's exact words from January , when he told the New Zealand courts : " There is no realistic prospect or possibility of restoring the business or recommencing the business having regard to both the seizure of the requisite servers and data storage equipment and to the seizure of all funds , monies and assets held both by MegaUpload and by me personally . Further , it is likely that users would consider any new iteration of MegaUpload as inherently unreliable as it could be subject to a further incident in which the US government takes action to close the site down and thereby prevents users from having legitimate access to their data " . <p> But this month Dotcom has told his Twitter followers how programmers have been busy preparing Mega v2 for launch , how investors are lining up to fund the new business , and how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American authorities ( or prosecutors or judges in any one jurisdiction ) meaning users can be assured their files wo n't disappear overnight . <p> In their court filing last week , the DoJ wrote : " Defense Counsel 's claim that the corporate defendant can and should be allowed to operate undermines the sworn statements of Dotcom that he has no plans or ability to continue to operate or fund the businesses in the indictment during pendency of the extradition process . If defendant Dotcom intentionally misled the court in New Zealand about his intentions and capabilities in order to obtain his release from pre-extradition confinement , it seems Defense Counsel 's representation might endanger Dotcom 's bail situation or even subject him to additional charges " . <p> Perhaps unsurprisingly , the Mega legal team has quickly rejected these new claims by American prosecutors , I think by arguing that the new Mega is sufficiently different from the old MegaUpload to mean the new business can be launched without Dotcom going completely back on his pledge to the New Zealand courts . Legal man Ira Rothken told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technology before they fully investigate it . This looks to be the second time they 're doing that . Kim Dotcom is innocent , and he 's entitled to be involved in technology and business " . <h> MegaUpload founder Kim ' Dotcom ' Schmitz is due back in court in Auckland tomorrow as the US authorities try to appeal the previously reported decision to bail the Mega man . As ... <h> MegaUpload boss Kim ' Dotcom ' Schmitz will be back in court tomorrow in another bid to secure bail , according to the AFP . A legal rep for the larger than life Mega ... <p> http : //www.wirenews.co/ WireNews+Co <p> Not sure how this is the business of any US authority . Surely the conditions of bail in NZ would be the remit of NZ authorities and I suspect they would be able to determine if Kim Dotcom has breached his bail conditions . I suspect they

##3130450 <h> Behind The Headlines <h> After yet another week in which our national politics bore rather more resemblance to a slow-motion car crash than one would really like , Bibi van der Zee decides to get to the bottom of things . <p> ' Energyshambles ' begs the question what 's really going on ? <p> Leaving aside Cameron 's defeat on Europe ( never been a good look for a Tory leader ) , ash dieback ( too depressing to even think about ) and the comments by the wonderful Dame Helen Ghosh -- at one point the most senior woman in the civil service and now the new director of the National Trust - that Cameron has a " clique " and that women tend not to thrive in Old Etonian cliques ( although I 'd be happy to just repeat that , over and over again , like tory party tiling ) , most policy watchers were actually pretty bemused to see energyshambles , as it is now fondly known , hitting the headlines again . <p> Even as the Daily Mail and Guardian argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to all wind farms before being told off by the secretary of State , Paul Waugh , editor of PoliticsHome , mused on Twitter ; " It takes a particular kind of political genius to give a second showing in a fortnight . " <p> But how has this happened ? Why did David Cameron sack the apparently popular Charles Hendry and bring in anti-wind John Hayes instead , leading to a row that surely any half sane person could have seen coming a mile off ? Did n't the CBI tell the government to sort itself out and get its energy policy organised ? I , like most people , was under the impression that the CBI ran the country . <p> So what is going on ? In my quest for enlightenment ( you do n't work for Satish Kumar without picking this sort of phrase up ) I emailed all my favourite energy and politics wonks and promised them anonymity if they would tell me their favourite conspiracy theories for energyshambles . They kindly responded . And so , in no particular order ... the main theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chancellor wanted him out so that he could carry on with his Dash-for-Gas . Hendry , my industry expert mate points out , has been working on energy for six years now and has far more expertise than most politicians in this area . The fact that he ( and Greg Barker and Ed Davey too ) are all enthusiastic about renewables is based on empirical evidence of their usefulness . But the Chancellor just lurves gas ... <p> - Another theory about Hendry , however , is that actually perhaps he had made a right mess of the energy bill ? Although he 's much loved by the industry , perhaps number 10 looked at the bill over the summer and realised that it is -- as it is -- a terrible mess and felt that Hendry had messed up ? " There is some credibility in this when you actually look at the bill and realise how many problems there still are with it , " says one observer . " But it is also very strange as the single best person to try and finalise it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one minister who really understood it -- Hendry . " <p> - What about John Hayes ? Why on earth was he chosen for the job ? One theory is that Cameron is simply politically stupid and " truly thought that by adding an anti-wind , pro-gas and pro-nuke junior minister like Hayes he 'd create ' balance ' at DECC ( Department of Energy and Climate Change ) and get Osborne and all the Tory anti-renewables people off his back . Now , what he actually gets is an embarrassing cat fight , which makes the government look untrustworthy to energy investors of all stripes . " <p> With this theory , Hayes was not supposed to make too much actual difference - simply please the right-wingers and keep everybody happy . But obviously , if this was THE PLAN , then it has all gone horribly horribly wrong , with Hayes making the front page of the Mail and Telegraph within weeks of getting into the job . At least one expert sees this as just a terrible miscalculation . " Hayes was meant to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a victim of his own ' success ' . His comments were worthy of a few column inches on page 5 , but were hardly Front Page News . His stated comments should jeopardise his position as a Minister -- they certainly marginalise him in the Department -- but will have no impact on Coalition policy . " <p> But is that right ? Or was there a more devious agenda at work ? <p> Cameron is " rumoured to have told John Hayes to ' deliver a win for our people on wind farms ' " . Was he supposed to defeat the whole wind agenda ? A few people are wondering if the whole thing was cooked up to undermine onshore wind altogether . And one expert points out that Hayes does have a hold over Cameron , because he has delivered him the Cornerstone group -- an ultra-conservative group of politicians whose website promises : Faith , Flag and Family . <p> According to this pundit , the most worrying thing is that " The more you look at it , the more clear it becomes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Major managed to win an election and 
##3130451 <h> Pricing Nature <h> The neo-liberal takeover of environmentalism is not a paradigm but a confidence trick , warns Paul Evans <p> If environmentalism can be said to have soul , this is where we fight for it <p> There were very few butterflies around last summer . Although I saw plenty of meadow browns , they 're dull and nowhere near as exciting as many other species , which have been absent . I feel this physically and emotionally ; it has affected my wellbeing so I think I deserve compensation . If I compare my feelings about the loss of butterflies to an injury I sustained in a traffic accident , I 'd say it 's worth about 1,500 . No butterflies = a pain in the neck . <p> Water , air , food , aesthetic quality , wildlife : the ecosystem does indeed provide me and everyone else with services we value greatly , and I appreciate they carry a cost . There are many academics and institutions working on what the environmental journalist George Monbiot described in a recent article for The Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " green infrastructure " , and biodiversity and habitat " asset classes " within an " ecosystem market " . <p> There are people working on toolkits to identify and describe ecosystem services . Thus they are creating markets from methods of valuation for these things , and economic instruments through which ecosystems can be both exploited and protected through pricing . My problem is that my willingness to accept the market approach is coloured by the opinion that it 's stupid , irresponsible nonsense . The neo-liberal takeover of environmentalism is not a paradigm but a confidence trick , perpetrated by market forces and supported by complicit environmentalists more interested in corporate goals than in anything as antiquated as Nature . As such , it will crumble if enough pressure is applied by those prepared to articulate intrinsic value in Nature and the kind of care that stands up as advocate , rather than stands in as manager . <p> This requires a cultural project that explores value , not price , and socio-economic alternatives to the market-driven commodification of Nature : a job for the truth and reconciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ecologist . If environmentalism can be said to have soul , this is where we fight for it . <p> It 's hard to pinpoint the time when markets bought the environment . Perhaps it happened through a manipulation of language and ideas during the ' green bubble ' of the late 1980s and early 1990s . A public awareness of environmental issues within a burgeoning market-driven politics and a desire of environmentalists to become a professional class with an identity makeover fuelled a green movement eager to work with anyone to achieve common goals . <p> When the bubble burst , that space was flooded by climate-change anxiety ; its landscape littered with confused and badly articulated notions around sustainability , biodiversity and natural capital ; its principles swept aside by a naive pragmatism , which became a kind of ideology that supported market intervention and a funding-obsessed managerial culture . Like many people involved at the time , I have to shoulder some responsibility for this . <p> Language is crucial in linking experience of Nature with both a fear of it and a fear for it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like from the Nature we do n't like . This resource conservation is Nature management for humans , and perhaps a consequence of ecology 's use of the language of economics to interpret natural processes -- competition , energy expenditure , strategy , and so on . <p> This view of the world allowed a business model to get a toehold from which it largely took over . But if this has slipped way down the political greasy pole of priorities , then other forms of conservation with an Arcadian tendency and an antipathy to market forces and corporate structures are almost unheard of today . I want to join with others to change this . <p> The opportunity to reinvigorate the environmental movement following the financial crisis appears closed off by the headless running around of governments , institutions and organisations desperate to conserve a threatened reality . Those of us who want something else must find the courage to stand up for Nature with a language that refuses business-speak and instead articulates ideas that grow from intimate experience of Nature . <p> I lied about the butterflies . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't think meadow browns are dull and of less importance . I think they 're dark and underworldly and that they inhabit those priceless , seedier places of late summer and I take heart from them as I take heart from being able to write this here and now . <p> Paul Evans is a Nature writer , a radio broadcaster and a lecturer in creative writing at Bath Spa University .

A murmur of voices , the buzz of the fly and sigh from me . <p> Slowly he got out of the car and walked with my mum to the arena gate . I watched but stayed motionless , lowering my head even more . His eyes are dull and full of pain , his shoulders hunched up and his fists clenched .... the pain and stress emanating from him so easy to feel . <p> The man was stocky , not much taller than my mum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fear , the anger , the mental anguish as a 1000 thoughts rushed through his mind and his body and I can feel every emotion within him . <p> Tentatively he walked closer to me , my mum kept her energy and body language low , I could feel her send soothing energy to us both . <p> He wanted to run .... why was he so scared of me ? Then I realise .... no he 's not scared of me .... he 's scared of life , of living , of his past , his present and his future -- I want to help him , to reach him , to let him know that I understand -- I have been where he is , and my mum rescued me , its my turn to help him . <p> He stood close and I sighed again , then gently I moved a few steps away , and lay down in the soft grass of the arena . I rolled and swished , and the man just watched .... confused , angry , and then I lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? " he asked ...... " He 's showing you it 's ok to feel vulnerable -- you can kneel beside him if you like and rub him all over . " <p> I waited , and closed my eyes , my breathing deep and even . Slowly the man knelt beside me and tentatively rubbed my neck . Soon both hands were stroking and rubbing me ....... " I 'm sorry " he whispered , " I am so sorry for everything I have done " ......... tears pouring down his face , falling on my neck ..... he buries his face in my neck and I lie as still as I can waiting . <p> My mum kneels beside me comforting and reassuring both of us .... this level of emotion and grief is intense , but I wait , as I know I am needed right here , right now . As his tears subside , he kneels up and smiles , his eyes are bright , he is more relaxed . " I needed that " he murmurs . <p> Slowly I get to my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains kneeling , and the man begins to talk , releasing and healing .

##3141652 <h> City Hall protest over miscarriage death <h> A protest and vigil has been held in Belfast on Thursday evening , after the death of a pregnant woman who was refused an abortion in Galway - as against the hospital staff . <p> We 're sorry . This video is unavailable from your location . <p> Vigils for Savita <p> Analysis <p> Savita Halappanavar , a 31-year-old dentist , was 17 weeks pregnant when she died in Galway University Hospital last month from septicaemia brought on by a miscarriage . <p> Her husband Praveen had claimed his wife pleaded with doctors to perform a medical termination , but they denied her requests because the baby 's heartbeat was present . <p> He further claims the couple were told : " This is a Catholic country . " <p> The protest in Belfast city centre came a day after 2,000 people gathered outside the Dil in Dublin to demand Government reform of abortion laws in the Republic of Ireland . <p> To deny women a choice fails to recognise medical and societal realities . Government must not fail society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aisling Gallagher , NUS-USI <p> Activist Virginia Santini told UTV that call was being echoed north of the border . <p> " Tonight really is to show our anger and to show our support for our fellow pro-choice activists in the South who are also campaigning on this issue and to say that we need change , " she said . <p> " We need abortion reform and we also need clarity on the Health Minister regarding when an abortion can be given in terms when it could save a woman 's life . " <p> Authorities in the Republic have launched two investigations into Ms Halappanavar 's death , which has reignited the debate on both sides of the border as to when a termination can be carried out . <p> Current laws in both jurisdictions only permit abortions to go ahead if the mother 's life is at risk or if there 's a serious threat to her long-term health . <p> But calls have been made for greater clarity when it comes to the guidelines . <p> Stormont Health Minister Edwin Poots says he is currently taking advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Ireland . A date has yet to be set for their release . <p> I want to give the family certainty as quickly as possible and not left in limbo for a moment longer than necessary . I want the findings of this to stand up to the scrutiny of the world . <p> Dr James Reilly , Irish Minister for Health <p> Meanwhile , the Master of the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin has said it 's unclear in the Republic exactly when doctors can sanction an abortion . <p> " The area of difficulty really is in the grey areas , where we are not quite sure of outcome of the certain disorder or the disease , we are dealing with probabilities , we are dealing with potentials , " Rhona Mahoney told UTV . <p> " So we are not dealing with certainty and that 's the difficulty we have .

##3693150 <h> Magnificent Frigate Birds : Up Close and Personal <p> September 6 , 2012 <p> BVI has one of the largest breeding colonies in the region of magnificent frigate birds . Last week I got a chance to visit the colony . <p> The colony is on Great Tobago , a 263 acre island to the west of Jost van Dyke , which is a National Park . I went there with Susan Zaluski from the Jost Van Dykes Preservation Society and with some local fishermen , who have been visiting the island for many years . Getting onto Great Tobago is not straightforward , as there is no dock . But fortunately we chose a wonderful day , with bright sunshine and calm seas , so the fishing boat we were on was able to drop us in a small bay to the west of the island , from where we hiked overland to the frigate bird colony . <p> Looking west from Great Tobago : Little Tobago is in the foreground , St Thomas ( USVI ) can be seen on the horizon . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the birds nesting in the trees below us . It was amazing to see just how many there were and how close to each other the nests were . In addition to the magnificent frigate birds , there were also large numbers of brown booby , which nest not in trees , but on the ground . Above our heads hundreds of birds were in the air , including many male frigate birds with their throat pouches inflated in a spectacular red display to attract the females . What a wonderful sight ! <p> Male frigate bird with enlarged throat <p> As we moved down the far side of the island and entered the colony , we realised that the birds were not frightened of us . So we were able to get very near to the them , many of whom remained on their nests as we approached . It was a real privilege to be see such beautiful creatures up close and personal . <p> A nesting female magnificent frigate bird <p> The reason for my visit was to find out more about a project being taken forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jost Van Dykes Preservation Society and the UK 's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) and Food &; Environment Research Agency ( FERA ) . The project is designed to preserve the habitat of the frigate birds by removing the feral goat population on the island . Over the last few years , many of the trees in which the birds nest have been lost to storms . As the trees have gone , the soil has become eroded and land-slips have occurred , taking more trees down with them . And it is impossible for new trees to grow because the young shoots are eaten by the goats . So only if the goats are removed can the trees regenerate . Experts from the UK and BVI will be collaborating on how best to take this forward . <p> Landslip on Great Tobago <p> Another threat to the birds is monofilament fishing line . Fishermen in the area sometimes use live bait . The frigate birds see the bait moving in the water and dive on it , entangling themselves in the line . The fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unfortunately they take the line with them back to their nests and it becomes entangled in the trees , threatening not only the bird which was originally caught in it , but also nearby young and other adult birds . The Jost Van Dykes Preservation Society has done a great job clearing the old line with the support of the RSPB , but this is an ongoing problem and will need constant monitoring . <p> Brown booby on Great Tobago <p> The National Parks Trust , which has just celebrated its 50th anniversary , do a marvellous job in preserving and protecting the beautiful natural environment of the BVI . Non-governmental organisations like the Jost Van Dykes Preservation Society provide tremendous support and do much of the leg-work . But there will often be value in partnering with organisations outside the BVI that have relevant expertise and sometimes funding . The work being done to protect the magnificent frigate bird colony on Great Tobago is an excellent example of such cooperation . It was great to

##3693451 <h> October 09 , 2012 <h> Linguistic and culture : two arguments against the an Europeanisation of contract law <p> The Europeanisation of contract law is an enterprise of the European Commission about creating an European contract law . If the creation of a contract law for the Europe is n't criticised itself , the elaboration of European Civil Code , which is seen as the final aim of this enterprise , is subject to controversy . The issue is n't about the law itself . The issue is about the creation of a legal monument representing the Europe . In this way that seems impossible according to certain persons . <p> One of the argument , developed by Grard Cornu is that the creation of an European Civil Code could n't be possible because it 's a problem of linguistic . French law can only be the daughter of the French language . It means that not a law , but a code , as the legal monument of a community , can be created only for people using the same language , and at least sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , an European Civil Code is impossible . We can ask if this argument is reliable . The French Civil Code has inspired all of the civil law country around the world , especially in Europe . Because it is an example of unity , it had inspired the German civil code ( BGB ) . In Germany , the code had permitted the unity of the nation , united around the law . And not the opposite . Why the French civil code could n't be the start of an European legal unity ? Maybe is the concept of European legal unity itself which is controverted . <p> An other argument , of Pierre Legrand , against the creation of a Civil Code is based on the linguistic and the culture of the EU 's member . Because the law is created by the society , and not the society by the law , the legislative instrument is soaked of the society 's aspiration . The history , the psychology , wrote Pierre Legrand , can explain the legal system of a country . The French Civil Code is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not be copied for others country . An European Civil Code could be seen as a domination of the civilian society on the common law community . Europe can not impose to common law countries a legal system at the opposite of them .

##3698250 <p> Wigan Athletic have received a boost with the news that midfielder Ben Watson 's injury is not as bad as initially had been feared and it is hoped that he could be back in training in as little as six weeks . <p> Watson , who has suffered a confirmed fractured shin , will not need to undergo surgery on the injury which he picked up as his side lost 3-0 to Liverpool at the weekend . <p> Speaking about the injury , manager Roberto Martinez said <p> " It 's still a very serious injury and we need to ensure that Ben is given all the time that he needs to make a full recovery . The good news is that he wo n't be out for as long as we initially thought and , with the character that Ben has , he will be able to deal with such an injury .

So I wave the flag in my head ( well , errr ? ? ) , while actually being busy on all kinds of other things . <p> It 's the last week of term and let me inflict on you what my uni day has been , before we get on to our royal family . This is partly for those very few readers of this blog who might be under the impression that we academics do n't work hard enough . . . <h> November 24 , 2012 <p> I just did my third talk in A Point of View ( one more to go , to write this weekend ... ) about the plaster casts of Pompeii , which was sparked off by the conference at the Getty I went to last weekend and the show at the Getty Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> As I 've said before it is weird how long it takes to write a 10 minute radio talk ( somehow , it 's in your head all week ) . But , on the other hand , it always turns out that you do nt have time to get in all you wanted to . ( Well , of cource not , it 's only 10 minutes . ) <p> This week I was particularly sad not to be able to name check the extraordinary broadcast by Matthew Halton for CBC , which is actually a live commentary on the Battle of Pompeii in 1943 ( pretty early on in the battle , as he says at one point that the ancient city is still relatively unscathed ... in the end it took the hit of more than 160 allied bombs ) . For me this is the second most moving account of the destruction of Pompeii , after that of Pliny the Younger . You can listen here ( really worth it ! ) . <h> November 21 , 2012 <p> I havent actually confessed yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reviews to come out next Spring from Profile -- almost certainly called Confronting the Classics ( we 've been through quite a lot of titles and that one seems to please the most , and to be faithful to the contents ) . And barring an afterword and preface and linking passages ( OK a good couple of days work there , but never mind ) .. I 've finished and pressed the button about five minutes ago . <p> Have a foul cold ( caught on the airplane to Los Angeles , how else ? ) and am more knackered than I like to think ... but I can sort of tick the job off . ( I count ticking the job off as reaching the point where if you dropped down dead someone woud be able to finish it and still put your name on the cover ) . <p> What 's amazing is that , even with something approaching a compilation , it still takes ages and ages to get done . Think of a number of weeks , then treble it . <h> November 17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake to go to a conference in the middle of term ... all the more so when that conference is on the other side of the planet . But when you say ' yes ' , it 's months in advance , and you somehow fantasise that it will be a nice little break in a slightly warmer climate . At that point , you havent quite worked out that it will mean almost as many hours in a plane as you are at the conference . <p> So here I am again in Los Angeles , writing this at 5.00 am ( and trying NOT to adjust to California time , made more difficult by the fact that all a cabin crew want you to do on a long flight is go to sleep : more booze , lights off , blinds down , heating up -- and you 're out for the count ) . <p> But in this case the conference really WAS irresistible , because it is all connected with an exhibition at the Getty Villa on the modern legacy of Pompeii . I had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , and if I did n't come now , I would miss it entirely . Besides I am not down to give a paper , but to " respond " at the end of the day . ( In truth an ambiguous advantage : it means you do nt have to write a paper , but it means that you have to stay awake and sharp -- so you have something worthwhile to say . No dropping off , Beard . ) <h> November 14 , 2012 <p> You know you are getting to be an elderly academic when you start getting asked to give out prizes at school ( to be honest you also know that you are thought of as someone who might go down well , might give a decent mini-speech and not be wholly ridiculous in front of the kids and Mums and Dads .... " elderly but a bit sexy " seems to hit the nail on the head ) . <p> Anyway I went to Swavesey Village College on Monday , where I had a great time and is obviously a great school ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back all those " speech day/prize giving memories " from way back . <p> I said to the audience on Monday that I did nt remember anything that had been said at any of the occasions I attended as a kid . That wasnt actually quite true . I do remember when John Ferguson ( who was Professor of Classics at the OU ) , and he gave a tub thumping left wing speech to the rather proper burghers of Shrewsbury , ending up with " No Man Is An Island " ... which I of course loved . But I thought it might all seem a bit pious in the early 21st century ( young Beard thrills to John Donne ) , so I drew a veil over it . <p> I did mention one speech though , that I heard at my son 's school about 15 years ago ... <h> November 09 , 2012 <p> I fetched up this morning at the new wing of Broadcasting House to do my Point of View recording ( just next to the Old Broadcasting House and where most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It was the first time I had been there in daylight . . . and the first time I had had a good look around . <p> Parts of the building are extremely elegant , and there are wonderful vertiginous vistas through glass from upper floors to the ground . And it 's a great match for the old Broadcasting House . What is more , good or bad , anyone who think that BBC staff work in the lap of spacious luxury could well take a look round the packed " open plan " offices . ( Not sure who chose the carpets though ... some of the retro orange was a bit blood-curdling . ) <p> But what caught my eye even more was the art work in the piazza outside . It 's called WORLD by Mark Pimlott , and it is simply a series of lines of latitude and longitude set in the pavement , plus a series of place names . <h> November 07 , 2012 <p> I heard sometime in the middle of the night ( we 'd left the radio on ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he really had won , Romney had conceded etc . I went back to sleep with a certain pleasure , or rather relief that I wouldnt have to be living on planet Romney . <p> And this morning it is hard to forget the lingering pleasure . Even " Thought for the Day " was an Obama broadcast . ( I wondered what the nice rabbl would have said if Romney had won ... did he have two scripts ready ? Or did he write it all in an hour ? You can listen here . ) <p> So joy all round , but not without a few wry reflections . <p> First , what is it about American politicians that means they have constantly to bang on about how the USA is the greates nation in the world ? In truth Obama 's ' accession speech ' ( as the Romans would have called it ) had some good bits in it , as those speeches go ( democracy being messy etc ) . But it still had quite a lot of the ' top nation ' stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria are for the world 's greatest country ? ( I mean , why not Norway ? ) And that maybe part of the trouble in the world is that Americans are being brought up constantly being told that they are the greatest , simply by being American ? ( Usually -- as with the Roman empire -- top nation actually means , as Obama came close to saying , ' most fire power ' ... and that certainly excludes Norway . ) <h> November 03 , 2012 <p> It 's not really clear what is going to make a bookshop successful into the 21st century against the competition of Amazon etc . There was the rush to the " in-store coffee shop " a few years ago , but that did nt save Borders . And anyway the coffee shop is always going to take up space where you might have books , and that is the beginning of the slippery slope . <p> It 's probably a much better idea to move in the Literary Festival direction . I have done a number of bookshop events of that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topping of Ely ) . But today Heffers did a whole day Classics festival , which was free and booked out . In fact the ting had been so popular that they had to move it to the Union Society to fit more people in . <p> This is not the place for me to put the record on about inportant local bookshops are . OK I use Amazon sometimes , but if we all buy all our books from Amazon , we 'll wake up one day and find we do nt have a local bookshop .. and we wont like that . <h> October 31 , 2012 <p> Most of us have forgotten ( or never noticed ) that we have elections coming up for our " local " police and crime commissioners on November 15 . I have never honestly been convinced that the election of a ( well paid ) P &CC; will do much for the democratic deficit in policing policy . <p> In fact -- problems though there may have been with the old local Police Authorities , now being abolished -- they seemed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were elected councillors , and the fact that they were a group of people rather than an individual meant that they could easily represent different interest groups within the local community , and different areas within the authority . <p> Besides , I 'm not sure I like the idea of my Chief Constable being sackable by a single elected official ( as the info websites seem to imply , but I ca n't quite believe is true ) . And I am fairly certain that we shall not be paying any less for the new " men " ( and they will mostly be men ) at the top . Look , for example , what is happening in Devon and Cornwall , where there has already been a c50k a year job advertised for a media manager for the lucky new P &CC.; <p> Anyway , my choices now are between a ) vote for one of the candidates in Cambridgeshire ; b ) spoil my ballot paper ( on the grounds that women should always vote in some form , to give thanks to those who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up when it comes through the door . <p> The local candidates , I have to say , are not a particularly inspiring bunch . <h> October 28 , 2012 <p> One side benefit of having young kids is that you sometimes have to do something else other than work at the weekend . That may be a rather rosy-tinted view of time management with toddlers and a job -- but there is something to be said for being forced to load the nippers into a car at the weekend and take them out to see something improving/fun ( for a start , it means that you get to see it too ) . <p> Once that stage has gone , for me at any rate , weekends get entirely taken up with work just like any other day of the week -- unless you have someone to stay . And then you can go out to see " something improving/fun " again . Which is what we have just done , with our South Sudanese friend Samuel , who is here to stay . <p> In fact we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Home Farm and Rare Breeds Centre where we often used to go with the kids 20 years or so ago . <p> Now the last time I went to a local National Trust stately home ( Ickworth ... I 'm not including Roman Chedworth here ) , I was pretty incandescent ; and said so pretty frankly on the blog ( I couldnt stand the faked up kitchens ) . So credit where credit is due , let me say that Wimpole Hall was almost faultless in touristic terms . <p> It 's a great house , partly done over by John Soane in the late eighteenth century -- and he put in the most wonderful plunge bath ( above , the view from the bath ! ) and a stunning " Yellow Drawing Room " . They 'd be worth the trip on their own ( built for the filthy rich or not , they are ace ) . <p> But more than that , the whole display got it just right . These I reckon were the touristic/heritage plus points : <p> 1 ) There were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they did n't want you to sit down on something , they had just put a bit of pot pourri ( vel sim ) on the chair , and you got the message . <p> 2 ) In the great Yellow Drawing Room -- the Soane bit -- the ceiling and dome are fantastic , but you do need to look up . So there were some rough old cushions on the floor , and you could lie down and do just that . No messing , no signs saying " lie down here " .. again , you saw the cushions and got the point . <p> 3 ) In the Long Gallery -- used as a ballroom -- there was music . You heard it as you approached , and rather assumed it was piped . Actually when you arrived there was someone playing the piano , real live . <p> 4 ) The volunteers in the rooms were all spot on , by which I mean they knew their stuff and quckly recognised when you knew yours . I cant bear going to those places ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you ask about some image of ( say ) Artemis on the wall , and you get treated to the pre-prepared lecture on ancient gods and goddesses being different from " our " God . You ca n't be nasty and say " Look sunshine , this is what I did my PhD on " , so you shut up and get to feel crosser and crosser . At Wimpole , none of the volunteers treated us to a lecture on what we knew about , and all were helpful on what we did nt . <p> 5 ) When we got upstairs to a room about the history of the house , they had printed out , and bound , some of the key articles on the place from Apollo and the Burlington Magazine etc , so you could sit down and read . OK , someone might in theory have walked off with them -- but in practice who would ( and so what ) ? <p> 6 ) Most of the stuff in the now regulation " downstairs " area also appeared to be from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riled me about Ickworth was that most of the kitchen stuff on display to reconstruct the authentic atmosphere seemed to have been bought off ebay . That was true of some of the kitchen display at Wimpole ( I do nt believe that the last occupants left the packet of Lux flakes behind ) . But there were some surprising bona fide items . We looked suspiciously at a large pile of suitcases , but indeed they did carry the label of Elsie Bambridge ( the last , pre National Trust owner ) . <p> Pretty much full marks I thought . The attached Home Farm was a bit of a different story , however -- but also with its definite plus points . <h> October 24 , 2012 <p> I am in Brussels for a week , grading ERC fellowship applications . Do not for a minute imagine that this is a glamorous jaunt , enlivened by evenings of moules frites and Belgian beer . The working day " at the office " ( above ) is 8.30 to 6.30 ish , and the evening is spent in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room-service pizza or lasagne . Have n't been within a spitting distance of a restaurant since I arrived ( though we are all going to a dinner at the Crowne Plaza tonight for a " social " -- 37 each , including two glasses on wine each , if you want to know the details of ERC hospitality and uprightness : it 's no gravy train ) . <p> Anyway , this regime has given me ample opportunity to reflect on what I carry with me . Leaving aside the tootbrush and a couple of spare pairs of leggings and tights , it 's all electronic AND TANGLES OF FLEXES . <p> I 've got the laptop , and the mobile phone , a camera ( in case I want to immortalise the " social " ) and a kindle ( in the unlikely event of having five minutes to spend with Hilary Mantel ) . OK , none of that is too bulky , but each one has to have its flex and plug into the eletricity source , or its battery charger . And each one needs an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt know if anyone else has noticed this , but euro adaptors come in two slighty different sizes , with slightly thicker or thinner prongs -- and the slightly thicker ones can be next to impossible to jam into slightly thinnner sockets . Result : to be on the safe side you need more adaptors than you think . ) <p> Anyway , what this means is the my hotel room is filled with plastic all over the floor , and my shoulder back carries half of it to and from the office each day . <h> October 21 , 2012 <p> I caught a snatch of Any Questions yesterday ; someone ( I think it might have been Sally Bercow ) was saying words to the effect of " transparency is always a good thing " -- presumably in the context of whether Prince Charles 's letters to government ministers should be made public . <p> I am not sure what I think about that partcular teaser . My gut reaction is to think that even people in power ought to be able to write things to each other that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down for fear of disclosure , they 'll do exactly the same business on the phone or over dinner and then no evidence will be left and no-one will ever know . <p> But what really struck me was how people get fixated on the " right to know " , at the expense of much bigger and more important questions . If we are going to have a king -- then I guess I 'm prepared to let him , when heir to the the throne , write to government ministers privately . I 'd much rather that people got worked up about whether we should have a king at all , or at least whether the structures of the monarchy as now defined deliver to us what we want . Just knowing what he wrote does n't make a blind bit of difference to that big issue . You 'd never actually be able to pin any decision to his influence anyway . <p> I 've fought for disclosure on all kinds of things , and information that the powers that be think we cant be trusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably a bad time to be writing this . But , unfashionable as it is to say , we do appear to have forgotten that sometimes not knowing things can actually be useful . Some things are usefully confidential . <p> It always strikes me at this time of year , when the uni applications for next year have come in . In days gone by ( presumably back in the Dark Ages before the data-protection act ) , the school references for candidates were confidential , between the head and the university ; the kids did nt get access to them . Now they are entirely open to both the applicant and their parents . And they are much less useful in the selection process , for obvious reasons . <p> I know all the good motves for the change ( apart from the long arm of the data protection act ) . The relationship between pupil and school should be such that nothing that is said should come as a surprise to the applicant . If there are mistakes in the reference , then it is only right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etc etc . In fact , when I got my job aged almost 30 , back in my old college , one of the first things I did was rummage through the old files and dig out my head teacher 's reference . <h> October 17 , 2012 <p> I have been spending every spare moment that I have ( and there are n't many , I promise you ) trying to get the first draft of my Roman laughter book finished . I have done the most difficult bit -- that is writing about the theory and method of studying Roman laughter . When I did the lectures on which the book is based , I did nt do very much on that kind of stuff , or rather I dropped it in from time to time , rather than treating it in any systematic way . There is nothing worse than going to a series of lectures and finding that in Lecture One the lecturer draws his or her breath and tell you all about the methodological underpinnings and problems of what they are about to do ... but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is . <p> That 's fine for lectures , but not I think for the-book-of-the-lectures . Laughter is a particularly tricky area in history . It 's history 's final frontier in a way ... raising in the acutest form I can imagine all those basic issues of historical knowledge , the familiarity/difference of people in the past etc . So you ca n't just shelve all that -- and , even if you 're writing about the Romans , you ca n't simply duck all those questions about what Aristotle did or did n't mean when he wrote about laughter ( I mean some Romans read a lot of Aristotle and whatever he had to say was part of Roman culture , as well as Greek ) . And that takes you into another vast bibliography . . . <p> But the rhetorical problems in the book still have something in common with the rhetorical problems of the lectures . Does the reader really want to sit down and slog through a load of theoretical prolegomena before they actually meet a Roman laughing ? Of course they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrate some important ( well , I think it 's important ) theory and method into some good and compelling Roman examples . In fact I start from a wonderful story where the historian Dio is sitting in the Colosseum and the emperor Commodus ( who is playing at being a gladiator and beast hunter ) comes over and waves the head of a decapitated ostrich at the senators , as if to say " you next " . Dio explains that he can hardly stop himself laughing , but knows that would be dangerous ... so he plucks a leaf from the wreath on his head and chews on it . <h> October 11 , 2012 <p> I mentioned in my last post that we had read a bit of Juvenal Satires 10 ( Johnson 's " The Vanity of Human Wishes " ) in our Cheltenham Festival gig . The whole idea of the Satire is to question what really matters in the world , and to ask how far standard human aspirations ( power , wealth etc ) are worth aspiring to . It now turns out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times than we might have thought . <p> The section we concentrated on was about the very nasty henchman of the emperor Tiberius , Sejanus . . . it 's here in Latin from line 56 , and here in English . <p> Juvenal 's " joke " is about the fall of Sejanus and the way his statue was pulled down when he was overturned -- a nice bronze work of art , destroyed by the revolutionary people , melted down and turned into frying pans and piss pots . As Llew said , Juvenal is great here , in mixing up the high and low language : the great epic statue and its language is turned into the language and vessels of the street ( Sejanus becomes a matella or a sartago ... a pot and a frying pan ) . <p> But , as Llew also pointed out , Juvenal is being more complicated . Because , as Juvenal says in the poem , Sejanus whose statue was being gleefully pulled down , had been worshipped by the very people who were now destroying him ( adoratum populo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke is on us .. because " we " ( that is the Roman people ) were those who elevated the guy , with our misplaced adoration , in the first place . <p> And that is where it gets us with Savile . We are guilty of exactly what Juvenal points at : the very people who stupidly elevated him are now dragging him down . <h> October 10 , 2012 <p> Last weekend , I hoofed it to Cheltenham Literary Festival . The prime objective was to be junior partner , with Peter Stothard and Llew Morgan , in the third of our " How to read a Latin poem " gigs at the festival ... and by Latin , I mean Latin , in Latin . <p> This year we did an epigram of Martial and a couple of passages of Juvenal ( from Satires 3 and 10 ) . And , let 's brag a bit , we had a full house of 330 people , actually enjoying the real Latin -- and they were of all ages from 15- to 75+ . Quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or so . <p> That was in the morning . In the evening , I had a fun discussion with Natalie Haynes about classics , blogging and All in a Don 's Day ; then a discussion about " What is a University For ? " Why , oh why , do politicians who should know better -- Lord Adonis in this case -- always kick off with a bit of Oxbridge bashing , as if there were only two universities in this country , and then move on to brag about their own achievements ( in Adonis 's case it was the " Teach First " scheme , which I much admired until it was sound bited into the discussion with minimal relevance at every possible opportunity , then tweeted ... counter suggestible , moi ? ) <p> But between Juvenal and talking to Natalie , Llewelyn and I zoomed out with one of the generous National Trust curators to have a fresh look at Chedworth Roman Villa . I had been there moons ago ( I think the last time was c. 1973 ) and sort of remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposed water shrine just outside the main building area . But it had recently been done up , and ( unusually with these things ) done up for the better . <h> October 05 , 2012 <p> Yesterday evening I had a party for all the 20 or so Classics students at Newnham , undergraduates and grads ( and a few fellows ) . We had some nice glasses of prosecco and orange juice , and a good chat ... and I came home after a couple of hours to think about how the class of 2012 was different from the class of 1984 . ( Do n't worry ladies , I 'm not going to embarrass you .. ! ) <p> It 's easy to dump on the students of 2012 versus those of " our " generation ( whenever than might be ) . And it 's true that there are differences and downsides . Many of them , for example , have had a lot less time than we had to work out about how you learn on your own . People my age remember having loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 16 or so . Whether that 's better than doing PSE , and whether we really did use the time to read rather than have a quick fag behind the bike shed , I am not sure -- but there was the beginning of a sense of independent learning and time management in our apparently free time , and it was a good prepraration for uni . <p> But it was n't that which struck me as we caroused ( modestly ) last night . I came home thinking how much had changed in 25 years ( despite what you hear about how Oxbridge is stuck in the past ) . For a start , we now have in college a much more mixed undergraduate and graduate community . At the party we had 4 grads there -- doing Masters courses and PhD's. 30 years ago , when I did my PhD , we grads were pretty much invisible , perhaps one every other year . The community was really an undergrad affair . <h> October 01 , 2012 <p> As a woman who is rather down on rowimg ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from their books ... ) , I am surprised that I have just bought two bits of Cambridge rowing memorabilia ( or are they ? ) / <p> At our favourite local auction house last weekend , we had spotted two rather pretty mahogany chairs , each one painted with the logo of " St John 's College Rowing Club " , plus the name of the cox , dates 1896 and 1897 , and on one the triumphant phrase " bumped Kings " . <p> We reckoned they would go for a bit more money than we had , so did n't put in a bid . But on Sunday night we discovered they had not been sold , so bought them for the reserve price . ( OK 400 was still more than we had , but it was the husband 's birthday ( which we had hardly celebrated ) and I had just got a little royalty cheque -- so why not , eh ? ) <p> They are now installed in the front room , and very handsome they are . <p> But the two ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled , if not downright suspicious , about the historicity of this pair . Why ? <h> September 29 , 2012 <p> I mean sat navs are great when you are on your own , trying to get to a destination you do n't know in some busy central city . How many times have I been on my way to talk at a school , got in the wrong lane and found myself back on the ringroad that I came in on ... and ended up 30 minutes late , while the assembled junior classicists got more and more restless , and the teachers more anxious , wondering when I would turn up ? ( This was the era before mobile phones too . ) <p> But honestly , if you 've got a passenger , and if s/he is a reasonably competent atlas reader , then s/he 's a much better bet than the electronic voice . " You 're going to be turning right in a bit , so I 'd get in the right hand lane " is a lot more engaging than the damn woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> In fact , I 've ended up pretty aggressive against the disembodied voice in my car ( even if I do still use it .. partly because -- of course -- we 've thrown our atlases away ) . <h> September 24 , 2012 <p> This post is not an attempt to give a lifeline to Andrew Mitchell . In fact I have been congratulating myself a bit smugly these last couple of days for some rare prescience on my part . That is to say , almost as soon as he had , or had n't said , what he is reported as saying , I observed that the F word was far less damaging than the P word ... " plebeian " or " pleb " . <p> Within modern British culture , since the sixteenth century at least , this bit of sub-Latin has been used with a decidely derogatory sense . " Hath not the pulchritude of my vertues protected me from the contaminating hands of these plebeians " ... is a line penned by Sir Philip Sidney ( who died in 1586 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the present day . " Why ca n't these plebeians live like the ants that they are in high-rise public-housing projects . " ... from the Boston Herald in 2004 . Or there 's the shortened form : " ' A bit of a pleb , was n't he ? ' put in the military friend . " .. that 's from Huxley 's Point , Counter Point . <p> But what does it originally mean ? <p> The word comes from Latin ( plebeius , or plebs ) . But the Latin story is a bit more complicated . Sure there is also a strongly derogatory use . Cicero was typical of the Roman upper class when he talked about the sordida plebs ( " the great unwashed " ) . Just like the late first century AD poet Statius , could say as a compliment of a patron 's house and bathing establishment nil ibi plebeium ( " nothing common there ! " ) . There is no doubt at all that most Roman toffs would have perfectly well understood what Mr Mitchell did or did nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what Andrew Mitchel l said to the policeman at the exit of Downing St. And we probably never will . But there is something nasty about the incident ( and it 's not the use of " f***ing " ) . <p> I can swear with the best and worst ( ok I 'll fess up to that , as many will confirm ) . So if some tired cabinet minister was biking up Downing St and was told by the cop that he couldnt cycle through the main gate , but had to get off and walk through the side gate , I can understand him saying . .. ' Oh for f 's sake , I 've biked this way for years ... ' All this stuff we 're hearing about propriety is a bit much . Like all those guys saying that

The social network claims that this will reduce news feed overload and improve the quality of content , but the subtext is pretty clear : companies seeking to promote their services on Facebook need to combine their content with paid advertising . <p> When asked about the change though , a Facebook spokesperson issued a typically vague statement as to what kind of content would be prioritized , saying " all content should be as engaging as the posts you see from friends and family " . Having briefly reviewed the nonsense and claptrap shared by my own family members , I decided to search for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of unique people who have clicked on your posts in the last 28 days " . This includes anyone liking , commenting on or sharing a specific post , liking the Page , mentioning the Page in a post , checking in , RSVP'ing to one of your events , photo-tagging the Page and writing a post on your Page 's Wall , as well as clicking on a post , opening up a link , watching a video , or clicking to view photos . <p> But which types of content are the most engaging ? Earlier this year , Facebook conducted its own study to identify which types of posts generate the most engagement . They decided to divide posts into three types : <p> Messages about the product or service -- e.g. " Our new resort just opened ! Book your trip today " . <p> Messages related to the brand -- e.g. " I decided to go on my first cruise because . " <p> Messages unrelated to the brand -- e.g. " Hang in there everybody . Monday will be over before we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate the most engagement . But beyond their relation ( or not ) to the brand , posts have other , dramatically different dimensions . Some , like the fill-in-the-gaps example above , are deftly designed to elicit engagement from fans . Videos invite fans to view them and photos offer an easy opportunity for sharing with friends . Yet users react very differently to these content types . <p> A recent report from Wildfire ! and EdgeRankChecker , which analyzed more than 1 million Facebook posts , found that photos are far and away the most engaging content type . Users can decide if a photo is worth sharing in a single glance , without having to think or click , whereas videos and links require us to click before we decide whether to share . Status updates are the second most engaging post type , since they too do n't require us to think much before we like or share . <p> But does better quality content produce more engagement ? <p> Last month , fuelled by the slew of " Like the Olympics ? -- then Like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a blog post criticizing the often condescending and crass engagement techniques employed by companies . The feedback I received in comments was considered and clear : nobody likes cynical , valueless engagement ploys , but equally , short , seemingly pointless statements can be highly engaging . Take this post from Yorkshire Tea , for example : <p> This is a simple , status update ( tick ) that 's closely related to the brand ( tick ) ; it 's not cynical ( tick ) ; and it 's at least as engaging as my brother-in-law 's photos of his new lawnmower ( tick ) . It also generated 356 likes , 49 comments and 13 shares -- so it ought to be exactly the kind of content that Facebook is now seeking to prioritise . <p> I have a feeling , though , that EdgeRank is going to be more hit and miss in future and I 'm keen see how the content-to-advertising ratio on Facebook shifts in the coming

##3709550 <h> Venice <h> Film Review : ' The Sapphires ' <p> ? ? ? ? ? <p> Reputedly based on a true story and adapted from the 2005 hit stage play , Wayne Blair 's comic drama The Sapphires ( 2012 ) sees popular Irish comedian Chris O'Dowd and Australian Idol runner-up Jessica Mauboy combine in this feelgood , yet flawed period effort . Set at the start of 1968 , three young , talented aboriginal sisters ( plus cousin ) are desperately seeking stardom , despite being stuck in the Outback . After a chance encounter with alcoholic piano player Dave ( O'Dowd ) , the girls form ' The Sapphires ' and enter a local competition which leads the to them playing for the American armed forces out in Vietnam . Featuring toe-tapping soul tunes such as Marvin Gaye 's I Heard It Through the Grapevine and Sam &; Dave 's Soul Man , the musical renditions performed by the female foursome provide plenty of fun and entertainment , as they they embark on their pursuit of fame . The squabbling sister dynamic makes for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of solid comedy . There is also an attempt at handling issues of race , played out in the presence of their ethnically white cousin , who provides a gentle level of antagonism to the tale in the face of hostility from the forceful and stubborn Gail ( Deborah Mailman ) . <p> The character of Gail borders on the irritating due to her ongoing antagonism , but ultimately strikes the right note as a love story develops between herself and Dave , with O'Dowd once again in commanding form . The rising Irish star is comfortably behind the wheel as the driving force of Blair 's film , his whisky-sodden performance and passion for soul placing himself as ( somewhat bizarrely ) as a white Sam Cooke-come-Ray Charles . Regardless , the best lines almost always come from O'Dowd 's charming chancer , whether teaching the girls the ethos of soul or making himself a quick buck or two in the process . <p> Whilst there is much to be enjoyed here , The Sapphires does fall flat when confronted with more challenging material . The scenes in Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar with the comic family drama and fun , funky performances . This is also true of the attempts made by Blair to deal with the racial segregation which was rife in 1960s Australia . Similarly , moments of apparent peril during explosions and gunfights are handled with little care and never convey the drama of the situation , culminating in one tiresome hospital scene guilty of employing the cheapest of emotive tactics . <p> Blair has clearly made sure that his latest effort will appeal to the widest possible market , no doubt hoping to tap into the family market with a taste for the sentimental . It 's also patently obvious that Blair is n't quite brave enough to make any overt political statements of any weight . Consequentially , the faults of the film ( linked to the latter ) , whilst numerous , are saved in the musical numbers and comedy ( the former ) . The Sapphires possesses all the necessary razzle-dazzle , shimmering sequin dresses and O'Dowd comic riffs to prove popular with audiences in the short-term - 
##3709951 <h> Twitter to focus on small business <p> Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has announced this week that the system is going to offer a new self-serve location-aware advertising system for small businesses . <p> This is the first small step to the future of advertising . We have come a long way from the days when Google started to revolutionise ads by introducing the concept of AdWords . By making Twitter location-aware and connecting tweets to ads we are entering a new era of advertising that is not only connected to what you are searching for , but also your location . <p> Imagine the scene . You are on your smart phone in an unfamiliar town and you want to find the nearest Indian restaurant , or cinema , or flower shop . You tweet what you want , and within a few seconds a message comes back from a matching local business , with directions from your present location . <p> I saw several people complaining on Twitter last night that they were in Scotland and had no way of watching the England football match live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the Scotland game . If a local sports bar in Glasgow had been showing the England game and was monitoring the tweets from marooned England fans north of the border , they could have scooped up a lot of business . <p> That would have been possible manually , just by monitoring keywords , but imagine if you could instruct Twitter to auto-respond to certain keywords in a certain location ? <p> People might still fear the path we are going down with location-awareness , for data protection reasons , but I believe that pragmatism will win the argument . People will find these tools so useful ,

##3714350 <h> Friday Reads : The Language of the Dying <p> A little while ago Ian Rankin was talking about novels and authors he 's recently discovered and mentioned Sarah Pinborough and The Language of the Dying , saying ' It 's about a father who 's dying ; his grown-up kids get back together at the house to wait for him to die , but there 's all kinds of weird secrets and weird stuff happening , just on the periphery . I 'm really enjoying it , it 's really well written . ' His words brought Pinborough 's novella back to mind , and prompted me to pick it up again . <p> In fact , the word that really prompted me to pick it up again was ' enjoying ' . Because I remembered a lot of things about reading The Language of Dying , among them a sense of kinship and heart-ache , echoes of old pains , a compulsion to read on . There 's a sense of the enduring yet fragile nature of family and relationships , of the kind unhelpfulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us can have no idea what were actually feeling . The themes are powerful : death , abuse , self-abuse ( whether food , alcohol , drugs or emotional ) , depression , balanced with freedom , self-knowledge and catharsis . And while there is a quiet kind of enjoyment to this sort of a read , I think it 's better characterised as broken glass reading : exquisitely sharp in places , smooth and seamless in others , and made up of pieces that fit together so perfectly you ca n't always see the join -- but whose edges can still shift and grate against one another when you least expect it . <p> It 's very sharply observed and very simply written , and both of those are an art in themselves . Saying what you mean is a skill that 's difficult to master . Saying it about a topic as difficult as the death of a loved one is harder still . . . and saying it in such a way that it draws on the reader 's experiences while telling a story is something very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I enjoy reading The Language of the Dying . I think I connect with it , am moved by it , and am a little in awe of it . I think I have to pause while reading it to turn moments or ideas over in my mind absorb them . I think there are scenes I had to sleep on before I continued reading -- and I think I 'm liable to reread this novella again and again . Not for enjoyment , but because it captures something unspoken about human experience , and that

##3718050 <p> Hi , thought it would be good to start a thread so we can talk about certain parts of the film Skyfall . I would like to ask someone who has seen the film , what was the creature in the shanghi part where bond and a bad guy fall into this pit with a sort of lizard. what is the creature called , and did it seem animated to you . was it real ? ? ? ? ? <p> Was the issue of the hard drive totally forgotten about in the final act ? <p> It was , but I do n't think it was relevant anymore in the second act . I think the whole agents names thing was just a sick , perverted game to get at M and Bond . Once Silva came face-to-face with Bond and M , the damage did n't need to be done . His mission was now to kill M , as he tried to in the courtroom . It would 've been nice to have a bit more on that , but IMO it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core element of the story . <p> Was the issue of the hard drive totally forgotten about in the final act ? <p> It was , but I do n't think it was relevant anymore in the second act .

It would 've been nice to have a bit more on that , but IMO it was more of a setup to the second act rather than the core element of the story . <p> I agree about that , but I think it should have been cleared up before the credits rolled , even a throwaway comment in the office at the finale . <p> What I liked about exploring Bond 's childhood and his parents was that it was really subtely done , not rammed down your throat . His dad 's gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tombstone were really well done . <p> Did anyone of your guys get gosebumps or realy excited when the bond theme started playing with the db5 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! That was amazing . And then the gadgets , oh my god . <p> It had everything . But the story with M dying can never be done again by judy dench . <p> It also explores james bonds ancestrial home and parents . does nt that make the best bond film . It explores stuff no film has before . Thats why i think its the best . <p> The DB5 scene was an amazing moment in the Royal Albert Hall . The whole place went crazy , and so it was a bit of a letdown to just hear the audience in the cinema today do an excited mumble when it happened . Wanted everyone to go crazy like me ! ( cinema audiences are so reserved these days ! ) <p> Sometimes it 's best not to fill in all the blanks and leave something to the imagination . I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond has a nasty habit of surviving . That 'll be enough I suppose . : ) <p> Sometimes it 's best not to fill in all the blanks and leave something to the imagination .

Once it becomes too visible , I find it inappropriate for a Bond film . <p> It 's called a Komodo Dragon . It was completely CGI , but it did n't look it when the dragons barely moved . Once the second one started running , it was fairly obvious . <p> Well some shots where the animals were pretty static could have been done with animatronics . When the animal is only a little part of the shot and you want to have something in the image when you choose where to put your camera , it can be far cheaper than doing CGI . <p> I suppose , well put .

##3718052 <p> Brosnan has the most kills because his movies were not very realistic , the scripts were catered towards action oriented scenes which resulted in more bland and over-the-top action . <p> IMO Craig is the deadliest , he may not have the most kills but thats because Craig 's outings are more realistic , which results in less kills , but overall the ones that take place are more brutal and realistic <p> Can anyone argue that he is the deadliest Bond ? Of course he is ! There is no denying that ! I am not surprised in the least ! And besides , who cares if he does use a machine gun often times ? Perhaps that 's the most effective way to get the job done , and it 's pretty cool at the same time ! <p> Brosnan is cool , he 's my 2nd favourite along with Connery , but until he burns alive the machete wielding drug lord that fed his mate to a shark , he 's not the deadliest Bond ; ) <p> Not that I disagree with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest friends off a satellite tower to his death , shot a man in the head mercilessly , and killed a woman he loved without hesitation .

##3718352 <h> Sunday , 2 September 2012 <h> Healthy dose of judgement guilt . <p> I like to think of myself as pretty easy going , I try not to judge people , I do n't know their situations and they do n't know mine . Who am I to butt in with my opinions ? No one , that 's who . This week I got a healthy dose of a reminder that you should never judge a book my its cover . Or a person with his bum hanging out . <p> I was sitting outside Starbucks , relaxing with Mojo and Mr M. Sipping my refresher ( cool lime ) yummy . I looked over in to the high street . There is a man in an electric wheelchair ( lets call him Mark ) , he was cruising down the path . Suddenly he stopped , just like that . A man ( we 'll call him Bob for the remainder ) , dressed in joggers with his arse hanging out stood in front of him , with his mate next to him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had chains hanging from his neck like tinsel . He had huge rings on his fingers , and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth . You get the picture right ? Right . <p> I was convinced something bad was about to happen . Bob stuffed his hands in his pockets and walked around to the back of the wheelchair and removed the bags . <p> You know that moment when you see something , you get a flash of ' what should I do ? ' That is how I felt , I had that pang in my chest that I may be sitting by when something bad is happening . <p> Bob handed the bags to his friend , he reached his arm into the pockets of the man in the wheelchair . <p> I was getting a bit jittery . Could I recognise them if this really was a bad thing happening ? Could I ? <p> Bob then unbuckled the clasp securing Mark into the chair and swiftly lifted him , placed him back down and removed keys and a wallet . <p> Fuck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by and watched that happen and done nothing , I was livid with myself . <p> Bob then moved to the side of Mark and rearranged him , gentle re-tucked all his fleece padding , bent down and tenderly re-did the laces that had fallen open . He placed his arms round Mark and gave him a massive kiss . Fixed his pillow . He took a small comb out of his back pocket , the one which was sagging below his arse . Took it through Marks hair . They were laughing and joking . <p> Mark got his wheelchair on the move again , Bob and his mate walked along side him . They were talking away , I caught just enough of the conversation to hear Mark say - <p> ' Thanks for coming to help , I was getting really uncomfortable ' <p> And the reply <p> ' You know I 've always got your back ' . <p> I judged , I should n't have .

##3718752 <h> Dentyl Active Enamel Restore : Stinkies roadtest <p> I 'm pretty sure that if I asked our family dentist they would offer me a designated parking space . What with a one Stinky seeing the orthodontist every three weeks and the other two constantly back and forth to see if they 're ' ready ' for the brace waiting list I spend a lot of time there . <p> For me oral hygiene and health is really important to us . However I 'm not too sure it features high up the list of the Stinkies priorities . So when Dentyl Active offered to send us a sample of Dentyl Active Enamel Restore I was excited to see how it would help in their daily mouth care routine . <p> The first thing that they noticed when they saw it was Dentyl 's distinctive two tone colour in fact the two phase working action combining a water based antibacterial agent and an oil based solution with natural essential oils . The stinkies looked at me almost as if it was a trap when I told them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two solutions mixed properly . It 's safe to say that there has been shaking aplenty when its time to brush their teeth . <p> Seeing is believing and with Dentyl Active Enamel Restore you wo n't believe your eyes as the debris removed by the mouthwash can be seen in the basin as it is shows up in deposits -- cue lots of " Cool " from the Stinkies and a resounding " Eww , No do n't try and scoop it out ! " <p> An added bonus is that it contains double the amount of fluoride compared to other leading brands and its alcohol free meaning it 's safe for children from the age of 7 , so being suitable for 5 out of 6 of our Brady Bunch is not bad at all . <p> Overall the Stinkies enjoyed using it and anything they helps them become more interested and involved in oral care is good news . Icy mint taste is not too strong which for me is often a real problem as I 'm not keen when the taste is overbearing . And hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my morning routine is worth a try ! <p> Alcohol free Dentyl Active Enamel Restore costs 4.07 for 500ml and is available from supermarkets and pharmacies nationwide . <p> Disclosure : We were sent a bottle of Dentyl Active Enamel Restore free of charge for review . No payment 
##3718852 <h> A blog by Yasser Rashid <p> After a lot of hard work the BBC iPlayer Radio app is finally in the app store and available for download . It 's been quite a journey to design and create the app , I was involved with it from the outset leading the user experience and creative direction . <p> The app is part of the wider iPlayer Radio product launch , a new brand that brings together all of BBC Radio and Music . Designing iPlayer Radio has been more than just a redesign as it 's a complete rethink of the BBC Radio &; Music digital experience . Previously all of the BBC Radio websites were very separate and lacked consistency but now they share a common user experience and visual language . Part of this rethink has been our multi platform approach and the app is one example that demonstrates this . <p> It was a fairly unique project in that we were starting from scratch so we had the opportunity at the beginning to be quite exploratory in our thinking and try a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app would appeal to and sketched ideas . Many of our visitors to BBC Radio are typically task orientated in that they know exactly what they are looking for whether its a station or a programme . So we thought a simple entry point would be to select a station and start listening live . Beyond this idea we also considered how a user could personalise the interface . We initially thought this could be interesting as mobile phones are inherently very personal devices and the idea of creating an interface that a user could customise with their favourite stations and programmes could be a good way into content . <p> After the home screen we then shifted attention to the playback page which is the most important area of the app . We really liked the idea of creating a dynamic experience , much like what you get on the Radio 1 website , where you can see which tracks are being played , messages from the audience and studio but also have the ability to interact with the show you are listening to using the built in functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messaging . The thinking was that this could potentially open up the opportunity for presenters to talk about this feature on air to encourage audience participation . <p> During this sketching phase we also payed a lot of attention to how a user would navigate the app using gestures and touch . We spent a lot of time looking at other apps and taking note of what works and does n't . Our main aim was to create a simple and intuitive interface and to achieve this we sketched a rough architecture of the app so we had an idea of how it might hang together and then considered the user journeys between sections . At a granular level we then considered which touch controls or gestures would be appropriate to use in each section . <p> It was really important to me that the app had an element of playfulness . Tai and I spent time discussing transitions , movements , sound and elements of the interface that would make the app a joy to use and have what I called a ' signature ' element of its experience which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To encourage regular use we also thought about how we might give the app some kind of utility which led us to think about the alarm clock feature . It started life in these early sketches . <p> The sketching phase was really helpful to explore a range of ideas and then start forming some decisions around what we thought could make a compelling app . Moving on we then decided to prototype to bring our ideas to life . For this phase of the project we partnered with Kent Lyons who provided both visual and technical expertise to translate the ideas we wanted to explore in the prototype . <p> Working on the prototype helped to challenge some of the ideas we had during the sketching phase as seeing things working in front of you is very different from what you have on paper . The team at Kent Lyons initially built some simple wireframe prototypes based on our sketches which helped to rationalise which sections we needed to get designed and built . Then the visual design was applied , this was an iterative process as we had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as icons . <p> It was while we working on the visual design that we started exploring how we might use the radio station logos in the interface . The logos are really well suited to a touch interface because their shape and size are finger and thumb friendly and because of this they have an inherent playful quality about them . Initially we thought they would work well in the EPG as a way of ' tuning ' into different stations . As a concept it was well received by the wider team internally at the BBC . So we began to iterate on it and it evolved like this ( click on the numbers or the image to see them ) : <p> The playback page went through a number of iterations to . We mainly focused on music programmes as they have richer info we can play with . We prototyped how dynamic data such as tracks being played would animate in and work as a timeline in the interface . This is an example of the Annie Mac playback page that enables a user to swipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap on each track to favourite and reveal more info . <p> One aspect of the app that was particularly difficult to get right was the EPG . Perhaps not the most exciting aspect of any design process , its important in this app because it gives the user an overview of all the radio stations and quick access to on demand programmes . We struggled with how a user would navigate to it . Initially we considered a button in the interface , but after designing the EPG in portrait it clearly was n't practical . Changing orientation was the answer as it provides a lot more space , it also means that a user can access the EPG at any point in the app if they feel like browsing and listening to something else . <p> We prototyped many ideas that did n't make it in the final app but unfortunately I ca n't share them just yet as it would spoil the surprise of future features we may want release . <p> After this prototyping phase we looked ahead and started planning the app for launch . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many improvements we could make . We had suffered from overloading the interface with too many features and sections . So to get the app ready for launch we went back to basics . Kathryn Leach joined the project at this time and she created a flow diagram of the entire app which visualised all the key user journeys . This helped us to get rid of an unnecessary sections and keep track of what we needed to do in order to deliver the final app . This is one example of a flow for live listening . <p> For the final version of the app we reworked the look and feel and simplified the interface . We set out to achieve a logical flow to the page . The station branding sits at the top so that there is a visual relationship between the schedule button and the station . Reducing the size of the programme image helped to create space and also give us the opportunity to make it a useful part of the interface . <p> When you tap it , the page flips around to reveal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set an alert for the next broadcast and share options . <p> The other key change was the play control panel . The new iPlayer Radio website provides a range of curated content for each station . We wanted to include this content in the interface but not at the expense of cluttering the interface . So we designed the play control panel to be swipeable and reveal the additional content such as video and audio clips . To indicate the hidden content the panel bounces when the user first views the page . This visual cue brings a playfulness and element of discovery into the interface . <p> We also overhauled the now playing information ( data corresponding to what it is on air such as track information ) . The initial approach was very visual , however using text is a lot more scalable , as the panel has to work across a range of both music and speech programmes . <p> A useful feature is the ability to save track information to a favourites list to email or tweet . We prototyped lots of ideas around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them may appear in future updates . The graphic equaliser is a fun addition but also really useful feedback to indicate to the user that the programme is playing and not paused ( or buffering ) . <p> The final home screen went through a number of iterations to get the animation to have the right amount of responsiveness , friction and easing . We also integrated a new feature which is the ability to add and edit your local radio stations . <p> While we were working on the iPhone app we were also busy with the Android version . It 's currently being prepared for launch and offers a similar user experience and design to the iPhone app . The key difference is that we have optimised elements of the interface specifically to be consistent with native Android behaviours and interactions . <p> This is the first version of the app , so expect new features and interface refinements in time . <h> Credits <p> This app was the combined effort of some very talented people . Wai Tai Li worked with me in the early stages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Sissons to commission the prototyping work and review the work in-progress that Kent Lyons had produced . The team at Kent Lyons were superb , their expertise helped us translate our ideas into a working prototype . James Simcock worked with us during both the prototyping phase and the final implementation of the app . Not only did he provide creative input and also led the project editorially , he ensured the stakeholder process was as smooth as possible . James is a mobile guru , his insights and experience were invaluable . Mark Timson helped us refine the home screen with his After Effects talents producing many iterations to get the animation just right . Last but not least I worked with Kathryn Leach during the final stages of the app . She created the flow diagrams , visual design and produced all the assets and worked with our technical partners to ensure they delivered 
##3720251 <h> Automatic survey of inbound mail ( MX ) servers in academic domains in the UK <h> Intro <p> This report presents the results and methodology of a semi-automated survey of inbound mail ( MX ) servers in all academic domains in the UK ( ac.uk ) with a focus on Further and Higher Education ( FE and HE ) . The survey has been performed in June 2007 . <p> A mail server or Mail Transfer Agent ( MTA ) is a software system that transfers email messages from one computer to another , so all MTAs act both as a receiver and a sender . <p> MTAs are an interesting focus of study for OSS Watch because email is ubiquitous in both FE and HE , but also in commercial companies and public administration . It is therefore a heavily used tool that allows the study of academic institutions with respect to the rest of the world . <p> MTAs can be used as inbound or outgoing servers , or both . Inbound servers receive email sent to the domain , and outgoing servers deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes into account the former , as they can be queried in an easily automated way in order to conduct extensive studies . This opens many possibilities : comparison of automated and traditional surveys ( e.g. emailing mail managers ) , easy update of the results to study evolution over time , larger samples , etc .. <p> The results of this survey show that external providers and academic institutions in general clearly prefer open source MTAs over proprietary alternatives , with the exception of FE institutions , that manifest a moderate preference for proprietary systems . <h> Methodology <h> Overview and limitations <p> The ideal goal of this survey would be to evaluate which MTAs are used in academic institutions in the UK in an automated way . Due to a number of factors the actual goal is to evaluate which front-end inbound MTAs are used in ac.uk institutions in a semi-automated way . <p> The ideal goal is limited to the actual goal for several reasons : <p> Only inbound servers <p> Inbound and outgoing servers need to be treated separatedly and using different approaches ; limited resources for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inbound servers . See section " Identification of email servers " for details <p> Only front-end severs <p> Inbound email servers can be front-end ( visible to the external world ) or internal ( hidden from the external world ) . This study deals only with front-end servers , as to the best of our knowledge there is no automated way to survey internal servers . See section " Identification of email servers " for details <p> ac.uk institutions instead of academic institutions <p> Domains in ac.uk correspond to a heterogeneous mixture of organizations and projects , so this study uses the term institution in a loose sense . See sections " Acquisition of lists of institutions " and " Mapping between domains and institutions " for details <p> Semi-automated <p> Although scripts have been written to automate data acquisition and compilation , human intervention is still necessary to keep the list of known MTA systems updated , run the scripts and publish the results <p> Some mail managers may doctor the information provided by the MTA so that it identifies itself as another system . We have no figures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of institutions <p> OSS Watch national surveys have studied the usage of open source software in FE and HE institutions . Colleges , universities , etc. are readily classified as academic institutions in the sense that they are organizations situated in complexes of buildings for the promotion of learning and research . <p> Further Education ( FE ) : Institutions for students of age 14-19 to prepare for GCSE A levels examinations ( e.g. sixth form colleges ) or vocational training ( e.g. vocational colleges ) , and for adult learning <p> Higher Education ( HE ) : Institutions that award academic degrees , typically universities and vocational universities , for students of age 18 onwards <p> When this survey was conducted , HERO , the official gateway to universities , colleges and research organisations in the UK , was able to provide comprehensive lists of FE institutions and HE institutionsAs of June 2009 the HERO.ac.uk website is now closed . The British Council provides lists of educational institutions too , but there is no perfect correspondence with HERO 's lists . It would also be possible to obtain lists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK 's education and research network ) . , that can easily be parsed and compiled into lists of domains , one domain per institution , e.g. <p> However , 3641 ac.uk domains were registered at the time of this study , of which only 659 ( 18.1% ) correspond to HE and FE institutions . <p> This suggests that in order to obtain a more realistic picture of the usage of MTAs in education in the UK , other types of organizations and projects ( not necessarily institutions ) need to be considered , the diversity of which is illustrated in the table below . <p> Nonetheless and for simplicity , we are going to use the term institution in a loose sense to be able to classify ac.uk domains in 3 groups : FE , HE and Other . That is , we are going to denote both actual academic institutions and activities or organisations closely related to education as institutions . <h> Mapping between domains and institutions <p> It would greatly simplify this study if we could assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between domains and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions use domain redundancy , e.g. both ox.ac.uk and oxford.ac.uk are University of Oxford domains <p> Some domains are registered but not being used , e.g. aac.ac.uk <p> Some institutions are split between different centres , each with one domain , e.g. The White Rose Centre for Enterprise Teaching and Learning has registered domains sheffieldcetle.ac.uk and leedscetle.ac.uk , for their centres at the Universities of Sheffield and Leeds , respectively <p> Some schools , faculties and organizations have their own domain , but they are in fact part of a larger institution , e.g. bristollawschool.ac.uk is registered to the Faculty of Law at the University of Western England <p> In this study we have decided to identify institutions and domain redundancy by the entry " Registered for " in the WHOIS database ( see Appendix A ) . This method can differentiate institutions with domains that use the same mail servers and authoritative Domain Name System ( DNS ) server , e.g. <p> cof.ac.uk registered for " Birmingham College of Food - Tourism and Creative Studies " <p> The steps followed to map domains to institutions are : <p> The WHOIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields are recorded as institution identifiers <p> Redundancies are removed to build a list of unique institution identifiers <p> Each domain is tagged with a unique institution identifier <p> Using this approach 2914 institutions for 3641 domains were identified . <h> An incorrect method of mapping between domains and institutions <p> An idea for the mapping that we discarded was to use WWW servers , under the assumption that each institution will have a website , and that all redundant domains will be aliases of the same homepage . <p> This is unfortunately not the case . For example , the University of Oxford web servers have different IP addresses $ host www.ox.ac.uk www.ox.ac.uk has address 163.1.0.45 $ host www.oxford.ac.uk www.oxford.ac.uk has address 163.1.0.90 <p> OSS Watch is a separate institution , but the webserver shares the same IP address save for the last byte $ host www.oss-watch.ac.uk www.oss-watch.ac.uk has address 163.1.0.145 <h> Identification of email servers <p> A list of front-end inbound email servers associated to a certain domain can be obtained with a DNS query ( see Appendix B ) . This list can be emtpy , or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . <p> The list assigns a priority to each server ( low priority servers should be contacted only if higher priority servers are not responding ) , but in this study we make no distinction between them . <p> It is also worth noting that some institutions may use load balancing schemes . Load balancing is a special case where several servers are running , but they all appear as a single machine to the outside world . In this study , load balancing is treated as a single MTA . <p> Domain redundancy is another hurdle for a study like this . In some cases , several domains of an institution are valid email domains , e.g. both user@ed.ac.uk and user@edinburgh.ac.uk are valid email addresses for the University of Edinburgh . But sometimes , only one domain is valid , e.g. user@ox.ac.uk are valid email addresses for the University of Oxford , but not user@oxford.ac.uk . <p> Another difficulty is found with outsourced email . Institutions may run their own mail servers , outsource them to another institution or company , or a combination of both . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford , even though they can be considered separate institutions . Another example , the Architectural Association School of Architecture 's primary server is internal , while 2 secondary servers are outsourced to a private company . <p> Following the considerations above , in this study email servers associated to an institution are found in the following way : <p> All domains belonging to an institution are grouped <p> A DNS query is run per domain to find all email servers <p> Redundancies are removed , i.e. each server is counted only once per institution <p> Email servers are tagged as either belonging to a private company ( those with org.uk , co.uk , org , net , gov.uk , com and biz domains ) or an academic institution <h> Identification of MTAs <p> Information about the MTA running on an email server can be obtained by opening a telnet session to port 25 . This process can be automated to query large numbers of servers ( see Appendix C ) . <p> Information obtained from the telnet session falls in one of 3 categories : <p> open : the email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually the version number , e.g. Exim 4.62 . Mail administrators who use the " open " category rely on the doctrine of security by design <p> obscured : the mail manager has removed the name of the MTA from the telnet output , replaced it by a nonstandard identifier ( e.g. " RHCMarshal " instead of " MailMarshal " ) , or replaced the welcome banner by a string of asterisks . These are examples of security through obscurity <p> misleading : the mail manager has doctored the output of the telnet session so that it looks as if another MTA is running . This is an active form of security through obscurity <p> The steps followed to identify MTAs are <p> A telnet 25 session is attempted for each email server <p> The welcome banner is recorded for successful connections <p> An SMTP HELP command is sent <p> The output is recorded <p> The telnet session is closed <p> The collated output of the telnet session is matched to a list of known MTA systems to look for matches <p> The email server is tagged as running an unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 shows that at the time of this study there are 3641 top domains in ac.uk , of which only a negligible amount are not registered to any institution ( 0.3% ) . Of the rest , those registered to FE ( 17.5% ) are roughly twice as many as those registered to HE ( 9.7% ) . <p> According to the lists obtained from HERO , there are 2.7 times more FE than HE institutions ( 454 FE , 166 HE ) . Table 2 shows that 441 ( 97.1% ) and 163 ( 98.2% ) , respectively , were identified in the WHOIS record of one of the queried domains . <p> " Server names " refer to the host names provided by the MX record in the DNS . A small amount of these names ( 3.7% ) had no IP address and could not be queried . The rest were considered valid mail servers ( " With IP address " ) . <p> FE and HE have an average of 1.4 and 2.2 valid mail servers per institution , respectively , while the rest of institutions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with HE institutions being less numerous but having in general more IT resources than FE , and taking into account that the " Other " category includes many pseudo-institutions ( see " 2.2 . Acquisition of lists of institutions " for details ) . <p> Note that the number of institutions in FE , HE and Other add up to the total number of institutions . This is not the case with servers , because the same machine can be serving more than one institution . <h> Email by institution <p> Table 3 shows that almost all FE and HE institutions ( &gt; 98.0% ) use email , while those in the " Other " category have a much lower rate ( &lt; 60.0% ) . This can be explained because many of the " Other " domains are projects , ventures , etc. hosted by FE and HE institutions . Typically , the " Other " domain is used for a website , but email is routed via the hosting institution . <p> " Unknown provider " means that the domain of the mail server name could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions were found in one of these domains : ac.uk , org.uk , co.uk , . org , . net , . gov.uk , . com , . biz , . de , . dk , . net.uk , . uk , . edu . In this case , the 2 unknown providers correspond to MX records that instead of containing a server name contain its IP address . <p> 79.1% of HE institutions run their own email servers , while 25.8% have outsourced email , either to another ac.uk institution or to a commercial company . " Overlap " means that some institutions have both in house servers and outsourced servers . <p> The overlap is 3 times more common in FE than in HE , where fewer institutions run their own email servers ( 69.8% ) and more outsource them ( 46.3% ) . <p> Interestingly , in the " Other " category most of the institutions outsource their email . Note that the 48.0% figure refers to the total number of institutions ; if only institutions with email were considered , the outsourcing rate would be 80.4% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domains ( typically commercial companies ) for those institutions that outsource email . Between 71.4% ( HE ) and 78.4% ( FE ) of the outsourcing is to non-ac.uk domains . <p> We can also see from Table 4 that in general outsourcing is done to either ac.uk or non-ac.uk domains , but not both , as the overlap is very small . <h> Email by server <p> Tables 5 and 6 are in the same spirit as those in the previous section , but looking at usage of email by server instead of by institution , to get a more complete picture . <p> Table 5 shows that most servers providing ac.uk institutions with an email service are within ac.uk itself ( 76.7% and 89.8% for FE and HE , respectively ) . In the " Other " category the rate is lower but still the majority , 64.0% . <p> Correspondingly , the rates of servers outside ac.uk are 23.1% , 10.2% and 35.9% . <p> Table 6 shows that for servers within ac.uk an overwhelming majority are used to provide the service to the same institution that hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE institutions ( 5.2% and 6.4% , respectively ) host email for other ac.uk institutions . In fact , most of the **40;8488;TOOLONG ... happens in the Other category ( 44.6% ) . <h> External email providers <p> Table 7 presents a list of non-ac.uk providers , and the number of institutions they serve . The provider 's names have been anonymized to avoid promoting specific companies . The results clearly show that the first 2 providers have 40.8% and 70.6% of the FE and HE market , respectively . Both are commercial companies . Provider 1 leads in HE and FE , while Provider 2 leads in the Other category . There are 225 providers with fewer than 5 customers that have been removed from the table . <p> 5 providers serve 62.7% of FE institutions that outsource email , while this figure grows to 85.3% in the case of HE institutions . Quite interestingly , the maket in the Other category is much more fragmented , with 22 providers serving 50.4% of institutions . <p> Table 8 presents the same list of providers , but in this case evaluated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 2 are also leading for FE and HE by number of servers , the rates are lower , with 29.7% and 56.7% , respectively . This can be explained by many providers who have only 1 or 2 customers , but use several servers for them . Provider 17 appears second in this table because of the high server/customer ratio it has in the Other category ( a ratio of 4.0 ) . There are 231 providers with fewer than 5 servers that have been removed from the table . <p> 5 providers contribute 44.0% and 81.1% of servers for FE and HE , respectively , and in the same fashion as above , the Other category is much more fragmented , with 50 providers contributing 50.2% of the servers . <h> MTAs and filters by institution <p> Systems running in email servers were classified as either MTAs or filters ( and only servers hosted by ac.uk domains were taken into account ) . The difference is that an MTA 's main purpose is to transfer email , while a filter searches incoming emails for spam , viruses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTA that is often hidden from the outside world . <p> In cases where the system could not be identified , it was tagged as " unknown MTA " . There are two reasons why this happens . The first originates in the way this study identifies MTAs , searching for a known string in the output of the telnet session , e.g. " Exim " . If a system is not included in our list , then it can not be identified . However , we did a systematic review of telnet outputs and we are reasonably confident that all known systems used by ac.uk institutions or their external providers have been added to the list . <p> The second reason is that some postmasters delete or edit the information provided by the server , as explained in section 1.5 " Identification of MTAs " . We think that most , if not all , of " Unknown " cases can be assigned to the categories of security through obscurity or active misleading . <p> Table 9 shows that 65.3% ( FE ) and 63.2% ( HE ) of institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , 41.8% ( FE ) and 50.7% ( HE ) make that information available . ( There is some overlap because an institution can be using both identified and unidentified MTAs . ) <p> The most popular MTA for FE is MS Exchange , in 21.7% of institutions . The most popular for HE is Exim , in 33.1% of institutions . In the Other category , Exim is also the most popular , with 22.7% vs. 10.5% of MS Exchange . <p> The percentages in Table 9 refer to " Institutions in ac.uk with email " . Regarding institutions " Running known MTAs " , the 3 most popular open source systems ( Exim , postfix and MMDF ) are used in 54.9% of cases ( 33.3% in FE , 72.4% in HE , 58.2% in Other ) , while the 4 most popular proprietary MTAs ( MS Exchange , Qmail , MDaemon and Merak ) are used in 28.6% of cases ( 54.1% in FE , 13.0% in HE and 24.0% in Other ) . Sendmail is a special case , as it is distributed under a licence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the list of approved OSI licences . The OSS Watch position on this is that unless software is released under an OSI approved licence then it is not open source . Sendmail is used in 13.4% of institutions ( 7.4% in FE , 11.6% in HE , 15.1% in Other ) . <p> Thus , in general , open source or Sendmail is 2.4 times more likely to be used than proprietary alternatives for MTAs . In HE the imbalance is very noticeable , as HE institutions are 6.5 times more likely to choose an open source or Sendmail MTA than an proprietary one . On the other hand , FE institutions are 1.3 times more likely to choose a proprietary system than an open source or Sendmail one . <p> Table 10 shows that the use of filters ( or at least , filters that could be identified ) is negligible , with 2 proprietary systems ( MailMarshal and MIMEsweeper ) and 1 open source system ( qpsmtpd ) leading the classification . <h> MTAs and filters by server <p> The results in Table 11 are comparable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source MTAs run in 49.8% of servers ( 31.7% in FE , 81.6% in HE , 53.4% in Other ) , while the 4 most popular proprietary solutions run in 37.2% of servers ( 53.7% in FE , 8.4% in HE , 33.2% in Other ) . That is , a server hosted in ac.uk is 1.6 times more likely to run an open source or Sendmail MTA than a proprietary one . But there is again a big difference between FE and HE . Servers in HE are 10.6 times more likely to run open source or Sendmail MTAs than proprietary , while servers in FE are 1.3 times more likely to run proprietary than open source or Sendmail MTAs . <p> Positive identification of MTAs is 10% less frequent in external domains than in ac.uk . Of those systems that could be identified , the 3 most popular open source MTAs are Exim and postfix ( 53.2% of servers with known MTAs ) . The 3 most popular proprietary MTAs are Qmail , MS Exchange and Merak ( 19.0% of servers ) . Sendmail is in 17.8% of servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an open source or Sendmail MTA than a proprietary one in external providers . <p> The results of Table 13 are very similar to Table 10 , and suggest low usage of filter systems . According to Table 14 , this is even lower for external providers . <h> Conclusions <p> All ac.uk domains were systematically queried to find information about the type of MTAs that academic institutions ( in a broad sense ) are using . <p> Both the methodology and the results show that the evaluation of MTA usage is quite complex . To obtain a full picture it is necessary to consider deployment by institution and server , and it is difficult to define what an " institution " is . In fact , most of the domains are registered to pseudo-institutions that are neither in HE nor in FE . <p> Other hurdles for the study are that servers can overlap between institutions , and that institutions can use 1 or more servers , either in house , from another academic institution or from an external provider , or combinations thereof . <p> We are limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in roughly half of the cases the MTA can not be identified because the information has been edited in the spirit of security through obscurity . <p> However , emails in response to a question we posted to the UK mail manager mailing lists suggested interest from the community for this kind of data . All domains were given the option of opting out of the study , and only 3 in 3,631 chose to do so . <p> Some results were to be expected . For example , that 98%+ of FE and HE institutions use email . More surprising is the fact that 46% of FE institutions outsource their email ( for HE this is only 28% ) . At the same time , 70% of FE and 80% of HE have in house servers . ( There is some overlap due to some institutions having both ) . Of those institutions that outsource , 80% in FE and 70% in HE use non-ac.uk providers , typically commercial companies . In fact , just 2 companies cover 50% of the FE and 70% of the HE outsourcing market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85% of the market , respectively . The market is much more fragmented for institutions in the Other category , where 50% is covered by 22 providers . <p> In total , academic institutions are 2.4 times more likely to choose open source or Sendmail MTAs than proprietary ones . Academic servers are 1.6 times more likely to run open source or Sendmail MTAs , and this figure grows to 3.7 for external servers . <p> However , these figures are not evenly distributed among institutions , as HE institutions are 6.5 times more likely to chose open source or Sendmail MTAs , while FE institutions are 1.3 times more likely to choose proprietary systems . In terms of servers , HE ones are 10.6 times more likely to run open source or Sendmail MTAs , while FE servers are 1.3 times more likely to run proprietary ones . <p> The most popular open source MTAs are Exim , postfix and MMDF , while the proprietary ones are MS Exchange , Qmail , MDaemon and Merak . Sendmail is a special case in that it is not open source but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that some institutions and external providers run filters to protect their front-end servers , but the number is negligible . <p> Thus the results confirm trends observed in the previous Open Source Surveys conducted by OSS Watch in 2003 , 2006 , 2008 and 2010 . Namely , that there is a healthy uptake of open source software in academic institutions , with higher percentages in HE than in FE . ( The latter tend to prefer proprietary software . ) <h> Acknowledgements <p> The contribution of Andy Saunders of OUCS was invaluable in terms of technical guidance and general suggestions about the study . We are also grateful to those UK mail managers who chipped in and offered advice or pointed out errors and omissions . And finally , thanks to all those OUCS and OSS Watch staff members who at some point offered their help . <h> Appendix A : Querying the WHOIS <p> WHOIS is a protocol that can be used to query special databases for information about domains , e.g. owner , contact address , servers , etc . Queries can be made from JANET 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command line with a WHOIS client ( e.g. the program whois in Unix systems ) <h> Appendix B : Querying the DNS <p> Domain Name System ( DNS ) servers work in a similar way to phone books . Each human-readable hostname ( e.g. www.ox.ac.uk ) is linked to a number called an IP address ( 163.1.0.45 ) . For domains , DNS servers provide the hostnames of the email servers associated with them . This information can be obtained from the command line with a DNS lookup application ( e.g. program host in Unix systems ) <p> The number by the hostname indicates the priority level ( a lower number means higher priority ) . That is , the primary mail server at aaschool.ac.uk is smtp.aaschool.ac.uk while relay2.red.net and relay3.red.net are secondary or backup servers . In this study we have made no distinction between primary and secondary servers . <h> Appendix C : Querying the email server <p> Email transmission is performed using SMTP ( Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ) . The mail server listens to SMTP connections on port 25 , and it is usually possible to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MTA being used in the welcome banner . Telnet sessions can be opened with the command line program telnet in Unix systems . <p> In this case , the MTA used by the mail server oxmail.ox.ac.uk is Exim v4.62 . If the name of the MTA is not provided in the welcome banner , sometimes it is possible to obtain it with a HELP command , e.g. <p> Telnet sessions are interactive , but they can be automated with an expect script in Unix systems . <h> Appendix D : General flowchart of the study <h> Appendix E : Opt out email <p> The following text was emailed to the postmaster address of every domain queried in this survey , with an option for them to opt-out of the study . <p> Dear postmaster , <p> You have been sent this email to inform you that your domain has been included in the " OSS Watch automated survey of inbound Mail Transfer Agents ( MTAs ) in academic domains in the UK " study . <p> OSS Watch is a JISC-funded organization hosted by Oxford University . <p> OSS Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical and economic issues that arise when educational institutions engage with free and open source software . It does this by providing free and unbiased advice and guidance to UK higher and further education . <p> The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usage of inbound MTAs in ac.uk domains , and the results will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence . <p> The methodology of the study is the following : A telnet session is opened to port 25 of every surveyed inbound email server in ac.uk domains , and " help " and " quit " commands are issued . Then , if possible , the MTA running in the server is identified from the output of the telnet session . <p> The information collected from the server is available to any person with an internet connection and an open SMTP port . It is acquired using standard protocols and is freely provided by the server as part of its normal functionality . <p> For this study , each server needs to be accessed only once , and if it were to become periodic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per server under normal circumstances . Thus , we believe that the impact in the work load of the studied servers is negligible . <p> However , if for some reason you object to these data being gathered from your domain , please let us 
##3721052 <h> Fun , Fab And Free Christmas Decorations ! <p> This week 's feature is bought to you courtesy of my laziness . I live in a 50s built house , with a large window at the bottom of the stairs , at the front of the house . Last year I had this fab idea . Son and I would spend some great bonding time together , and make a huge cascade of paper snowflakes , big and small , flowing down the window . <p> Yeah , well , that was the idea . The reality turned into something a little bit different . First , paper snowflakes actually take quite a long time to do . Especially if you want proper snowflakes rather than doilies . Second , seven year old boys do not have that much patience . So after about snowflake number two it was just me sitting there , snipping away . <p> Finally , after three hours of work , I had enough snowflakes to fill one corner of one half of the window . Whoop-de-blimin-do . <p> This weekend I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And crucially it had to be cheap . I have absolutely no room for extras in this year 's Christmas budget . I was amazed at what I found , so I went searching for more . And here 's the top five , fabulous , fun and free ( well cheap , and possibly free if you already have the material to hand ) Christmas decoration ideas I found . <h> Christmas Bauble Wreath <p> I actually have a ton of baubles from Christmas ' Past , most of which I hardly ever use . I 've seen these bauble type wreaths before but had absolutely no idea how to make one , or even if it was possible . <p> Eddie Ross crafts shows you how to do this , using photos . It does n't look like you need much other than a wire coat hanger , baubles and some twisty tie things . I usually keep all these - they come attached to toys in packaging by the bucket load . <p> The only piece of equipment used here that I do n't have to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's but to be honest , when it comes to kids and crafts they 're just so useful and not that expensive . I 'm going to invest in one ! The photo at the top of this post shows you how the Eddie Ross wreath worked out . I 'll post a photo if mine even comes close to this ! <h> Window dcor for Christmas <p> It looks like Vintage Wan na Bee has saved me from the Paper Snowflake horror this year ! I just love the potential for this particular decoration . I 'll be doing mine so it can be seen from the street as I like to add a little Christmas touch , and since the glass is n't frosted I never leave the curtains open ( it is right on the street ) . But you could do this so it is visible from inside , and it wo n't necessarily stop you from closing blinds or pulling the curtains shut . <p> It works out free for me as I have a tension rod already , bought to use in the bathroom but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension rod is one of those little rods you can get from places like Argos or B &Q; where it expands to fit the space and stays up through pressure placed against the walls . I do n't think they can take more weight than a shower curtain , but baubles and other ornaments do n't weigh that much . <p> I also have ribbon left over from the Jubilee , in silver , metallic blue and shiny metallic red . With some tinsel on the rod , or some holly ( there 's lots growing wild near me ) , it would be quite a bit of fun to do this with son . He is already bursting with excitement , counting down the days to the 1st of December when we can put up the tree ( and he can open his first advent calendar window ! ) . <h> The Snowman Fridge <p> Or it could be a Snow Woman . I do n't think that these things have to be gender specific , and my use of the word snowman is purely because snowwoman looks odd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> What I liked about this decorating idea is that it is also something you can do with the kids , or if they 're a bit older , then leave them to it on their own . The fridge on the left , courtesy of Crafting My Talents is made up of mostly scrap book paper and wrapping paper taped to the fridge . <h> Who-Ville-like Ornaments <p> How about adding a little Dr Seuss inspiration to your Christmas ? I really like this one , especially if your children really love Dr Seuss . The frame concept would work well as an outdoor ( hanging on the door ) or indoor decoration . And the baubles can be hung anywhere . What a great rainy day project too at the start of the holidays - make your own baubles ! <p> The idea comes from Blue Cricket Design , and looks fairly simple to assemble . A picture frame from a junk shop that you can paint , some ribbon and some baubles that you can also paint . One tip I came across for painting plastic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first . <p> However , what they 've done here is actually make the baubles themselves out of papier mache . Again , this could be a fun craft to do with the kids . I keep a small box filled with cut up strips of old newspaper ready for whenever we decide to do something in papier mache . Probably sounds a bit excessive , but I can cut the strips up at anytime . However nothing kills the creative moment dead more than going from great idea to boring half hour spent ripping or cutting . <h> Make your own baubles <p> This is a slight cheat in that my favourite idea here come again from the site I just mentioned above , Blue Cricket Design . I mean look at these baubles , do n't they just look gorgeous ? I love that home made stuff , and if you ca n't do the home-made thing when you 've got kids then just when can you do it ? <p> I too love the snowman fridge . I saw a ' vintage wreath ' in a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an obscene amount of money . The wreath was beautiful because it was made of vintage baubles - the kind your nan had on her tree that no one wants today . I go to charity shops locally and always buy vintage baubles when I find some - I have lots of German and Polish ones that I bought for about 5p each . Some day , when I have collected enough , I shall make that wreath ! And now , thanks to this blogpost , I know how . <p> I too love the snowman fridge . I saw a ' vintage wreath ' in a store called ABC in Manhattan about two years ago , selling for an obscene amount of money .

Some day , when I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , thanks to this blogpost , I know how . <p> I made tiny wreaths for my family one year using berries I collected from obliging trees in the woods - they need to be fat berries , or crab apples ( red ones ) . I dried them in the boiler cupboard where it 's really hot . They shrivel , of course , but keep their deep red colour ( mostly ) . Then , using a glue gun , I glued them to a tree branch wreath I made with twigs I found in my garden . They have to be moist/damp twigs coz they 're bendable . Dry ones will snap . You bend them into shape in the same way a bird might bend them to make a nest . I fixed everything together using a glue gun , and then glued the berries to it . I 'll happily send you a pic of it when I pull out my Christmas decorations . I also make paper decorations using the images from old children 's books I found in the charity shop .

##3725251 <h> A Kitchen Item that Transcends the Ages <p> For as long as I can remember , my mother and grandmother have had enormous candles burning in their kitchens . No matter what the season , a fluid fragrance has wafted , and created a homey appeal in this room in their homes . Neither woman followed in the footsteps of the other when it came to selection , but each made flawless choices . <p> My Mama never splurged on designer brands , instead she opted for the more decorative candleholders . This is what led to the tradition of my sisters and I trying to out do each other on her birthday by competing to find the most gorgeously packaged scented candles . This constant barrage of candles is probably what kept her kitchen more modern than any other grannys on the block . <p> As for my mom , well she kept the candles for another reason . It was not because she loved the flickering light , or even the plethora of scents to be chosen from . Oh no , she needed those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the many burnt dishes declared it loud and clear . However , she became a master of hiding the aromatic sins of her foibles with the help from the folks at the candle factory . <p> The point is , while each may not have set out to build a standard of what a kitchen should be , they did . My sisters agree , candles offer a great deal to a home , and in a kitchen , they complete many duties beautifully . So , 
##3725351 <p> What can we say that has n't already been said ? LIFE OF PI is relentlessly assaulting us with new material every week and rather than getting sick and tired of all the material , we welcome it . Here we have two little featurettes which see James Cameron discussing the 3D used in the film , and the creation of this years Best Actor In A Supporting Role ( probably ) Richard Parker . And no , that is n't the same one we saw earlier in the tear in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN . The CGI used for Richard Parker is fantastic , and I mean that in the sense that it is n't preoccupied with being completely realistic . It does have this otherworldly feel , which is how I think CGI should be treated . To see the gigantic hoard of posters and trailers then simply go here . <p> LIFE OF PI is released 21st November 2012 in the US &; 20th December 2012 in the UK . It stars Suraj Sharma ,
