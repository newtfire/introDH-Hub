The trickle-down theory simply does not work , it is a scam to benefit the rich . <p> Their economic theories are false and the only purpose it has served is to hurt this country , the middle-class and making the gap between the middle-class and the very wealthy wider and wider while sinking the working class into poverty .

##3162452 <h> On the use of force <p> I am co-authoring a modest book on cats with another veterinarian who , like me , has had experience with a wide variety of species in different clinical and research contexts . Of course , as Andrew is approaching 80 , his experience goes well beyond mine . Recently , I reviewed his chapter on " training " cats so that they do n't behave in ways that could put strains on their relationships with humans , such as scratching furniture and jumping onto tables and countertops . His advice was to use the classic water-spray method that seems to have worked for some people , some of the time . As a use of force , it is a relatively gentle means , but it is a display of force nevertheless . ( My son likes to say on behalf of all animals : curse you humans and your opposable thumbs ! ) <p> Several years ago , I tried the water-spray method of discipline , but ended up finding it messy and annoying , both to myself and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reach the spray bottle in time ( it was never put back in the same place ) , or I missed ; and if I did n't , I ended up with a wet , resentful cat who reverted to jumping on countertops when I was n't home just to prove he could still do it , if only to himself . Today , that same cat is 14 years old , and he still jumps on countertops , to get a drink of water from the tap in the sink or to evade harassment from the more energetic cats on the floor . In short , I gave up , and reasoned that the only way to have cats off tabletops was to gently remove them , over and over again , if necessary , until they tired of the exercise . <p> Of my three other cats , only one is prone to jumping on tables and countertops . I often find his footprints on the counter ; of course this is annoying and mildly unsanitary , but I tolerate it because it 's not a huge issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experience most objectionable cat behaviour requires an intelligent use of resources to create solutions that benefit everyone , or gentle dissuasion . The use of forceful methods will usually produce unintended results , such as a different objectionable behaviour , or a neurotic and unhappy cat that never reaches his or her full potential for amiable companionship . <p> My mother often mentions to me that her cat does n't dare jump onto countertops , tables , or even certain chairs in the house , because he remembers being smacked for it back when he first moved into the house and was a very easily intimidated cat . The use of force worked for her . But the cat is clever . While my mother is the one who feeds and cleans up after the cat , she gets very little love in return . Cat is in love with my father , follows him everywhere and gives him all of his best attention and lovingest expressions . Cat knows that my father would n't ever lift a hand against him , even if he wanted to ; my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat deserves a smack for waking him up at night , he would never dream of actually doing it . I guess that 's OK with my mother , because she does n't want cats following her everywhere or waking her up anyways . <p> The same principle applies with regard to the use of force in training dogs . It may produce certain results , if only because dogs have a hierarchical concept of social relationships that cats find abhorrent , so the use of force will go a certain way to ensuring obedience . However , most responsible dog trainers and experienced owners know that there are ways of training dogs without using force . They use consistency , fairness , and persuasive togetherness to get the best results : an obedient , non-neurotic and non-fearful canine companion . <p> I have no training in diplomacy , political science or even human psychology , but even so it has always been obvious to me that the use of force is nearly always a missed opportunity and a tragic mistake that produces unintended consequences . I know this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very idea of using slaps or spankings to teach them obedience or as a punishment . Humans are animals , and animals do not respond well to the use of force , in any context -- even when human reason or religion proclaims that it is for their own good . <p> The current Israeli offensive in Gaza has reminded me of the tragic uselessness of force . Simply put , there is simply no way that the Israelis will achieve anything remotely positive from bombing and marching into Gaza , no matter how often they repeat their message that this is about subduing the threat of Hamas or ensuring future security for Israeli citizens . The use of force is always a mistake . I would 've hoped that the accumulated experience of decades -- millenia in fact -- in the Middle East would have taught them otherwise . <h> 9 Comments on " On the use of force " <p> Helen Suzman , a tireless fighter for racial justice in her country just died on January 1st at the age of 91 . <p> The former president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless enforcers of apartheid laws , once referred to her as " a vicious little cat " -- a comment that Suzman did not view as an insult as she loved animals and was surrounded by them in her home . <p> You make the most wonderful and thought-provoking connections in your writing , brebis noire . <p> brebis noire , I have a countertop cat ( you knew that , did n't you ) , and share your intuitions about these problems . <p> In our situation -- six cats , two of whom are ferals -- you learn fairly quickly to think from the inside , to think along with each of them and figure out what works for each of them . The countertop cat is not one of the ferals -- she 's the runt , and she has never been able to adjust to the other guys . She sits with me at my desk or she sits on a pad on the counter , where no one else is allowed -- those are the only two places she feels safe . <p> How did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counter ? Same way you are doing it -- I just kept lifting them down and saying NO , a word they all understand . They see that Guinny is allowed to stay up there , and they finally accepted that . <p> I 've never believed in behavioural psychology , and I 've never believed in punishment . I have never struck an animal ( or a person ) , and I ca n't imagine what result that could have except to inspire complicated feelings of fear and resentment and rebellion . <p> Our culture has a strange relationship with the notion of punishment . I read the news today , oh boy , and I read people talking about teaching other people a lesson , and I fear for us . In itself , that attitude is ugly , and then in practical terms , it does not work and we know it does not work . <p> The only lessons that matter are the lessons we learn from thinking from the inside with another living critchur . To me , anyway , that works , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long about where you 're going . The ferals have taught me a lot on that score , simply because there is no point in fighting them -- they 'd win any fight . Love them , listen to them , pay attention , and they learn very very slowly to love back . <p> I 'm sure that my countertops are unsanitary . I figure that gives me a more robust immune system . *wink* <p> I never tried to " discipline " my cats , because instinctively I knew it would n't work on them . Or it might work for a bit , then they 'd get revenge . Having seen what my sister-in-law 's cat did to her wardrobe ( dragged clothes off hangers onto the floor and pissed all over them ) in revenge for something , I decided early on to concede defeat and just wash the counters off any time I wanted to use them . And strangely enough , my cats never spent a lot of time on the counters . Only when I brought shopping bags home and they could n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love all the comments here , too . Like you say , skdadl , about thinking inside along with another and listening to them and paying attention ... in order to work out arrangements that individuals with different needs can really accept ... it takes the ability and the willingness to identify with others , to really feel with their needs and point of view enough to be able to honour them . ( I shudder to use the word honour these days -- I feel it 's been so hijacked into trite new age usage . But it 's still a good word . ) <p> For me the question is : why can some people be willing to respectfully feel into where someone else is coming from whereas other people either can not or wo n't ? If I may be so presumptuous , I think a lot of why we 're so stuck in the world hangs on that . <p> I 've been learning an awful lot over the past decade or so about emotional trauma and its effects on people spiritually , psychologically , and physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatized , they can not look without fear and distrust . Terror informs their way of seeing . It 's not about choice of perspective . They do n't have rational control over their way of seeing , and if , out of the best of intentions , they do try to override their fear-based viewpoint and look more broadly at things , it does n't last long before they careen into reactivity again . <p> So I look at the situation in the Middle East and I see two horribly traumatized peoples , both of whom have been historically reviled and shat upon by lots of other people in the world , and now each perceiving each other as the present threat and reacting out of that and attacking the other who becomes even more traumatized and so it gets deeper and worse instead of resolving and starting to get better as it needs to . <p> I think , brebis noire , that trauma explains why the accumulated experiences of millennia do n't seem to make a difference . Somehow , the trauma has to heal -- has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be ready to look at things differently . But how will this happen ? <p> Thinking from the inside is something only individuals can do , so I 'm idly supposing that 's why we do n't do it as a society , or as a species . So-called " groupthink " makes it easier to discount individual experiences of suffering and trauma , and chalk the use of force up as being better for the common good ( of one side , naturally ) . <p> As for the Middle East , Israel in particular did not allow its traumatised generation to voice its suffering , except when it was done within an approved " official " narrative . This narrative thus became useful for the next generations to conveniently forget a wealth of understanding , and to operate in similar ways to those who oppressed and tortured Jews in Europe . <p> And of course animals are never able to express their suffering in written or oral history , so their story only gets told by sympathetic humans who take the time to listen and understand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different personalities . When Willow and Iris were little I would make a small hissing noise to indicate displeasure and I could tell they both got it right away although sometimes I would have to pick them up and put them on the floor . Willow would lie in wait for me to enter the kitchen and then jump up onto the counter and off again very quickly just to get away with it while Iris never did . Thing is -- much human activity does n't take place at cat level and standing at the counter cooking is quite a lovely opportunity for a visit when you get home from your day so now I allow them their spot on the edge of the counter to watch the proceedings -- Iris happy just to sit , Willow predictably reaching out the occasional paw to see if it will elicit a hiss . Humans who do n't care for this cooking arrangement are free to eat elsewhere . <p> " the use of force is nearly always a missed opportunity " Yes . Moreover the use of force also often appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , Alison -- very much like people when you start to analyse it . This morning , I had to take my " top cat " off the countertop because he was in the way -- since the arrival of cat no. 4 he 's taken to perching on the countertop more often , and appreciates the taste of fresh dripping water from the tap -- anyways , he looked at me with an expression that said " what the HELL do you think you 're doing ? " and he jumped right back up . Four times in fact , until I gave up , laughing . I learn to work around him , and it gives him a great opportunity to express his affection by head-butting . <p> When I remove cat no. 3 from the countertop , he just lollops away as if to say , " ya , I know , stop nagging ! " My other two cats do n't even try ( unless it 's to lick the butter , which is a no-no for everybody ) . <p> I sometimes use the hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every cat , to stop them from scratching , for example , but for some

##3173250 <h> Search <h> Catching you up on the past couple of weeks . <p> So , my last blog post was about going out with a guy who really " got " me . He was cool with all the projects I do . Well , I did see him again later that week and let 's just say : Things got a little creepy . <p> He plays softball , and was going to come over after a game . He also loves horror movies and I had told him about " A Serbian Film , " which is pretty much the sickest movie I have ever seen . He showed up with a laundry basket and asked to use my shower . <p> *screeching brakes* <p> What ? You are coming to my house for the first time and you want to hop in my shower ? He said he 'd feel more comfortable being around me after playing softball that he wanted to take a shower . Ugh . Why not just take one before you come over ? So , he showered , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually hoping he was going to take off . I just go a weird vibe . He also brought over some drinks , which is cool with me . I personally do not drink . but I am not weird around it and it does n't bother me . Except that this was some sort of beer but margarita-flavored with 8% alcohol and smelled DISGUSTING . I kiss guys all the time after they 've had a few drinks , and I 've never been repulsed by it , until that night . It even tasted gross ! I loved margaritas Back In The Day , but this was just gross . This was a Wednesday night , by the way . <p> So , he called Thursday , but I kept the conversation short . On Friday morning , he texted me , asking what I was doing for the weekend . I told him I already had plans ( true ) and his response ? You wo n't believe this : <p> " Do n't forget your vows . " <p> We had made a few marriage jokes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right then that he was at least a little serious . <p> *screeching brakes* <p> He had Googled me and it seems he was going to become a little obsessed with The Fabulous One , but not likely Amy . I do n't like that one bit . I have n't seen him since . He has called a couple times and will send a good morning text a couple times a week , but we have n't had any conversations about seeing each other again . I just do n't " feel it . " <p> That week , I also went out with a SUPER sweet guy . He 's probably the nicest guy I have ever gone out with in my life . He 's older than I am by a few years , but it 's not a big deal to me . He works the overnight shift , so it is kind of nice to not be smothered . But , he ca n't drive . He has very mild diabetes , but did n't know it until a couple years ago . His vision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car . He made a HUGE effort to come see me on First Friday . He took a bus and the lightrail , and we walked around CenPho for a couple hours . It was a really awesome time . I saw him again a week later &; made him dinner . Again , he took the lightrail to get here . I have no issue with it , really , because he 's not expecting me to drive him around . I did drive him home both nights though , but after I had to insist profusely . He does n't live too far , either , so that 's cool . I have n't really talked to him this week , though . I love talking on the phone with him because he has such an awesome sense of humor . He 's also got a vibe that kind of soothes me . I hope to see him again , but I 'm not sure he wants to . <p> Tonight , though , was the most fun I have ever had on a first date . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . He was cool with me not drinking . Some guys just are n't . They get uncomfortable . Anyway , he 's hysterical and I could totally be my snarky self . He actually used the word " snarky , " and a lot of people do n't even know that word . He asked if we could go out again , and we are set for Monday . He is leaving Tuesday for several days for work and wants to see me before he leaves . I really had too much fun tonight ! It was an early night , too , which is good . He 's got ta get up 
##3173552 <h> This Just In : There is no Obesity Epidemic ! <p> Addendum : I just had to share this with y'all:When I informed BuddingStarlet that there was no longer an Obesity Epidemic , she said : " What ! No more epidemic ? ! We should have a funeral and bury it . I mean ... if we are , we should wear black . It makes you look slimmer , dont'cha know . " Heh . I should probably find some better friends . <p> About 33 percent of men and 35 percent of women were obese . The new rates were slightly higher than the 31 percent and 33 percent reported in 2003-2004 surveys . <p> However , in generalizing the results to the U.S. population , researchers calculated a margin of error that swallows up the differences between years . In other words , the increases were not considered statistically significant . <p> Emphasis mine . Now see , folks have been saying for quite some time now that there is no such animal as the Obesity Epidemic . And now , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , but y'know governmental folks have to skate around the truth ) we see ... no significant changes in the levels of obesity . So in other words ... we folk in the Fat Acceptance movement were right . We were right to question these so called numbers ; right to call shenanigans on the " ever-rising level " of obesity in the States . Because THERE IS NO EVER RISING LEVEL . I mean , it 's not as if folks are leaving home thin , going into convulsions , and dropping to the ground ... only to arise much plumper than they used to be . I mean , it 's not like if I sneeze on you , you 're gon na immediately become chubby , right ? Oh , right . Well , apparently , it ai n't always catching ( perhaps there 's an immunity as yet undiscovered ? ) , because if it 's gon na be called an epidemic , it should be spreading like wildfire . However , that 's just not the case . <p> But , as always , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because just like when we found out being overweight was n't a death sentence , but it STILL IS UNHEALTHYOMG ! ! ! ! , we have been warned : <p> The rates are still too high , said Mark Swanson , a researcher who studies childhood obesity and school nutrition at the University of Kentucky 's College of Public Health . <p> " Until the numbers start to go the other direction , I do n't think we can consider this a success at all , " he said . <p> Well . It took these folks a while to admit there was no epidemic .

##3177050 <p> I was looking through an article in Time Magazine recently and came across an article about healthcare reform .

There are very few people at the table who regularly see patients . There are also very few who represent patients without a particular axe to grind ( elderly , people with chronic disease or disabilities ) . <p> But healthcare is about what goes on in the exam room . The entire point of healthcare is health care ; it is about the care of the patient . It is n't about the business , the drugs , the delivery system , or the insurance industry ; it 's about optimizing how the system makes sick people better and keeps better people from becoming sick . Everything else is a means , not an end . <p> But those of use who are in the exam room are soon to be served up on the menu for the sake of political gain and special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good plan , and they may or may not have good intentions .

They are serving up a dinner of food they do n't know about and they wo n't have to eat what they cook . How can they make good decisions ? <p> A step in the right direction would be to listen to bloggers . As opposed to the lobbyists and pundits inundating Washington , we actually do healthcare . The doctor and patient blogs on the web represent the interests of the people who are in the middle of the healthcare universe . This universe does n't have Washington DC at its center , it has the patient and those who care for him or her . <p> A good parallel is the crisis in Iran .

They do n't give the entire perspective , but getting a true perspective is impossible without talking to them . <p> Do n't just listen to me ; I represent a specific point of view , and do n't represent that of patients or specialists fully . Do n't just listen to patient blogs , as they often do n't have a clear understanding of the business of medicine or the complex medical realities ( although I know some of them do know an awful lot ) . We need to force ourselves to the table . We need to give perspective that has previously been invisible . <p> Blogging matters because it gives perspective that could never come from anywhere else .

##3178752 <h> The ten principles of guitar design , Part 8 , Details <p> This is Part 8 of a 10 part series , applying Dieter Rams ' " 10 Principles " to guitar design . Just as we did in previous installments , we should understand that these principles were just one designer 's opinion as to how to evaluate their work , and that they 're presented in their original order assuming that there is no particular importance to that order . <h> Principle #8 : <h> Good design is thorough down to the last detail <p> " Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance . Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user . " <p> I assume that since Dieter uses the word " nothing " , he must mean that he 's not only addressing aesthetic design elements , but also functionality . I 'm guessing he might extend this principle through to the engineering of the actual product . This is another Principle that guitar designers and builders compromise on a regular basis , sometimes out necessity but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first to plead guilty to this charge , though , as I 've left some design details to be finalized later during the fabrication process . There have been times when my failure to think through all the details in the design stage have left me with something that just did n't look 100% right as it left the bench . <p> When a detail is out of place , it shows . <h> The Wisdom of Planning <p> Failing to Plan means planning to fail , and an incomplete plan is better than none . I do n't know who came up with those quotes originally , but in my experience they 're spot on . This should n't come as a surprise to anybody who has designed and built a few guitars , as the process of Design itself is a form of planning . If you have n't thought through all the details , how they fit together with other elements , and how you 're going to fabricate it , then you have n't finished your plan and therefore have n't finished your design work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including something that looks like a Bill Of Materials and Production Routings . A manufacturer has to know what it 's going to cost to produce parts , what they need to source , and a plan to maintain consistency . A good plan can have a positive effect on efficiency in production , and help ensure things are fabricated in a way that you had intended them to . <p> Strat neck blueprint with dimensions and some tooling notes . <p> Planning for Art , Craft , and Custom building is a bit more forgiving . For example , it maybe enough to know what kind of screws will be used , but not necessarily what type of head or their exact locations since the designer is often the builder , too . In other cases , it might be critical to know that information and detail it in the plan . Sometimes it 's just better to avoid " Paralysis by Analysis " and get on with the work . For custom luthiers , there will be times when a plan does n't survive contact with the realities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improvise , and overcome to move the build forward . <p> To adhere to this Principle , the guitar designer must take responsibility for every detail of the Design . This includes the materials used , the parts sourced or fabricated , the integration of all the design elements , sequence of operations in production , adaptability throughout the instrument 's life cycle , and it 's transport . There are designers that prefer to leave details to the builders after they 've come up with the Concept and perhaps a nice sketch . Dieter might say that they 've purposely scored low on this particular Principle . <p> The Boeing 777 has been described as " Three million parts flying in close formation . " As incredibly complex as the design for a commercial jetliner is , it 's critical that every part works smoothly with everything else . Given the expense of fuel and the demands for efficiency , there 's little room on board for any component that literally does n't pull it 's weight . Everything has to serve a functional purpose , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engineered thoroughly , down to the last rivet . <p> Guitars are not as complex as jet airliners . I would suggest , though , that it would n't hurt to use the 777 example when thinking through your design work , evaluating how everything fits and functions together , and figuring out what is simply dead weight . <h> Details That Fit the Concept <p> In a good guitar design , everything fits together both physically and aesthetically . Every design element looks like it belongs and integrates well with the other elements . It does n't mean that the details themselves need to be complicated . This is another Principle that meshes well with the " Appeal to Simplicity " as it makes the work much easier to integrate the design details within a cohesive Concept if it 's straightforward . <p> Heel detail matches the binding and purfling in material and fit <p> It 's important to consider the functional details as well as the aesthetic details in the plans . Every design element has to co-exist with other design elements . For example , cavities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or expose other design elements . The classic example is in the neck join area where the presence of a pickup route can weaken the join if it 's not properly planned . Another is a roundover of the back that would intersect the planned control cavity or cover . A detailed plan would help prevent such an unfortunate situation . Details such as dimensions , centerlines , center points , and construction notes are much easier to do in a drawing application , but can also be handled with pencil and paper . <p> An example of detailed planning <p> I ca n't think of a single guitar design I 've done that was 100% on it 's first pass . None of them survived entirely intact through the build , either . At least this Principle gives you an opportunity and reminds you to check all the details , evaluate them , then make adjustments in subsequent iterations of the design . <p> Nothing should look to be " tacked on " , out of place or added as an afterthought . Every detail should fit within the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may argue that the guitar should have a pickguard as it serves a functional purpose , namely protecting the face of the guitar , even if it 's on a pre-relic'ed instrument . It 's not covering any control or pickup cavities , wiring channels , or other functional duties , but at least it follows the outline of the body . Others might say that it looks like it 's there just because somebody thought that it 's ancestral lineage dictates that it must have a pickguard , so put something on there even if it 's not otherwise required . Does it really need to protect the horn , or are they doing that just because it 's that way on their other instruments ? <p> Does a pickguard fit the Concept ? <h> Reality Presents Important Details , Too <p> All consumer products are meant to be used , but musical instrument design presents additional challenges in meeting the objective and subjective criteria of the user . Guitars are by their very nature " high-touch " experiences and also engage multiple senses when in use . Everything must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are numerous design elements that can be critical to the success of an instrument 's performance . Examples of such elements are fret end treatments , upper fretboard access , balance , fingerboard radius , control layouts , weight , and tuning stability . These details can also be dependent on the genre of music and respective player preferences , too . <p> There are also the minor details of money and availability . Both have to be considered when planning and evaluating the detail specifications in the plans . If you specify a part and it 's simply not available at a reasonable price that keeps the instrument within a budget constraint , then you 're going to have to specify something else . Then you 'll have to think through any potential interactions it has with other parts and design elements , and also have to evaluate how it fits in with the overall Concept 's aesthetics . <p> I like to think that a guitar that gets used is a happy guitar . Like anything else that gets used , it 's going to require some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as string changes , compensation adjustments , tremolo spring tension adjustments , truss rod adjustments , an so on . A good designer is going to think about these things and make sure that they can be easily done . All of us have seen a Stratocaster that has had its tremolo cover removed from it 's back , done so because it makes string changing easier . Just as you would n't enjoy changing spark plugs on a car that requires the engine to be removed first , you 'd prefer that all adjustments can be made without taking the guitar apart . It would n't kill us to think of how to make things easier for a repair person in the future . <p> Guitars typically need to be transportable , and some thought should be given to how the player is going to get it from point A to point B in one piece . Custom cases are always an option , at least as long as time and money are n't a problem for you . Otherwise , designing to fit an existing case type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed a lot . Another one that is getting increasingly more important is planning for the instruments demise , making sure that everything can be 
##3180050 <h> That Kind of High <p> ... It was about 4:45 am and I was alone . I had been up all night after a show , chain smoking , guzzling hard liquor and beer and doing cocaine . The sun would be up soon , all the coke was gone , and something was terribly wrong with me . My heart was beating like a jackhammer , I was sweating bullets , and I felt for sure that I was having a heart attack . My whole life flashed before my eyes , and my first thought was how upset my mom would be that it all ended this way . This is n't how I wanted to die ; it was n't how I wanted my story to end . With trembling hands I picked up the phone and dialed 911 ... <p> Here 's how my story began ... <p> My father was an alcoholic who was verbally and physically abusive to my mother . They divorced when I was 8 , and it had a huge impact on me . My mother had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father was no longer around . So I became a latch key kid , left alone much of the time with nothing to do but eat for comfort . I began overeating and became an obese child . I spent most of my childhood overweight ; picked last for sports , called every name in the book , teased by the boys and shunned by the girls . Of all of my addictions I would least wish obesity on anyone , especially as a child . What sets it apart is that it 's the one addiction everyone can see . <p> I was obese for most of my formative years , in fact , all the way through high school until I turned 17 . That summer , my mom came up with the idea to send me to live with my Uncle Pete in Hawaii . He was energetic , upbeat , physically fit and motivating , and I think she thought he would rub off on me . She was right . Upon making it to the islands , my uncle had me working , painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables . I began to melt off the pounds , and with my skin tan and hair bleached from the sun , I returned for my senior year in high school a new person -- 60 pounds lighter than when I left 2 months before ! <p> Life changed immediately for me ... <p> ... and I wanted to catch up on all the fun I had missed out on . I wanted to experience everything I could , and experimenting with new things became my hobby . I had lost a lot of weight , and eating was no longer a crutch , but it did n't take me long to trade that addiction for a few other nasty habits : drinking , smoking and drugs . I 've never been one to do anything in moderation , so these habits quickly raged out of control and became addictions themselves . I was n't aware that I was being self-destructive ; I just thought I was young , wild and free -- doing what kids do . I believe that most addictions to alcohol and drugs begin from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the intention to ruin their life . <p> While in Hawaii , I discovered something else that would greatly impact my life : my uncle 's acoustic Ovation guitar . I learned a few chords from a Creedence Clearwater Revival songbook , and tried to put some of my poetry to music . This was one case where my addictive behavior served me well , I could n't put the guitar or the notebook away . It was like my whole childhood was flooding out of me through music . This felt like real power to me , and I could n't get enough . The release of opening up and letting out all of the negative energy through music was something I had never experienced before , and something I would never let go of . <p> I had always known I wanted to be a performer , even when I was picked on for being fat . I did n't really have any natural talent , but I did love music , and I had a burning desire to thrust myself into the spotlight . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the class clown . My personality was finally starting to come out , and I was making new friends and feeling popular . I was also known for bringing my guitar along and playing at every high school party . I remember many a moonlit night down by " the cliffs , " a secluded area overlooking the Chesapeake Bay where we 'd have bonfire parties . I 'd strum my guitar and my friends would sing along while we dangled our feet over the edge of the cliffs , looking at the moon on the water and the lights of the Bay Bridge off in the distance . These were good times , and I was very disappointed when they started building large waterfront estates on those cliffs . I thought I would never see them again . <p> During this time I started drinking heavily , doing a lot of illegal drugs and trying to " expand my mind . " I followed my heroes like Jim Morrison , Jimi Hendrix and Jerry Garcia . I probably should have considered the fact that they were all dead from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even so , I managed to get into a band with some friends from high school . We called ourselves Laughing Colors . I think the other guys in the band saw potential in me , but I know they had some reservations about my behavior . Still , we started playing on a regular basis and quickly drew a following . I guess that being a musician is one job where you can get away with being a complete mess , at least for a little while . It was only a matter of time before I would eventually screw that up as well . <p> My breaking point came after being in the band for a few years . Playing music was now our full time job , and for me it was a non-stop party . We would do four or five gigs during the week , but drinking and drugs were a daily routine . It all started to melt together -- the days , the nights , the shows , the people , the drinks and the drugs . On some level I though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that I had to go through this to understand what music and stardom where all about . How pathetic . That theory all came crashing down one cold night in late winter . That 's when I called 911 ... <p> I had been up all night drinking and doing coke when everything came to a screeching halt . At sometime just before 5am I thought for sure I was having a heart attack . I somehow managed to get to a phone and call an ambulance , and the ambulance came and took me to the emergency room . I was scared and lost , and I was sure I had ruined my life . I waited in a hospital bed , and when the doctor finally came in he asked me if I had been using drugs , if I thought I had a drug problem , and if I 'd like to get some help . I answered YES to all of them . <p> A shift in perception ... <p> Just like my trip to Hawaii , my life was about to completely change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . There were all kinds of people in there -- rich and poor , young and old , black and white , Christians and atheists . I knew the band would n't want me back if my actions did n't change . I also knew it was time to change my life again , and since I had lost all of that weight as a teenager , I knew I could beat drugs and alcohol as well . It was just a matter of making up my mind to do it , and creating something better for myself than a life of misery . <p> So I rejoined the band with renewed commitment -- clean and sober . At first I was scared that the energy and confidence that I had might disappear without alcohol and drugs . Nothing could have been further from the truth . The band was better than ever , and a river of inspiration came flowing out of me . Once again I had shifted my perception of myself instantaneously , and the results of my new outlook began to show . I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you become . It is a greater determining factor than race , gender , age , upbringing , education , or economic background . One of Dyer is " when you change the way you look at things , the things you look at change . " <p> Life continued this way for a while , and the band enjoyed a high level of independent success . We sold 80,000 CDs on our own and played to packed houses on a regular basis . We had regular radio play on 98 Rock Baltimore , while our albums were produced by Mitch Allan , the singer/songwriter for SR-71 who wrote the smash hit " Right Now , " and co-wrote Bowling for Soup 's chart topper " 1985 . " We were selected personally out of hundreds of bands to work with the legendary producer Eddie Kramer , who worked with Led Zeppelin and countless others , but is best known for being the Electric Lady Land producer for Jimi Hendrix . <p> Life was good . But I could n't help to think that there was something missing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was supposed to learn and teach to others , I just had no idea what the lesson was . Playing night after night completely sober for a crowd that was stoned and drunk began to wear on me , and during this time I relapsed . I was n't out of control to the extent that I was before rehab , but the occasional slip up was letting me know that deep down , all was not well . I ca n't say that life had become unmanageable again , but I felt like there was something missing in my life . <p> Eventually I felt my urge to play and write music all but disintegrate . That was a very sad time . The thing that I loved most in this world was starting to feel like drudgery , and I just did n't have the same drive to " make it big , " or wait around for some record label to come along and make all of my dreams come true . All of that seemed so unimportant . I was tired of wondering what the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finally break through . It felt so disempowering , like giving someone you 've never met complete control of your life . I decided it was time to start growing up and settling down , and after falling in love with the girl of my dreams , it was time to start a family . <p> Meghan and I got married and bought a World Gym fitness center with a partner . I thought it was time to be serious and think of our future security . Shortly thereafter , Laughing Colors played a sold out farewell show , and decided to amicably call it quits . I went from staying out late five nights a week in music venues , to getting up early , strapping on my Nike cross trainers and fitness gear , and working at the gym 60 hours a week . It was a shock to my system , but I ignored the yearning in my heart to play music and tried to get used to it . I quickly discovered that you can only ignore your heart for so long . <p> The fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expecting it to be . We did n't see eye-to-eye with our partner on business matters , and it became a stressful place that we dreaded everyday . Eventually our partner bought us out , but that left Meghan and I without jobs and no immediate backup plan . It seemed like one minute I was in a rock band living my dreams , and the next I was out in the cold with no idea of what to do next . At the same time , we had been trying to get pregnant for a year and a half with no luck . That can be stressful enough , but with everything else going on it really started to weigh on us . <p> Just when things seemed like they could n't get worse , Meghan 's beloved grandmother passed away unexpectedly , and it was n't long after that that my father died as well . Years of drinking and smoking had finally taken their toll on him , and he died a broken , shell of a man . My greatest motivation for being sober was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragic thing to watch one of your parents waste away to nothing , but there can be no greater lesson learned . Sometimes a good example of what " not to do " is the best road map you can have . <p> Meghan and I are n't the kind of people who ever feel sorry for ourselves , and we never ask " why me ? " We both knew that something very special would come out of this difficult time , and our growing spiritual journey gave us reassurance of that . The same week my father died we got a call from the hospital . The test came back positive , Meghan was pregnant . We were finally going to be parents . The circle of life had come back around . <p> I knew that I owed it to my wife , my child and myself to get back to doing what I really loved -- playing music . This time , I wanted the music to serve a purpose and to help others who are less fortunate . Despite what you hear daily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . There are more opportunities than ever before to do what you are passionate about and share you gifts with the world . You are not limited by your age , color , income , religion or gender -- you are only limited by your own thoughts , beliefs , and actions . <p> After I recorded my first solo album , I met a man named Rick Rathmann and his wife Mary Anne , and we quickly became friends . They saw at a show that I was offering proceeds of my CD to a local charity and offered a generous donation way above and beyond what I was hoping for . Rick ran his family 's foundation so I began to pick his brain about how I could give back and involve my music . He is a successful venture capitalist , but also one of the most humble , unassuming , and kind human beings you would ever come across , so I valued his insight and his friendship . When he called me one day to ask if I could help him write a song as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored . <p> I had never been to Rick 's home before , but when he sent me his address I knew I was familiar with the area . As I drove down his long driveway I realized exactly where I was headed , back to " the cliffs . " Rick lived in one of the waterfront estates that sat atop the same ground where we had moonlight bonfires years earlier . I thought I would never set foot on that ground again , but when I pulled up I got out of my car and took a deep breath ; looking at the sun make diamonds on the water , and the majestic Bay Bridge off in the distance . It was like coming home again . <p> My collaboration with Rick proved so inspiring for the both of us that we decided to record an album , and enlist the help of my old friend Mitch Allan . Mitch had become a very successful producer in LA and has had a hand in selling over 10,000,000 albums . I also called up another old friend , Kevin Kadish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lives in Nashville . Rick and I got enough material together for a 5 song EP and decided it would be the first release on his new label , KETS Records . <p> Somewhere along this journey I figured out what my message was , and it 's clear and simple : everyone has the right to find their purpose and to live it . If we commit to doing something that we are really passionate about -- something that makes us excited and grateful to be alive -- there will be no need to fill the void with food , cigarettes , alcohol , drugs , spending , gambling , etc . <p> Would you like to know what your purpose is ? The answer is obvious . <p> It 's the talents , skills and passions that you were born with . It 's the loftiest dream in your heart , and it 's the peak of your imagination . It 's the person you dreamed of becoming as a child but somehow convinced yourself that you do n't deserve to be now . It 's what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine the perfect scenario without any concern of what " they " might say or how it would look on the outside . It 's the realization that this life is not a dress rehearsal , and if you do n't follow your dreams because you 'd rather live a " secure " life , then you will teach your own children and future generations by example that they do n't deserve to live up to their fullest potential either . <p> This is the most exciting time to be alive in human history . A time where we are slowly waking up to the fact that we each control our own lives , destinies and happiness . Do what you love to do . Follow your dreams .

##3183651 <h> Microsoft Walks Away from the Yahoo Deal <p> Unless you were in a cave over the weekend , I 'm sure you 've seen that Microsoft has walked away from its 40B+ Yahoo acquisition attempt . I 've largely avoided the topic , but do have some commentary now . Note that many people think this is just a posturing attempt by Microsoft and that 's entirely possible . First let me say that I think the merger would have been spectacularly bad for Microsoft . The cultural and integration issues alone would have been nearly unsurmountable . Would the mail portion of the deal even have gotten regulatory approval ? How many high profile departure would you have seen ? How many projects that really give Yahoo much of its street credibility would have been crushed ? I 'm not sure that Flickr , delicious , Zimbra and many others would have gone to Microsoft given the choice . That being said I think the deal would have been bad for Yahoo as well . Microsoft has had a terrible track record on the web and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way I saw the deal being feasible would be if Microsoft spun things out into a fully autonomous company . I did n't see any indication that was going to happen . <p> On to Ballmer , I really think this underscores the fact that he needs to go if Microsoft is going to turn itself around . He seemed to have no coherent plan here . It almost seems if he woke up one day really wanted Yahoo and just did n't think it through . Microsoft wants to compete with Google so bad they seem to be getting irrational . It 's clear they ca n't do this organically , but I really do n't think Yahoo was the answer . <p> Next come the shareholders . There 's already a ton of speculation that this will result in shareholders lawsuits . To me that makes no sense for a couple reasons . First , as a shareholder it will distract the company and further drive down the price of the stock . The more tragic part though is the current state of the street . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few people take the long view anymore . Unless you 're day trading , if you invest in a company you should be looking at the long term . That means trusting management . IMHO shareholder lawsuits should be reserved for gross negligence and other egregious acts . We remain far too litigious and it 's going to come back to haunt us . FWIW , the stock currently sits in the mid-24 range , which makes it down about 12% . That 's not nearly as bad as some people were speculating . MSFT is up mildly . <p> On to morale . Most people within Microsoft seem to be happy about the deal falling through . Many jobs have been saved and they get to keep their $43B cash horde . This happiness may wear off as soon as they realize they still are not effectively competing in the space , but with that much cash they should be able to figure something out . Things are n't as clear at Yahoo . Yang and co are clearly happy , but the rest of the staff seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take Yahoo having a couple very good quarters or making a really compelling announcement for that to change if I had to guess . It 's been a long few months if you work at YHOO . <p> So were do things go from here ? There has been talk of Yahoo grabbing AOL . I ca n't see that making any sense , but let 's hope Yahoo does n't do it just to look like they 're making moves . MySpace seems a little more reasonable . I also see reports that Yahoo should buy back a bunch of stock . At first glance that makes a ton of sense , since the board clearly thinks the stock is way undervalued at the moment . With only $2.5B or so in cash though , they wo n't be able to make a big enough dent to really make it worth while . The money could almost certainly be spent better elsewhere . <p> Some additional thoughts : * This deal would have been really bad for Open Source . Zimbra is the first thing that comes to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they get credit for . * It looks like Bill Miller and a couple other huge holders would have gotten behind a deal in the $35 range . If Microsoft really wanted the company , they almost surely could have had it . * It will be interesting to see if Yahoo moves forward with the Google outsourcing , or if that will prove to simply have been posturing. * Yahoo must have made it really clear that if Microsoft went hostile , that they would poison pill themselves to death . We do n't get too many of these in our industry and Yahoo is actually setup poorly to defend against a proxy fight , since everyone comes up for election at once . <h> Like this : <h> 2 Responses to Microsoft Walks Away from the Yahoo Deal <p> * The more I think about this , the more I think a shareholder lawsuit of some sort was almost inevitable from the beginning . If the deal had gone through at say $36 or so it would simply have been on the MSFT side instead of the YHOO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the best quote I 've seen so far goes to Bill Morrison , Think Equity : " In what may likely to go down as one of the more destructive decisions for shareholder value in the history of Internet stocks ... To say we are disappointed is an understatement -- dispirited is more like it . " On a list that includes Webvan . Pets.com , Kozmo.com , Flooz , eToys , etc. this should n't even register a blip . It 's certainly possible that Yahoo will not deliver moving forward , but it 's certainly possible that they will . Let 's not be so quick to overreact here . <p> Also interesting to note that while the NASDAQ is slightly down since my last post , YHOO is actually very slightly 
##3184151 <h> Main menu <h> Do I love my iPad as much as I think I do ? <p> I 've had an iPad 2 for a bit more than a year . It is an amazing device , one that feels like it fell straight from the heavens . The touch screen is so responsive , and some of the apps are so very good . Like the iPhone , the learning curve for the OS itself and for decent apps is usually incredibly smooth . <p> Whenever I talk with people about other tablets like the Surface ( which I have n't seen yet ) or the Galaxy Tab ( which I own ) , I naturally to compare them to the iPad . Especially to the really excellent iPad experiences , which mostly center around a few well-made games plus Garage Band . Many similar apps on the Galaxy , for example , do n't really compare in my opinion . <p> I hold and give off this impression that I think the iPad is going to be hard to beat . Especially the newer retina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveted ) a few times . <p> But then when I really think about it , 95% of my iPad time is centered on exactly three apps : Safari , Facebook and Flipboard . The browsing experience on the Galaxy is really very comparable -- maybe even a bit better . I imagine it ca n't be too bad on Surface either . I 've never used Facebook or Flipboard on anything but the iPad . But they have to be about as good -- they are n't that complicated of apps , at least in the ways that tend to make some of the Android apps feel clunky . <p> So reducing the tablet experience to just a handful of apps , maybe I really could live with a different tablet if I had to .

##3187551 <p> Our Milky Way galaxy is an anomaly in more ways than one . And now , NASA scientists say they know exactly when it will come to an end . <p> In a universe that is forever spreading apart , the Milky Way has been moving closer to celestial neighbor the Andromeda galaxy . But whether we are in for intergalactic Armageddon or an extraterrestrial fender bender has been a mystery -- until now . <p> " Very interestingly , we find that Andromeda galaxy does appear to be coming straight at us , " said Roeland van der Marel , an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore . He was scheduled to speak at a NASA press conference Thursday . <p> The discovery was made thanks to images taken over the 22-year lifespan of the Hubble Space Telescope . But the quest to determine the Milky Way galaxy 's expiration date has been undertaken by astronomers for more than 100 years . Now , for the first time , NASA scientists say they know " with certainty " when our beloved galaxy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look like and how it will happen . <p> New data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope proves , NASA says , that in 4 billion years the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide or pass each other by so closely that the gravitational force each exerts on the other will cause them to slow down to the point of merging . The merger will be completed 6 billion years from now . <p> When galaxies collide <p> At the outset of universal existence , Andromeda and the Milky Way were each going their separate ways , van der Marel said . <p> " They have been approaching each other for the last 5 billion years , " he said . " For the first 8 billion years , they were moving away from each other , and now they are moving closer together -- and that will continue , always . " <p> In our local universe , which consists of around 50 galaxies , according to van der Marel , the Milky Way and Andromeda are goliaths . There are two galaxies that have around one-tenth the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1% . Each exists at the center of its own universal microcosm , with smaller galaxies swirling around similar to a solar system . <p> It is the massive gravitational pull that ultimately drew the Milky Way and Andromeda together , and will ultimately cause them to become one . <p> " The clear finding is , we are going to merge with Andromeda , " van der Marel said . " In the past , it was just a possibility , but now it is a known fact that this will happen . " <p> The finding was determined by comparing pictures of the sky taken by the Hubble Space Telescope over a number of years and comparing the movement of the galaxies , allowing scientists to determine the trajectory of the Andromeda for the first time . <p> There is a 9% chance that M-33 , a satellite galaxy of Andromeda , will hit the Milky Way first in what van der Marel called a " one-two punch , " causing it to become a satellite of the new galaxy that is formed . <p> What an intergalactic merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " really big cosmic pileup " that will light up the sky . <p> When the two galaxies hit , each containing its own set of stars and cosmic gases , the result will be the formation of many new stars -- all shining bright . <p> The Milky Way , as it exists now , is a flat disc shape similar to a frisbee . Andromeda is more spherical . When the two combine , they will form an " elliptical galaxy , " or what van der Marel described as a football-shaped galaxy . Rather than seeing a band of stars on the cosmic horizon , someone on Earth would theoretically be surrounded by them as shown in a simulation unveiled to show what the night sky will look like in 6 billion years . <p> The new vision of the stars wo n't be the only earthly changes . <p> " Our sun and Earth will go on a new journey through the universe , " van der Marel explained . <p> When Andromeda gets here , the sun will likely be pushed out much farther into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become too hot to be inhabited by humans anyway . <p> Our sun will not be directly hit when the initial collision happens in 4 billion years . But in 6 billion years , when the merger is complete , our sun will die . <p> Meaning in the cosmos <p> Life on Earth as we know it will certainly not be possible by the time this great galactic merger is expected to take place . But as van der Marel said , there are " many more uncertainties than the laws of physics , " and the human race may well have figured out how to carry on with existence . <p> " It 's a very long time from now , so people do n't have to lie awake or take out insurance , " van der Marel said . " What makes it really special is it is going to happen to us , it 's our sun , it 's our planet , and humans are really fascinated about what our fate is going to be . " <p> I read this in the Revelation Space series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens were relocating life forms in our galaxy so they would survive . But , none of us will be around to see it -- so who cares ? <p> The simple fact is that the human race will be long gone by then . We are having our time , just as the dinosaurs had theirs . I am thinking the bugs will have evolved to the point where they are running the place by then . There are FAR more bugs on the planet than people . I bet their god will look like a bug . <p> ... Eating a Milky Way bar now . I will most likely be working on the very instant we become one with the Andromeda Galaxy . By then my 401K which was reduced to a 101K should have grown . Beam me up Scotty ! <p> Read these comments below , i do nt know why some of you even read articles this .. we have the internet could be talking about important things . but 99% of the talk are bad jokes or religious and political propaganda . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust these " experts " as much as that wacko religious guy who has been predicting earth 's demise for the past 20 years and has been wrong every time . <p> In February , the experts confirmed the myan calendar did not say the world was supposed to end in December . <p> June 2 , 2012 at 4:37 am <p> Peter <p> Its amazing how many people really think that people are going to be around when the " sun explodes " or " dies " ..... have you ever seen those flies in the desert ? In Australia the inner out back rarely sees water , but once in a very long while , sometimes years in between , the water finally makes it inland .... the flies , or whatever they are flutter around a few short hours happy in their ignorance , sing dance eat drink mate lay their eggs and then quietly go off into the nothingness ..... its amazing to me to hear people compare themselves with the lives of Stars ! ! ! ! What a joke . Our civilization is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sacred , it is .... but we are flies , none the less ... if our civilization could last another five hundred years at this size , I would be very surprised , if I could live to talk and think at that time . We have already run up against the wall of the easy discoveries .... from here on end ... its the hard stuff all the way . <p> Actually , no . In as little as 1 million ( thats million , not billion ) the sun 's radiating temperature will increase and be strong enough to extinguish most if not all life on earth already . Little known fact that people ( except scientists ) tend to ignore . Oh , and this whole article is absolute rubbish , nothing will the " destroyed " , and any civilization that is existing at that time ( outside of our solar system ) will not " feel " anything as the gravitational effects between the stars is too weak to perturb any orbits . <p> Yes , you are quite correct . The Mayan calendar irrefutably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an new political party in the U.S. that will come to power in 2020 , and that they will mandate bananas in all school lunches . I , for one , will welcome our new simian overlords . <p> It 's too bad that our current species will almost certainly not be around to see this . Within the next 5 billion years the sun will have become a red giant and consumed the Earth and other inner planets . In geologic time people have been around for the blink of an eye and I do n't see many encouraging signs that they will be around much longer . But wow , what a cool view it would be as NGC 224 approached . <p> Star Trek had this figured out 30 years ago . It has taken government funded programs much longer to come to these same conclusions . The study of Quantum physics using the much maligned Gamma Theta Epsilon postulation put forth by Di Vinci in the 16th Century has already proven this but , was previously rejected by JPL astrophysicists . Consequently , efforts to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For those who are earth-bound , having your feet firmly planted on terracotta , does the term " Beam me up Scotty " have a ring of familiarity ? What does this mean for humankind ? Simply that as the two galaxies approach each other the opportunity for finding and traveling to another earth-like planet is increased exponentially . Earth 's resources will likely have been depleted long before the merger begins so , survival of the human species will hinge on our ability to monitor the cosmic events leading up to it while developing a timetable and the means to capitalize on this opportunity . This means once again , " Back to the Future " where Copernicus postulated his oft maligned Phi Tri-Gamma Alpha Codex which is the basis of Einstein 's theory of relativity . Let 's hope cooler heads prevail and we get this done right the first time . Only God knows if we 'll get a second chance . Tally Ho ! <p> Humanity will be long gone by the time this happens . Also , the article tries to deceive you into thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collision , but nothing could be farther from the truth . The Sun is going to die in approximately 3-5 billion years as its supply of hydrogen fuel is depleted , and regardless of whether Andromeda collides with us . <p> This study also assumes that the properties of the Universe are static , but they are not . We believe the universe is expanding , but we can not say with certainty whether the universe will continue to expand forever , or if it will ultimately reverse course and contract back into a primordial " head of a pin . " <p> There are still too many unknowns to declare anything that will happen billions of years from now . <p> The ultimate fate of the universe has actually become far clearer in the last ten years . Perhaps the most dramatic development in cosmology within that time has been the discovery that galactic recession is actually accelerating , utterly defying the conventional wisdom re . gravity and the known mass in the universe . This is currently attributed to " dark energy " . The universe is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which all particle activity ceases . Do n't hold your breath for this eventuality . It 's not due for the next google years . Just to picture how long that is : there are approximately 10 to the 85th power atoms in the known universe . This time scale will exceed that by a factor of a quadrillion . <p> Easy to make statements that the galaxy movement " will continue , always " and that a collision is going to happen " with certainty " billions of years from now . Wo n't be held accountable for your statements if inaccurate . <p> the earth will cease to be habitable in 1 billion years , the sun 's radiation output today is roughly 15% brighter than 1 billion years ago , and it will be 15% brighter than it is now in 1 billion years to come . this will make earth a lot like venus <p> There are technological solutions to the sun 's brightening over that lengthy time span . For example , billions of small reflective bits of metal could be placed in an orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ( so they would stay in the same relative place from earth as we go around the sun ) . The reflective bits could be scattered at just the right density to decrease the solar radiation hitting earth , to compensate for the sun 's slowly increasing brightness . Many things are possible over a billion years of time . <p> If the universe is supposed to include everything how can a universe be local ? Galaxies may contain up to 10 million stars for a dwarf to 100 trillion stars for a giant . There might be 170 billion galaxies in the universe . In addition dark matter is theorized to be a force which separates galaxies and keeps them from colliding . Also dark matter is theorized to be 4 times greater than all other matter . This article is confusing . <p> That said , " the universe " does not contain everything . Our universe contains everything from our big bang . If you believe in a multiverse though , and it certainly seems plausible , even likely , then there are many universes in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own universe . Space is infinite after all . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 3:12 pm <p> Adam Smith <p> I do n't think Congress should allow this mega merger . This will simply drive up prices for consumers . <p> I thought the Earth was only 6000 years old and we were all going to be raptured to paradise any minute now ... Was there a memo I did n't get ? My computer 's been down but somebody could have mentioned it at lunch ! <p> The Milky Way will not " end " ( as in disappear , or be destroyed , or such ) when we merge with Andromeda . In fact , very few , if any , stars will actually collide . Clouds of gas will , and that will result in new star formation . But the Milky Way will not " end " . It will become larger in combination with Andromeda , in fact . Maybe they will call the larger galaxy " Milky Andromeda " or " Andromeda Way " , who knows . But misleading headlines like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics , in my opinion . <p> It is my belief that everything that exists is part of an infinite cycle that has always been and always will be . In attempting to explain this , I believe there are 2 states that exist . These states are analogous to the binary system that comprises 100% of this computerized digital age . I am only comparing this with the 2 most basic binary digits , the 0 and the 1 . <p> To begin , the binary digit 0 represents the state of nothingness . Since the state of nothingness does n't contain anything then this state can be infinite ( i.e. an empty universe with no matter . ) The binary digit 1 represents the opposite state of nothingness , which is a state of something-ness . If there was n't an opposite state of nothingness then I would n't be sitting here typing this at this moment . Since there is a state of something-ness it must have also always existed , and will always exist . <p> I believe that " time " starts at moment 0 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitated together to form it 's next cycle . Since this cycle always has been and always will be then time only has meaning in the present cycle . As the matter in the universe contracts to a single mass ready to explode again to begin another cycle . At this point all matter has been reconverted to the state of something-ness exploding into a new universe . In this infinite cyclic theory then it does n't matter how much time it takes for the universe to expand out , expend it 's energy and be pulled back to reform the state of something-ness and begin it 's cycle again . Maybe just another way to explain the Big Bang theory . <p> @ karek40 No scientific theory states matter came from nothing . You imply there was a time before matter ; therefore it needs to ' come from ' somewhere . Setting the question up so you can ' disprove ' the concept is fail . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 3:12 pm <p> bob <p> yes you can , and hawkings radiation is proof of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter and hang around for as long as they would like . <p> The " Big Crunch " idea has been around for a long time . The two possibilities are Big Crunch ( gravity overcomes universe expanion ) or Heat Death ( expansion overcomes gravity , everything cools down and sits tight . forever . ) <p> Except that it is well known that all matter will NOT gravitate together eventually . The matter from our big bang is actually accelerating further and further apart forever . So much for your theory , sounded good till you got to that part . You 'll have to come up with another reason for the next state of nothingness to come about . <p> Hate to tell some of you , but I 've been to the Andromeda Galaxy ..... and it 's way way over rated . The people there are very strange with their little heads and long skinny legs . And the food ...... the . last time I ordered out , I had to complain about the pizza .... just not as good as on Earth . ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runny .... got it all over my new white shirt . And the ride ..... boy oh boy bring lots of water .... it 's a long ride . The people there also can change visible reality at will , so watch what you wish for . Hope this helps .... thanks , El Dar Con Giggidy . <p> Because the number of unknowns in predicting the trajectory of galaxies through largely empty space after collecting 22 years worth of data are fewer than the number of unknowns in knowing with 100% certainty what a localized weather pattern in a tumultuous environment will look like . <p> We have no way of knowing , with any degree of scientific certainty , if our whole known Universe is not just a tiny teeny spec in an infinite ocean of specs , inside some cosmic petri dish . In that sense , we are not much different from yeast , just before the fermentation process had reached 12% alcohol level . Be grateful , fulfilled and content in this moment . Enjoy your time in the Sun ! <p> May 31 , 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> May 31 , 2012 at 2:54 pm <p> Ykcyc <p> Collecting 22 years worth of data that is 2.5 million years old , my friend . A lot may have changed in that time , not to mention what can change in 6 billion years in this " static " universe . Perception is not the reality . <p> June 1 , 2012 at 8:35 am <p> matt <p> if a US marine sniper can hit a target a mile away , i 'm pretty sure scientists can calculate the path of 2 enormous galaxies ... andromeda is 228,000 light years across how hard can it be for people to figure out that as it gets larger in the nightsky , its coming towards us ? ! ? <p> It 's not especially difficult considering the scales involved . The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years wide , and is only about 2.6 million light years from Andromeda , so Andromeda is only 26 times further away than the width of our galaxy . This is nothing compared to the difficulty of landing a space probe on another planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is many orders of magnitude greater -- yet NASA has routinely accomplished this . <p> it 's not so much a matter of scale but about the understanding of universal laws . we also know about DNA sequences but do n't know what causes cancerous cells to grow ( similar scales ) . Mike is right -- using 22 years ( if that ) of observations from a single perspective to proclaim with 100% certainty what will happen in 4-6 billion years is senseless . Somehow scientists these days expect people to follow their ideas with blind faith . there used to be something called the scientific method where people understood that interpretation is part of the process of finding new explanations -- aka theories ( and they change with new knowledge/new perspective ) . If anyone thinks we ca n't possibly have more to learn about universal laws in the next 4 billion years , I would question their expertise as a scientist . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 11:25 pm <p> my2commoncents <p> The big bang was similar to a firework going off exploding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difference is in the universe we will not keep going forever into oblivion and burn out . Our mass and gravitational pull will eventually cause us to join other galaxies creating a bigger mass and gravitational pull . Until eventually the universe is pulled back into one massive sun that under immense gravitational pressure will explode like a super-supernova , and a rebirth of the universe will have recycled itself . <p> Well , except for that whole Dark Energy problem we ca n't explain . The universe is n't just expanding still , it 's expanding FASTER every day . It 's sorta funny how we find out more and more about our reality as we go on ... and just realized that there 's even more we do n't know because of it . <p> You are 100% wrong . Our universe is actually accelerating away from it 's origin to infinity . It is a well known and proven fact . The mechanism is not fully understood I do n't believe but it seems to have something to do with dark energy . <p> Rick . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 8 billion or so years our two galaxies were headed AWAY from each other and only in the last 5 billion years have they began heading toward each other . Seems to me , a lot can change out there in the universe so to use terms like PROVE and 100% seems a bit , well , ignorant . We can really only tell what is currently happening and what we expect to happen barring changes caused by forces we not only can not fully comprehend , but may not even be aware of yet . <p> Just because somebody says something will " always " happen does n't make it fact , however PROBABLE it may be . <p> How much can foods and water should I be hoarding ? Should I book a seat on that new space passenger ship that is in the news or can I wait ? Should I warn everyone else or is it , every person for themselves ? Can I bring a playboy mag with me ? <p> When I look at the picture of that galaxy ( even though it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how many millions , upon millions of lifeforms exist there . Amazing and so cool that life is not unique , and is actually so common and prevalent throughout the universe . <p> How did you conclude that ? We 're spending billions trying to figure that out and you somehow just were able to give us the answer for free ? ! Yay , there is prevalent life everywhere because Bub said so ! <p> Given that there are billions of planets and billions of galaxies in our universe alone simple statistics would indicate that if there is life on one there is a high likelihood there is life on others as well and zero evidence that there is not . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 3:30 pm <p> RdWtNBlu <p> Rick -- I agree with you in principle , but we have not yet proven it . We are desperately trying to prove it and I think we will at some point and I am excited about the prospect of such discovery . At this point we have nothing . There are billions of stars in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 4:53 pm <p> ObjectiveOpinion <p> Maybe this will be an opportunity to meet life from another planet without having to worry about the current speed limit of light . Even if face-to-face is not possible , perhaps communication will be possible . However , based on our brilliant track record of relations between people on this earth , I doubt we will last the 4 to 6 billion years necessary . <p> The picture of the galaxy is stated to be the Andromeda Galaxy . But it ca n't be . The Andromeda Galaxy is seen at much more of an angle from Earth . And the quality of the picture makes it appear the galaxy is small and far away since a picture of the Andromeda Galaxy , one of the brightest , easiest-to-see galaxies , would provide a much sharper image . Anyone know what galaxy this really is ? <p> The " photo " is an illustration intended to show what the sky might look like from a nearby vantage point as the galaxies are merging . It 's not showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong resemblance to the Andromeda we see today . <p> I do n't think I 'll be around in 6 billion years . Our sun will be gone as we know it in about 4 billion years from what I hear , so will it matter ? I do like to hear the theorys that they come out with though , it 's breaks up all the gloom and doom news that they run all the time about what 's happening on earth . <p> If Andromeda and Milky Way were first moving away from each other , what changed to have them colliding ? Are all galaxies moving at the same rate or are all of matter speeding up ( expanding universe ) at different rates . <p> Then there is the whole dark energy/dark matter . Too many questions to begin . My layman 's thought is that dark insert name moves faster than light and is the lead wave from the big bang center pulling our slower not-so-dark matter along . <p> Does not make sense unless we or Andromeda added mass 8M years ago . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change especially if we are expanding away from other galaxies . Condensation of matter into dense bodies does not seems it since the total mass would be the same . <p> Did Andromeda collide with another galaxy ? <p> May 31 , 2012 at 3:15 pm <p> Rick <p> Consider this TM . If you shoot something in the air it needs a certain velocity to break free of the earth gravity . If not it falls back , yet originally it was in fact moving away .

##3188851 <p> There was a time when I thought getting a tattoo was an act of rebellion , or maybe a way to express myself ... but never about expressing my love for someone else . But nowadays , folks are using body art to show their undying love for the man or woman of their dreams ... until their dream becomes a nightmare -- and celebrities are not exempt . Love does n't always last , so it 's a good thing there 's laser removal available . And since Hollywood romances can fade before the ink dries , you 'd think they 'd be more careful about permanently professing their love on their bodies . These stars thought getting tatted up meant forever ... until forever had gone away .

##3191350 <p> MINNEAPOLIS ( WCCO ) -- Minneapolis Police are asking Dinkytown businesses to reassess security as crime continues to rise in the area . <p> Police want bars and restaurants to hire their own security to deal with crowd control issues . They believe it 's the only way to prevent a riot , like the one that happened in 2009 during Spring Jam . <p> This once quiet , college neighborhood has become more of an entertainment district in the past decade . Dinkytown businesses are booming , and housing construction is on the rise . And the boom has brought crime . <p> Minneapolis Police hope to deter the bad guys by placing off-duty cops in bars and restaurants . There are more than 30 bars and restaurants in a four-block area . <p> Sgt. Stephen McCarty is concerned because Dinkytown has become a gathering spot for non-students , students from other colleges , and criminals who see students at the U as targets . <p> " Security is kind of very important because we 've also seen an increase in the aggravated assaults and robberies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just asking that security , the Dinkytown Business Association , help contribute to having more officers in the area .

Petraeus seated on what appears to be a first class jet chatting with each other . <p> Not that generals should travel coach , but you ca n't help but wonder if the trappings of life at the top of the military heap are so princely that the judgment of these men entrusted with the lives of so many , have become totally distorted ? <p> It 's not just Ward and Petraeus , but what of Gen.

##3191750 <p> As of this coming Monday , I will be starting my first job in professional baseball as the official team writer of the Detroit Tigers ' Class-A affiliate , the ... <p> Since starting this blog in December of 2007 , I have had the opportunity to meet a number of great people in baseball . Members of the Chicago Cubs front office , sports reporters , bloggers , players , etc and I have been plugging along using Prose and Ivy as a way to connect with Cubs/baseball fans , a creative outlet and a way to hopefully get my foot in the door of professional baseball . Each and every new person I have met and every article I have written on this site or other sites such as MLB.com , Baseball Digest and Vine Line Magazine among others , have served as motivation to keep pushing , keep writing and keep looking for an opportunity to land an opportunity to mix my professional experience in television production , sports writing , public relations , sales and marketing and passion for the sport and parlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballclub . <p> I 'm excited to say that the opportunity with the Tigers will allow me to not only write for the team on a regular basis , but also provide a chance to learn the business side of the game and the ins and outs of baseball operations . <p> This season , when Connecticut Tigers fans come out to the ballpark , they will have a chance to read content I write about the home team , the Detroit Tigers and the New York-Penn League . Throughout the year , fans will have an opportunity to read articles I write about a variety of different topics within those three categories on the team 's official website CTTigers.com . I have had meetings with independent league teams over the past few months and nearly landed an opportunity with one of them back in January -- something that if it had come to fruition , I would have been extremely grateful for . Of course , I am not sure where this opportunity with the Tigers could lead in the future , however the chance to work within a front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infrastructure tied to a storied franchise such as the Detroit Tigers is an opportunity I am very much looking forward to and ca n't wait to get started on . <p> The fact that our games will feature ballplayers that could be wearing a Detroit uniform in just a few years from now is something I am very excited about and looking forward to being a part of . This is an exciting time to be a Tigers fan ( certainly a more hopeful experience than that of a Cubs fan ) and while their MLB roster hardly needs a hand in dominating so far this season , to watch the players they believe to be the future of the franchise and have a hands-on experience working within one of my favorite parts of the game- the Minor Leagues- is going to be unbelievable . <p> In addition to writing for the Tigers , I 'll be learning a ton about the business side of Minor League baseball in serving as the team 's Box Office Manager for the 2012 season . Need a ticket to the game ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to the game ? I 'm your guy . Want to rent a suite for one of our upcoming games against the young talent coming up through the Red Sox , Astros , Nationals , Indians , Phillies , Pirates , Cardinals , Marlins , Blue Jays , Yankees , Mets , Rays or Orioles respective systems ? I 'm your guy . Need season tickets to enjoy a few months of quality baseball talent at affordable , family friendly prices complete with fun promotions and in-game family friendly entertainment ? I am your guy ! <p> The more the merrier clearly , so if you happen to be a Tigers fan who stumbles upon this article or simply a baseball fan that lives in the area , come check out the team this season at beautiful Dodd Stadium . I 'll have an opportunity to post pictures of the extremely impressive stadium throughout the summer months ( the season runs from June 18-Sept 5 ) , but for now , here 's a shot of the field from the team 's website : <p> While you 're at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The team decided to keep the Tigers name when they moved the team from Oneonta , NY to Norwich , CT in 2010 and the logo reflects the tie-in to the big league club as well . As you all very well know , the Detroit Old English Style ' D ' is one of the most recognizable logos in all of sports . I love the idea of turning it around practically and keeping the same font for the A-ball club in designing the logo around the Connecticut ' C ' . Here is a larger look at the team logo in royal blue : <p> Now that I 've posted it , I believe the more appropriate term would have been ' much larger ' look at the team logo . What can I say , I 'm psyched . <p> This site will of course continue to cover Chicago Cubs baseball for the 2012 season . <p> Will it feature a link or 100 here and there to material I write for the Connecticut Tigers , too ? The short answer ? Quite possibly , yes . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hope for here like always , however , I 'll also be sharing my experience with the Connecticut Tigers here over the course of the season . <p> Prose and Ivy and MLBlogs allowed me to kick-start any and all opportunities I 've had so far in sports writing in general , which means any of you reading this whether it is your first time here , or you 're Abracadabra ( the person that has left more comments than any other visitor to the site since 2007 ) , you have helped keep me motivated in my pursuit of a career in sports journalism/professional baseball and I appreciate it , so thanks ! <p> Looking forward to sharing my experience of working with the Detroit Tigers ' Class-A affiliate , the Connecticut Tigers this season ( and of course second guessing Sveum 's line-ups , debating when to change up the rotation , complaining about the bullpen , enjoying the opportunity to watch Theo work his magic 
##3192152 <h> What a beautiful day ... out in the " Sunshine " ... <p> Tonight , we are off to a bit of a late start , but hopefully we will be back on track tomorrow ! Tonight we watched Sunshine , a very awesome movie , for the most part , about a dying sun and our race to fix it ... I am going to try and synopsize , yet go through the movie without telling too much detail ... so deal with it cause it 's my first post ! <p> Ok ... So the first part of Sunshine had me turning up my TV to " 11 ? do we really need a dude with a monotonic voice beginning the film .. ? Not only monotonic but with a voice so low I had to rewind more than once .. ? Ok , Ok , back to the actual movie ... <p> The opening scene , minus the monotonic monologue was , to me , breathtaking . An image ( CGI ? ) of the sun , as it would appear if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUPER close if you know your astronomy .. The character Searle , played by Cliff Curtis , is in the " viewing " room looking at the sun . At first I thought that maybe he would be the villain , I kept trying to figure out what was going on with him most of the movie , because they kept taking shots of him sulking somewhere , or asking random questions ... I thought maybe the sun had hypnotized him or something ... With his all the time look of sunburnt peeling skin .. I guess you have to watch the movie to know if he is the villain ... The movie has its first twist with the cliche should we be humans or should we keep to the mission ? If you watch this , you , like I wanted to will scream at your TV , KEEP TO THE MISSION , FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE ! ! ! ! But alas , the movie would be all too short had that happened .. They go off mission , there are mishaps and hilarity ensues ... No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mission going terribly awry .. Time begins to move fairly quickly now in the movie and the team is forced to continue on to their new destination . A few more cliche moments , there is even a line in the movie about if they should be doing this .. ? It was something like , " are we all going to be killed by aliens on this ship ? " and then the all too familiar suggestion , " maybe we should split up ? " NO DO NT SPLIT UP FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE ! ! ! HAVENT YOU EVER SEEN A HORROR MOVIE BEFORE ! ! ! ? ? STAY TOGETHER FOR PETES SAKE ! ! ! ! But alas again , the characters split up and more things go awry .. ( Note : at this moment , when they are getting to this new place , be very mindful of the screen .. very creepy things happen .. maybe not creepy to you , but it always creeps me out when movies do this ... ) <p> A few crew members short now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of what they need until dun dun dun , HUGE twist , that you might see coming , like I did . I 'm not sure if the villain in this is a crazy person or the actual devil ... I got really REALLY confused because the shots kept shaking and blurring and I just wanted the screen to stop and have a clear picture .. I mean , I understand , weird crazy eyes are really creepy and shadows and blurry stuff .. But , so was the villain , or what I saw of the villain .. I think you only get one GOOD shot and it 's almost at the end ... I WAS NOT satisfied with the end at all .. I wanted boom smash pow , haaaah .. but no .. it was as if time stopped and they have the final scene on earth ... The entire movie was in space , it should have been finished in space with a final piece de resistance .... <p> In all a very good movie , not very horror , more psychological thriller/horror . It reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other space horro flick , minus the aliens ... INSANE cast , including Captain America , Rose Byrne , The Scarecrow , Michelle Yeoh , the guy who played Barry Winchell in A Soldier 's girl 
##3193751 <h> Fl/Ga Tailgate : There Was a Football Game ? <p> A sea of blue and orange and black and red took over Jacksonville on Saturday for what 's known to most as " The World 's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party , " as the University of Georgia and the University of Florida once again went head-to-head in a game of football . <p> As many college football fans know , the two teams do not share a lot of love for one another , but that does n't stop the annual meeting of the two schools from being the premiere tailgating event of the year . The fans put their rivalry aside for the duration of the cocktail party and the rivalry is done in a peaceful manner . <p> According to an Oct. 2011 article on the tailgate , the neutral-site game for the foes was first held in 1915 and has been held in Jacksonville ever since 1933 , except for 1994 when EverBank Field was being built .

Arriving a week early allows the RV owners to decorate their mobile homes with school colors and memorabilia before celebrating for seven days straight before the actual tailgate begins . <p> This is where the cocktail party starts , college students pouring as early at 7 a.m . Saturday to join in the festivities . Students from all over come to enjoy the tailgating and continue enjoying their favorite drinks throughout the day . <p> The post-game celebration has belonged to Florida in recent years , which has won 11 of the past 13 meetings .

##3194651 <p> Alex Baliles was at work in Winchester last week when he received an email about a pit bull with severe burns . <p> So he dropped what he was doing and drove to the Spotsylvania County animal shelter to assess the dog 's injuries . <p> The pit bull was lying in a kennel with raw , red tissue on his back from neck to tail . The dog looked up at Baliles as if to say , " I 'm hurting . I do n't know what 's going on . " <p> Baliles took a lamb-and-salmon-flavored treat from his pocket and held it toward the pit bull . The dog sniffed his hand , looked into his eyes and accepted the food . <p> " That 's when I opened up the door and said , ' You 're coming home with me , ' " Baliles , 35 , recalled . <p> He and his wife , Cari , have fostered several pit bulls for Bully Paws Pit Bull Patriots , a Fredericksburg-based nonprofit that finds homes for abandoned pit bulls . Baliles is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most severe cases , like the emaciated pit bull who needed to pack on 35 pounds . <p> But he said the pit bull he picked up last week has the worst injuries he 's dealt with . <p> He named him Django , after the late jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt . Baliles was surprised to learn later that the dog 's namesake also suffered severe burns . <p> " Once you 're around him for a little bit , he is the sweetest dog , " said Baliles , who lives in Culpeper County . <p> Django , who was wearing a T -- shirt to cover his burns during a recent visit to Yowell Meadow Park in the town of Culpeper , even licked a Free Lance -- Star reporter on the cheek after some initial wariness . <p> The black pit bull weighs 68 pounds -- 4 pounds more than when Baliles first got him . Django has tested positive for heartworm and will need injections for that condition after his burns heal , Baliles said . <p> Spotsylvania Animal Control picked up the stray dog last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tractor . <p> The Humane Society of the United States hopes to offer a reward of $2,500 to $5,000 for information in Django 's case , said Laura Donahue , Virginia director of the Humane Society . A Warrenton veterinarian who examined Django sent a letter to the Humane Society on Friday saying the dog 's injuries are compatible with chemical or mechanical burns . <p> " I suspect the dog was either a victim of abuse or neglect ( or both ) , " the vet wrote . <p> Spotsylvania Animal Control Director William Tydings must sign off on the Humane Society 's reward , Donahue said . <p> " We hope that the department will move forward with an investigation and accept our reward , " she said , noting that Django 's injuries appear similar to other cases of animal cruelty . <p> Tydings was out of the office on Friday . He told The Free Lance -- Star earlier this week that he wanted third-party confirmation that Django 's injuries were not accidental . <p> Barbara Donegan , a Bully Paws board member who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " You do n't hear too much about when it happens the other way , " she said . <p> Many consider pit bulls a dangerous breed as evidenced by a ruling this year by Maryland 's highest court labeling the dogs inherently dangerous . <p> Baliles said he had somewhat of a pit bull bias until he adopted Tilla about five years ago . He recalls walking Tilla in a nearby park , where a lady told him to keep his pit bull away from her and her dog . <p> That offended him . <p> " My goal at that point was to make him a breed ambassador , " Baliles said . <p> He has a bumper sticker on his truck that reads , " Ban bad breeders . " <p> It 's been more than a week since he picked up Django , who is doing pretty well considering the circumstances . <p> Django is staying in a basement with some old couches and a TV . Baliles calls it his man cave/rehab center . <p> He said he sleeps on a couch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wounds . On the first night , Django slept with his muzzle on his foster dad 's chest . <p> Django is receiving laser treatments three days a week to increase blood circulation in his wounds . He 's on antibiotics and painkillers and eats dog food with extra protein and vitamins . <p> Baliles has to clean and apply petroleum jelly or cream to Django 's burns six times a day . <p> And every other day , he has to scrub the dog 's burns to help with blood flow . Django whimpers but does n't put up a fight , Baliles said . <p> " His wounds are coming along really well , " he said . Bully paws has raised almost $6,000 in online donations for his medical expenses . <p> Django will be kept away from his temporary home 's four pit bulls -- one of whom is also a foster -- and two pugs for the time being . <p> Baliles is optimistic Django will find a home after he recovers . <p> " He 's going to have such a story behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog that somebody will take him in , " he said .

##3194652 <p> An assault trial in which the victim is expected to testify for her alleged attacker was postponed Tuesday when too many prospective jurors indicated that they could n't be impartial . Theodore Peyton , 47 , of Colonial Beach is charged with felony domestic assault and battery in connection with a March 3 incident in Stafford County involving the mother of his child . <p> Peyton was supposed to have a jury trial in Stafford Circuit Court , but Judge J. Martin Bass had to declare a mistrial because too many would-be jurors were eliminated during pre-trial questioning . <p> In response to questions from prosecutor Andrea McCauley , many of the jurors indicated they were troubled by the fact that the victim was not going to testify against Peyton and that she kept going back to him after at least two prior assaults . McCauley , defense attorney Bruce Strickland and Bass agreed that 17 of the 34 potential jurors should be deemed unsuitable to hear the case . <p> Since at least 20 eligible jurors are needed before the final 12-member panel is selected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new trial date was set for Dec. 12 .

Both were intoxicated , and the man also chased the woman into traffic , according to the police report . <p> The couple had left the store by the time Deputy Jeremiah Rakoczy responded , but they did n't get far , and Rakoczy saw the man hit the woman in the head . <p> The clerks had seen the man grabbing and pushing the woman earlier . <p> Rakoczy 's investigation showed that the altercation had started earlier in King George County and somehow ended up in Stafford . <p> McCauley said Cavender was cooperative with police that night , but later told authorities she did not want Peyton prosecuted and she would not cooperate . <p> McCauley decided to prosecute anyway , and Peyton , whose long criminal record includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail without bond since his arrest . <p> Cavender also is in jail , serving 
##3195350 <p> He presented the very real scenario whereby a patient from the North Country needing specialty care in Boston would have to be transported down by helicopter to see the doctor in person , rather than his local doctor being able to use modern technology to communicate with the specialist and patient . This ca n't be done now because state-by-state licensing prohibits doctors from practicing in a state in which they are not licensed .

##3201051 <p> It seems appropriate seeing as I 've been in the woodwork for over a month , that this is the topic of my next post . <p> Why is it that when you least expect it , someone or something happens to crawl out of the woodwork ? I am completely guilty of this myself and have use it to my good advantage , however have never used it in malice -- as can often happen . This is one of those times . <p> One night last week I woke up in the middle of the night . This is n't strange , not at all as I have always woken up at 4am on the dot in habit of when my stranger used to text me then . That was years ago . Even now I still do it . But this was different , this was a certain type of 6th sense of a different kind . For one , I woke just before 2am . <p> I did n't want to think anything of it , but I had no choice as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my blackberry made the same piercing noise it always did . Only this time it was so much more piercing than it usually was . It is n't technically possible but I swear in my mind it is ! I thought for a moment about just leaving it until morning , thinking logically through who could actually be texting me at that time of the night . I had a few ideas , as it 's usually the same people . However those same people would usually not hesitate to ring instead of texting at that time . <p> I opened it , losing to my better part of self-control . That 's when my heart missed a beat or two , literally stopping for a brief moment in my chest as I saw the name flash up on the screen attached to an unopened text sent at 2.02am . It was a name I had n't had a text from since August and had n't heard their voice or seen their face since June . 5 months of silence and 5 months of being somewhere among the woodwork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone across the room , laughed and cried all at the same time . <p> I had no idea what to think about it . It was n't a drunken mistake , it was well articulated even , which made me all the more suspicious and worried about this person . Did I want to go for a coffee -- well , did I ? I closed the message and put my phone back where it had been , knowing I need time to think and that I needed to think through what was happening before deciding on anything -- the first thing was whether it even warranted a reply at all . It was opening a whole new chapter when the last one had ended and been accepted . It had n't ended brilliantly but it could have been so much worse . <p> The next day I felt off-balance , shaken and a little unsteady . This is n't like me . Or it was n't the me that I had grown back into . It had been the me that was left in June . Or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June . <p> I had no idea whether to reply or not .

My mid-afternoon , though , these winds had quieted down to a cool breeze so I made my way out the door . <p> Although there are a number of albums in the " Y " section of my library , this was one of those days where the choice was obvious .

Their third album , Summerteeth , had more in common with the Beach Boys than The Byrds , so expectations for album number four were high . <p> The story of the resulting album , Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , has been well-documented in print and video , particularly in the I Am Trying to Break Your Heart documentary . Besides the personnel changes that saw the departures of drummer Ken Coomer and **33;5596;TOOLONG Jay Bennett , the resulting album was initially turned down by their record company , which delayed its release for almost a full year . <p> When it was finally released in April , 2002 , the album 's success showed that not only was their original record company was incorrect in their sales assessment , it also proved that pre-release leaking and downloading were not necessarily the reason for the music industry 's declining sales . Wilco had defied record company protocol by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming it on their website months before it 's release . In fact , not only was the actual album available online , but hours of alternate versions , demos , and different mixes . <p> As for the actual album , it 's hard not to agree that it is the band 's masterpiece . Their use of " found " sounds , feedback , and other forms of audio noise and technology sort of makes them an " American Radiohead " , but at its heart Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a natural pop progression from Summerteeth . Outside of a few little touches , the orchestrated noise is really only present on a couple of songs ( " I Am Trying to Break Your Heart " , " Ashes of American Flags " , " Reservations " ) , leaving the rest of the album as " normal " acoustic-based pop songs . How is it possible that Warner Brothers thought songs such as " Kamera " , " Heavy Metal Drummer " and " I 
##3203252 <h> The size of a dialog <h> July 27 , 2007 <p> While working on the Qt4 prototype of the dialog , more precisely on the settings panes ( the ones that can be changed using the icons ) , I came across the following dilemma : <p> How large should a dialog , a printing dialog , be ? <p> Not an easy question . Believe me . <p> Going back to examples seen in other applications and operating systems there are two possibilities : <p> Very small dialog . This has the advantage of not using to much screen space . Allowing the user to keep an eye on the original window . Mac OS X has a pretty small dialog . They achieve this by having many , many different panes . The multitude of panes is a real downside in my opinion . Another problem is the limited space to layout the different widgets in the pane ( the reason I started wondering about dialog size ) . <p> A large dialog . On small screens this is a real pain in the ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown correctly on my 14 inch laptop screen . Buttons or other widgets that were n't shown on screen simply because the dialog is too big . On the other hand , it gives the designer of the dialog much more freedom for his layout . Allowing him to use icons and other graphics . Something I would really like to do . <p> So for now the question remains unanswered . I continue to work on the layout of the individual settings panes . Because in the end , that 's where the real configuration is done . <p> Now for something completly unrelated : My " analog " live has been quite hectic the last few days . Today I almost bought a house . Yep , we found what we were looking for . Unfortunatly , we were n't the first to find it and the house was sold right before our nose . <h> Like this : <h> One Response to " The size of a dialog " <p> Very good observation . I have a personal principle that says that a tool window should n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parent window . Almost all printing is utilitary for applications . Even considering the not necessarily frequent case of users running all windows maximized , KPrinter dialog should n't take 60% of the physical screen . This is the maximum . <p> Now , the KDE guidelines were imposing some time ago that all applications be able to run normally on a 800x600 display . Thus , you get a ballpark maximum KPrinter window size of 480x360 pixels . This is really small . <p> Today 's KPrinter takes approx 520x300 in its simplest form ( no options ) and 520x550 with options tabs expanded . Would we be able to keep ourselves to these maxima ? <p> Of course , everybody dreams of the day where GUIs will be designed vectorial , so they can smoothly adapt to varying display dimensions . But for now , your question is valid and the answer

##3204852 <p> In one sense of the word , Emma surely is clever . She 's an intelligent young woman with a quick wit and an active mind . In others she readily sees what they lack . Only when it comes to understanding herself , the question whether Emma really is so clever can at least be argued . Her meddlings in other peoples ' lives , especially in that of " poor Harriet " as Emma 's father Mr. Woodhouse might say , do n't really show a superior understanding . <p> Nevertheless , Emma is n't a character whom you can honestly dislike . Much in her favour is her disposition of reasoning with herself and being willing to acknowledge mistakes in her conduct and her actions . Therefore , Jane Austen 's assessment that Emma might be " a heroine whom no one but myself will much like " ca n't be taken that seriously , I think . Jane Austen certainly was sure that her girl would meet with a good deal of sympathy among her readers and I imagine Jane Austen was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Besides , there are other characters in the book whom you CAN dislike for sure . Take for example the ill-behaved Elton-couple . Mr. Elton , when he is refused by Emma , is so injured in his pride that he loses no time to get himself someone who is willing to have him . The success of their marriage , however , is questionable and their union presumably does n't last longer than the merry days of a fresh impression guarantee . That is what Jane Austen vividly suggests . Both , husband and wife , are depicted as vain and insolent , driven by a most improper behaviour towards others , especially those whom they feel superior towards . <p> Then , there is the ambigious character of Frank Churchill . With him , one can not be sure if he can be liked despite his flaws of character or if he is just too deceitful and reckless . I think Jane Austen hoped him not to be out of reach of improving by setting the good and sweet character of Jane Fairfax against ( or rather beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming to a better understanding is the worthy and reasonable Mr. Knightley who is not even blinded by his love for Emma to her faults and takes pains to criticise and advise her , nevertheless . One thing which makes Emma so amiable is her accepting and appreciating such advises and her admission of having acted in a wrong way when she did . <p> I liked Emma , not only the character but the novel at all , a great deal . It perfectly attests one more time Jane Austen 's sharp powers of observation in regard to human character traits and people 's follies . It also shows her conviction that people can work on themselves , that they are able to improve their minds and their characters especially with a fitting partner at their side . <p> I never saw the movie Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam , so I 'll treat myself and borrow it from my local library for a nice and cosy screening on Sunday afternoon while outside the weather most probably will remain as 
##3205152 <p> By Kent Finlay , Cheatham Street Warehouse owner for more than three dozen years . George Strait is currently on what he calls his " final tour " and it reaches Lubbock on Jan. 18 and Oklahoma City on Jan. 19 <p> October was a mighty important time at Cheatham Street Warehouse , ( in San Marcos , Texas ) and indeed , in the world of music in general . On October 13 , 1975 , a new , unknown five-piece band played their first show . They called themselves Ace In The Hole , <p> Inscription on George Strait CD to Kent Finlay <p> and the band came to be centered around the vocals of a young fellow named George Strait . That first show was free , and a few dozen folks showed up . That first show turned into a weekly gig for George and the guys , and they played every week at Cheatham , getting better and better with time and practice , and they gradually started getting shows in Houston , Austin , San Antonio , and other Texas cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashville in 1977 , We went in the Cheatham Street cargo van . ( We still had to go to Nashville back in those days to do music business . ) Anyway , George kept on getting more and more attention , and finally Erv Woolsey , who worked at MCA Records , got the powers that were there at the time to take a chance on George -- and of course , you know what happened . George Strait and his Ace in the Hole band became the most successful country act in history ! <p> By 1982 , they were so busy out there on the road that they were hardly ever home , so the weekly gig at Cheatham Street came to an end , ( But then , that was what we were working toward -- We love it when one of the acts we are helping gets too big for us ) . <p> AN INTERESTING ASIDE NOTE : George and the Ace in the Hole Band were still playing once a week whe n Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble started playing every Tuesday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years we had Stevie Ray and George Strait both playing every week . <p> MARY JANE 'S OWN SIDE NOTE , laughing at myself still for this one : One night during this time , about 1977 more or less , and during my drinking days when I was living in Wimberley , I drove to the Cheatham Street Warehouse to hear Ace In The Hole -- like Kent said , it was n't even George Strait &; Ace In The Hole then ... Parked , got out , went inside , and was having fun with the people and the music . Suddenly , the band stopped , and Tommy Foote , then the drummer , had George announce : " Mary Jane , the train has stopped but wants to go on , will you please move your car 
##3205550 <p> This is rattling around in my head right now . If you have the conclusive ( or even a good guess ) let me know . <p> At what point do we , in the church , get truly serious about weighing all scripture through the person of Jesus Christ ? Is n't He the resting place for all of our conclusions and approaches to living and loving ? <p> Will we ever break away from our proclivity to proof-text our rationales for war , propagating poverty and elevating our spheres of concern over above the needs of those who fall outside of those spheres ? God commanding war in the OT is not a good enough reason for me to blindly embrace armed conflict today . <p> What moral obligation do I have to reduce poverty and be a voice for the least of these ? How far-reaching is that ? How much does that affect what I buy , where I shop , etc ? <p> Could it be that we have completely blown Romans 13 out of proportion and twisted it completely into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true ethic of life consist of ? How can I be pro-life and accept the needless death of any individual ? <p> When did faith get confused with certainty on every moral question ? <p> If the greatest commandments are all that , should n't we be focusing a whole lot more on what it means to love God and love people ? <p> Can we lay aside our personal disgust on sins that particularly rankle us to have an open discussion about the true make-up of sinful behavior ? <p> Have we so marginalized women in the church that they have no outlet for their gifts and talents ?

This article was written by David Ristau , one of our writers . We did not receive compensation for this article ( ) , and we have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article . <p> Each earnings season , we spend time researching the top growth and value combinations of reporting companies to find what companies might see the best price increases during the quarter . Today , we have provided you with some of our top picks and trading ideas for this earnings season . You can view last quarter 's picks here . <p> We select these stocks based on hours of researching the companies that offer the best combination of growth and value in the upcoming earnings season . We are looking for companies that are growing sales and earnings heavily , along with still offering good value in the marketplace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance companies are all seeing much better profitability in the coming quarter . Catastrophe losses have been low , allowing the company to have reduced claims and lower expenses . The company is not seeing a ton of revenue growth , but we expect a great round of earnings . <p> Despite the company 's current valuation near a 52-week high , the stock is cheap with a 10 PE . Look at it this way : the company should be seeing a move of about 0.90 in EPS , which will bring EPS to 5.00 for the TTM. 5.00 x 10 = 50 . We believe pre-earnings we should see a move to the 43-44 range and a potential move to around 50 by the end of the year based on this earnings report . <p> The company 's rival , Progressive ( PGR ) , just reported excellent earnings that were above expectations on similar reasoning . These companies were dogged at the beginning of the year with a lot of risk in the market , but the longer defaults and risk comes off the market , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we believe ALL is about to make a very nice move . <p> Additionally , the company operates at a discount to peers with a forward PE well below the 12+ average , which also attracts us . Allstate combines the perfect balance of value and growth that makes it a great pick for earnings season . <p> AOL ? ! Really ! The fledgling online company that no one uses anymore ? Yes . We like AOL a lot heading into this earnings season . The company 's last quarterly report showed that it is moving in the right direction again and took the stock up about 40% from report to date to currently . What 's so great about AOL ? <p> The company is making a nice comeback on the back of CEO Tim Armstrong 's turnaround . Armstrong has turned AOL into an advertising web portal with news that people are interested in ever since acquiring Huffington Post and ramping up its blogs " TechCrunch " and " Engadget . " While the company is definitely still seeing a sales slump overall , the company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is using money from Microsoft ( MSFT ) patents to reinvest in its dividend and share buybacks . <p> So , does the stock have any more juice ? We believe that the company will continue to forecast well and could start to see growth again in 2013 . Costs are coming down , and that is being seen by EPS growth this quarter , which is expected to rise from -0.02 to 0.18 . The increase in EPS from loss to in the black will attract investors into and out of earnings , and we believe the company is a few steps away from returning back to a solid name in the Internet space . <p> Our second pick for large-cap stocks is Bunge . Farming companies look solid as well for this quarter , and BG , in the farming and food businesses industry , is looking at a strong quarter of growth that we believe will translate into higher prices . First , the company is slated to see tremendous revenue and earnings growth with 150% growth expected in EPS as well as 14% growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company is seeing a lot of growth in emerging markets like Argentina and Brazil , but the shortage of crops this summer led to record prices , which has helped companies like BG make margins move much higher than sales growth . The company 's main line of business in soybeans , wheat , and corn gives it a nice diversification to those price hikes . Further , we like the company 's fertilizer exposure as higher prices mean higher production . That trend is also giving weight to the earnings hike for BG . <p> Value is definitely there for this farming company . Just look at the 9.5 future PE , which is showing a lot of opportunity in the stock . The estimated 6.26 EPS for the year multiplied by the current 14.5 PE yields a price target of $90 . Even 12.5 yields 78 . We believe this stock is primed for a nice move , and agriculture is a great way to play this earnings season . <p> Despite BG being at a 52-week high , we still believe a lot of value and upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very solid right now and is our top small-cap play for this earnings season . We are attracted first off to the company 's nearly 100% revenue growth YoY . The small energy company is starting to churn out some solid earnings and revenue , and we believe it could be ready to take off from these levels . <p> NOG is a great play on the " at home " production of crude oil and natural gas , and we believe the company is a great value play with solid growth that is now occurring for two quarters and helping to put in a bottom for the stock right now . The stock lost some 40% from its highs , but it has rebounded off the $15 levels and held up well since its last report . <p> Right now revenues are really starting to explode , and the company is seeing a lot of success in the Bakken region where it does business with 170,000 acres available . The company has a lot of potential to continue to develop that land and has had a ton of success with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NOG is expected to increase EPS by 0.08 in the coming quarter , pushing EPS to 1.35 for the TTM . That number multiplied by current PE at 13.5 would give the stock a valuation at 18.50. 13.50 is extremely cheap for a high growth stock , so look for that level to remain . <p> Finally , we believe NOG is a great takeover candidate . The company is attractive for its growth , financial health , and recently had its president step down . It could announce a takeover at any time . <p> Our second mid-cap pick is TRN . The railroad company was one of our top 15 picks last quarter , and the stock made quite a move in its last earnings . The stock has rallied nearly 20% since that report , but we believe it could have another sizeable gain on its way for this report . <p> The company operates in the railroad industry , which has seen resurgence in 2012 but has been weaker since a strong start . Railroad stocks suffered after a great 2011 , but they have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid play in the coming quarter amongst a stronger industry as the company is expected to show 88%+ EPS growth along with 25% growth in revenue . <p> The company is seeing growing backlogs and improved rail trends that we believe are translating into strong sales/earnings that will be reported in the coming quarter . <p> Taking a look at the numbers , the company should see EPS for the TTM improve to 2.96 . Taking that number multiplied by the 12 PE gives us a $36 price target . The company is already a great value , and we believe those levels are achievable . Value can also be seen in the 0.7 price/sales ratio . <p> With over $3B of backlog , business is booming and should continue to translate into higher share prices from here . <h> Share this article <p> The Oxen Group is a financial analysis and investment opportunities newsletter-based website run by financial analyst David Ristau .

##3206251 <h> Gold And Silver : The Most Important Data Since QE3 <p> Gold and silver have been running since the announcement of QE3 . Gold bulls contend that QE3 is highly inflationary . Further , there is precedent of precious metals running after QE1 and QE2 . <p> In the hoopla of excitement about QE3 , it was lost on gold and silver investors that QE3 is very different from QE1 and QE2 . <p> In QE3 , the Federal Reserve is buying mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) . The Federal Reserve 's buying of MBS is not the same as government spending . In this respect , the common connotation given to ' printing presses ' is a misnomer . The common thinking is that the Federal Reserve creates money and gets nothing back of value in return , therefore the belief that it will cause inflation . <p> MBS purchases by the Federal Reserve are purchases of great value . An MBS is simply a pool of mortgages on real property . <p> In momentum investing , factual differences between QE3 and prior QE programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve was primarily buying treasury securities . <p> In this up-leg , gold and silver have been under the control of the momo crowd . The momo crowd is quite different than , and is not to be confused with , gold bugs . The momo crowd has been emboldened by the momentum investing that surrounds QE3 . The momo crowd simply chases momentum based on superficial notions that QE3 is highly inflationary . Unlike the momo crowd , gold bugs tend to be steeped in the monetary policy . <p> However , the most important data point for gold and silver investors since the announcement of QE3 is Core Producer Price Index ( PPI ) . Historically , Core PPI is the leading indicator as well as a more reliable indicator of future inflation , whereas CPI lags and is more volatile . <p> Core PPI is the most important data point since QE3 for gold and silver because the premise behind the run up in precious metals is inflation . In QE1 and QE2 inflation showed up in Core PPI right away . This time it is different as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take notice of how the metals reacted to the announcement of PPI data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) . <p> The table shows finished goods PPI , except foods and energy . In September 2012 , finished goods PPI except foods and energy fell to 0.0% from 0.2% in August . The consensus of economists was 0.2% . <p> Finished goods PPI without foods and energy is also known as Core PPI . The reason Core PPI is considered one of the best indications of future inflation is that when producers are experiencing inflation , it ultimately spills into inflation for consumers . Further , both foods and energy PPI numbers are highly volatile and including these in the analysis causes distortions . <p> Yes , we all eat and travel ; therefore it seems intuitive to include foods and energy in the analysis . However , the data in recent years shows that when analyzing an investment thesis , based on inflation outside of the foods and energy segments , it is best to use Core PPI . <p> The two traditional reasons behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catastrophic news . <p> Serious gold and silver investors would want to take notice of the data shown in the table and understand that core inflation is not rising enough to justify the big run in gold and silver . <p> Some will argue that it is not the present data , but the future inflation caused by money printing by the Federal Reserve , that is causing inflation . There is no doubt that this is the generally accepted folklore . However a closer look shows that QE3 is different from QE1 and QE2 , and not likely to cause inflation of the proportion that gold and silver bulls anticipate . This fact was sinking in yesterday , leading to sharp drops in gold and silver . However , today an oversold bounce is expected as the momo crowd exerts itself and smart money backs off . <p> One of the secrets to making money in the markets is to understand early when the crowd may be wrong . History is replete with examples of the crowd being wrong and giving opportunities to astute investors . There was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd was not thinking of inflation . There are still reasons to buy gold and silver , but QE3 is not one of them . <p> On October 12 , 2012 , when the PPI data was first released at 8:30 AM ET , gold and silver started ticking up . Our algorithms detected buying by the momo crowd . Perhaps the momo crowd , as is their practice , jumped on the headline without digging deep into the data ; or perhaps the momo crowd was continuing its recent bizarre behavior . The bizarre behavior is buying on news of low inflation and selling on the news of high inflation . This is contrary to what gold bugs and most investors do . <p> The buying by the momo crowd in the recent up-leg has been so strong that the smart money has typically not stepped in front of the momo crowd to sell . Smart money , in our parlance , is collective action of ultra-sophisticated investors who know more , who know early , and who have more analysis power . <p> Every astute investor should understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the same as the popular belief . History is replete with examples of astute investors making a killing when they were able to carefully study a phenomenon and conclude that the popular beliefs were wrong .

##3210052 <h> Column : LIPA 's leaving powerless people in the dark <p> TIM GANNON PHOTO Roberta 's house in Reeves Park is the only property in the neighborhood still without electricity after Sandy , she says . <p> By now , a lot of people have their electricity back in the wake of Hurricane Sandy . <p> I got mine back Tuesday , and when you first get your power back it seems , to you at least , that Sandy is no longer a problem . <p> But there are many without power . And in some cases , it does n't seem to make sense why some houses have power and some do n't , or why fate chose the people it chose to leave in the dark . <p> Such is the case with Roberta . She lives in Reeves Park and still had no power as of Wednesday afternoon , though she says everyone else in her neighborhood does . <p> Even without electricity , Roberta , who did n't want her full name used , has her hands full . <p> Her 87-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and ca n't get around by herself . Her 13-year son has Down 's syndrome . And Roberta does n't drive . <p> When LIPA repairmen came around over the weekend to restore electricity to the rest of her neighborhood , they told Roberta they could n't restore hers because the tree that had fallen on her house , pulling power lines down with it , had also crushed the electric meter box . <p> LIPA told Roberta she would have to get a private electrician to fix the box before they could come back and reconnect the power lines to her house . She had the box fixed , but getting LIPA back to restore the wires was n't proving too easy . <p> " I asked when they were coming back and they did n't have an answer , " she recalled . " I said , ' But you told me I had to have all this work done and you would come back . ' And now it 's getting cold . " <p> On Monday , a neighbor took them to stay at her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " out of their routine " and are constantly asking when they 're going home . <p> A few years ago , I guess , it could have been me grappling with a similar situation . <p> I had a brother with Down 's syndrome , and my mother was old and had " small strokes " that made it tough for her to get around or communicate . We took it a few steps further , too . We also had an even older father who was perfectly healthy but loved to get mad about things like this and the psychotic dog , which allegedly bit a guy who then sued us for $2 million . <p> And sometimes , the Down 's syndrome brother would open the gate and let the psychotic dog out of the house , which gave my father something else to get mad about , and I 'd have to try to catch the dog before it attacked somebody . <p> But that was then . Now , it 's just me . <p> My other brother , who lives nearby , was mentioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have this kind of storm and power outage back then . There was Hurricane Gloria , but that happened in mid-September when it was warmer -- and in 1985 , when all those people were younger . <p> Something like this , in the cold , would be much harder . <p> As Roberta is discovering . <p> She has since found that she could n't even get LIPA on the phone anymore . <p> On Monday , the neighbor , who also did n't want her name use , decided to contact the media . She contacted us . I went down there . <p> At first , I thought maybe she was calling the wrong numbers at LIPA . So I called the number I had just called the day before , since my power was out too , and , like Roberta , it seemed like everyone else in my neighborhood had gotten power back already . <p> No dice . Once you 've made a report , an answering machine tells you they have the report , and it hangs up on you . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would n't be the ones to come down and fix the power , but sometimes a little press attention will get some action . <p> The LIPA spokesperson , Karen Ryan , looked into the situation and eventually called back . She said a LIPA crew could be at Roberta 's house at an " estimated time " of 9 a.m. on Wednesday . <p> Of course , on Wednesday , a Nor'easter , and more outages , were forecast . Roberta asked if they could make it Tuesday . The LIPA spokesperson said there are thousands of people in the same situation , and that there were other homes in Reeves Park without power and that Wednesday 9 a.m. estimate was the best they could do . <p> So Roberta took it . <p> I drove by Roberta 's house on Wednesday morning at about 10:30 a.m. and again at 1 p.m . The wires were still sitting on the ground , and the new storm 
##3210950 <h> Wednesday , November 7 , 2012 <h> In the next four years I hope ... ( A response to Donald Miller 's Blog ) <p> November 7 , 2012 <p> I read Donald Miller 's blog this morning titled , ' The Most Powerful Decision Maker Is n't the President . It 's THIS Person ... ' . It sparked thoughts that eventually pulled my fingers to the keyboard and my eyes to the screen . In his blog he wrote , " You are the most powerful decision maker in your life . It 's your decisions that will decide what your life looks like four years from now . " <p> And it led me to think ... <p> Even though I was n't voted President , I have decisions and choices to make each day that will determine the next four years . Perhaps you have an optimistic outlook on these next four years or maybe you feel as though America is doomed . Either way your stance on the outcome does not change your ability as a capable individual . The next four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be based on your decisions . <p> Like the candidates we are able to set personal goals and chase after dreams , but the question is will we ? Will we set goals and formulate a plan to accomplish them , or will we let these four years wash by ? Before we know it 2016 will be knocking at our door and will leave us asking , where did the last four years go ? <p> I do n't want to ask that question . Rather , I want to have an answer for when I am asked where did the last four years go ? In 2016 I want to be able to look back and tell you where the last four years went . <p> In the next four years I hope ... <p> I hope to have finally written that book that I 've started so many times , but ca n't seem to sit down and finished . <p> I hope to have figured out how to put my clothes away after I 'm done wearing them . <p> I hope to faithfully serve those around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than nachos and quesadillas . <p> I hope to have seen the waves of the west coast and hike the mountains of the east . <p> I hope to faithfully assume my role as a brother , a son , a friend , and a mentor . <p> I hope to look into the eyes of a woman and look down to see the ring I put on her finger . <p> I hope to recite poems and share stories that leave listeners inspired . <p> I hope to hear poems and listen to stories that leave me inspired . <p> I hope to follow Jesus more fervently , more passionately than I am in 2012 . <p> I hope to be living a better story . <p> I hope to one day cross out the word ' hope ' that is found in all of these goals because they have either been accomplished or being presently lived . <p> We all have our different hopes and because of that we have a different four years ahead of us .

##3211550 <p> Remember when I was writing about Star Trek : Enterprise ? And then I started to feel worn out and decided to watch Farscape instead ? And then my season two second disc would n't work , so I said " Screw it , " and watched Lost again . And then I watched Golgo-13 . Anyway , I 'm out of stuff to watch , so it 's back to Enterprise . I had to skip season two disc two ! Hopefully it was n't important . <p> Singularity : A " ship 's crew goes crazy because of an external factor " episode whose tension is completely undercut by the fact that the show opens with the entire crew save T'Pol unconscious , with T'Pol explaining what 's going to happen over the next hour . <p> Vanishing Point : A teleporter incident causes Hoshi to turn invisible and noncorporeal . Having just come off viewings of Farscape , Lost , and Battlestar : Galactica , I ca n't help but think the episodic nature of Enterprise really destroys the potential for narrative depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others I 've watched over the past few days , if storylines were allowed to overlap a bit . Instead , each one wraps up neatly -- and in the case of " Vanishing Point , " too neatly . The wrap-up is basically a sudden " it was all a dream ! " cop-out that really deflates the whole thing . <p> Precious Cargo : Hey , it 's every terrible romantic comedy condensed to 40 minutes . Trip of all people ends up being forced into close proximity to a princess , they hate each other , then later they screw before going their separate ways . Startlingly predictable ! Redeemed only by the fact that guest star Padma Lakshmi is utterly gorgeous . I think this episode would probably work better as a 40-minute freeze frame of her smiling . Actually , no ; Captain Archer 's interrogation of the enemy agent was kind of brilliant . Scott Bakula completely hammed it up , perfectly channeling William Shatner for one of his best moments in the series . <p> The Catwalk : A totally serviceable episode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the good guys save the day . <p> Dawn : Basically , Enemy Mine , but surprisingly well-done . The Enterprise crew has steadily grown less insufferable over the course of the series , and Archer 's defiance of the enemy battlecruiser captain treads a tricky line between confidence and thick-headedness . Despite the predictability of Trip 's **38;4553;TOOLONG with his stranded alien counterpart , the episode sells it well . Quality stuff ! <p> Stigma : Despite being a too-obvious parable for rape and AIDS , this one works a lot better than it really ought to . For once , the dual plotlines work nicely : While T'Pol deals with Vulcan prejudice , Phlox 's wife puts the moves on Trip ( which Phlox is totally fine with , being from a polygamist species ) to Trip 's immense discomfort . So while Archer gets all pompous and judgmental about Vulcan culture for being too closed-minded , Phlox and his wife laugh about the hidebound nature of humanity . That goes a long way toward diffusing the usual high-minded snottiness of Enterprise . And it 's nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series , the show runners tried to combat that limitation with frequent callbacks to previous storylines . Enterprise was n't great -- I 've seen enough to know that for certain -- but at least sometimes you get the impression that it sincerely tried to rise above its ordained mundanity . <h> This entry has 2 comments <p> So you should n't have to skip any episodes , even if your disks are n't working . I know you 're probably watching on DVD , but if you can get ahold of HD versions , you should do it . Enterprise was one of the first shows on TV specifically filmed for HD , and it looks gorgeous . <p> As for your criticisms about shows with more overarching plot lines , I think that 's valid but it depends on what you want out of a show . I enjoy a well constructed show with a plot that takes multiple episodes to develop the same as the next guy , but sometimes I actually enjoy the more episodic nature of older TV shows and kind of wish we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV , and damnit sometimes I want to eat junk food . Also , as you may or may not know , you should like Season 3 and 4 then : season 3 changes pace into a season-long story arc , season 4 is 
##3211551 <p> For the first time in , I do n't know , five years or so , I 've reviewed a game in comic strip format . It 's been a while , and my artwork is pretty rusty , so I apologize for that . But the style seemed appropriate for the game , and the easiest way to get the review 's thesis across . <p> The review was influenced directly by my recently having embarked on a read-through of the first four volumes of Fantagraphics ' amazing reprintings of Floyd Gottfredson 's Mickey Mouse daily comics . Gottfredson 's work is n't as highly regarded as Carl Barks ' work on Uncle Scrooge for various reasons -- his art style , at least in the early going , is more clearly of its era than the perfectly modeled work of Barks and Don Rosa , with lots of stylistic tells ranging from the handwriting script used for dialogue to less savory elements ( the frequent racial caricatures in particular ) , so Gottfredson comics did n't stay in circulation through reprints in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But despite a few little snags , Gottfredson 's comics are wonderful . They 're full of lively charm , packed with energy , and despite their bite-sized , daily , four-panel structure they tell huge and rollicking tales that span the country and even the world . Oh , and Mickey has a personality more intriguing than " bland nobody who mutters ' golly ' and reacts emptily to the world around him . " It 's not always a nice personality , but that 's what makes it so great ! He 's flawed , temperamental , sometimes a bit violent , and generally pretty cocky ... but beneath all that he 's fundamentally a big-hearted , stand-up kind of guy with plenty of courage and moxie . <p> What I 'm saying is , you should buy all of Fantagraphics ' Disney reprints . They 're the best thing to bear the Disney name in years ... both then and now . <h> This entry has 8 comments <p> What a delightful review ! Whether or not everyone " gets it , " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . <p> On 17 November , 2012 <p> Carl wrote : <p> I really liked the review .

Just look at Steamboat Willie , where he 's rebellious against his boss , throws objects at the ship parrot , and harrasses barnyard animals to play music . <p> Speaking of Mickey 's boss , this is one of the cases where Pete is n't really in a villainous role .

##3212151 <h> I Want to go to Asia ! <p> The following is a guest post by my friend Joseph . He and his wife Julie travel all over the world for their Emmy winning PBS show Travelscope , and they are starting to offer tours . Their first stop is Asia -- a continent I am determined to visit before I get too old and decrepit to travel . They only have 15 spots available for this tour to French Indochina -- so they will fill up fast . I would desperately love to go -- but I 'm sure they would say no with a two and a four year old in tow . Perhaps I 'll go when Sunbeam and Firecracker can both carry my luggage . <h> Join me in Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam ! <p> After years of being asked repeatedly by many , many viewers to lead a tour , my wife , Julie , and I personally designed this Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia itinerary to provide a select group of traveling companions with an authentic , culturally rich , interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many somewheres we 've been , we 've arranged for you to share with us our first-time discoveries in places we 've always dreamed of visiting . To have the opportunity to see Vietnam in all its magical glory recovered from war and want is a guaranteed uplifting experience . Each day in Vietnam is filled with opportunities to touch and understand this ancient culture through a wide variety of carefully selected activities -- each one holding more possibilities than the next . Laos offers us the chance to engage in the moving spiritual practice of exchanging alms and blessings with the monks , get a riverside view of life and witness the handiwork of hilltribe weavers . In Cambodia , Angkor Wat , the world heritage site , stunning beyond belief , as well as breathtaking in its majesty and mystery , yet our comprehensive visit to the plain of Angkor will introduce us to many treasures that , in some ways , rival it . <p> We 'll also have opportunities for gentle interactions with the attending monks giving us the chance for personal moments of reflection . Angkor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have selected from its riches its most precious gems . During the Northern Vietnam extension , we up-the-ante and go in search of close encounters with the hill tribe people , something we love to do . We 'll meet them in their villages , in the markets and in the fields and with the help of our local guides our collective senses gain insight into existence from their perspective .

##3214251 <p> This Anzhi project is incredibly interesting to me , even more so with a guy like Roberto Carlos and Gus Hiddink in charge ( and do n't forget Fabio Capello in charge of Russia and the World Cup hosting right around the corner .... Brinks trucks full of cash , but a tough sell on the location . And with Manchester City proven and PSG seemingly on its way , can Anzhi really compete for the ' big players ' ? And do n't forget about the amount of money Zenit dropped at the closing of the summer transfer window on Hulk and Alex Witsel . <p> When he returned to Brazil in late 2009 , to sign for Corinthians at the ripe old age of 36 , it was not hard to picture Roberto Carlos playing on forever . Supremely fit and performing to a typically high standard , he seemed to have many years of football left in him . This August , however , he finally called it a day after enjoying a farewell stint captaining Anzhi Makhachkala . <p> Now a sporting director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian still takes part in training sessions and is preparing the ground for his next career move -- one that will take him into coaching . <p> Check out FIFA 's Interview w/ Roberto Carlos after the Jump ........ <p> FIFA.com : Roberto , what expectations can we have of the 2018 FIFA World CupRussiaT ? Roberto Carlos : Things have really been helped on the pitch by the arrival of several quality overseas players in the league and by the mindset Fabio Capello has brought as national coach . Then there 's the fact that the country has a very strong economy and is doing very well right now . Obviously everyone knows Moscow and Saint Petersburg , but Russia 's got other great cities too and it 's got the infrastructure , railways and everything else . I think it 's going to be one of the best-organised World Cups yet . <p> Tell us about your job as sporting director . Is it something you intend to do long-term and make a career of ? I 've been travelling with the team and working side-by-side with the coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there on the pitch . It 's a new life , one that I 'm enjoying a lot . We 're coming to the end of 2012 though , and I need to get my coaching licence . It 's great to be a director and take on the responsibilities that come with it , but my business is down there on the touchline . That 's what I want . <p> Mano Menezes recently told FIFA.com that working with great players like you andRonaldo at Corinthians was an important step on the road to becoming Brazil 's national team coach . What was so special about working with him there ? It was a great experience because he taught me a lot : how to handle players , how to talk to the big stars . He looked on it like a friendship , but he was always responsible about it too . Mano did n't need Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo to get to the national team , and he knows very well how to deal with that kind of situation . I remember him coming up to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed our help to do his job , and from that point on everything worked just fine . <p> You experienced the highs and lows of representing your country , like winning the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and suffering defeat and all the pressure that comes with that . Do you think the things that happen in a FIFA World Cup shape a player 's career ? Every Brazil team that competes in a major tournament , especially the World Cup , is defined by what they do there . Obviously , playing for A Seleao is a massive boost for anyone 's career but at the same time the margin for error is very small . I played for the national side for more than a decade and yet a lot of people remember me for one goal we let in , one goal that was supposedly my fault ( France 's winner in the quarter-finals at Germany 2006 ) . <p> What do you make of the transitional process Mano has been overseeing with the Brazilteam ? Do you think there 's too much responsibility on Neymar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , but not just one or two . You need a few of them , like we had in the 2002 team . Mano knows that and he 's not going to heap all the responsibility of leading the team on Neymar . It 's for the likes of Thiago Silva and Kaka to do that . All Neymar has to do is play football , not worry about being a leader . <p> You played against him when he was just starting out . Are you surprised by his rise to stardom ? I first met Neymar when he was 14 , when he came to Spain to have a look around at Real Madrid . You could definitely tell then and from watching videos of him that he could play a bit . I think his family is the reason he 's made light of all the hype and come on so well . Sometimes talent 's not enough if you do n't have your head screwed on properly and people you can trust around you , like I had , and like Ronaldo and Kaka have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years in A Seleao , at a time when there was plenty of competition around . There 's been a bit of a vacuum there since you left , though . Why is that ? Throughout my Brazil career there were always an awful lot of options , most of them very attacking players like Ze Roberto , Serginho , Junior , Athirson and Felipe . I think leaving at an early age for Inter Milan helped me . I played a lot in defence there and that helped me become a more complete player . The quality of the competition was really high too , though I honestly think it was all a bit of a coincidence that we found someone to take the position full-time after an initial struggle to fill it . Sometimes you have a lot of options and sometimes you do n't . We 've got Marcelo now . He 's got a lot of quality and I hope he makes the position his for the next ten years . <p> Marcelo is also compared to you when he plays for Real Madrid , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game that fans enjoyed so much , even the fans of Sao Paulo rivals Palmeiras and Corinthians ? I think the fans could see I had a lot of fun with the ball , so much so in fact that I was still playing every match by the time I got to 38 and 39 , even when I was at Corinthians . I only missed games when Adilson Batista wanted to rest me ( laughs ) . <p> One of your strongest suits was your shooting . When did you realise you had a gift for hitting the ball hard and is there any piece of advice that stuck with you throughout your career ? I 've always had that power in my left foot , ever since I was a little boy . The key thing was that lot of people taught me a lot about what to do with it , people like Otacilio Goncalves , Vanderlei Luxemburgo and Carlos Alberto Parreira , though it was Luxemburgo who taught me the most . He played as a fullback too , at least he told me he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe him or not ( laughs ) . When I was starting out , I 'd get to the byline and almost always try to shoot on goal . Vanderlei taught me to how to position myself , to look up and see what was going on in the box , cross the ball , and choose the right time to get forward . <p> As someone who 's only just retired are you aware that you 'll go down as one of the greatest left-backs of all time ? Do n't say that . Think about the likes of Nilton Santos , Junior and Branco . They were all great teachers and a great inspiration for me . I 'm flattered when people say that and I 'm happy with the career I 've had , but I honestly see them as different class . <p> The content on this site that is published contains rumors , speculation , assumptions , opinions , and factual information .

##3217952 <h> the presence of a mother <p> Boy did this absolutely amazing thing for me . And the effect of this one thing he did has rippled much farther into the future than I ever anticipated . <p> It had become this running joke about our mothers , that after 11 years they had never met . Of course they knew more about each other than they may ever realize . My mother is obviously a key figure in my life , and so is boy 's mother . Each has been a tremendous influence on the woman I am and the woman I have yet to become . So after all I have asked from boy -- quitting his job ( although it has become the longest goodbye yet ) , relocating to a desert , saying goodbye to our friends ( do you KNOW how hard it is to make such awesome friends as an adult ? ) and leaving the place that holds more sentimental value than the galaxy holds stars -- after all of this , he surprised me by managing to get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and my mother so they could support me at my white coat ceremony . Did I mention this happened on his birthday ? <p> The first night they were here I went to bed in a stupor , so filled with love I tried to describe it and felt like a babbling fool . I compared it to the realization of a mythical event . For so long I sustained from envisioning a wedding because the logistics sound like a nightmare . So having them both there to support me on my new journey into medicine was something beyond what my mind was prepared to receive . Their presence felt like a blessing on my new journey . <p> But here 's the unexpected echo from boy 's gesture . When my mom was here I hugged her goodnight as she came from her bath and retreated to the guest bedroom . I noted the slight perfume from her skin and the humidity from the bath tub and it brought me back , so far back , to being a little girl and finding comfort in my mother 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of lotion , and then turned on the bedside light as she read prior to going to sleep . I would mark time by her routine . Sometimes I would not go to sleep until I knew that she too was in bed . Sometimes I would walk in and tell her I could n't sleep and she would walk me back to bed . Most of the time I would try to climb into her bed so I could spend the night feeling safest by her side . All of those nights were accompanied by the slight humidity left over from her bath and the soft scent of her lotion . <p> I 'm 6 weeks into medical school . Even at the age of 31 , this is probably one of the scariest journeys I have been on . I get stressed , lose sleep , and try to desperately reassure myself that both dog and boy are happy in the middle of the conservative desert . And sometimes , when I get too exhausted from it all , I drag my feet to the guest bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allowance of rest over studying . I envision that my mother is somewhere nearby and there is a gentle humidity from her bath lingering over the room . Just knowing that she slept in that room is enough to convince me that the scent of her lotion is still permeating through the hallway and into the bedroom . And I can close my eyes and find some relief from that self-critical voice that got me here , that pushes me harder , that knows exactly how hard I had to work to get here and knows that it will not end anytime soon . I fall asleep haggard with the memory of my mother 's comfort tucked into the senses of my mind and I wake up knowing that I am enough . I know that my mother will not always be here . She lost her mother when she was my age . But the shadow of her presence is so powerful that I 
##3218051 <h> City discharging wastewater into river for first time <p> Treated wastewater , from the city of Princeton 's wastewater treatment plant , flows out through a grated pipe and into this stretch of the Rum River located about a mile south of the Princeton Golf Course . The flow into the river began about two weeks ago and is the first time that the city 's wastewater plant has sent treated wastewater into the river . <p> If you were canoeing downstream on the Rum River in Princeton you might notice , since last year , a new feature along the western shore of the river nearly a mile south of the golf course . <p> Princeton Public Works Director Bob Gerold looks over the new oxidation ditches at the expanded Princeton city wastewater plant last Friday . <p> The feature is a metal grate , with water flowing out of it into the river . The discharge , which began there on Oct. 9 this year , is treated wastewater from the city 's newly-expanded wastewater treatment plant . The discharge into the river is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $18 million expansion project . <p> Prior to the discharge into the river , the plant was discharging its treated wastewater into two ponds , or lagoons , that can be seen from the south end of the golf course . The water in those lined ponds would eventually seep into the groundwater . The rules governing the quality of that treated wastewater were not as high as they are for the expanded plant , says Tracy Ekola , engineering consultant with the engineering firm SEH . <p> The first time the city ever had a mechanical treatment plant for treating its wastewater was starting in late 1995 , when the plant was completed . Prior to that , the city 's wastewater just went into a lagoon system and every spring a rotten-egg odor would waft up from the lagoons and across the city . <p> Jump forward to about 10 years ago , and city officials could be heard deciding that the 1995-era treatment plant would run out of treatment capacity as the city developed . The city council hired SEH to work on a proposed treatment plant design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to approve . <p> Long permitting <p> process <p> But it took more than five years of fits and starts for the city to get the final permit to carry out the plant expansion that is nearing completion now . The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy ( MCEA ) had sued the MPCA for how the MPCA issued the first permit to the city for the expansion and the courts ruled in favor of the MCEA . SEH had to redo the plant-expansion design to include more conditions in order to get the final MPCA permit for the expansion . <p> One of those conditions has been evident of late along the north side of Highway 95 just east of Princeton 's Rum River Drive . There , a contractor was altering the slope of the shoreline of the West Branch of the Rum River to reduce the amount of sediment eroding into the stream . That sediment carries phosphorous , says Ekola , and the Rum River flows into the Mississippi , and the phosphorous settles out in the Lake Pepin part of the Mississippi River , along southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance in a body of water , algae consumes oxygen from a lake , Ekola said on Tuesday this week as she talked about the wastewater plant expansion project in Princeton . <p> Two other river bank locations in the city of Princeton have also undergone the same shoreline excavation this year as part of the wastewater plant expansion -- one near Pioneer Park south of the middle school , and one near the south end of the golf course . <p> The expansion <p> The wastewater plant expansion triples its processing capacity and also adds extra filtering to remove unwanted elements in the treated wastewater . Besides the major change in where the treated wastewater is discharged , another new feature is eight reed beds that were constructed at the plant . The concrete compartments for the reed beds can be seen on the south end of the plant complex . <p> The reeds , once planted and working , should break down the sludge to one-tenth of its volume , and sludge residue would be cleaned out of the reed beds every 7-10 years , according to Ekola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some municipal wastewater plants for 10-15 years now , Ekola said . Having reeds reduce the sludge means not having to spread wastewater sludge on farm fields , like has been done since the mechanical plant was built 17 years ago . <p> Two additional clarifiers , or tanks where solids settle out of the wastewater , and two more oxidation ditches were also added during the wastewater plant expansion . Each of the new oxidation ditches can handle twice the amount of wastewater as each of the two old oxidation ditches could do at the plant , Ekola notes . <p> The newly-expanded plant is designed to process an average of 1.6 million gallons of wastewater per day , with a short-term ability to treat 1.9 million gallons daily during wet weather . To get a perspective of how much extra capacity the plant now has , the amount being processed today is close to 400,000 gallons daily , according to city public works director Bob Gerold , who oversees the plant 's operation . <p> Both Gerold and Ekola said the plant is operating successfully with its added features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated wastewater testing and monitoring , said Gerold last Friday . The Princeton plant , in fact , has the highest wastewater quality standards in the state because it is the newest , Gerold added . <p> The tests gauge the amounts of phosphorous , ammonia , nitrogen , mercury and also a property called carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand , the latter expressed as CBOD . The higher the CBOD content , the more the wastewater has to be broken down as it requires a high amount of oxygen to do so , Ekola notes . <p> At the heart of the plant operation are millions of living bacteria that eat the wastewater 's organic material and they require oxygen to do this . <p> City Administrator Mark Karnowski said during a city council meeting about two months ago that when the original plant was put into operation in late 1995 , there were problems with the operation . He said he therefore wanted to make sure any problems this time would be covered under the contractors ' warranties . <p> The price tag of the expansion project has added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low-interest loan from the United States Department of Agriculture 's Rural Development program . The bills went from $18.72 per month for a residential user in late 2011 , to $50.40 per month when they were fully phased in during April this year . <p> Karnowski has said that any city faced with upgrading its wastewater facilities and keeping up with growth , will be faced with more cost . <p> A view of the newly-expanded wastewater plant , looking north last Friday .

##3220650 <h> Dimock Proud is Sick of the Same Old ( Wrong ) Story <p> Earlier this month , the Scranton Times-Tribune published an article rehashing the Dimock story containing absolutely zero new relevant factual information . We responded with both a letter to the editor and a blog post expressing our exasperation that although testing by Cabot , the PA DEP and the EPA have found that the water meets safe drinking water standards the newspaper continues to publish these redundant stories . <p> Today it became evident that we are not alone in our feelings -- Anne Van Lenten , a resident of the Dimock/Springville area and a member of the Dimock Proud group , submitted her own letter expressing frustrations towards the article . <p> Editor : The Sept. 30 article : " The Methane Mess : Are leaking wells still allowing methane to seep into Dimock 's water ?

It spent these words propping up a thesis of a researcher from a North Carolina university at the expense of residents in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a travesty and a dereliction to the very community the Times-Tribune supposedly serves . <p> A researcher seeking to save face looks at EPA data , makes conclusions that the EPA itself did n't make and that officials involved with the initial DEP investigation publicly refute . How is this news ? <p> What is clear is that The Times-Tribune is struggling to remain relevant and this reporter seemingly ca n't accept that our water is safe . Otherwise , why spend so much space on an issue where the only new development is one researcher 's hastily found opinions on what is occurring in an area he knows little about ? <p> If our paper of record cared about the quality of life in the communities it serves , it might decide to stop manufacturing stories like this where none exist . We are a strong community but this continued thrashing at the stroke of the Times-Tribune pen is wearing us thin . <p> Want to know how we feel about Cabot Oil and Gas ? Stop by the annual picnic it holds every year which draws thousands of Northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those expressed on these pages . <p> Perhaps the Times-Tribune can run an article of equal length on the fact that EPA , after conducting extensive testing , found that Dimock 's water does not pose a threat to human health or safety .

##3224151 <p> But in the NFL , a quarterback is only part of the story . He ca n't have success without a collection of offensive linemen who can protect him . In Wilson 's case , it 's a little different . He 's being protected by a former defensive lineman -- fellow rookie J.R . Sweezy . <p> While most rookies talk about going through growing pains , few go through an entire transformation . That 's exactly what Sweezy has done as he has switched from playing defensive tackle at NC State , where he was a dominant defender for the Wolfpack , to offensive guard , a position he had n't played since he was 8 years old . <p> " Basically , everything is different , " he says . " Down to the stance . Literally everything . It was quite a challenge .

He says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an offensive lineman can get beat very easily if he 's too aggressive . <p> Sweezy says he sometimes has to remind himself that he 's on offense and forget his Moorsevill High ( N.C. ) linebacker role and his standout years as a Wolfpack defensive tackle .

##3228651 <p> BoostMood is the world 's first and ONLY ALL-NATURAL SUPPLEMENT that 's specifically designed to keep you going all night without a nasty crash at the end using a maximum strength proprietary blend of ingredients derived from natural serotonin and stamina boosters . <h> No Effect From Molly The First Time <p> No , it is not normal to have no effect after having molly for the first time . Either you have not taken molly or you are completely mistaken about the molly drug effects that you are not feeling anything . The truth might be as well the fact that you are only thinking that you are not feeling anything , but actually you are quite feeling the molly drug effects . Drugs often play tricks with the brain and this might be just one trick that molly has pulled up on you . Given the chemical nature of molly it is quite unnatural not to feel any effect at all . This article presents you with molly drug information about the chemical nature of molly and the chemistry of molly inside the brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify the effects of molly inside the body so that you can know what is happening in your body under molly drug effects . <h> Molly Effects <p> Molly or mdma generally acts in the body by increasing the secretion of serotonin in the brain synapse junctions . Serotonin is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter inside the brain that is responsible for all our feelings and perception . Since molly heightens this serotonin secretion by a neurochemical process we get to feel more about the reality surrounding us . Serotonin is naturally present in the synaptic junctions of our brain neurons as it is released whenever there is a transmission of vital signal from one nerve cell to another . Also present on the wall of neurons are serotonin reuptake receptors that take back the serotonin into the cells after the signal has been transmitted . This is how molly works on the serotonin levels in your brain . <h> Serotonin Molecules <p> The mdma molecules actually mimic the serotonin molecules and as a result they are preferentially taken by the serotonin receptors on the walls of the neurons . This preferential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three step way . first , since the receptors are now occupied with mdma instead of serotonin there is an automatic increase in the serotonin levels in the neuron junctions . Second , the mdma molecule causes the receptors to act in reverse , the receptors now act to bring out serotonin from the cells to the synapse rather than taking them inside . Thirdly , the mdma molecules already inside the neurons constantly push more serotonin molecules out of the brain neurons into the synaptic junctions . These are the molly drug effects that we feel every time after we take molly , whether the first time or the last time . <p> If you have been taking molly under the impression that it is a natural antidepressant solution then you must be aware of the fact that molly itself is not a natural antidepressant at all . It is a synthetic chemical manufactured in drug laboratories so there is nothing natural or organic about them . The only connection of natural antidepressant in reference to molly is through serotonin which is the actual natural antidepressant present in your brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##3228951 <h> Partners <h> Blog Metrics <p> If wine tasting is for wines , cupping is for coffee . So yes , you can actually become a coffee connoiseur if you want . You may not have heard about this but it 's been going on in areas not very familiar to many of you . The procedure is quite similar to wine tasting . Different coffee brews are presented on a table and are then tasted by visitors . The tasting , however , is not done in a small cup but using a sterling silver spoon . The goal here is to be more educated about coffee flavor , taste and aroma whether wet or dry . Participants taste and drink pure coffee only without milk or sugar . <p> This procedure is normally conducted by coffee shops and restaurants in London before they decide which ones to offer in their menu . At the Blvd Coffee cupping event , people get to learn about one of the priciest coffees ever offered which is the Panama Esmeralda Geisha . This type is priced at $50 to $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee festival called UK Coffee Week . It features public and cultural events all related to coffee and food service with the goal of raising public awareness on the quality , preparation and sourcing of this very popular adult drink . <p> This year , more than 12,000 coffee and food lovers , baristas , business owners and industry experts attended the event held at The Old Truman Brewery on Brick Lane . Coffee tastings offered during brewery tours and at some coffee shops were some of the highlights of the event . There were also demos on how coffee beans are roasted over hot coals and served in china cups . <p> No , it 's not . Coffee cupping was invented by the professionals to primarily detect defects so that a green coffee buyer would n't get stuck with a pallet of bad coffee .

##3231352 <h> Exploring writing , publishing , life , and creativity . . . <h> Main menu <h> Post navigation <h> 3 Ways to Keep the Doors to Publishing Swinging OPEN <p> My boss , the publisher for multiple divisions at Baker Publishing Group , says this often : " The door to publishing is either swinging open , or it 's swinging closed . " <p> He 's right . If you are a published author or aspire to be one , your chances of publishing are either getting better or worse all the time . <p> The trick is to keep the door the swinging open . Following are three ways to do that . <p> Platform . Keep expanding your platform , your ability to find exposure for your work . This can sound daunting , but it need n't be . Building a platform takes time . Resign yourself to that , decide it 's important ( it is ) , and then block off time each week to work on it . <p> Read books and blogs about it . Try something new on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose excellent tweets . Start saving for a good website design . <p> Also , think about how to sustain your energy for this work . Do you have some friends whose help you can enlist ? Is there somebody you should host to lunch ? And what 's your mission in all this ? There 's nothing like a clear sense of mission to keep you going for the long haul . <p> Concept . I remember a conversation with an agent about the concept an author was pursuing . The last time this author and I had spoken , we had talked about one concept . " It 's not big enough , " this agent was telling me . " We 're going to save that one for later . Instead , we 're doing this , " and the agent proceeded to knock my socks off with the concept they had settled on . <p> Concept is just hugely important . I recommend keeping a running list of book ideas . Brainstorm a list and then keep adding to or removing from it as you interact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , that if you pick the right one and pair it with excellent writing , you can steal past the platform bugaboo , and use your book to build your platform ! The wrong concept can hurt you in at least two ways . It can send publishers packing , or , if the concept is contracted , the resulting book can fail to sell , and that hurts you too , which brings me to my last point . <p> Sales . Getting published can be the worst thing you can do for your writing career . How ? If your book does not sell well , you will likely have a hard time getting a second contract . A really hard time . Here 's why . Book buyers have long memories . If we sell your book to an account , and it immediately starts sucking the retail exhaust pipe , that account will remember . If we bring your next book to that same account , the account is likely to say no thanks or reduce the purchase significantly . <p> Publishing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just true that publishers need authors to help move their books . When an author chooses to take a three-month European sabbatical as her book is releasing , that hurts sales . We ca n't stop authors from doing this , of course , but we wo n't be excited to publish your next one . <p> Work hard to promote and sell your book because the converse of the above is also true . Books that perform well in the marketplace give you all kinds of leverage the next time around . Publishers will be clamoring for your next one . <p> I keep the door swinging open by pressing through even when discouragement settles in . Some weeks I feel like giving up , but God has a way of pulling us up again . If I am making a difference with my words and encouraging others I can be proud of that . If I give another person a space to share their voice I can be proud of that . <p> Like you said , patience has been a huge learning curve for me . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be sustainable if I do n't have a strong platform and concept . To have that I have to dig in and put in the work ! <p> ( I will continue to have a sense of humor about it though , for example , I still feel silly when I am ' hashtagging ' and ' pinning ' and adding myself to ' linky 's ' . ) <p> Lisa , good words . It does take time , but most people I talk to in the blogging world , for example , talk about hitting a critical mass followership in about five years . That 's not forever , and we 'll learn so much along the way ... <p> I have heard figures like 500 facebook followers , 1,000 twitter followers , 10,000 views a month on your blog are these numbers publishers look for or is it different for each author ? ( and maybe different for fiction and non-fiction writers ? ) <p> We definitely look at those numbers , Lisa , and my area is nonfiction so I can only speak to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do see social media stats as part of a larger picture , of course . But if social media stats are low , they probably do more harm than good . <p> While I try to set goals of my own for my online marketing plan , I 'm struggling to reconcile all of these mixed messages . It 's very clear to me that authors are expected to do some of the work promotion following publication ( though then I read that it does n't do much to help sales ) . <p> But what do I need to strive to do prior to publication ? What should my goals be at this stage -- when I have absolutely nothing to sell but a manuscript ? <p> AK , thanks for visiting and for writing in with this excellent question . First let me say that as a veteran online marketer you have a real leg up , so take heart ! I do think it 's important for you to have a marketing plan for any book you 're writing , and you should include the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a big difference . I also encourage you to read Platform by Michael Hyatt and Tribes by Seth Godin , if you have n't already , and keep building your tribe . I hope this helps ! <p> Thanks for the reply ! I 'm a Godin follower ( my day job is very " Poke the Box " -ish ) . I have n't read Platform -- will check it out . What you have said makes sense to me , and has been the basic premise I 've been working on for a while . <p> A few more thoughts . I appreciate his emphasis on good writing , which is spot on . A legend in my part of the industry says , " The best any publisher can do is get the word of mouth started . " Brilliant promotion by anybody , author or publisher , will only make a bad book fail faster . Good writing ( meaning a great concept or story , well written ) keeps positive word of mouth going , and that 's what really sells books . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonfiction authors can do a lot of speaking engagements on the topic about which they 've written . Fiction authors can speak at writers conferences , of course , but that 's a very limited audience . There may be a few other venues where novelists can legitimately give a talk , but just by nature of the content I think nonfiction authors have more options when it comes to speaking engagements . And speaking engagements have the potential to sell a LOT of books . <p> Your distinction between book promotion and tribe-building is also really important . There 's a difference between mere book-hawking and helping people . <p> Regarding his point about not blogging on writing , here again I think it 's a matter of intention and calling . I do n't recommend blogging about writing if ALL one is trying to do is hawk his/her books , but if an author wants to help other writers and cultivate a mutually beneficial community , why not ? And if that author sells a few books in the process , all to the good . <p> One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to novels , " So much depends on reaching a certain level of quality . Focus on that . " And I think he 's right about that . But that does n't mean you should n't do speaking gigs and blogging . <p> Well , I hope these thoughts are useful . You may well have prompted me to do a post on promotion that works and is n't sleazy . Be well . <p> Good post . I wish I 'd started building a platform earlier . But you 're right to say it takes time . You have to learn something first so you have something of value to give to others . And learning -- becoming an expert -- takes time . <p> My question is this : are sales as important as ever or are they becoming a little less important due to the internet ? What if people self-publish and they do n't sell much ? Do you see them as bad marketers and steer clear of them even though booksellers would n't necessarily know who they were and would probably be looking at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn something , and that takes time . Another thing that takes time is discovering , for example , what horizon your blog is going to cover . I read a great post at the BufferApp blog yesterday about how their blog has evolved through two or three significant iterations . <p> To answer your questions , yes , sales are important as ever . If an author self-publishes a book that does n't sell well , I ca n't say we definitely would not publish that author , but the poor sales performance is an indication of the author 's ability or lack of ability to help us move books . That can be overcome , especially if the book was published five years ago and the author can win us over with all that s/he has going now that s/he did n't have going then . But yes , sales are important , regardless . <p> And thanks for your kind words , Sally . You made one of the first comments , as I recall , and I appreciate your checking in . Feel free to let me @ @ 
##3239150 <h> Stop on Red Week would seem to be a no-brainer <p> I noticed on Friday that I had nearly missed all of Stop on Red Week , an effort to promote public safety by encouraging people to stop for red traffic lights . <p> My first reaction was that devoting a week to such an obvious theme seems to be a waste of time , money and elbow grease . Who does n't know that a red light means stop ? Even my just-turned-8-year-old could explain the finer points of green , yellow and red traffic lights . <p> One might as well devote seven days to " Breathe Air Week . " It should be that simple . It should be second nature . <p> But , of course , we know that unfortunately that 's not the case . There are still far too many people who speed up when they see a yellow light . Sometimes they make it , and sometimes they do n't . Sometimes they even blow right through a solid red light -- no hint of yellow in sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have cameras monitoring traffic light violations . Those cameras record people running red lights , often as many as dozens of them each day , even at the risk of getting a ticket in the mail and having to pay a fine of more than $100 . <p> But this column is not about those red light cameras . I 've discussed those in this space before , and made my opinions pretty clear . <p> Instead , I wanted to write about how drivers treat red lights , and other traffic laws in general . <p> Just a few weekends ago , I drove to Osceola to visit my older son at scout camp . It was a mostly uneventful trip , though I do remember at least one occasion where an impatient driver pulled out to pass slower traffic despite there being a double yellow line . I suppose it 's possible that he or she did n't know what a double yellow line means , but the lack of visibility due to a curve in the road should have been a strong enough signal that passing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the store the other day , when I literally had to walk around someone parked directly in front of the door , squarely in the middle of an area clearly marked " Fire lane -- No parking . " I wondered what kind of person was n't able to see that , or who thought it just did n't apply to their particular situation . <p> And then there was Tuesday morning . I had just arrived home for lunch , and as I rolled the empty trash can up from the curb , a large truck drove past . I was nowhere near the road , had n't indicated that I was going to step out into traffic and had n't even made eye contact with anyone else , but the driver of this truck gunned his engine as he passed , pushing his speed well past the 30 mile and hour limit -- probably closer to 45 . Never mind that our street has closely packed houses with families , children , pets , cross traffic and all kinds of other potential hazards ; this driver apparently was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and voiced his displeasure by revving the gas as he passed . <p> These things bother me , because it 's that kind of attitude that makes car accidents so common . If more people simply followed the rules of the road , observed the speed limit , stop signs , stop lights and the actions of other vehicles around them , probably 95 percent -- maybe more -- of the accidents that happen could be prevented . I have n't been in a crash since I was a teenager , and believe me , that was a while back . I simply pay attention , follow the rules and am able to avoid sticky situations on the road . <p> Now , I ca n't say for sure that the people who park in a fire lane are also the people who would run a red light or pass traffic in a no-passing zone . But I would n't doubt if they are . They certainly exhibit the same disregard for the law and for the other people around them . <p> Just imagine : If everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't cut corners , behaved courteously toward other drivers and generally paid attention to what was going on around them , we could probably reduce the number of accidents by 90 percent -- not to mention the number of tickets for all manner of violations . <p> So , last week was Stop on Red Week .

##3242950 <h> Football Headline <h> Saturday November 17 , 2012 Gators Pass Final Test with FSU Looming <p> GAINESVILLE , Fla . ? The Gators did it Saturday the way they have done it all season . <p> First , they did it with defense . <p> After Jacksonville State gained 76 yards on the game ? s first play from scrimmage ? a short pass from Marques Ivory to Kevyn Cooper that ended at UF ? s 7-yard line ? the Gamecocks gained only 166 yards on their final 56 plays ( 2.9 yards per play ) in the Gators ? 23-0 win . <p> Florida ? s defense clamped down as usual and added a score on Jon Bostic ? s 7-yard interception return for a touchdown early in the third quarter . Florida allowed only 58 points ( 8.3 per game ) all season at home . <p> ? I don ? t know if there ? s a better defense in the country , ? ? Florida coach Will Muschamp said after the Gators became the first team to shut out JSU in 12 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? re playing very well. ? <p> Next , the Gators did it with special teams . <p> Senior Caleb Sturgis hit field goals of 21 , 44 and 47 yards , his last score set up by a 31-yard punt return by Marcus Roberson . <p> Finally , Florida sprinkled in some Mike Gillislee , Omarius Hines , Jordan Reed and others in Jacoby Brissett ? s first start in place of injured starting quarterback Jeff Driskel . Gillislee was the star for the offense ? 122 yards on 20 carries and a touchdown ? and Brissett efficiently managed the game the way the coaches wanted . <p> Brissett finished 14 of 22 for 154 yards and no interceptions . <p> With the win the Gators improved to 10-1 ? becoming just the seventh team in program history to win 10 of its first 11 games ? and sent a group of 19 seniors off with a perfect home record ( 7-0 ) in their final game at The Swamp . <p> ? To win in the SEC and to be undefeated at home , that ? s tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That ? s very tough. ? <p> The Gators made it look tougher than expected on some Saturdays this fall , most notably the season-opening win over Bowling Green and last week ? s last-second victory over Louisiana . And while a portion of the fan base expected a 50-0 rout over the JSU Saturday , that ? s not the way this Florida team is built . <p> Muschamp knew that from the start , and 10 wins in 11 games later , his view of this team hasn ? t changed . <p> ? Part of coaching and part of being a good coach is realizing who you are and what you are and what your players can do and what they can ? t do , ? ? Muschamp said . ? I knew after spring identifying kind of what I thought we were going to be , and this is about what I thought . I thought we were going to be a team that ? s going to have to grind it out a little bit offensively , that ? s going to need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay injury-free. ? <p> That pretty much sums up the way the No. 7-ranked Gators have won to climb back onto a national stage after back-to-back seasons that produced 15 wins and 11 losses . <p> They have had more injuries than they would have liked ? the offensive line has especially been hit hard in the second half of the season ? but the Gators are excellent defensively and on special teams , and good enough offensively other than the 17-9 loss to Georgia that cost them a perfect season to this point and a trip to the SEC Championship Game . <p> Brissett didn ? t throw a touchdown pass against the Gamecocks but he had four completions of 20 yards , including a 30-yarder to Reed . <p> ? We came out with a W , ? Brissett said . ? That ? s good enough for me. ? <p> The Gators , No. 6 in the BCS , have two games remaining and one shot at a BCS Bowl next week at No. 10 Florida State . The Gators have lost two in a row to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by winning at FSU . <p> The Seminoles won 41-14 at Maryland and next week ? s matchup at Doak Campbell Stadium will mark the first time in 12 years both the Gators and Seminoles are ranked in the top 10 at the time of their annual regular-season finale . <p> Gators Buck/linebacker Lerentee McCray was one of 19 seniors to say goodbye to The Swamp on Saturday . <p> ? I can say everything I want to about missing the Swamp , but it wo n't feel right unless we beat Florida State , ? ? McCray said . ? We want 11-1 . ? <p> FSU ? s defense is ranked among the nation ? s best like Florida ? s . They have a more experienced quarterback in E.J. Manuel and will be favored on their home field . <p> Meanwhile , the Gators will begin preparation uncertain if Driskel , Brissett or both will play quarterback . Driskel wore sweatpants and a T-shirt ? but didn ? t nee crutches ? as he watched from the sidelines Saturday due to his sprained right ankle . <p> ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muschamp said of the ankle . ? He ? s off crutches . He ? s not in a walking boot . We 'll see how it progresses. ? <p> The Gators finished with 356 yards against the Gamecocks , averaging 6.1 yards per play . Still , there were missed opportunities that the Gators likely will need to cash in on against FSU . <p> Muschamp said that will be a priority in practice before the Gators head to Tallahassee in search of their first win over the Seminoles since 2009 ? Senior Day at The Swamp for Tim Tebow and the most successful group of Gators in program history . <p> ? We need to continue to press forward , press forward offensively more than anything , ? ? he said . ? We need to be more consistently offensively . I know I have been saying that , and I know it ? s a

The goal is to share Greasemonkey 's history , to help explain how the decisions made in Greasemonkey 1.0 were reached . Hopefully if you have any interest in user scripting , and especially if you are a script author , you 'll find it enlightening . <p> Greasemonkey is at least seven and a half years old ( version 0.2.5 was released on March 28 , 2005 ; version 0.2 seems to date from January 14th , version 0.1 from way back on December 6th , 2004 ) . Greasemonkey in particular and user scripting in general , not to mention the browser platforms they rely upon , have come a long way in the past eight years or so . <p> If you examine the version history of Greasemonkey , you 'll see that core APIs like GMxmlhttpRequest and GMgetValue / GMsetValue were added very early on . They 've helped define a lot of what user scripting is : a quick and simple way to fix/enhance existing web sites with ( generally ) short and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet more powerful than what standard javascript ( in a web page ) can do . <p> One of the early great scripts was Book Burro , which allowed users to compare book prices at Amazon , Barnes &; Noble , and others , right on the existing web page . This was possible only because GMxmlhttpRequest allowed the user script to break the same origin policy that would be applied to a normal XMLHTTPRequest call made by a web page . The ability to store persistent values and use them at next run also enabled things like adding a search history to GMail . <p> These features are n't provided to normal scripts on web pages , because they can be dangerous . They were provided to scripts , because the user has much more control over which scripts they choose to install . Links clicked online can point to any web site , with any potentially malicious goal , so they 're much harder to control ahead of time . It was in July of 2005 that Mark Pilgrim pointed out the giant unfortunate security hole in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APIs , which made it possible for malicious pages to access and use them . <p> This is when Greasemonkey 's security sandbox came into being . Greasemonkey version 0.3 was public at the time that this security problem became evident . Version 0.4 was in development , but was scrapped to build 0.5 which contained the security fix , later in the same month . It was right at this time that Mozilla was implementing XPCNativeWrappers into Firefox . This formed the core of the execution model that Greasemonkey has used ever since , until the release of Greasemonkey 1.0 , a span of over seven years . An entire article , at least this long , could be written just on the repercussions of this change . In short , as the linked page says , " XPCNativeWrapper is a way to wrap up an object so that it 's safe to access from privileged code . " In this case the privileged code is the user script ( with the APIs that Greasemonkey grants it ) , and the wrapper makes it " safe to access " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greasemonkey Hacks O'Reilly book which was in progress at the time needed to be completely rewritten , as many of the scripts it contained would no longer function properly . As part of this rewrite , the Avoid Common Pitfalls section was added , based on the author 's insight from reading and re-writing dozens of scripts to deal with the issues this security focused change caused . ( And the pitfalls commonly tripped up script authors . ) <p> This was the only intentional backwards-incompatible change ( anything else was a bug , and fixed ) in Greasemonkey 's eight year history , until version 1.0 . I bring this up primarily to stress the point that we really do care about maintaining compatibility . We broke it again in version 1.0 , and not lightly , but rather because after years of experience ( and changes around us ) , we decided it was the right thing to do . <p> But why ? Partially because we think it 's a very small break . Few scripts should be affected . But also , go back and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It relates to a number of things that may be completely natural , for experienced javascript programmers , and especially for new ones just trying to follow tutorials . Time and time again , script authors would come to us with problems , saying that the script works fine in a web page ( or the Firebug console , or similar ) , but fails in Greasemonkey . And fails mysteriously . Usually no error is given , sometimes something cryptic , but the answer is never obvious unless you know it already . This makes developing scripts hard , which is not awesome . <p> On top of the broken features , the security restrictions mean that interacting with javascript on the page is harder . The security restrictions intentionally isolate the script in the page ( content scope ) from the user script ( script scope ) . But when the script tries to alter the content scope , it ca n't . There are plenty examples of authors trying this , and failing . Then there 's the location hack and reading content globals workarounds . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script functions . And the pitfalls article . But you need to know both that these problems , and their workarounds , exist in order to use them ! <p> Let 's not forget unsafeWindow . This beast was created back when the legacy security sandbox was added . Some times , you just need to poke at the content scope . With the legacy sandbox , sometimes unsafeWindow is the only way to do this . But that name was n't picked lightly . The unsafeWindow object is unsafe ! Back in 2008 , I figured out a way around the security sandbox , for any script that used unsafeWindow for any purpose . That particular hole has been patched , and we 're not aware of any others . But that does n't mean they do n't exist . <p> Unfortunately , usage of unsafeWindow is extremely widespread . My API usage survey showed it to be the most commonly used Greasemonkey feature , where using none at all was the only more common case . Nearly one of five scripts use it . And there 's always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through some avenue which we simply are n't aware of yet . If so any site that a script accesses via unsafeWindow could gain all of the Greasemonkey APIs . Which means GMxmlhttpRequest , and the ability to interact with any site you 're logged into , whether it 's Facebook or your bank . <p> The whole problem boils down to the security restrictions that keep the content scope and script scope both separated and different from each other . The big idea in Greasemonkey 1.0 was to change this model . I discussed something like this in 2009 and Johan brought it up again in 2011 with some distinct details . In short , web browsers and javascript have come a long way since 2004 . There are features like DOM Storage and postMessage , and all the things popularly labeled as " HTML5 " . Scripts can use these features , rather than the Greasemonkey specific ones . Even more importantly , though , a majority of scripts do n't use any special Greasemonkey APIs . Yet they bear all the compatibility burdens that the security sandbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of Greasemonkey 1.0 was to make it possible for the most common class of scripts , with no need for special APIs , to work just like a content script , with all the new features that the browser supports , with all the standard methods javascript programmers are used to ( including jQuery ) , without breaking anything . And none of the mysterious failure modes . <p> The way we chose to do this is to make the APIs an opt-in feature , rather than on by default for everybody like they always were before . This is what the @grant metadata does . It says " I really need it , so I want this special API for my script " and , as a result , I 'm willing to deal with the limitations of the security sandbox it will be put into . <p> But for the past eight years , this has n't existed , so nobody has used it . What about all the scripts written in that time ? In Greasemonkey 1.0 , simple content sniffing is performed on the script . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Greasemonkey acts like the appropriate @grant line was given , even if it was n't . If you want the new execution mode where everything ( besides the privileged APIs ) works for sure , you simply specify @grant none in your metadata . <p> This mode also puts you much closer to the content scope . From the script scope , you can read any content scope variable simply by using its name . No reading content globals workaround . And you can even write to the content scope , simply by addressing it as " window.thing = value " . No location hack necessary . ( In more javascript-y terms , window is the content global scope ; in the script this is the script global scope . And this has window as its prototype . ) <p> Examining every existing script hosted at userscripts.org shows that not a single one does this ( assigning a value to a property of window ) today ( so they wo n't get different broken semantics ) . Unfortunately , jQuery does , so it needs to be fixed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a case . On the other hand , if the page you run on already includes jQuery , then you can just use it ! You have direct read access to the global content scope ! <p> Eventually , @grant none will become the default . At that point , we will stop sniffing and faking grants that were not specified . And at that point you will be required to specify the grant for any API that you do still actually want to use . Only time will tell when we 're comfortable enough making that change . <p> Finally , do n't forget about the grant-none-shim.user.js , which provides an emulation layer for most of the Greasemonkey APIs on top of standard browser features . If you ( for example ) use getValue / setValue or xmlhttpRequest , but only on a single origin , you can switch to this and get the thin sandbox goodness of a grant none style script , and everything will generally work as it always did , at little to no cost . Just note that existing stored values will no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The entire list of bugs handled in this release is also available via the 1.1 milestone on GitHub . Note that as always it takes some time for Mozilla to review the new version , but it 's available on the all versions page immediately . <p> If you are using it and notice problems , it 's best to log an issue or let us know at greasemonkey-dev ( and be clear that it 's with this version ) . <h> Thursday , August 30 , 2012 <p> Back in November 2009 , I analyzed the API usage , and a few other aspects , of all the scripts on userscripts.org , then 36,141 scripts . I was directly discussing some of the topics that were already bubbling around the back of our minds , for how to carry Greasemonkey into the future with us . The short version is : web browsers and web apps are getting so much poweful , why do we need these one-off Greasemonkey APIs with cross-browser problems ? <p> Now that Greasemonkey 1.0 is out , we 've made big steps made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I downloaded ( with permission from the site owner ) every single active script on userscripts.org , now 82,084 scripts . <p> Not much has changed . By far most common is that a script does n't call any special APIs ( 57.94% ) . Then , GMgetValue / GMsetValue are still right up there . <p> The biggest change is that unsafeWindow usage has jumped from 6th to 2nd place ( 12.44% to 17.65% of scripts ; 1,527 scripst also mention wrappedJSObject , not on the chart ) . Authors want to interact with the page in ways that the security sandbox ( which protects these APIs ) prevent , so they explicitly jump out of the sandbox , bringing vulnerabilities with them . Of the 14,484 scripts that reference unsafeWindow , 6,494 of them use no other Greasemonkey APIs , and thus are served well by moving towards a model where there is no sandboxing ( nor APIs , unless you ask for it/them ) . Another 838 scripts only use GMlog and/or GMaddStyle , which can easily be replaced with console.log() or the compatibility shim layer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I see a lot of get/set value calls , which ( assuming you run on only one domain ) can also be well served by DOM Storage . <p> Moreover , those 47,557 scripts that do n't use any of the special APIs are still saddled with the sandbox and its pitfalls , known and unknown before Greasemonkey 1.0 . Plenty of newer browser features do n't work in the security sandbox because its entire point is to separate the content scope ( where these features work ) from the script scope ( with its smaller set of privileged features ) . A huge part of the design changes in Greasemonkey 1.0 is to make the default behavior , like these majority of scripts need/want , to run as close to possible as a regular script in a regular web page , without surprises like missing values and broken features . <p> So do scripts that use get/set value or xmlhttpRequest really need the cross-domain behavior they provide ? <p> ( Note : the left-most set of bars is " @include * " and the rightmost is " &gt;5 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure why . ) Mostly : no , and this has n't changed much since 2009 . The vast majority of scripts using get/set value ( 71.86% ) only ever execute on a single domain , and thus can use DOM Storage with no ill effects . <p> The XHR usage to two domains is lower mostly because I fixed my analysis a bit ( i.e. not counting an @include of *. example.com and an XHR to www.example.com as two domains , and not counting XHRs to userscripts.org , assumed to be update checker scripts , which is now provided by Greasemonkey ) . However , a combined 44.25% of scripts that call XHR ( and with a string literal that I could pull a domain name out of , not a variable set somewhere else ) either call to/run on two or all domains , and thus really use the cross-domain power of GMxmlhttpRequest . <p> Finally a bit more detail about Metadata imperatives . This graph is for all imperatives used in at least 1% of scripts , regardless of what they are . <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more values . Note that almost every script ( 99.37% ) specifies @name , and we see a power law trail off in usage . The commonly used , but unsupported in Greasemonkey , ones are @author , @homepage , @license/@copyright , @date , and @history . <p> Check the raw data to see hundreds more @things , generally all unsupported values . And there I pasted only those used at least ten times , there are yet more hundreds used fewer times . To those that are interested : the script that I used to generate these numbers is available for inspection , in case it perhaps contains a serious bug . The raw data that I generated with it , 
##3244451 <p> In a bid to reduce her carbon footprint , Londoner Lianna Etkind chose an unconventional summer holiday this year -- a voyage to Israel over land and sea . <p> " From London to Israel without flying ? Is that even possible ? " Mostly , telling people about my ambition to travel overland to Israel was met with incredulity . Crossing borders in the Middle East is hardly straightforward , and the ferries that used to go from Greece and Cyprus stopped years ago , another casualty of ' The Situation ' . <p> But it is possible . The cargo ship company Grimaldi allows paying passengers to piggyback on their regular freight passages to Israel . For me , travelling by cargo ship was a way of minimising the climate change impact of my travel . At around 400 Euros ( US$520 ) , it 's more expensive than flying . But passage includes meals and a cabin for the week long sail . I booked trains from London to Paris , then onto Italy , where we would embark . <p> Traveling by ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping is the great circulatory system of the real economy . Despite the fact that we rely on freight shipping for almost everything we buy , from jeans to oranges to iPhones , few people see the enormous ships which supply our consumer needs -- and I was interested to have a window into that world . <p> Freight ship is not the most stress-free method of travel . Would-be passengers are warned that ' schedules are subject to change due to cargo and weather . And a fortnight before we embarked , our sailing date was put back five times -- as well as a heart-stopping phone call informing me that the ship we 'd booked onto was no longer calling at Israel . <p> In the end , the agent managed to transfer our booking to a different ship that did sail to Israel , albeit several days later than planned and from the Southern Italian port of Salerno , rather than Monfalcone . The changes meant that we spent an extra few days hanging around Italian towns , eating pizza and sampling gelatos . But our anticipated two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest concern was whether I will be able to hack a week on board without internet , phones , or anywhere to really go .

##3245351 <p> With so many injuries to the starting quarterbacks , which team has the best backup QB and the best chance of winning this week ? <p> 4 . Nick Foles , Eagles : With Vick likely out , the Eagles will get a chance to see their quarterback of the future play against the Washington Redskins . They will get a chance to test the waters and see what Foles can do . If Foles can pull off a win , Vick 's starting job may be on the line . The Eagles are in need of a miracle to turn this season around ... maybe this is exactly what they are looking for . <p> 3 . Colin Kaepernick , 49ers : The 49ers tied a game they should have lost last weekend against the Rams and are 6-2-1 , leading the NFC West . They have a very good team all around , but the uncertainty with Kaepernick seems to be an issue , especially since they face the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football . Can Kaepernick perform on a national stage ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best teams in the NFL right now , but the inability of the offensive line to protect the quarterback could cause some continuous problems . Campbell is a veteran and should be able to perform well assuming he can get some protection . The Bears will not be able to score as much as they have , but should definitely give the 49ers a run for their money ! <p> 1 . Byron Leftwich , Steelers : With Big Ben likely out for a couple weeks , Leftwich will needs to step up as the Steelers face the Ravens twice in the next 3 weeks . Leftwich has the most experience out of the backups and that definitely contributes to his ability to perform . The Ravens defense has a lot of holes with Ray Lewis and other starters injured . Leftwich should be able to pick up where Roethlisberger left off 
##3245352 <h> Reactions to Tennessee 's 51- 48 4OT loss to Mizzou <p> Posted on November 10 , 2012 by Lahari <p> The Tennessee Volunteers once again done it to themselves . The Vols are still winless in the SEC after losing to the Missouri Tigers . The hopes of making a bowl game are quickly disappearing . The penalties and misjudgment by head coach Derek Dooley are to blame for this loss . <p> The Vols dominated the first half , leading 21-7 . They had an impressive offense , which everyone expected , but even the defense seemed to have turned a corner . Defensive coordinator Sal Sunseri coached from the booth while Dooley seemed to encourage and guide the players on the sidelines for the first time this season . Things seemed to be looking good , but the defense slowly became tired and it showed . The Tigers tied the score at 28 with 47 seconds remaining . Dooley decided to let the clock run out after being unable to gain any yards on two plays , despite having 2 timeouts . This move angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained tied at 48 through 3 overtimes . The Tigers were able to stop the Vols in the 4 th overtime and were able to kick a 35-yard field goal to win the game . The Vols managed to get 11 penalties for 80 yards . Dooley acknowledged that there were several opportunities to win in the post game press conference . The loss has brought up confusion to where this team 's future lies . The fan reaction has been uproar . <p> Fans are calling for Dooley to be fired . This has been the same reaction to the last couple games this season after very high expectations early on . This negative feedback has been growing and making fans weary . The inability for the Vols to have a complete team has raised eyebrows .

##3247950 <h> Far Cry 3 Preview -- Holiday from hell <p> The premise of Far Cry 3 is not all that dissimilar to a teen horror movie ; a high-adventure vacation in a tropical paradise goes horribly wrong when the group of sexy gals and guys are kidnapped for ransom by a bloodthirsty gang of land-lubbering pirates . Long story short , you find yourself alone and having to rescue those of your group that might still be alive . <p> And thus the open world walkabout that is Far Cry 3 begins . <p> As a holiday maker , you 're hardly the type who knows about guns and death ... that 's where your friendly neighbourhood mentor figure comes into play . His name is Dennis . Dennis is your all round nice guy , so nice that it raises suspicions as to his true intentions . Whatever his overall plan , Dennis is the head of a small village that has been fighting the same bandits that kidnapped you and he 's eager as can be to help you rescue your friends and kill a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , in about 30 minutes he manages to give you abilities and confidence to hold a gun , shoot a gun and take lives . Bearing in mind that you 've never shot at a person before , and were skydiving with friends the day before , that 's some educational skill . Our kids could learn a lot from his methods . <p> Our new friend is also the portal through which we learn other essential elements of the game . For example , to create medicine and status effect items you need to collect plants of various types that are dotted around the game 's ( literally ) enormous map . In addition , hunting animals provides you with valuable leather that can be fashioned into a trendy pouch to allow you to carry more items . Again , Dennis is some teacher ... skin an animal and make a bag out of it , surely that would take at least a week to learn ? <p> It 's all up to you as far as indulging in the collecting/crafting is concerned , it does take quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill as it turns out ) but it does makes things easier . What is more essential is the activating of the radio towers dotted around the island , doing so reveals the area on your map and pinpoints the location of hunting grounds , key locations and fast travel points . Climbing the towers takes the formula of an Assassin 's Creed leap of faith moment , in that the climb is a mildly challenging puzzle as you try to work out how to navigate the dilapidated steel and broken ladders and is followed by a triumphant glide to the ground in double quick time ( courtesy of a zip wire ) . <p> Once you 've got the radio towers up and running it 's much easier to use vehicles as a means of transportation . Trying to do so without knowing which roads lead where is nearly impossible thanks to their unpredictable and seemingly random design . My kingdom for an American grid system . <p> Clearly , like Far Cry 2 , exploration and ' playing it your way ' are key themes for Far Cry 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether or not the same level of quality will be present here as was on offer in the last remains to be seen . On the one hand , all of the elements are here to keep you coming back for more , but on the other the world itself is n't as impressive and inviting as it was previously . The jungle mountains punctuated by small bodies of water does n't get the excitement and awe flowing in the same way as the expansive Africa plains did , but then again , we have n't explored the whole map yet . Not by a long shot . <p> The build we played featured two , proper ( i.e. non-tutorial ) missions , one in which you have to infiltrate a wrecked ship being used as a bandit base and another that sees you searching for a special mushroom that can heal a friend of her disease . They could n't be more different from one another , demonstrating a great deal of promise when it comes to mission diversity in the full game . <p> Said wrecked ship mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former being the more rewarding option . Your task is to eliminate specific enemies ( highlighted by their unique uniforms ) and steal the data they 're carrying , once you 've done that you need to get out of there . As part of your default kit you 're carrying a rather fancy digital SLR camera which , presumably through magic , you 're able to use to tag enemies with a floating skull above their heads which means you can see them through solid objects such as rocks , metal and wood . <p> Tagging enemies and then sneaking around behind them is the best way to silently take them out . Alternatively , if you want to shoot them dead , wait until one of the other bandits is using their welding tools to fix the boat -- the noise masks the gun shot . If you happen to make a mistake and are spotted , you might as well give in and reload from your last save point . This is not a game you can realistically expect to win battles in when you 're heavily outnumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mushroom collecting mission resembles something out of Requiem for a Dream . After unwittingly walking through a cloud of mushroom spores , you become intoxicated and the world begins to take on a whole new form around you . Caves shift and change colour and shape in front of your eyes , buildings jump away from you as you approach them , huge rocks lift slowly and elegantly into the air as though light as a feather . <p> It 's a welcome change of pace from the collecting and fighting portions of the game that have been shown up until now and hopefully point to missions that aim to enhance character , setting and emotion rather than just your shooting accuracy . <p> Once you do find the mushrooms , the doctor you 're bringing them back to is no less weird ... but you can find out why for yourself . <p> Taken in isolation , the opening few hours of Far Cry 3 are frustrating , but that 's only because you 've not had a chance to properly explore all the effects you can wring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Clearly , there 's a lot to do here . The mission , then , is to allow players to express themselves and come up with genius ways to employ the wealth of mechanics on offer . If only because the single player portions of the other first-person shooters coming out before Christmas are almost certainly going to bore , 
##3247952 <h> Assassin 's Creed 3 on PC is not a " basic port " <p> The Assassin 's Creed 3 dev team have just taken part in a Reddit AMA chat and there were a few bits and pieces of information that were relevant to the PC version which has still to be released . <p> UbiSoft has confirmed that the PC version will ship with all the latest patches already applied and it comes with a " special patch " which has been " designed to ensure that everything runs as smoothly as possible " . They did mention that there are likely to be fixes at launch or shortly after release but that it will be " less buggy " than the console versions were at launch . <p> The PC version will be enhanced with DX11 support so there is increased texture resolution , Tesselation and shader improvements .

##3250050 <p> On buying a plane : " No way . It 's a total waste of money . You buy the plane , then you have to pay for storage , and on top of that you have to think about the fuel , the cost of the fuel -- that 's maybe $4,000 . Even hiring a private plane is like 50 or 60K . Once you get into that it becomes a habit -- a bad habit . I 'll get one when I need it -- if I have to go somewhere instantly -- but you do n't want to buy a plane ; it 's definitely not worth it . " <p> On music : " I never stop working . In what I wanted to do in music I 've never had any fear . But now I 'm at the top there 's nowhere to go but down ; for me it 's about staying standing at the top .

I want to be loved like Michael Jackson was , from the four-year-olds to the 80-year-olds . I am going to change and grow through my music and doing films . This album was different . My next album will be even edgier . " <p> On swear words : " My music is never going to have swear words in it . Never .

People think I 'm a product , that they found this good-looking kid , cut his hair nice and put Auto-Tune on his voice , wrote him good songs , taught him how to dance and then said , " Here is a pop star for you . " I am the furthest thing from that . I 'm a musician ; I play instruments , I write songs . I 'm a businessman ; I want to create an empire . I want people to know I do n't just sing songs .

I keep my distance when they go to clubs to have their fun -- I go home . Drinking is definitely one way , but it 's not for me . I still want people to think I 'm a good person , a good influence .

I welcome directioners if they 're not being rude but you are . What , are you mad because Justin took back the record of Most Watched Video in 24 Hours that One Direction took ? <p> Justin is amazing guy who adores his family and friends . but cherish what he has with his fans and hopes to grow more fans as he grow older and wiser . he s still wise but having that mentaility of becoming adult dealing with people who are very ignorant in the business . of course the STALKRAZZI . THEY ARE LIKE BEES TO HONEY . <p> Among the things that attracted me to him recently as a fan is his confidence and strong character-he 's no pushover ! Furthermore he has an exciting stage presence I do n't see in most most pop stars or boy bands today . He also will hopefully not be influenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . I think of him as a little brother that I will always defend from the haters . <p> u know Justin that 's the kind of spirit your fans like n wanted n I trust that u will be like MJ not only by music but by your character n personality n I believe that you will not stop until the end just like MJ . <p> Ok correction , he did say his music . But I 'm not sure , they let her say the word on the radio , when they usually leave it out . Maybe it 's not what we think it is ? I do nt know . Even so , I have the confidence that he wo n't curse . ( That " damn " in Die in Your Arms does n't count to me . To me , because of it 's meaning , " damn " is n't really a curse word , so ... ) <p> Justin is my everything ! ! I devote my life to him he 's the only reason get out of bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard days . So basically he 's my life . I do n't know what i 'd be doing without him and his music . So justin if you ever read this just know that your my life saver right now and if you stop making music I 'm gunnar cry ! ! ! ! <p> wonder how many beliebers justin will have is he was'nt so cute and sexy if he was ugly , but still the sweet boy he 's now , well i ' ll still would love him with all my hear becuz beauty is on the inside not on the outside , most people look at the outside of a pakkage not on whats in it lovely ? <p> Amazing . This is why I love Justin . When Rihanna went stupid and started pushing out garbage instead of music , I did n't know what to do . Rihanna was my favorite . When I stopped listening to her , I thought that I would never have another favorite again . Then along came Justin . When I watched his interviews , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " . I listened , and I found a replacement for Rihanna . And his name was JUSTIN BIEBER ! This interview just strethened my love for him again . The fact that he said that he would never curse in his music reminded me of why I liked him in the first place . When he said that he did n't need to drink to have his fun , that just made me think of how he wants to be a good example . He 's such a beautiful person , inside and out , and I do n't know why people hate him . This whole intrview just kept my love strong . ALWAYS A FAN ! <p> Hi Justin . well when i finished read it up I just start crying cause i many times founding the human like you i mean you are real human and my dream comes true , i found you . thank you Justin for everything , you know maybe you think I 'm lying but I 'm really so happy that u are here with me , no matter where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always and nobody will not change that . you give on my face smile when I 'm sad , every day , you are one in a million ...

##3250252 <h> Eagle editorial : Budget pain self-inflicted <h> Photos <p> The state will collect nearly $705 million less in revenue next fiscal year than it will this year , or a drop of 11.4 percent . <p> In case it was overlooked in all the election news , it is important to draw attention to the state 's new revenue estimates -- and the huge budget hole caused by the income-tax cuts signed by Gov . Sam Brownback . <p> Revenue forecasters projected that the state will collect nearly $705 million less in revenue next fiscal year than it will this year , or a drop of 11.4 percent . Even if it spends down all of its cash reserves , the state will have a budget shortfall next year of about $327 million . That assumes overall state spending does n't increase , despite likely growth in Medicaid and the possibility of the state losing the lawsuit on school funding . <p> The cause of this shortfall is not a stalling economy . Rather , it was the reckless decision last session by conservative state lawmakers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a result of those cuts , the state 's income-tax revenue from individuals is expected to drop 15.1 percent next fiscal year . In addition , the planned phasedown of the state 's sales-tax rate on July 1 , 2013 , will reduce those collections by about $262 million . <p> State Budget Director Steve Anderson said that " more pruning " in state spending may be necessary . That 's an understatement . <p> Anderson asked state agencies to prepare budgets for next year with scenarios for 10 percent cuts , though he said he does n't expect to have to cut that much . The Kansas Health Institute News Service obtained documents showing how the state 's three top health agencies might cut 10 percent of their spending -- and it was n't pretty , or realistic . <p> For example , the Kansas Department of Health and Environment proposed reducing its administrative costs by nearly 34 percent , as well as reducing funding for safety-net clinics and aid to local health departments . The Kansas Department for Children and Families said it would not replace workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood programs , and would help fewer parents pay their child-care bills . Possible cuts for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services included home- and community-based services for the frail elderly . <p> Rather than such draconian cuts , the better way to cover the shortfall would be to restore some revenue . Though taking back some of the tax cuts is politically unlikely , Brownback may seek again to eliminate some tax deductions and credits . He also has expressed openness to keeping the sales-tax rate in place . That seems politically difficult , though , as many GOP lawmakers opposed the initial increase , and keeping it in place would shift even more of the tax burden to lower-income Kansans . Another alternative might be for the state to keep in the general fund the portion of the sales tax that is supposed to go to the highway fund . <p> But any of these options involve pain . And what is frustrating is that

##3252550 <p> Although MMW is primarily focused on Muslim women in the media and their issues , I chose to review this book anyway because it lends context to the issues that affect us . In recent months , I have been told that Islamophobia does n't exist ( and is just a fabrication of the victim mentality Muslims have fed the liberal media ) that " a Muslim woman told me not wearing a veil is ok so the veil is n't ok " ( when the truth is much more nuanced than that ) and that teh Islamz is inherently responsible for domestic violence by definition ( because only Muslim men hit women , of course ) . I also think that Muslim women are on the front lines when it comes to bearing the brunt of Islamophobia ( headscarf wars , anyone ) , and in that this book , while not looking at women per se , sets the stage for the issues that affect us . In this vein , if I could critique what is otherwise an excellent book , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more balanced way , given women are affected by Islamophobia in lopsided ways ( see : France 's niqab ban ) . <p> Much like the work of John Esposito and Edward Said back in the day , in a sea of the Bernard Lewises and Thomas Friedmans of this world , Nathan Lean 's book is a welcome addition to Muslim cultural criticism when the only stuff getting airtime these days seems to be the recent Pamela Gellar New York subway ads . Lean takes us through the history of fear in America , drawing parallels among the anti-Catholicism of the 19th and early 20th centuries , the Red Scare of the mid-20th century , and the discourse surrounding Muslims today . As he mentions in the introduction , it is a propos that parts of the evangelical Christian community root their faith narratives precisely in a " religious showdown " with Muslims . <p> The Islamophobia Industry reads well as a continuum , but it is also an easy read chapter by chapter -- I could see how either the entire book or parts of it could be assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , the two highlights of Lean 's book for me were Chapter 2 ( " A Web of Deception : Fomenting Hate Online " ) , covering the role of the internet in creating hate ; and Chapter 7 ( " Across the Pond : The Deadly Effects of Hate in Europe " ) which provided an accurate analysis of the situation " over here . " In Chapter 2 , I could n't help but chuckle when Pamela Geller 's name showed up on only the second line and set the stage for a takedown on Atlas Shrugs and Jihad Watch ( I do n't hyperlink and send traffic to bigotry , sorry ) . This chapter also provides an extremely detailed analysis of the Park 51 shenanigans . I enjoyed Chapter 7 because one of my ongoing complaints about America-based activists is that some people , while well-intentioned , fail to realize that Islamophobia is n't the same game " over here , " something that Lean catches onto right away in the way he writes the chapter . This chapter starts out with a play-by-play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggle-worthy quotes about how his gushed over Robert Spencer ) . Lean goes over some of the context in France , Belgium and Switzerland , and notes that the extreme right , where necessary , is " creating fears about Islam and Muslims rather than exploiting existing ones , " as shown by campaigns by people like Geert Wilders , or the anti-Minaret vote in Switzerland . <p> Sorry to hijack this thread but I do n't know where else would be appropriate . I 've been playing around with Robert Spencer motivational posters and would like to post one . Is it possible to do this here ? <p> mp11 Motivate people to do what to Robert Spencer ? Custard pie would be my favourite . <p> Or are we talking about what motivates him ? He already gets paid too much although I am sure he would like some academic credibility unfortunetly I stand a better chance of winning the 145million eurolottery than he does of getting any academic credibility . Or is he after fame ? he has already been on Fox news , what more could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms . <p> The basis of Islamophobia in Europe and to an extent the uk ( there are differences between countries with colonial links to Muslim countries ) is twofold In the axis area where there is no real colonial history there has been a cultural war aspect -- one endorsed by the Catholic Church and politicians aligned to it . This can be seen in Austria and Germany in particular . As a result that dialogue has gone mainstream qv Angela merkel Those countries that had Muslim colonies have had to accommodate Islam in that era so the argument is more racist there . As a result we see more public demos and overt violence Of course each country has its own seperate issues : sort of like race issues in the US are different in the north and south and west coast That 's why a country like holland , whose colonial history was much more confrontation based and whose colonial expats did n't impact as much on holland has gone more on the culture issue and France ( again confrontational and actually had to be kicked out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British ruled India etc on the sufferance of the natives so had to allow religious freedom ) is at the race end <p> Btw sir dave Unfort the beeb did fall for it Rageh Omar did a documentary on the Prophet and I went into shock when I saw bob I think it was a misguided attempt to have a balanced opinion ( there was an anti muslin Jewish commentator as well who said that the 2 Jewish tribes if medina where justified on selling weapons to Mecca because buisness is buisness ! ) <p> Is it not a coincidence that when the Dutch ruled Indonesia , their rule over Hindu Bali was relatively benign , while their rule over Aceh ( the most devoutly Islamic part of Indonesia ) was extremely brutal ? <p> Another aspect was that British colonialism ( for example ) was driven almost entirely by economic exploitation and did n't really seek to interfere with native cultures , while the French were more intrusive thanks to their mission civilatrice . <p> The French actually offered privileges to Algerian Muslims who agreed to live under French civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they considered it tantamount to apostasy . Algerian Jews on the other hand were given full legal equality -- this may be why independent Algeria expelled them ( as they could be vilified as " collaborators " ) . <p> Well the Dutch church was more confrontational with the Islamic religion due to shared monotheism and Muslims having knowledge of Chrisitian doctrine making them less likely to become rice Christians . One could also argue they were dividing to conquer so they could create a loyal group within the indies who could do the admin etc Also there was a history of excessive aggression -- which the British who were initially in charge did n't do as I read about in Nathaniels nutmeg which describes the English working with the natives then the Dutch came in with cannons and oppression As for India remember the Brits started of as serving the Muslim Mughals and then taking over from them -- they were vastly outnumbered so had to create a culture of relative tolerance Compare that with Belgium and Germany in west Africa -- disastrous Btw the French used textbooks that told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't acknowledge the fact that they did n't give up their empire they had to be kicked out <p> fear ... fear sells ... after the ussr collapsed and the cold war along with it there was no real reason not to cut our military budget ... but bush/cheney had other ideas ..

Canceling these services could keep a notable amount of money in your pocket at the end of every month . <p> Cut Back Your Data Plan Data plans are often the most expensive part of a phone bill .

##3255552 <p> The holiday season is quickly approaching , and some consumers may have to adjust their budgets so they can buy gifts for friends and family . There are a number of small changes you can make to your spending habits to free up the extra cash . Just remember , bad credit personal loans should be used in an emergency and not to go on a shopping spree . <p> If you start now , a few minor changes in your day-to-day life could free up the cash you need to get gifts for loved ones . <p> 1 . Make Your Own Coffee Buying a single cup from a local coffee shop may not seem like very much on its own , but if your do this several days a week , it adds up to a significant amount of money .

##3256651 <h> Meek Mill -- Dreams &; Nightmares Review <p> Back in the day teams had pretty concrete roles . You had the superstar , maybe another star , and the rest of the guys were role-players . Recently though with the reemergence of ' big three ' concept in the NBA teams now are holding more than one bonafide all-star . Even still there remains a hierarchy among the elite . LeBron , Wade , and Bosh are the biggest names on the Heat , but we all know that James is THE guy . <p> Similarly , with Maybach Music Group it 's obvious that Rick Ross is the boss of his crew . But Rozay has a squad of young gunners who are trying to break out of the Ross 's super large shadow . One of the most promising acts in MMG is Philly rapper Meek Mill . The 2011 XXL Freshman Class member has been using his cosigns and connects to elevate himself to the top right next to his employer . Will Dreams &; Nightmares be more Dwayne Wade or Chris Bosh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Produced by Tone The Beat Bully I was surprised that the Maybach drop was n't included to open off the CD . However we get a lush piano loop just as luxurious as the expensive vehicle . Mill sticks to the street rapper script , pledging the loyalty to the game , achieving by any means necessary , money over women etc . While the subject matter may be trite , Meek has enough charisma to make it sound engaging . Halfway through the song the track does a complete 180 as Meek takes his flow into overdrive and the beat goes from melodic to threatening . Nice opener to the album and the switch was pulled off well . <p> 2 . In God We Trust Produced by Black Metaphor So I really wanted to talk about the menacing and brooding back drop that Black Metaphor creates for Mill to spit that grimey , tough talk on . I wanted to talk about how the aggressive delivery that could have made this a staple on the streets . But I have to talk about how about 30 seconds into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went in shock , no Pikachu " . I know there are a lot of people that heard that and though that was hot , and I 'm all for creativity , and a fan of anime . But it was really hard for me to take this song seriously after that one . <p> 3 . Young &; Gettin ' It Featuring Kirko Bangz ; Produced by Jahlil Beats The third cut of the album brings us the CD 's second single . Kirko Bangz helps out on the hook as Meek Mill raps about the carefree lifestyle that comes with being on #teamyoungnigga . It almost feels like they tried to make a Y.O.L.O. type anthem for the young audience . The problem is , anyone over the age of 19 whose circulation is n't being cut off by their jeans probably wo n't be nodding their head to this one . The chorus is average , the beat sounds disposable and Mill 's rhymes are forgettable . <p> 4 . Traumatized Produced by Boi-1da Following a throwaway track we get arguably the best song on the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple yet soulful beat that is really effective as Meek details the adversity that he 's dealt with living the street life . His flow is often frantic , sometimes to his detriment as it gets him off beat or trying to cram a lot of syllables into one line ( a'la Talib Kweli ) but here it works and it just sounds like Mill is going for broke . The second verse is the brightest spot of the song , which is saying something as they 're all epic : <p> Niggas wan na murder me I 'm ridin ' around heavy I think they wan na wet me like New Orleans and the levees But I got this mac elevy , these niggas 'll never get me Lord knows , I got alotta homies in the dirt Niggas sprayin ' metal tryna take you off the earth Really over nothin ' , tell me what it 's worth Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt I Rose from the jungle like Derrick Death to anybody that oppose my spirit My future lookin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We be runnin ' trains on the hoes y'all cherish Rest in peace to my niggas , I swear I miss them to death My hammer sing murda music , I 'll let you listen to death I 'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest Cause if you throw ' em I throw back like Mitchell &; Ness I 'm gone <p> This is the most focused and sincere that Mill sounds on the album . When people say that Meek Mill can bring real street rap , it 's because of songs like this . <p> 5 . Believe It Featuring Rick Ross ; Produced by Young Shun The Bawse makes his first of three appearances here , and we finally get the Maybach Music drop . Usually when Ross and Mill hook up its gold , but this one sounds so-so . The chemistry just does n't seem to be there on this one . Props to Ross for a hilarious hook ( is there any white celebrity left for him to use as a metaphor for his cocaine ? ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that bad , but after only five tracks in the fact that there 's already filler is disheartening . <p> 6 . Maybach Curtains Featuring Nas , John Legend and Rick Ross ; Produced by DJ Infamous &; The Agency Ross comes back , along with Nas and John Legend for this joint . The automatic response is to compare this to Maybach Music volumes on Ross efforts . DJ Infamous and The Agency give a plush back drop for Legend to beautifully croon about hard work paying off and finally making it . Unfortunately , Mills and Nas both phone it in with their bars . Fortunately , Ross is always at home over these cinematic tracks and he and Legend salvage the track . Good song , but a missed opportunity to create an epic cut . <p> 7 . Amen Featuring Drake ; Produced by Keye Wane and Jahlil Beats We get another bounce back with the first single off the album . Mill sounds best when the tempo is upbeat and he can let loose , and the production does n't let him down . Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun song that is undeniably a hit . <p> 8 . Young Kings Produced by Lee Major Immediately when I heard this song it reminded of something that Kanye was cooking up for State Property back when the Roc was on top . The Philly sound is a nice back drop for Meek to spit to . While the song is technically on point the subject matter is getting really repetitive . Good track , but nothing special , and it fails to continue the momentum of the previous track . <p> 9 . Lay Up Featuring Wale , Rick Ross &; Trey Songz ; Produced by Kane Beats &; Ashanti " The Mad Violinist " Floyd Rozay makes his final appearance on the album , as Wale and Trey Songz are also brought on board . The title is pretty deceptive , and with the Trey Songz feature I expected the song to be far more X-Rated . Instead the song is more about the ability to flaunt and get women rather than bedroom repertoire . Mill 's has the most structured verse , or more precisely , he uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Wale and Ross are scatter brained as they just floss . Trigga delivers a throwaway hook over a beat that sounds very lackluster . This one is mediocre at best . <p> 10 . Tony Story Pt. 2 Produced by Boi-1da Meek Mill returns to what he does best with the follow up to ' Tony Story ' from his 2011 Dreamchasers mixtape . Boi-1da mellows it out a bit for a mid-tempo beat as Mill spazzes out and tells the story of an up and coming young hustler . As stated previously , Meek Mill 's frantic and hyper rhyme style help create the sense of danger and urgency that make these songs sound passionate and authentic . This is the Meek Mill that this album could use a lot more of . <p> 11 . Who You 're Around Featuring Mary J. Blige ; Produced by Tommy " TBHITS " Brown &; Travis Sayles There was once a time that having Mary J. Blige on your track meant an instant classic . Yet , this is n't ' You 're All I Need ' . Something about Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a flat baritone . Meek does his best to make do with what he has as he details the importance of keeping your circle small and being able to discern between friends and enemies . Although the concept is solid , this song is n't as detailed as ' Traumatized ' or ' Tony Story Pt. 2 ' . Still a strong song though but I wish Mill could have saw it through a little better . <p> 12 . Polos &; Shell Tops Produced by Cardiak The Maybach drop returns and thankfully Cardiak brings back the cinematic feel . Again the title had me fooled as I thought Meek might try and do his own version of ' Snapbacks and Tattoos ' . Thankfully that 's not the cause as Mill keeps it gully and details how capitalism will corrupt morality as hustlers will do anything to get fly : <p> I remember nights I used to sell rock , posted on the corner like a mailbox First class ticket to a cell block , just to get some Polo &; some shell tops Cold world and they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choppa when them shells drop Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock Tryna ' get it , Dickie on and my fitted Gun in my draws , ducking the law , I 'm all with it Money , cars and clothes , I wanted em ' all nigga I never was good at hoopin , I wanted to ball nigga Cause the OG 's sold keys and I had no cheese Copper 's lock me , beat me down like I was cochise Old fiends coppin ' work through they 're old dreams They got shattered , it ai n't matter cause we thirst cream Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip Homies murder other homies just to make a brick Most my niggas done got busted tryna ' take a hit The feds were lurking , we was serving , they was taking flicks <p> Pleasant surprise is an understatement for this one . <p> 13 . Rich &; Famous Featuring Louie V ; Produced by Jahlil Beats Meek lets his homie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shine on the hook . He does n't do his boss any favors though as the chorus is horrible . The fact that rappers not named T-Pain are still trying to use autotune is mind boggling and tragic enough . Jahlil Beats returns for the third time on this album , this time alone again , and again he delivers a simpe , cheap sounding beat . Mill tries to talk about finally getting the girl of his dreams , but just sounds crass and obnoxious . The most disappointing thing about this song is that Mill was building some real cohesiveness with the last three songs that showed range and depth . This song derails ALL of that . Complete wackness at its finest . <p> 14 . Real Niggas Come First Produced by Kenoe &; Got Koke We close the album off with Meek Mill going back to the same old same old . Production wise the song is banging as Kenoe and Got Koke give a hard hitting beat for Mill to get on . Yet nothing about this song feels like a close to an album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough talk . Sequencing could have saved this track as it would have been cool if this song could have been put in around track ten . ' Polo and Shell Tops ' would have been a much a better fit here . <p> Bottom Line : This one was really difficult to judge . When Meek Mill hits and crafts detailed street cinema , his is truly in a lane of his owns that even some veterans in the game could n't match right now . His raw and passionate delivery and storytelling breathes life into his narratives and keeps him from sounding like the hundreds of other street rappers . Yet , too often we get redundant and clich tough talk that 's neither convincing nor compelling , let alone entertaining . Production was also an issue , which should never be an issue when you have a guy like Ross helping you pick beats . A lot of times Mill seems comfortable with putting his ego on auto-pilot and using bravado to get him through tracks . It 's a shame that we could n't get the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , the tools are there , and for a rookie debut it 's commendable . Definitely a contender , but it 's gon na take more focus until he can legitimately make a run for the top . <p> Hip-Hop &; Politics junky . He 's probably the only nerd who could out dress your favorite rapper or celebrity . A radical freedom fighter and champion of justice , he 's a life long baby face who may never develop a heel persona . Made MABster . <p> For some reason , I was having a hard time getting through this album . Maybe it 's the timing that this album dropped ; a week after good kid , m.A.A.d city . <p> http : **25;10203;TOOLONG Saule Wright <p> totally agreed <p> http : **29;10230;TOOLONG Nicolas Thomas <p> Good review . Disagree with the score , but it was an interesting read . I 'd give it a 3.5 because there were way more good songs than bad songs . The only thing I have against this album is that the production was very inconsistent . <p> ZMoney <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I prefer this over Good Kid , Maad City . I think it has a better replay value and its standout tracks are better than Kendrick 's standouts . <p> Dude this album is trash it had only about two or three songs that was good . The bonus tracks are horrible too . I liked Meek Mills but this is a disappointing effort from him and now he do n't want to battle Cassidy now because Cassidy do n't have buzz anymore .. Smh <p> P From Da D <p> I agree with this statement ..... people are overhyping GKMC . I enjoyed this album more <p> P From Da D <p> I think what yall are doing is comparing GKMC to other albums thats out . And since its different and so " real hip hop ish " than its automatically amazing when put up against the 2 Chainz and Chief Keef 's and such but the truth is that album wasnt that amazing . You got ta review it for what it is . The production wasnt what if could have been . The songs were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial to me . I said several times The Game 's first 3 albums were all A LOT better than GKMC ...... and I mean A LOT ! Meek 's albums serves his purpose.Its pretty good man yall being closed minded . Going " its typical ..... its garbage.blah blah blah " this is the SAME type of shit yall get from people like Jay-Z who you love so much . FOH <p> Concept does n't improve quality , but where you state " songs were not that mind blowingly lyrical . And the album just wasnt substantial " you clearly missed the concept/story . <p> http : //twitter.com/GQBlu Da PocketSquare Kang <p> If you check the Second Opinion column we put up you 'll see that I was one of the ones who said that GKMC was n't a classic , so it definitely was n't the standard I used when judging this album . I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this CD . There are more talented artists ( whose voices are nowhere near as grating ) doing street rap better that Meek Mill . Save for a few good @ @ @ @ @

Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) warned on Sunday that " potential 9/11 " scenarios are " happening all the time " and that Eric Holder 's investigation of rough CIA interrogations could have a chilling effect . <p> Appearing on CNN 's " State of the Union , " Hatch said the investigation was in part political and that " they 're making it so the people at the CIA are afraid to do anything . " <p> " So we come onto a potential 9/11 , and they 're happening all the time -- that all I can say about it , " he said , adding that America needs the best people working on those without the chilling effect of later investigations . <p> He singled out White House counsel office as a group that deserved protection : " especially those who give legal opinions . " <p> " Legal opinions differ ... you want to always test them , you want to always check , but you also do n't want to say these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're conservative or just because they 're liberals , " Hatch said . <p> Holder 's investigation , however , is aimed not at the White House lawyers under President George W. Bush who wrote effectively legalizing techniques many say amount to " torture , " but at interrogators who went to still more aggressive techniques not authorized by the memos . There have been outside calls for the lawyers who wrote the memos to be disbarred , or even prosecuted . <p> Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D-Wash. ) , appearing with Hatch , responded that the investigation is warranted because " no one is above the law , " and stressed that the investigation is " a legal process , " not a political one , and that terror investigations needed to be handled within the framework of the legal system . <p> " This is not about being timid , " she said , " this is about being effective .

But doing evil makes the doer evil and no rationalizations truly justify such actions , and no ? pure ? and ? noble ? causes stay pure or noble when persons violate the law and thus betray the moral good the law was created to protect . History is replete with brutal thugs and bloody tyrants who thought they and their causes were good , even noble . America is heading toward government by thugs and tyrants and will only be saved by a government or people holding leaders and their minions accountable to the law for their crimes against humanity . No more pardons , but punishment fitting their crimes is what will save democracy and its best values . <p> Roameo , thank you . The whole cravenly cowardly idea of torture to protect us is sickening . Anyone can measure their own decency , morality , and courage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The sickest is the , " Torture kept us safe " arguement . Do we guage decency and morality by what " works " ? I guess a regime of chickenhawks would be expected to act cowardly , but the number of people willing to give up decency and morality to follow and justify their actions is sad and not what we all were raised to expect of Americans . I used to argue that WWII Germans were no different from us . I always said instead of a man on a white horse ( FDR ) they got a man on black ( Hitler ) and obscene immoral justification of inhumanity followed . The Japanese torture I ( racism follows ) blamed on a sick culture . Turns out all it takes is fearmongering to appeal to the cowards in any nation . It will be years , if ever , before decent men look at America as before . We must start by returning to being a nation of laws , where the of political losses by both parties ( what is really involved here in the Dem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law 's judgement showing the public the depravity ) are immaterial to the law ( as the founding fathers meant it ) . <p> Mostly I agree with Obama , there is little to gain looking back . But the matter of exceeding what was authorized is difficult for the AG to overlook . Tells me the AG is not politicised now as it was under the previous Administration . <p> Well , if you have money or status you can break any law as has been proven with the Kennedy clan . obama 's admin. skirts the law , they just are eager to point fingers . Panetta needs to leave and tell them off good ! He needs to realize he is being made a fool of ! This administration is barely legal and very Socialistic . The Dems wo n't get back in for ions ! ! <p> This whole farce is such a load of crap . One administration ( democrat ) not only blaming the previous one ( republican ) but basically taking them to court . Talk about suit happy , this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just wait till 0bamas turn comes what will they take him to court for and so on and so on . This is such a waste of tax payer money so what . 0bama and the democrats can get all fuzzy inside . What do they actually think will come of this BS investigation . <p> So . . . if the next Repub administration wants to revisit the decision by this administrations justice department into why two Black Panthers could " scare " off voters , it 's okay to make Obama and Holder accountable for the derelection of the present finding ? <p> Tom A , you would n't know a decent man if you met one . No mention in your piece about the 9/11 victims , so I 'm sure you do n't remember the not so decent people who tortured ( 51 days of sleep deprivation ) and killed 32 children in Texas . This is all about you , and even your self-righteousness is phony . <p> Tom A , you would n't know a decent man if you met one . No mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you do n't remember the not so decent people who tortured ( 51 days of sleep deprivation ) and killed 32 children in Texas . This is all about you , and even your self-righteousness is phony . <p> Right wingers -- If Obama is politicizing the DOJ ... what would be his motivation . Just HOW does investigating the CIA HELP him politically , HOW ? ? ? It does n't and he would rather not do it . The DOJ is supposed to act independently of the Whitehouse , but the GOP does n't seem the believe that given the Gonzalez DOJ which was a political hit squad ( against actual Dems not gov agencies . ) <p> Effective interrogation is NOT timid . Author verifies motive behind " harsh " interrogation : effectiveness . You , yes you , the public , wants/needs people to do this difficult work . The people doing it do not " like " it , " enjoy " it . It is their JOB . You need people like cheney , if we had had more like him during clintoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like draining the puss from IV drug users hearts , but I do it well . <p> Well if Cheney did n't have anything to hide , as far as being involved in the ordering of torture , he would n't be so all fired upset that there will be one . I think he " dost protest too much " .... that saying just keeps popping up where Cheney is concerned . <p> It was a disgrace both for orin Hatch as well as John King , to use a show wthat was supposedly was to be mainly a tribute to our lately departed and fondly though of Senator Teddy , and use it as a forum to tell lies about how most people are against the government asisting with health care , and the icing on the cake , is how Orin also managed to get in a word for the torture gang . This should indicate to all citizens and especially those in his state , who have listened to this man 's corporate supported lies , to think again how concerned he is with people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and CNN . This was a low day in CNN propagandist GOP ? corporate spin . <p> no czar@ I suppose you think bush was abrillian leader and made wise use of defense money .

##3262150 <p> Buxton made the trip over the pond to the Colonies to catch the IZOD IndyCar GoPro Grand Prix at Sonoma this past weekend . He was n't here to cover the race , just attend it as a fan - albeit a fan with a bit more celebrity status than most of the rest of us enjoy . <p> His next racing stop is going to be at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium , home of one of this planet 's most incredible racing tracks , where the stars and cars of the Formula 1 World Championship will be taking to the asphalt in anger . <p> But if you believe his blog , that incredible combination of high-tech , high speed , and high society is actually going to suffer a bit by comparison . To IndyCar . And no , that 's not a misprint . <p> The same IZOD IndyCar Series that ca n't even draw the equivalent of a small town to one of its race broadcasts on NBC Sports Network just flabbergasted a guy who works in a sport whose TV viewership could probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit hard to wrap your mind around it , is n't it ? <p> But to me it 's not very surprising when you think about it in context . Remember , Will Buxton is coming at IndyCar from a very different viewpoint than your average run-of-the-mill American sports fan . <p> There is a lot - a whole lot - you can say about IndyCar if you want to point out why it is an afterthought in the United States . Better writers than me have written lengthy epistles about why the Indianapolis 500 is no longer - and may never be again - the acknowledged greatest auto race in the world to anyone outside of Indiana or the inexorably aging fanbase who lived at a time when it was . <p> All of that , however , exists in a separate context from Will Buxton and , in fact , a great many " petrolheads " who have been exposed to other big-time racing series . <p> For people used to the world of Formula 1 ( and , it can be argued with increasing frequency , NASCAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IndyCar is a sport trying to get back into the limelight , and the difference between that paradigm and the one employed by F1 and NASCAR is significant . <p> IndyCar is accessible in ways that F1 never will be . Formula 1 has been for decades and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a self-appraised " sport of kings . " It is consumed by megawattage , the accrued power of celebrity , wealth , and royalty of all types . Like a supercar or a crown jewel , it is to be seen and experienced from a distance unless you have a sufficient level of privilege . <p> IndyCar was like that once . Perhaps not to the same Saville Row extent , but it had a high enough opinion of itself that it could afford to be , and often was , haughty to the hoi polloi . The " people 's motorsport " back then was NASCAR - the John C. Reilly to IndyCar 's Paris Hilton . <p> No longer . Now IndyCar is in a position where it has to persuade people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans . Because there are no paddock-choking crowds of fans like the ones in NASCAR , the odds of fans actually interacting personally with the series ' stars are far better . Outside of Indianapolis , there are none of the waiting lists for credentials on the same level of F1 or NASCAR - which means that the series ' media people can deliver more personalized accommodation to interested journalists . <p> If we 're being honest , IndyCar races other than the Indy 500 are not " bucket-list " events , so IndyCar has to find ways to add value to them to ensure that the fans get their money 's worth . A ride-along with one of the greatest race car drivers who ever lived ? Sure ! Free autographs from almost every driver in the series at the track ? Yep ... step right up ! <p> You see , humility forced upon IndyCar by its tumble from grace in the 1990s has wrought a great many changes in how it appeals to people who bother to experience it . It is , in fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity over the past twenty years . As NASCAR signed huge TV deals , packed in throngs of fans and pop culture hangers-on , it lost a great deal of that backwoods sittin ' -on-a-cooler racer-next-door bonhomie which made it so ingratiating and appealing to blue-collar America . IndyCar , by virtue of losing the trappings of success , has rediscovered it . <p> In a sense , IndyCar has become a better motorsport series thanks to its ongoing struggles . Better , at least , for the fans - they 're still working on the product and its management , as anyone who reads the headlines knows well . Right now , though , IndyCar may be one of the best investments of fan dollars in all of racing . <p> Whether that remains true if and when the series regains the prominence it so covets is open to speculation ... but

Photo : Stephanie Keith / AP <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Twitter on Friday agreed to hand over about three months ' worth of tweets to a judge overseeing the criminal trial of an Occupy Wall Street protester , a case that has become a closely watched fight over how much access law enforcement agencies should have to material posted on social networks . <p> The social networking site had been threatened with steep fines if it did not comply with Judge Matthew Sciarrino Jr . ' s order to turn over the records in the case of Malcolm Harris . <p> But the judge said he would keep the records sealed until after a Sept. 21 hearing challenging his ruling on the messages . <p> Twitter 's lawyer , Terryl Brown , called the options it faced -- waiving its right to appeal or being in held in contempt of court -- " unfair " and " unjust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of Harris ' information . <p> " We are disappointed that Twitter is essentially giving up the fight , " Harris ' attorney Martin Stolar said after the court hearing . <p> The Manhattan district attorney 's office said Harris ' messages could show whether he was aware of the police orders he 's charged with disregarding during a protest at the Brooklyn Bridge . <p> The case began as one of hundreds of disorderly conduct prosecutions after an Oct. 1 march in New York that brought the Occupy protest movement its first burst of worldwide attention . Harris was among more than 700 people arrested when protesters tried to cross the bridge , many on the roadway . <p> Police said demonstrators ignored warnings to stay on a pedestrian path . Harris , an editor for an online culture magazine , and others say they thought they had police permission to go on the roadway . <p> Prosecutors want tweets and user information from Sept. 15 to Dec. 31 that were taken down from the public site . After a certain period of time , tweets are automatically flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored electronic records , Stolar said . <p> Internet privacy and civil liberties groups have said the case is important because individuals must be able to fight for their constitutional rights , but they also wanted to see how the large and influential company handled the request . <p> " I think the biggest implication is going to be about how companies are going to react to what happened to Twitter here , " said Hanni Fakhoury , a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier foundation . " One of the things we were happy to see is that Twitter actually took a stand and tried to challenge this -- most companies would n't go that far . " <p> Still , it 's a hard argument to make -- because Twitter by nature is so public , said Joel Reidenberg , a Fordham Law Professor and expert on internet privacy issues . <p> " The tweets themselves are public information , it 's like speaking on a street corner , " he said . " His claim to privacy on the tweets is pretty weak , frankly . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete any incriminating tweets . He told reporters he was n't sure what the tweets might contain . " Three and a half months , a lot of nonsense , " he said . <p> Asked whether the case had affected what he posted to Twitter , Harris said : " I guess you 'd have to check the feed to find out . It 's still public . " <p> Earlier this year , Harris sought to block prosecutors from subpoenaing the information from Twitter Inc . The company stepped in after the judge ordered the messages to be turned over . <p> Harris had argued that seeking the accompanying user information violated his privacy and free association rights . The data could give prosecutors a picture of his followers , their interactions and his location at various points during the protest , Stolar said . <p> Twitter had said the case could put it in the unwanted position of having to take on legal fights that users could otherwise conduct on their own . Company lawyers argued that Harris had every right to fight the subpoena . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands for their records . The company argued in a court filing that it would be " a new and overwhelming burden " for Twitter to have to champion such causes for them . <p> Sciarrino said he would review all the material he ordered turned over and would provide " relevant portions " to prosecutors . <p> Harris has pleaded not guilty and his trial is scheduled for December . If convicted , he faces a maximum penalty of 15 days in jail or a $500 fine , his lawyer said . <p> " So Twitter handed over a pile of my tweets that 'll stay sealed pending a hearing on the 21st . 
##3268451 <p> ( Administrative note : I 'm no longer at Tenable ! I left on good terms , and now I 'm a consultant at Leviathan Security Group . Feel free to contact me if you need more information ! ) <p> Awhile back , my friend @mogigoma and I were doing a capture-the-flag contest at https : //stripe-ctf.com . One of the levels of the contest required us to perform a hash length extension attack . I had never even heard of the attack at the time , and after some reading I realized that not only is it a super cool ( and conceptually easy ! ) attack to perform , there is also a total lack of good tools for performing said attack ! After hours of adding the wrong number of null bytes or incorrectly adding length values , I vowed to write a tool to make this easy for myself and anybody else who 's trying to do it . So , after a couple weeks of work , here it is ! <p> Now I 'm gon na release the tool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does the same thing ! It 's called hashextender , and implements a length extension attack against every algorithm I could think of : <p> MD4 <p> MD5 <p> RIPEMD-160 <p> SHA-0 <p> SHA-1 <p> SHA-256 <p> SHA-512 <p> WHIRLPOOL <p> I 'm more than happy to extend this to cover other hashing algorithms as well , provided they are " vulnerable " to this attack -- MD2 , SHA-224 , and SHA-384 are not . Please contact me if you have other candidates and I 'll add them ASAP ! <h> The attack <p> An application is susceptible to a hash length extension attack if it prepends a secret value to a string , hashes it with a vulnerable algorithm , and entrusts the attacker with both the string and the hash , but not the secret . Then , the server relies on the secret to decide whether or not the data returned later is the same as the original data . <p> It turns out , even though the attacker does n't know the value of the prepended secret , he can still generate a valid hash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up where the hashing algorithm left off ; it turns out , 100% of the state needed to continue a hash is in the output of most hashing algorithms ! We simply load that state into the appropriate hash structure and continue hashing . <p> TL ; DR : given a hash that is composed of a string with an unknown prefix , an attacker can append to the string and produce a new hash that still has the unknown prefix . <h> Example <p> The server sends data and signature to the attacker . The attacker guesses that H is MD5 simply by its length ( it 's the most common 128-bit hashing algorithm ) , based on the source , or the application 's specs , or any way they are able to . <p> Knowing only data , H , and signature , the attacker 's goal is to append append to data and generate a valid signature for the new data . And that 's easy to do ! Let 's see how . <h> Padding <p> Before we look at the actual attack , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating H ( secret + data ) , the string ( secret + data ) is padded with a ' 1 ' bit and some number of ' 0 ' bits , followed by the length of the string . That is , in hex , the padding is a 0x80 byte followed by some number of 0x00 bytes and then the length . The number of 0x00 bytes , the number of bytes reserved for the length , and the way the length is encoded , depends on the particular algorithm and blocksize . <p> With most algorithms ( including MD4 , MD5 , RIPEMD-160 , SHA-0 , SHA-1 , and SHA-256 ) , the string is padded until its length is congruent to 56 bytes ( mod 64 ) . Or , to put it another way , it 's padded until the length is 8 bytes less than a full ( 64-byte ) block ( the 8 bytes being size of the encoded length field ) . There are two hashes implemented in hashextender that do n't use these values : SHA-512 uses a 128-byte blocksize and reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 64-byte blocksize and reserves 32 bytes for the length field . <p> The endianness of the length field is also important . MD4 , MD5 , and RIPEMD-160 are little-endian , whereas the SHA family and WHIRLPOOL are big-endian . Trust me , that distinction cost me days of work ! <p> Do n't be fooled by this being exactly 64 bytes ( the blocksize ) -- that 's only happening because secret and append are the same length . Perhaps I should n't have chosen that as an example , but I 'm not gon na start over ! <p> All right , so the server is going to be checking the data we send against the signature **32;8378;TOOLONG . Now , as the attacker , we need to figure out how to generate that signature ! <h> Client 's calculation <p> So , how do we calculate the hash of the data shown above without actually having access to secret ? <p> Well , first , we need to look at what we have to work with : data , append , H , and H ( secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , H ? , which uses the same hashing algorithm as H , but whose starting state is the final state of H ( secret data ) , i.e. , signature . Once we have that , we simply calculate H ? ( append ) and the output of that function is our hash . It sounds easy ( and is ! ) ; have a look at this code : <p> So we know the signature is right . The difference is , we did n't use secret at all ! What 's happening ! ? <p> Well , we create a MD5CTX structure from scratch , just like normal . Then we take the MD5 of 64 ' A 's . We take the MD5 of a full ( 64-byte ) block of ' A 's to ensure that any internal values -- other than the state of the hash itself -- are set to what we expect . <p> Then , after that is done , we replace c.A , c.B , c.C , and c.D with the values that were found in signature : **32;8412;TOOLONG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it finished in originally , and means that anything else we hash -- in this case append -- will produce the same output as it would have had we hashed it the usual way . <p> We use htonl() on the values before setting the state variables because MD5 -- being little-endian -- outputs its values in little-endian as well . <p> And we can generate the signature without ever knowing what the secret was ! So , we send the string to the server along with our new signature . The server will prepend the signature , hash it , and come up with the exact same hash we did ( victory ! ) . <h> The tool <p> This example took me hours to write . Why ? Because I made about a thousand mistakes writing the code . Too many NUL bytes , not enough NUL bytes , wrong endianness , wrong algorithm , used bytes instead of bits for the length , and all sorts of other stupid problems . The first time I worked on this type of attack , I spent from 2300h till 0700h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out till after sleeping ( and with Mak 's help ) . And do n't even get me started on how long it took to port this attack to MD5 . Endianness can die in a fire . <p> Why is it so difficult ? Because this is crypto , and crypto is immensely complicated and notoriously difficult to troubleshoot . There are lots of moving parts , lots of side cases to remember , and it 's never clear why something is wrong , just that the result is n't right . What a pain ! <p> So , I wrote hashextender. hashextender is ( I hope ) the first free tool that implements this type of attack . It 's easy to use and implements this attack for every algorithm I could think of . <p> There are plenty of options for how you format inputs and outputs , including HTML ( where you use %NN notation ) , CString ( where you use xNN notation , as well as r , n , t , etc. ) , hex ( such as how the hashes were specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to

" <p> The oddity drew plenty of opposition as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only every legislative Democrat but but also nine GOP House members and three Republican senators opposing the payment . <p> " I have to point out , we 're paying $100,000 for the Republican Party to sue the Republican Legislature , defended by the Republican secretary of state , in order to close primaries in Idaho -- I just think this is so bad it 's comical , " said Sen. Elliot Werk , D-Boise . <p> Sen. Shawn Keough , R-Sandpoint , who voted against the bill , said , " They were n't forced to submit that bill ... and I found it insulting that they did that . I do n't believe it 's appropriate that the taxpayers pay that money . " <p> Keough noted that when the party held its convention in Sandpoint in 2008 , a majority of the attendees voted against closing the GOP primary . But then the party 's central committee moved forward anyway , and sued the state ; party rules now require the GOP primary in Idaho to be closed to anyone other than registered party members . <p> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a re-do of the state 's entire primary election system ; GOP-backed legislation now awaiting the governor 's signature would force all Idahoans to publicly declare their party preference for the first time . <p> Keough said , " I remain disturbed that even while in essence shutting out the public , they asked the public to pay for it . " <p> The Idaho GOP 's lawyer , Christ Troupis of Eagle , who did n't return a call for comment Thursday , filed an affidavit with the federal court stating that he 's represented the party on a " contingent fee " basis in the case since 2008 . " My fee agreement with the Idaho Republican Party and Chairman Norm Semanko was for a contingent fee , comprised of whatever sum was awarded by this Court in the event that the Plaintiffs were successful in prosecuting their claims in this action , " he wrote . <p> In the affidavit , he said his total fees and costs came to $143,880 . The state negotiated and got that lowered to $100,000 in a settlement , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . On Tuesday , after the $100,000 payment bill already had passed the Senate , U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill issued an order granting the stipulation . <p> " The losing side could really be rational and say ... negotiate these fees and get ' em paid , we do n't want to go to court -- the judge could hit us even worse , " he said . " And while we fight , the meter 's running . " <p> Finer called the settlement over the amount " impressive , " saying , " Getting almost a third of it knocked off ai n't bad , " and said the fees are n't extraordinarily high for the type of litigation involved . <p> Contingent fee arrangements , however , are rare in civil rights cases like this one , which challenged a state law , rather than seeking money damages . They 're more typical in cases in which someone is suing for cash damages -- the lawyer takes a gamble that he 'll win the case , and get paid only a percentage of those winnings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the arrangement " unusual in that type of case . " <p> He said , " In terms of whether they 're entitled to it , the statute says that they are . " But , he said , they " did n't have to ask for it . " <p> House Minority Leader John Rusche , D-Lewiston , said , " As a citizen I just am really upset by this -- paying the Republican Party to sue the state of Idaho to make it more difficult for citizens to vote in the primary . Just listen to what we 're doing . ... The plaintiffs did not have to request money from the state coffers , the Republican Party chose to . ... I think that 's just unconscionable . " <p> Well said , Phil . I hope all those that voted these idiots into office are happy now . They made their beds , now sleep in it . The idiots in Boise do n't care about anyone , never have . Otter is too busy riding his horses and having his hair done to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does anyone remember what most of these idiots ran on .... LESS GOVERNMENT . Now they are the ones pushing more state government on the people . HYPOCRITES ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> All of the above describe the same thing . I feel sorry for any true American patriot that falls victim to the same scheme that the GOP has been running for years . If you have n't figured them out by now , your a lost cause . Good luck Idaho . You ca n't fix stupid , and by the looks

##3269952 <p> No , no , it 's ash ... but unlike the first movie , the earie white flakes go unexplained and are relegated to being an uninteresting weather phenomenon in this new , duller world of Silent Hill . <p> Which is n't to say there is n't any action . There 's plenty , but its meaningless and repetitive . Suspense quickly gives way to a glazed over feeling of indifference , a bubble burst by only momentary spurts of giggling disbelief or confusion . The filmmakers have somehow forgotten or ignored the most important part of Silent Hill ... namely , SILENCE . Silence interrupted by occasional fits of mass panic and hysteria , a warning siren , a terrifying dream , an imposing darkness ... <p> It just does n't work when it 's the other way around . This movie opens with a non-sensical terror sequence n Silent Hill itself , a sign of what 's to come . After that , the movie slips in and out of creepy and rediculous for a little while , and those moments are the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into constant question , there 's still something to fear . After all , what 's more terrifying than loosing your mind ? But that is all so quickly dismissed in favor of , " Would n't it be cool if this happened ? " or , " And then the monster does this ! " <p> Why ? <p> Why do the nurses attack you when you move your finger but if you have a full conversation in the same room they ca n't hear you ? <p> " They just ca n't . Do n't ask so many questions . Are n't they hot , though ? Aside from the ... you know ... no face thing ? " <p> The acting and dialogue of this film feels like cutaways during video games from the early 2000 's , but I 'm not going to get on it for that . That 's the genre . You know the feeling : Two actors who clearly where never in the same room together splurt out exposition for some 15 second scene . The scene plays between levels on your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't let you skip to the part where you get to take over the controls and kill some monsters or bad guys or whatever . It 's like that here , except that you never get a chance to take over the controls . You 're forced to sit there and wait for it all to end . <p> The actors should be cut some slack though . The script feels like a Wikipedia article written by a cult fan of the game , and if you look up the plot of the games online you 'll know that 's not a compliment . Still , the attention to shoving in some plot points from the original material is what makes it so shocking that they flat out ignored so much of the tone and intention of the franchise . <p> I took a life long Silent Hill player , and a huge fan of the game folklore , with me to the film . He was so deeply disappointed afterward , and among his many critiques , what bothered him the most was , " Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and do their own thing ? Why just waiver in-between ? " It 's ironic , because that purgatorial , between worlds feeling was so much of what made the first Silent Hill so fun to watch . It 's gone now , replaced by cliche 's ... in 3D ! <p> No sense crying over spilt milk though . There is a wax museum in Lake George , way- up-state NY , called " The House of Frankenstein . " You walk through , and see a bunch of stilted scenes of horror , cut with some cool audio and lighting . You 're free to linger and let your thoughts run , making the whole thing kind of a fun , chilled experience . Silent Hill 3D can sort of be like that , if you have the right attitude . If you 're looking for some disturbing imagery loosely stitched together , something that allows you to fill in your own story , then it could work . You could do worse for a Halloween thrill . <p> In fact , if the movie was actually silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , but your imagination might actually run free instead of being bludgeoned to death . <p> So , if you 're looking for some ghoulish imagery with very low expectations , and the every growing cost of going to a movie means nothing to you , and a good wax museum or haunted house is n't available , then ok , " come 
##3271750 <h> More from Maryland 's Heartbreaking Loss to N.C. State <p> Ugh . That was a tough loss . Quite an emotional roller coaster . From thinking Maryland was going to win , to thinking they were going to lose , to thinking they were going to win again , then a cling off the left upright giving everyone a gut punch with two seconds left . Ben B. : I just got reminded of something someone said on Twitter : it 's like having your heart ripped out , put back in , then ripped out again . <p> First and foremost , the most important and unfortunate news from this game was the injury to freshman quarterback Perry Hills . When Hills went down , injured while trying to make a tackle after throwing a pick , I noticed the training staff working on his knee . After he was carted off , he could n't put any pressure on his left leg as he walked into the locker room . After the game , Edsall confirmed it was indeed a knee injury and it unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will wait to see what the MRI tells about it , but it does n't look good , " Edsall said . <p> Following the game , I saw offensive coordinator Mike Locksley talking to Hills , who was on crutches , telling him that he could and will recover from his injury . That makes me speculate that his injury is not good and could be something as severe as an ACL or MCL tear . We 'll probably hear for sure soon , but that 's just my guess . <p> After Hills went down , sophomore Devin Burns came into the game and really ignited Maryland 's offense , specifically the running game . In the first half , Maryland finished with a net 41 rushing yards . In the second half , they had 165 , finishing the game with a total of 206 rushing yards . Maryland 's offense might have been as efficient as I 've seen all season with Burns running the show . <p> Burns also did n't miss a beat when he stepped in , especially to start the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locksley , who did a great job preparing Burns ( and Rowe ) for this very situation . <p> " I thought that Devin Burns came in and played well as a backup " Edsall said . " Caleb Rowe also came in and executed the two-minute drill with perfection . That is something that we have been working on and planned on bring in Devin if something happened to Perry and use Caleb in the two-minute offense . We got the ball down there , but unfortunately Brad Craddock did n't make it and we came up two points short . " <p> The play of both Devin Burns and freshman Caleb Rowe , who burned his redshirt when he came in for the final drive , was impressive and bring thrown into the fire did n't seem to phase either player . <p> " Like Coach Edsall said , always be prepared . That 's what I practice all week . I just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity I was given , " Burns said . When asked about maintaining his poise , Burns responded with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm I laid back guy . I do n't say too much . I 'm pretty much cool , calm and collected . " <p> Edsall mentioned that , if the team found themselves in a situation where Hills was hurt and they in a two minute drill , Rowe was going in to run the offense . So when he got the call after N.C. State took the lead with just under 30 seconds remaining , Rowe was not surprised when he was put into the game . <p> " I was n't surprised , coach always preaches to be prepared for whenever your number is called , " Rowe said . " I work hard in practice and today I was ready to play . They were telling me through my headset to get ready to play . " <p> The final quotes I want to get to involve Craddock and I want to bring up some of the reactions that happened during the game thread comments . I understand the emotion , frustration and disappointment that resulted in him missing that kick . But this game is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that game that you ca n't point to as the reason Maryland lost . The kid is a freshman , was supposed to be the back up , and is only 19 . The entire team is behind him and we , as a fan base , should be too . I 'm not saying you ca n't be frustrated or disappointed , but some stuff that 's been said veers over the line . By the way , Craddock met with the media after the game and answered some tough questions . <p> " I just tried to look at my spot and kick the ball . I was just thinking to myself take your time because it 's just like any other kick , " Craddock said . " I actually thought I hit it pretty well . My teammates were really supportive because there were so many other opportunities during the game to earn those points . They kept telling me that it was n't my fault , they are always supportive . " <p> All of the players were obviously disappointed with the outcome , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craddock . <p> " Things happen , ca n't do much more than cheer on your teammates and keep your head up , " freshman wide receiver Stefon Diggs said . <p> So as I said , obviously a lot of emotions fly during a game , but try to keep things in perspective . <p> I think Maryland can and will rebound from this loss against Boston College . And while that loss hurts , they 're still in decent position to become bowl eligible , which is something

Around 22 percent of dog owners and 15 percent of cat owners " characterized their pet as normal weight when it was actually overweight or obese .

##3273452 <p> Women check their appearance in the mirror an average of eight times a day , according to a new survey that is apparently meant to be shocking . And it 's not just traditional mirrors : We use other people 's glasses , shop windows , the side mirrors on cars , and smart-phone screens to get the job done . Our confidence varies by mirror , too : 5% of women said they look their worst in the bathroom at work . Is all this mirror-glancing a sign of runaway vanity , or just confirmation that appearance matters , especially during the workday ? <p> The Daily Mail , in typically caveman mode , asks whether this means women are " vain or just paranoid ?

Over the course of a typical day , let 's say you look in the mirror in the morning as you put on makeup ( 1 ) , and maybe again in the car on the way to work , just to make sure your blush does n't look weird in natural sunlight ( 2 ) .

##3276950 <h> Pig tattoo lands reputed gang member in Hennepin County jail <p> Antonio " Savage " Jenkins Jr . was proud enough of the new tattoo on his left bicep to stick a photo of it on Facebook . <p> " My tattoo iz a pig get'n his brains blew out , " read the caption . <p> The tattoo depicts a person holding a pistol to the mouth of a pig dressed in a Minneapolis police uniform with the badge of officer Jeffrey Seidel . <p> Hennepin County prosecutors say Jenkins ' tattoo crossed the line from body art to crime . On Thursday , Nov. 8 , the reputed member of the Bloods street gang -- currently on probation for armed robbery -- was charged with making a terroristic threat for the benefit of a gang . <p> Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said the threat was specific and that Jenkins had the capacity to act on it . <p> " The whole series of things made it enough to press the charge , " Freeman said . " It 's pretty crude and pretty direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) sent it out on Facebook . That 's a lot . " <p> The arrest comes less than a week after Minneapolis and St. Paul police were reported as being on heightened alert after learning that Gangster Disciples street gang members were threatening to kill an officer . <p> The threats are allegedly in retaliation for the Oct. 23 death of a reputed gang member who was shot by St. Paul police during a drug investigation . <p> Jenkins , 20 , was in the Hennepin County jail with bail set at $60,000 . His first appearance before a judge was expected Friday afternoon . <p> The man allegedly had a friend give him the <p> Advertisement <p> tattoo Oct. 30 in his St. Louis Park home . The charge alleges Jenkins " did threaten to commit a crime of violence with the purpose of terrorizing another , and/or in reckless disregard of the risk of causing terror in another . " <p> But when does body art become an illegal act ? <p> Dale Carpenter , who teaches constitutional law and the First Amendment at the University of Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events is correct , " then this is not protected speech .

" <p> " The tattoo depicts a person holding a semiautomatic handgun with the barrel of the gun partially in the mouth of a pig , " said the criminal complaint . " The pig is wearing a police hat and uniform with a patch on the right shoulder with ' Mpls. 8230 ' and a nameplate with the name ' J. Seidel ' under the patch . Below the ' J.

" Additionally , Officer Seidel 's family is in fear as a result of the posting . " <p> Police stopped Jenkins on Monday and saw the tattoo . He reportedly told them he got it because he was angry at Seidel for something that occurred in August 2011 . <p> The complaint does n't describe the incident but says none of the reports from the occurrence was issued by Seidel . <p> The complaint said " the Bloods street gang has an extensive network of members ... who are known to employ violence on behalf of their fellow members .

It identifies a specific police officer by name and badge number , and expresses a clear threat to him -- ' I 'm going to kill you ' -- and then he publicizes it , " Freeman said . " He 's a known Blood , and the officer works in the area . The whole series of things made it enough to press the charge . " <p> He said another consideration was that Jenkins had the ability to carry out the threat . <p> Carpenter said that once the alleged threat became specific and public , it became hard to defend from a First Amendment standpoint . <p> " When you go to threaten a specific person , then you can be punished . This would have to be interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " he said . <p> " If he 'd had it on a hidden part of his body and never showed it to anybody , that would be an interesting case . But if he posted it on Facebook , and a lot of people saw it , and it was visible , I think he communicated a threat . <p> " He can say , ' I hate the police ' or he can say , ' that police officer is corrupt ' or he can criticize him , " Carpenter said , " but he does cross the line when he makes a threat . " <p> At the time of his arrest , Jenkins was on supervised release from prison , where he 'd been serving a sentence for a November 2009 conviction for first-degree aggravated robbery in Anoka County . <p> The robbery occurred in February 2008 , when Jenkins was 17 .

He was sent to the Anoka County jail for 30 days and then released .

More &gt;&gt; <p> No matter the play or formation , Jason Campbell looked left after almost every snap . His eyes opened wide , and his head turned fast - rarely ever for a receiver . More &gt;&gt; <p> By TIM DAHLBERG AP Sports Columnist <p> Roger Goodell 's timing seemed odd , with his Harvard School of Public Health speech on player safety coming after a week in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concussions . <p> No matter , because the NFL commissioner is nothing if not a spin doctor extraordinaire . He cited the fact the quarterbacks were all removed from games as evidence of the progress the NFL has made in identifying head injuries and trying to limit their impact . <p> " The simple truth is that any physical activity comes with risk and reward , " Goodell said . " Head injuries occur in sports . " <p> They do , though the NFL sure took a long time to admit it . For years the league insisted there was no link between what happened on Sundays on the field and what happened to the brains of players afterward . <p> The culture has changed , and Goodell wastes no chance to remind us of that . His speech Thursday night touched on everything from player safety in the days before the NFL even existed ( 18 college players died in 1904 alone ) to what the league might be doing in the near future ( different helmets for each position , weight limits on kickoff teams ) to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund studies on concussions , giving $30 million to the National Institutes of Health and teaming with players for another $100 million in similar research over the next decade . There are 100 former NFL players taking part in research led by Boston University to find a diagnosis for the degenerative brain disease , chronic traumatic encephalopathy , more commonly known as CTE . <p> New kickoff rules are working to reduce concussions , and others are under consideration . Violent collisions will always be the attraction of the game just as knockouts are in boxing , but it 's Goodell 's contention that big hits can be managed more safely without changing the game so much that fans wo n't watch . <p> Meanwhile , not a game goes by without someone in the announcer 's booth talking about the dangers of helmet-to-helmet hits . <p> " Players and coaches have adjusted . They always do , " Goodell said . " We now see fewer dangerous hits to the head and noticeable changes in the way the game is being played . " <p> The good news for today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'll have a better chance of having a decent life after football than players did before them . That 's especially true when it comes to the condition of their brains , though the risk of long term injury remains very real . <p> Football is still a hurt business , and always will be . Nothing will make it completely safe , especially in an era when players seem to get bigger and faster every year . <p> But there might come a day when there 's enough research and information available so a parent can make a decision on whether their child plays football or not . There might be a time when players themselves can assess their future health risks and decide whether to continue their careers . <p> That will be good for the game itself , and certainly good for the NFL , which rode the wave of big hits to become by far the most popular sport in the country .

##3280752 <h> A Major Coaching Shake-up on the Palouse <p> Written by Longball on Tuesday , 23 October 2012 20:07 . <p> The Vandal Atheltic Department <p> Sometimes you think things are tough around your house , then you look outside and your neighbor 's house is on fire . No matter how you feel about the problems facing Cougar football , they are like a couple burnt out lightbulbs compared to the structure fire down the road in Moscow . As you have probably heard by now , the Idaho Vandals have given Robb Akey his walking papers and have promoted Jason Gesser to interim head coach while they conduct their search for Akey 's successor . All this is happening as the Vandals prepare for their first season as a football independent in 2013 , a status they hope to only maintain for a couple years as they search the ever changing conference landscape for a new home . Constantly looming over all of this is the very real possibility that the only viable option is for the Vandals to return to the ranks of the FCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are tough times to be a Vandal . As a true legend and icon of the Palouse I just can not let Akey ride off into the sunset without adding a few thoughts of my own , after the jump ... <p> To be perfectly honest , Robb Akey has n't accomplished too much as a coach since his days coaching the defensive line for the Cougs . Once he took over as coordinator in 2003 he had one good season with a Cougar D that was locked and loaded , then oversaw the complete collapse of that unit in the ensuing years . At Idaho he again managed one magical season with a mature group of players that had largely been recruited by a former coach , and once those players departed things went downhill in a hurry with no signs of turning around . A lot of this had to do with his loyalty to assistants that were simply not up to the task ( sound familiar ? ) , but Akey himself has never proven to have the coaching chops to excel at a level above position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good reason . He was a ton of fun . <p> For all his shortcomings as a coach , Robb Akey is one of College Football 's great characters . First of all , he looks the part . He is a towering man with a handlebar mustache and a signature gruff voice that constantly spits out enough T-shirt worthy sayings to keep a silk screen shop working round the clock . ESPN loves him and he has garnered lots of attention over his career , whether it was his unbelievable vertical leap he displayed as a defensive coordinator for the Cougs , or naming his sons Jack and Daniel , or quipping into the camera at the half of the Humanitarian Bowl to " stay tuned " , " you 're gon na love it " , and sure enough his team delivered a thrilling finish . Akey was easy to like and the kind of coach most people really wanted to succeed . College football 's coaching elite is dominated by Urban Meyers , Chip Kelly 's , Nick Sabans and other robotic , no-personality tacticians who give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only total football wonks and media sycophants would ever care to read . Robb Akey is not that guy . <p> With this week 's announcement a lot of people have been getting nostalgic about their favorite Robb Akey memories , and so what the hell , here is mine : In the 2008 season the Vandals were desperate for their first win over an FBS opponent in way too long and on Homecoming day against New Mexico State , Akey delivered . Amieable and I were there as the students rushed the field in jubilation , but my most memorable moment from that game came before it even started . This was pre-renovation , and the Kibbie was in pretty terrible shape . It had a video board about the size of my television that you could n't actually see . The Vandals took the field from a rusty garage door in the back corner of the Kibbie Dome and on this day that door rose about a foot and a half , then stopped . It was busted . You could see the cleats of the Vandal players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't budging . Then beneath the door a pair of hands emerged and with great strain the door was raised manually by none other than coach Akey himself . He raised the door and held it in place as the team ran out onto the field , all the while the motor above the door smoked and shot sparks out , some of them cascading over Akeys shoulders . It was awesome . I was almost in tears . That one moment said everything about both the state of Idaho football , and the awesomeness of Robb Akey . <p> But with every ending there is a new beginning and at Idaho that new beginning involves another one of our favorite sons , Jason Gesser . Sure , Gesser is completely unqualified to be a head coach at the FBS level , and he is basically like one of those Japanese generals in WWII who has been given command of a rag tag army after all the other generals have committed Harakiri . His chances of success are somewhere between none and none . But hey , is n't that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Give ' em Hell ! <p> And thanks to Coach Akey .

##3684950 <p> The study presents rare evidence of living creatures suffering the results of ocean acidification caused by rising carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuel burning , the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement . <p> " The finding supports predictions that the impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems and food webs may be significant . " <p> The tiny snail , named for two wing-like appendices , does not necessarily die as a result of losing its shell , but it becomes an easier target for fish and bird predators , as well as infection . <p> This may have a follow-through effect on other parts of the food chain , of which they form a core element . <p> Abstract The carbonate chemistry of the surface ocean is rapidly changing with ocean acidification , a result of human activities . In the upper layers of the Southern Ocean , aragonite -- a metastable form of calcium carbonate with rapid dissolution kinetics -- may become undersaturated by 2050 . Aragonite undersaturation is likely to affect aragonite-shelled organisms , which can dominate surface water communities in polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica that were extracted live from the Southern Ocean early in 2008 .

Comparing the shell structure with samples from aragonite-supersaturated regions elsewhere under a scanning electron microscope , we found severe levels of shell dissolution in the undersaturated region alone . According to laboratory incubations of intact samples with a range of aragonite saturation levels , eight days of incubation in aragonite saturation levels of 0.94 -- 1.12 produces equivalent levels of dissolution . As deep-water upwelling and CO2 absorption by surface waters is likely to increase as a result of human activities , we conclude that upper ocean regions where

##3687750 <p> NZSM : Cutting straight to the chase Jamie , in your experience dealing with sales professionals and business owners over the years , what separates top sellers from the rest ? <p> JF : They have the mental toughness " X factor " attitude to continue persevering towards their goals when others fall by the wayside , and despite well meaning friends advising them to give up . If you ask any group of people what makes the difference when it comes to results , the vast majority will say , " Attitude ! " Thomas Edison and Colonel Sanders are great examples , as is Sir William Hamilton . <p> NZSM : You 've done a lot to raise awareness of the work of renowned American psychologist Professor Martin Seligman in New Zealand -- for those who have n't heard of Seligman can you explain what he does and the significance of his work for sales managers ? <p> JF : Professor Seligman is regarded as one of the ten most important psychologists in the history of psychology , and he specializes in motivation . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " X factor " attitude in motivation that makes the difference between the average salesperson and the super stars . He also designed a test for this attitude , called the SASQ which is now being used by the Canterbury Crusaders and the Wallabies rugby teams , as well as business organizations such as ANZ National Bank . <p> Perhaps the most valuable aspect of his work is that he proved that the X factor attitude is learned , and that puts us in the happy position of being able to actually help sales people can develop this attitude , with big improvements in their results . <p> NZSM : A " positive attitude " and " mental toughness " are always high on the list of managers when they 're looking for salespeople but many salespeople appear outwardly positive yet crumble under pressure . Is mental toughness part of a positive attitude or are they two separate things ? <p> JF : No ! They are not the same and managers will make progress faster with their salespeople if they get to grips with this vital difference . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " positive attitude " at an early stage in life . <p> But it 's a superficial front , and does n't indicate that the fundamental mental toughness needed to persevere against the odds and succeed , is present . <p> Mental toughness is something much more fundamental and valuable . Think of it this way . Mental toughness is the foundation of the house you are building , while a positive attitude is merely the interior decorating . One is absolutely vital to everything that follows , while the other , the interior decorating , is open to personal preferences without creating any great risk of structural failure . <p> A positive attitude is a " nice-to-have " , while mental toughness is the " must-have " X factor attitude . <p> NZSM : You mentioned that this type of thinking can be learned -- are n't some people just born more optimistic than others ? <p> JF : Optimism and pessimism , as styles of thinking , are learned . While we are somewhat pre-disposed to one or the other , the major factor by far is accidental learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this accidental learning is huge . More than 1,000 studies with the Seligman test show that those salespeople with the more optimistic thinking style outperform those with the more pessimistic style , by 30% on average in sales results . In some industries it goes as high as 300% . <p> But the good news is that this old learning can be replaced by new learning . <p> NZSM : To date most of your work has been done in the business world with salespeople . Can you tell us a bit more about your work with the Canterbury Crusaders ? Many readers would suggest the Auckland Blues are the ones who need a bit more mental toughness ... <p> JF : The work with the Canterbury Rugby Union and the Crusaders Franchise is focused on developing their resilience and optimism -- that X factor attitude we talked about which is often referred to as mental toughness . <p> This involves assessing their present levels of that critical attitude ; working with their leaders and coaches to embed that attitude into their culture and practices ; providing coaching expertise and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of high performance become the norm . <p> As for the Auckland Blues ... Well all NZ sports teams would be wise to follow the Crusader 's lead ! In fifteen years of using Seligman 's test we have come to the conclusion that pessimism is endemic in our culture and action is needed urgently on all fronts , including sport . <p> NZSM : Some sales managers deliberately seek out salespeople those who have excelled in competitive sport -- what 's your take on this ? <p> JF : Sports people are comfortable with goals and targets . They are competitive and want to win . They understand the fact of failing and having to get up for next week 's game . They are also comfortable with regular training and individual coaching . <p> Those are the norm for top salespeople , and therefore the probability of a person who has excelled is sport excelling in sales is quite high , and the risk of another recruitment failure is reduced . <p> NZSM : Last year you correctly predicted on national TV that both the All Blacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the language they were using . Can you explain what happened in a bit more detail ? <p> JF : It 's as obvious as the nose on your face to a trained observer . We give away clues to our deeply embedded thinking style habits in the way we talk about why we have succeeded or failed in our endeavours . Technically this is known as our " explanatory style " . <p> I 've been using the All Blacks and Silver Ferns in case studies for many years now , and this provides insight into their thinking style habits . What makes this relevant to my predictions is that the science behind it proves , beyond doubt , that those with the more optimistic explanations beat those with the more pessimistic explanations . <p> With the Silver Ferns there is a strong pattern of more pessimistic explanations , while the Australian Diamonds are more optimistic in their explanations . <p> Similarly for the Black Caps ( NZ Cricket Team ) winning is an aberration while losing is the norm . It 's the other way around for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team were once asked to name the second best side in the world . Their answer was Australia B ! Now they were not intending to be perceived as arrogant . That 's the way they think . <p> NZSM : Kiwi 's versus Aussies ... we often accuse Australians of being arrogant yet we praise their mental toughness ... is this just symbolic of Kiwi 's being more pessimistic in general ? <p> JF : My observation is that it is more than symbolic . I think that Aussie 's have a more optimistic thinking style , and this comes across as " arrogance " to Kiwi 's , but it 's not intended that way by the Aussie 's . It 's an outcome of accidental learning at an early age . Fortunately for them ! <p> Kiwi 's on the other hand are accidentally learning a more pessimistic way of thinking from an early age . <p> What ought to concern us all is the way that Australia has been able to maintain a high OECD ranking for many years . I think it is currently number 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1950 's . <p> It 's my strong opinion that this has a lot to do with optimistic and pessimistic attitudes , alongside other factors . In fact , treasury people are studying this connection . If we had a national optimism project , like Scotland , I think a surprising degree of improvement would be achieved in a relatively short period . A national optimism survey would be a good start . <p> NZSM : You worked as country manager for the international sales training organisation Learning International ( now AchieveGlobal ) quite some time ago -- have you noticed any improvement in the way Kiwi salespeople sell since then ? <p> JF : This was in the early 90 's . I have noticed some improvements . Unfortunately there are still appallingly low standards of sales practice being accepted , and I 'm sure we have all been on the receiving end of some of that . <p> A good number of corporate 's do provide their people with quality skills training . Unfortunately there is far too much reliance on " product knowledge training " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after product training . Instead of asking questions to help define how to assist clients achieve their goals , salespeople engage in unloading all their newly acquired " product knowledge " , and turn off the customer . <p> One very good indicator of progress is the growing practice of appointing " sales coaches " to work with the sales team members . In some cases the coach is a consultant , in many others the coach is an internal sales expert . <h> Related Posts <h> About Jamie Ford <p> Jamie Ford , founder and director of The Foresight Institute is a nationally renown expert on mental toughness and optimism and resilience and the relationship of these qualities to success , particularly in sales .

##3688651 <h> Post navigation <p> Summary : In the newest issue of The New England Journal of Medicine , famed health care economist Victor Fuchs argues that : " Current demographic , social , and economic forces will create new priorities for future biomedical innovations : more emphasis on improving quality of life and less on extending life , and more attention to value-enhancing innovations instead of pursuit of any medical advance regardless of its cost relative to its benefit . " <p> Sunday , Matthew Holt published a superb interview with Fuchs , ( now the Henry J. Kaiser Professor Emeritus at Stanford University ) on The Health Care Blog ( THCB ) . Below , excerpts from that interview . At the end , I offer extended commentary on this exceptional interview . As always , Fuchs offers some eye-opening insights . You 'll find the complete September 19 THCB interview here . <p> Fuchs begins by summarizing the main points of his new NEJM article : " New Priorities for Future Medical Innovations " : <p> Victor Fuchs : I think there are two key elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience and one of them I think rather new . Let me do the new one first . The new one is that we are going through what I call the second demographic transition . <p> The first transition was when every country had high mortality and high fertility and then the mortality , especially of young people , started to drop , but fertility did not drop right away . . . and during that time the population soared because there was this discrepancy between mortality and fertility . <p> You see the high fertility made sense when mortality was high because you wanted to have at least a couple of children survive to adulthood , but when mortality dropped it did n't sink into people 's consciousness right away , so it took quite a while . . . a period which the historians and the demographers referred to as the demographic transition . . . <p> This was a time when many in the U.S. were calling for " Zero Population Growth . " Before long , the slogans would n't be necessary . More and more families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we worry about most , at a particular point in time ( Islamic terrorists , for instance , in the months and years since September 11 , or the " Red Threat " in the 1950s and early 1960s ) , turns out to be the least of our problems . Today , unemployment and a sinking economy pose the greatest threat to American families . -- MM <p> But now the second demographic transition is the one that I talk about in the NEJM piece , . . . It has the following elements . <p> First is that a very large and increasingly large percentage of the population cohort lives until age 65 , whereas at the beginning of the 20th century only a small percentage lived until 65 . Now we 're going to 80% and we 'll eventually approach close to a 100% living till 65 . <p> The second element is that life expectancy at 65 is increasing and it 's increasing at a quite brisk pace in recent decades . You put those two things together and you find out a very large and growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . will be lived after 65 . <p> At the beginning of the 20th Century only about 20% or not even 20% of the additional years were lived after 65 . Now we 're getting to a point where close to 80% of the additional years are being lived after 65 . Now that 's very important because the conditions of people over 65 are very different from the ones under 65 . <p> Over 65 they 're not in the labor force . Four out of five men are out of the labor force and nine out of 10 women and they are very highly dependent on transfers from the younger people and that means more taxes on the younger people and so on . <p> So I think that the people are going to realize that increasing life expectancy as a major goal of biomedical innovations does n't have the same compelling force behind it as if it did when the population was different and . . . much of the additional years from additional life expectancy would be lived before 65 when people were in the workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's what I call the second demographic transition and I have no doubt that it will take a while for the implications of it to sink in to people just as the first one did , but eventually I believe it should result in a change in emphasis away from innovations that increase life expectancy to innovations that improve the quality of life -- that 's the first point and I do n't think it 's well understood . <p> The second point has to do with the economic challenge of having healthcare expenditures growing so much more rapidly than the rest of the economy and most people realize that somehow that has to change . I think a lot people do realize it , and my point is that what we ought to be doing there is changing the emphasis from increasing life expectancy at any cost to finding innovations that would lower the cost of medical care without necessarily changing life expectancy or health outcomes generally . <p> . . . But there are still large elements in the population that resist that notion , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . <p> Matthew Holt : . . . let me ask you your opinion . How much do you ascribe of the increase in life expectancy and most people living over 65 and then increasing life expectancy post 65 to changes in medical care , broadly described ? <p> Victor Fuchs : Almost all of it . If you look where the big changes have come , let 's say decrease in infant mortality , tremendous decrease because they have technologies now that can keep very low birth weight babies alive . . . <p> Matthew Holt : Right , so you 're saying medical technology 's got a pretty large contribution to what we 've seen in terms of growth in life expectancy and longer life expectancy past 65 . Now , I also recall from your colleague and good friend Alain Enthoven , the concept of " Flat-Of-The-Curve " medicine . There has been a lot of discussion -- especially in the last couple of years about the work of Wennberg and his colleagues at Dartmouth about unequal variation , but also like unnecessary and nonproductive care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should n't be conflated . . . . One has to do with the curve being flat at a certain point as you have more and more MRIs and so forth . . . . a lot of the expenditures that we have now contribute little or nothing to increased life expectancy . . . . At the same time some technology moves the curve upwards . . . In those cases more medical care buys you more in health outcomes . . . <p> The problem , for us . . . is how we can cut back on the expenditures without cutting sharply into the health outcomes ? I think it can be done , but it can only be done under certain circumstances . Here is my formula for how you get physicians to practice cost effective medicine . . . the physician needs three I 's . You need information because very often they do n't know what the contribution is of the different technologies and they certainly do n't know what the cost is . <p> Then infrastructure so that they can make use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the most cost effective way to treat people with diabetes is to treat them with a team , mostly a non-physician team . <p> The third thing physicians need is incentives . If they do n't have an incentive to apply the information and to seek out the infrastructure , then it 's not going to do you any good . <p> It 's got to make sense to them and it 's got to make sense in dollars and cents as well as every other way . So , that 's where you reconcile all the Flat-Of-The-Curve Dartmouth stuff with the fact that there is technology which does increase life expectancy . <p> Matthew Holt : That 's a great distinction , I love your three I 's , information , infrastructure , incentives . . . . what do you regard as the likely outcome for the system or for the way we practice medicine given what you were talking about in terms of moving from an emphasis on increasing life expectancy to an increase in quality of life ? <p> Victor Fuchs : I 'm very pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I am pessimistic has to do with the whole underlying information base and decision making within our political system . You are no doubt aware of the fact that now we have a highly fractionated system of messages to people . We have -- how many channels ? I do n't know , but there are a large number of radio talk shows . <p> We have bloggers , God save them , there are some great ones like you , but they 're numerous and what you have is people tuning in only to the messages that they want to hear . The messages that reinforce their opinions . Psychological research has pretty well demonstrated that when someone has an opinion and they are surrounded by others with the same opinion , they will hold it more extremely Meanwhile , given the ineffective political system that we have now -- highly polarized , highly contentious , losing good people who do n't want to run again , who do n't want to serve in the Senate or the House . . . the chances of getting good policy out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Matthew Holt : Some of the discussion that you 've raised in this piece , especially around improving quality of life as opposed to the life expectancy is being picked up in various parts of the healthcare system by some people with some power in the public sector , the Don Berwick 's of the world and also in the private sector . <p> Victor Fuchs : He 'll go with quality of care not quality of life . Berwick wants to improve the quality of care , whichever way it goes whether people live longer or not -- I 'm talking about innovations that do n't extend life , but make life more pleasant for older people while they are still alive . . . . <p> Matthew Holt : But some of that involves , some of the things like the diabetes care teams that you talked about , they may extend life , but also quality of care . <p> Victor Fuchs : That 's cost effectiveness . That will have benefits both in length of life and quality of life . Cost effective is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Value-Added Tax Dedicated to Providing Universal Coverage <p> Matthew Holt : Let me flip to a different issue . You just authored a new piece from the Institute for Economic Policy Research at Stanford with John Shoven , This is about a dedicated VAT solution . <p> Victor Fuchs : . . . I can explain that fairly quickly . Domestically the U.S. faces two big problems , which the commission on deficit reduction have been asked to address . The first one is to find an additional source of revenue and the second one is to get a handle on healthcare cost . <p> In fact , as Alice Rivlin says -- and she is a member of the commission -- long-run fiscal policy is health policy . Now we have proposed that if there is a dedicated value added tax , dedicated to paying for basic care for everyone , universal coverage , that will simultaneously increase revenue and get a handle on healthcare cost , provided that what people are then entitled to do is to join an accountable care organization that will be paid on a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but will be paid a risk-adjusted lump sum to keep a patient well for a year ( adjusted based on the patient 's overall health , age , income , race , etc. ) taking the risk that they will fail , and the patient 's health care costs will exceed the lump sum . MM <p> And we know that we can realize very extensive economies in that form of organization and delivery . At the same time we 'll also have cut out a lot of the costs associated with the present way that we finance care with employment-based insurance . . . The whole thing is really , you might say , a mess . That 's the long and the short of that piece , although we go into it some detail . <p> Matthew Holt : So , let me ask you about that because , of course , your work on this , which goes back 15 years or so , was also the basis of the book which you did n't author , but you were clearly a big part of , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of a value added tax which funded a voucher system , providing everyone with vouchers which entitled them to the same generous package of health care benefits , at no cost to the individual . MM <p> The system outlined in Healthcare Guaranteed is tied to a system of Accountable Care Organizations . We did n't get that in the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) that just happened . So , can you give me a sense about how you think we can get people to think about this more systematically and more logically ? <p> What Everyone Says Ca n't Happen , Will Happen -- But Not Now <p> Victor Fuchs : I do n't think we can . What I 'm relying on here is something that De Tocqueville found about the United States a long time ago . He said that the United States moves from the impossible to the inevitable without ever stopping at the probable . <p> Another way to put this is that American history is studded with examples of major policy changes that were completely off the radar screen , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just give you two examples ; first , the emancipation of the slaves . No way , that was going to happen and then suddenly it did happen and the slaves were emancipated . I 'll give you a much more recent example , $1 trillion to bail out the major financial institutions . <p> Go back six months before that , no possibility ; that was not politically feasible . Then in a matter of three weeks , the whole thing turned around and it became politically feasible . <p> So , what I 'm saying is that I am trying to weigh out what I think is the best way to go , but the mechanism by which we get there will not be . . . painful , long drawn out discussion . . . it 'll be a response to a crisis and suddenly everybody ; both houses , the President and everybody will realize that they have to do something substantial and they 'll do it and my hope is that they 'll do something sensible . But you see the two examples that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get major policy change in America . <p> The interesting thing is that the De Tocqueville realized that 100 years ago and that was already true in the country . You go from the impossible to the inevitable without ever stopping at the probable . <p> Mathew Holt : That 's great . And talking about that , I want to ask you about the long drawn out debate that ended up in the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) legislation . You wrote an article in The New England Journal , I think it was early 2009 , suggesting that there was going to be severe difficulties getting something done . . . . So did you expect something to pass like the bill we got , and did you think it was what you 'd call real health reform ? <p> Victor Fuchs : The answer to the last question is " No , " it was n't real healthcare reform . As a matter of fact , by summer of last year the word " healthcare reform " was never heard from Obama . . . it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance companies was a much more doable target . <p> To get real healthcare reform , there just was n't the support in the country and they found that out , they saw that was happening . . . <p> There was an excellent article by David Leonhardt , in the NY Times , that day after the Affordable Care Act passed , in which he pointed out that the primary function of this legislation was re-distributive about redistributing health care dollars , and to some degree , health care services . It did n't change the healthcare system . . . The legislation offers only " promises " of real change says Fuchs . You know there was a piece by Orszag and Emanuel in NEJM . . . did you see it ? <p> Matthew Holt : Yeah , I did . <p> Victor Fuchs : Orszag and Emanuel suggest that there 's a chance that under the legislation there will be some good changes in the organizations delivering care , but given Congress -- the way it is -- and given the other obstacles , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the country gets into some kind of crisis situation . <p> We do n't know what that crisis will be . One possibility is China stops buying U.S. Bonds . There might be other possibilities . I 'm not a political forecaster , but I can tell you that it will take a crisis to really turn healthcare around and in that case I hope they turn in the direction that I 've been advocating . My comments : <p> A couple of years ago , someone asked me if I would be interested in speaking at a conference on longevity , and I explained that I could n't because : " I 'm against it . " I was only half-kidding . As Fuchs points out , it was one thing when medical technology was saving babies and children , or pushing the envelope so that most of us will live to 65 . But lately , some futurists have been talking about " making 85 the new 75 " or " 90 the new 80 . " <p> We should be careful of what we wish for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care of Serious Illness , palliative care pioneer Dr. Diane Meier , points out that 13 percent of Americans over 65 and " 42 percent of those 85 or older suffer from Alzheimer 's , the most common cause of dementia . ( Prevalence is even higher if vascular dementia is included ) . " <p> This is a terrifying statistic . As we live longer , more and more of us will outlive our minds . And there is little that we can do about this . As Fuchs suggests , we should invest in technology that will improve the quality of life as we age . Living longer should not be our primary goal . <p> At the same time , as Fuchs says , we need to focus on developing medical technologies that " would lower the cost of medical care without necessarily changing life expectancy or health outcomes generally . " Making care more efficient -- and safer -- should be a top priority . With that in mind , physicians need " information , infrastructure and incentives . " <p> What Ca n't Happen Will Happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insight : " the United States moves from the impossible to the inevitable without ever stopping at the probable . " Fuchs explains : " American history is studded with examples of major policy changes that were completely off the radar screen , they were politically infeasible and everyone said they were impossible until suddenly they became politically possible . " <p> As Churchill observed , Americans always do the right thing -- after " trying everything else first . " De Tocqueville recognized what is unique about how we make progress : in the end , under great pressure , we leap to the right conclusion . Fuchs offers a superb example : " the emancipation of the slaves . No way , that was going to happen and then suddenly it did happen and the slaves were emancipated . " <p> As regular readers know , in the past I have argued that we are at a turning point in American History . We have no choice . Our economy , like our health care system , is heading for a wall . At the beginning of 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass health care reform legislation this year -- except we did . This was because we were approaching a terrifying tipping point . More and more middle-class Americans are scared -- and rightly so -- that at some point in the near future , they are not going to be able to afford health care . <p> Funding Reform <p> Fuchs argues that the Accountable Care Act " does n't represent real reform . " I ca n't agree . Though I do agree that , at first glance , the major thrust of the legislation is to redistribute the cost of care : The wealthiest 2 percent of all U.S. households ( individuals earning over $200,000 or couples earning over $250,000 ) will be paying higher taxes to help fund universal coverage . Insurers that have been over-charging for Medicare Advantage without providing good value for those Medicare dollars also will contribute to financing reform : they will find their funding cut . Finally drug-makers , device-makers and insurers recognize that , under universal coverage , their revenues will grow , and all have agreed to kick in a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-income Americans will receive the subsidies they need to buy health insurance . This change represent a major step toward making our health care system more equitable . <p> Fuchs would prefer a Value-Added Tax ( VAT ) on consumption as the best solution to financing reform . He helped Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel write Healthcare , Guaranteed , a book that describes a brilliant plan for universal coverage fully funded by a progressive VAT , and I agree that , going forward , we should give this proposal serious thought . <p> In the book , Emanuel sketches a bold plan that offers free , high quality health care to all Americans . No premiums . No deductibles . Low-co-pays . Under this proposal , the government insists that all insurers offer the same comprehensive benefits to everyone , benefits that are more generous than Medicare 's and more comprehensive than what 85 percent of all employers offer their employees . A 10 percent VAT on spending becomes the sole source of funding for universal coverage , and revenues from the VAT can not be used for anything else . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care , it would be progressive . Low-income people spend less because they have less discretionary income . Thus , they would pay less in VAT taxes . But under the plan , they would be entitled to the same health care benefits that high-income households receive , even though those families lay out more in VAT taxes . I have written about Healthcare , Guranteed , and how the VAT would work here , and here . It remains the best blueprint for transforming our health care system that I have seen . <p> That said , I still believe that the Accountable Care Act represents a good first step . But as health care reform evolves , we might well adopt some form of the Emanuel/Fuchs plan . As Fuchs points out , their plan is built on a network of " Accountable Care Organizations " ACOs that move away from fee-for-service to pay hospitals and doctors a lump sum for caring for patients . The legislation the president signed in March also encourages ACOs . In fact , newly installed Medicare director Don Berwick is already beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Accountable Care Act . In other words , the new legislation and the Emanuel/Fuchs plan are not irreconcilable . <p> The VAT is something to keep in mind as we move forward , but we are not in a position to introduce a brand-new tax with a European pedigree this year , and I doubt we could do it next year . As Fuchs observes , politically , we are too divided . Moreover , we are in the middle of a deep recession . But at some point in the not-too-distant future , a progressive VAT might well make sense . <p> Changing How Care is Delivered : Congress Yields Power <p> In the meantime , I would argue that the Accountable Care Act opens the door to making substantial , structural changes in our health care system . . . Here , I am more optimistic than Fuchs , who suggests that there is only a slim chance that former OMB director Peter Orszag and Zeke Emanuel are right in a recent NEJM article where they suggest the legislation will lead to " good changes in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take time . As Orszag and Emanuel stress , reform will be a process : " Perhaps most fundamentally , the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) recognizes that reform , particularly changing the delivery system , is not a one-time event . It is an ongoing , evolutionary process requiring continuous adjustment . The ACA therefore establishes a number of institutions that can respond in a flexible and dynamic way to changes in the health care system . . . " <p> Orszag and Emanuel are talking about the Independent Payment Advisory Board ( IPAB ) , the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ( CMI ) , and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute . ( PCORI ) Each will strive to move U.S. healthcare toward more affordable , more compassionate , evidence-based care : " One of the essential aspects of the legislation is that unlike previous efforts , it does not rely on just one policy for effective cost control , " Orszag and Emanuel write . " Instead , it puts into place virtually every cost-control reform proposed by physicians , economists , and health policy experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and scaled up if they 're successful . " <p> For example , the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ( CMI ) is charged with testing pilot projects , including Accountable Care Organizations , that will change both how we pay for care -- and how it is delivered . If a pilot is successful in leading to better coordinated , more efficient care , the legislation stipulates that " t he Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to expand the duration and scope of a demonstration , even nationwide . " In other words the Secretary of HHS does not have to go through Congress . This represents a radical change . <p> In the past , Medicare needed congressional approval , and too often lobbyists persuaded legislators to delay or derail successful initiatives . After all , one man 's waste is another man 's income stream . For instance , one project that tested competitive bidding for durable medical equipment between 1999 and 2002 showed that the program could reduce Medicare expenditures in this area by 19% . Although Congress authorized the CMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years -- until 2010 . Presumably companies that manufactured the equipment were not enthusiastic about bidding that would trim their revenues . <p> Congress also has given the Independent Payment Advisory Board ( IPAB ) the power to rein in Medicare inflation without its approval . If projected per capita Medicare spending exceeds target growth rates in a given year , IPAB will have the authority to recommend proposals to limit Medicare spending growth . Congress can block those cuts only if it offers an alternative proposal that will achieve the same level of savings . If legislators do nothing , IPAB 's recommendations automatically go into effect . Orszag has called this " the largest yielding of sovereignty from the Congress since the creation of the Federal Reserve . " None of the proposals aimed at curbing inflation can ration care , increase taxes , change Medicare benefits or eligibility or increase beneficiary premiums and cost-sharing requirements . This suggests that IPAB may trim Medicare spending by refusing to pay for waste -- i.e. unnecessary or redundant tests and ineffective , often unproven , treatments that can not rightly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has granted the Secretary of HHS the power to review the Medicare payment schedule and adjust " misvalued " physicians ' services to prevent either overtreatment or undertreatment . This could let her raise reimbursements for underpaid services such as palliative care , while lowering payments for some very lucrative surgeries , such as back surgery , that medical research suggests are done too often , without helping the patient . <p> " By enacting a broad portfolio of changes , " Orszag and Emanuel observe , " the ACA provides the best assurance that effective change will occur . Moreover , by taking a multifaceted approach that includes hard savings plus the mechanisms for creating a dynamic health care system , the ACA enables physicians , hospitals , and other providers to consistently improve outcomes , boost quality , and reduce costs as health care evolves . " <p> Will each of the reform initiatives embedded in the ACA work ? Of course not . Will all of them fail ? To suggest that they will is to take cynicism to an extreme that could best be called nihilism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the descendents of those who insisted that the U.S. economy would always depend on slave labor . <p> Fuchs understands that , at some point , a crisis will force us to take the leap , and " do the right thing " -- because the only alternative is a complete melt-down . <p> Orzag and Zeke Emanuel 's proposals continue the fragmented , duplicative , non-system which is confusing and a time-waster for practitioners and patients alike . The VAT is a horrible idea . A single payer program , much like Taiwan 's would be a huge improvement . <p> I thought Fuchs piece was pretty telling about the American tendency to play chicken with reality until finally seeing that reality through the final attempt to avoid the grand crisis . Maggie , I know you think the new health care act will plant the seed of real reform , but too much politics will kill those seeds in the short run . The crisis that Fuchs predicts will be the telling issue about change or disaster , and it should be quite a ride until that crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform eventually , Fuchs sounds about right in what needs to be done as a general framework , IMO . <p> I 'm afraid I agree with NG -- things will need to get much worse before they get better . I hope I 'm wrong . What will happen , I fear , is that the GOP will succeed in gutting the healthcare bill ; then , when it does n't work , proclaim that the bill was a failure from the outset . Finally , as Churchill says , we 'll fix things . But first it will get uglier . <p> I think this ' progressive VAT ' is a myth , as a flat rate consumption tax affects poorer people more simply because it 's a higher proportion of their income . In the UK , the richest 10% pay one in every 25 pounds of their income in VAT ; the poorest 10% pay one in every seven pounds as VAT . I ca n't see how hypothecating VAT to healthcare will stop a regressive effect on day to day living . A combined national insurance/income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare . <p> Marc , Marc -- I too would have thought that a VAT is always , necessarily , regressive -- until I read the book and interviewed Emanuel . Please bear with me while I explain it : First , consider a middle-class family with joint income of , say , $60,000 . ( This is close to median income -- half of all households earn less , half earn more . ) After taxes ( income , property and sales taxes ) , let 's say they net $52,000 . It 's safe to say that they probably spend close to the entire $52,000 just to cover the basics of life : rent or mortgage , food , ultilities , transportation to work , clothing , furniture , essential home repair ( if they own ) Maybe they are able to save a few thousand a year toward retirement -- or a child 's college education . So , let 's say they manage to save $3,000 and spend $49,000 . They pay 10% on every dime they spend -- so they pay a total VAT of $4,900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this VAT applies to everything . ) But after paying the $4,900 VAT , they get all health care free of charge . No premiums , no deductibles , almost no co-pays . They have a voucher that entitles them to a very rich benefit package -- better than the package provided by 85% of employers . Then consider a wealthier familly -- let 's say a household with joint income of $180,000 . After taxes , let 's say they net $160,000 . ( These tax figures vary widely , depending on the size of their mortgage deduction , whether they pay state income taxes and how high local property taxes are . So this is just a back-of-the envelope figure ) They probably do n't spend every penny their earn ( though some households in this income bracket do -- especiallly if they have children -- if they also have credit card debt , they may spend More than they earn . But let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that they save 10% -- or $16,000 toward retirement , child 's education , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to cover unexpected expenses . So they spend $144,000 -- and pay a 10% VAT of $14,400 . Finally , consider a very wealthy family with joint income of $300,000 . After taxes , they net $250,00 ( I 'm assuming they have a big mortgage deduction as well as other deductions that wealthier people tend to have . ) They also save 10% -- and spend $225,000 . They pay a 10% VAT of $22,500 . Now here 's the important point : Each of the three families receives exactly the same rich benefit package in exchange for their VAT taxes . All health care is free -- no insurance premiums , no deductible , very , very little in the way of co-pays . In 2010 dollars , that package would cost roughly $14,000 ( I 'm assuming a family package better than what 85% of employers now provide . ) The median income family pays $4,900 for a benefit package worth $14,000 . The $180,000 family pays $14,400 for that package , the wealthy familiy pays $22,500 . In other words , the wealthy family is subsidizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending , say $20,000 to $30,000 a year would pay $2,000 to $3,000 in VAT taxes -- and get the same package . A household that spends $500,000 a year ( private schools , keeping up two houses , cars , vacations , eating out , hiring people to keep up the grounds , clean the house , a live-in baby-sitter , etc. etc. would pay $50,000 in VAT taxes . This is a progressive tax . Granted , today , according to the Census bureau the average median-income family spends only about $3,500 on healthcare . The number is that low , because many families do n't have insurance , and thus only see a doctor in an emergency . Under this plan , they pay more -- $4,900 -- but in return they get much , much more -- all of the health care they need , and the secruity of knowing that they will always have all of the care they need . The VAT does n't go up -- it remains at 10% -- though the revenues from the VAT rise each year , along with inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthier families are likely to see their income rise , along with their spending . ) A family pays more only if they spend more . Keep in mind that all of the revenues from the VAT are used to fund healthcare . And this is the only source of fudning for healthcare -- no employer contributions ( which means wages should rise ) , no other special taxes for healthcare . . . The math actually works ( Fuchs is an excellent economist . ) I hope this makes sense . <p> Maggie -- More than 100 countries have some variant of the VAT . As far as I can tell , exactly none come close to applying it to everything and none dedicate it to financing health insurance or anything else for that matter . In the U.S. , where the population is more resistant to taxes than in many other countries , I ca n't understand why you think our political system could ever pass a VAT that applied to everything and was dedicated to health insurance financing . Even if it did , it is highly unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the voucher to keep pace with rising healthcare costs as the population ages and technology advances . Moreover , health insurance lends itself very well to being priced in contrast to , say , defense spending or environmental protection . If we ever do move away from employer financing for the under 65 working population , I think we would be most likely to adopt something similar to the Swiss approach where everyone pays their own health insurance premium with subsidies for those who ca n't afford it . In Switzerland , 45% of the population qualifies for a subsidy and people are expected to spend about 10% of income toward their insurance premium plus deductibles and co-pays before the subsidy kicks in . In addition , general taxation helps to cover part of the cost of operating hospitals . The Swiss approach applies to the entire population including the elderly and there is no government run plan . I think the Swiss model , as an alternative to our current system , is the best fit with our culture . <p> Barry , NG , Chris , Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the VAT that Emanuel and Fuchs propose is very different from any other VAT . This is what makes it so original , and so brilliant . These are two extraordinarily intelligent men , and they thought long and hard about this problem The originality and elegance ( simple , and brilliant ) of the plan is also why reviewers ranging from the Financial Times to Ezra Klein have given the ideas in this book such Kudos . You argue that the public would never accept such a plan . I agree -- right now . But things are changing , in our economy , and politically . Two years ago , who would have thought that some of these Tea-Party candidates would be elected in so many states ? In 2004 , who would have thought that this country was ready to elect an African-American president ? At this point , things could go in either direction . I think it is very hard to predict what will happen over the next 2 to 3 years , though I 'm hopeful that we will go in a more rational direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , things can seem politically impossible -- until they suddenly become possible . Unfortunately , before that happens , we may have to go through a serious crisis -- see Chris Johnson and NG . NG -- I do think we 're looking at " quite a ride " over the next few years . I have always though that reform would be a tumultuous process -- and it will take years -- a process , not an event . And I agree with you and Fuchs on this : what will drive reform forward will be a crisis -- quite possibly more than one crisis . But I disagree as to whether the new legislation can seed reform . It can , and I believe it will . We all just need to give Berwick , and reformers as much support as possible . ( Or put it this way : that is all that we can do . ) Many good things will and can happen tomorrow . And I mean literally tomorrow : As of Thursday , kids with pre-existing condtions can no longer be denied insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits on insurance -- etc. etc . For many people , this is already a major turning point that changes their lives . We should pay attention to that . I was heartened to see that the evening news on the networks was highlighting these changes today . NBC news with Brian Williams does a particuarly good job . ( As do some commentators on CNBC . But I 'm glad to see Williams reaching the mainstream . ) Chris- I do n't think Republicans will be able to gut the bill . First , I very much doubt that they will take the Senate . Even if they do , Obama has the veto . And the president 's recent appointment of Elizabeth Warren suggests that he no longer focused on compromising with conservatives . He finally seems to understand that he and they are too far apart . So the president went around Congress , and appointed Warren , just as he appointed Berwick . Obama is not foldng on these domestic issues . He would veto any attempt to cip away at the Affordable Care Act . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a good piece on Politico today or yesterday pointing out how hard that is . It quoted sensible Republican Gail Wilensky , pointing out that while unhappy politicians like to talk about this when they are angry about legislation that has passed -- actually managing to remove funding is very , very difficult . It rarely happens . Meanwhile Berwick understands that speed is of the essence . The more he does -- as quickly as possible-will make it all but impossible to undo what he has done . He will be committing money to pilots -- especially to Accountable care Organizations . And people will begin to see that things are happening . , , Lou -- Taiwan is a tiny country . Trying to turn the U.S. into single-payer at this point in time would be chaos . For one of the best explanations as to why this is so , Google : " Atul Gawande " and " the New Yorker " and " single-payer . " He explains that you have to build on what you already have . Also , keep in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Canada and the U.K. And these are not the best health care systems in the West : many countries in Western Europe have much better systems ( higher quality , greater patient satisfaction , yet affordable ) and they all use private sector insurers . These are non-profit private insurers -- that is the key . Dr. Rick -- Thank you very , very much . I agree : what Fuchs has to say should be heard by everyone interested in reform . <p> Sorry Maggie , I totally disagree with your starting point that " we have to build on what we already have " . If that means keeping insurance corporations , we are already witnessing their extortion and ability to evade regulations -- ceasing selling child-only plans , for one . Yes , I realize the size of Taiwan , and have read the New Yorker article when it was published . The VAT IS regressive and will hurt lower income people more . I have read Fuchs since the 70s and never have found his approaches to be convincing . <p> Maggie , the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are a few . 1 . Linking healthcare funding to spending is a big risk , surely . In recession , people spend less . In the UK , healthcare has been explicitly ' ringfenced ' by the coalition government , but they 'd have a hard time doing that with VAT ( even though they are putting it up from 17.5% to 20% starting 1 Jan ) . 2 . Adding 10% to the cost of all goods and services will distort buying patterns and at the low end of income could cause more hardship for essential goods , as people there ca n't afford much or any healthcare anyway . Some categories will surely have to be exempted , such as children 's clothes , as in the UK . And surely it would n't apply to public services . 3 . Further , adding VAT to everything would be massive administrative nightmare and would mean huge evasion . In the UK , companies and sole traders only have to become VAT registered when they reach a threshold of about $100,000 sales a year . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production chain . Suppliers selling to other businesses charge VAT , but they reclaim VAT on purchases . That 's how it works in the UK -- only the net value gets passed to the government and is mostly paid by the end customer . 5 . All other developed countries , as far as I 'm aware , provide eligibility for universal healthcare through public/private insurance systems and income tax although they can of course use VAT revenues too . Overall , I think that last point is fundamental -- I think we need to see healthcare as a right that is funded as closely as possible by the productive side of people 's contributions and not by their ( capitalist ) consumption . <p> Marc -- We are the only OECD country that does n't have a VAT . This suggests one of two things : a ) we are right and everyone else is wrong Or b ) we are wrong . I ca n't help but remember that for some years , we were the only ( or one of very , very few ) civilized countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we did . . Why do these countries all have VATs ? Because it is a way to tax that wealth that often escapes taxation . A great many wealthy Americans run cash businesses . ( I once went to a Park Avenue doctor who took only cash -- no credit cards or checks . She had been in business for a long time , and had always only taken cash . ) Restaurants , general contractors , some landlords , many other self-employed people take part if not all of payments in cash -- and then do n't report all of their income . But if we had a VAT , that money would be taxed as they spent it . In addition , many wealthy older Americans no longer have earned income -- and so they pay income tax only on capital gains and dividends -- at a significantly lower rate . For the last 25 or 35 years of their lives they may be paying significantly less tax than others . Often these wealthy seniors spend lavishly . A VAT provides a way to tax some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cases , they leave it to their heirs . Inheritance is fine , but as great wealth consolidates , too much money winds up in the hands of too few families . This is bad for the economy ( itleads to bubbles0 and the society ( huge gaps between the wealthy and others . ) Of course we could just tax wealth directly -- rather than taxing spending -- but this would not be popular . And in many ways , it seems perverse to tax people for saving . We need a variety of taxes so that we are not putting the lion 's share of the tax burden on earned income . Indeed , taxing spending makes more sense than taxing work ( earned income . ) Work is genearlly a good thing : it keeps people occupied ; even if they do n't love their work , it provides satisfaction ; very often , what they do is useful . Spending , American-style , on the other hand , is extremely wasteful . For the past 30 years or so we have been " conspicuous consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't need : gadgets ; more clothing than we can wear ; " stuff " that collects dust on our tabletops ; three or four televisions ( one for every child 's bedroom ) ; cooking equipment and tools we never use , large gas-guzzling cars . . We teach our children to be materialists who feel they must have everything other children have -- and more . We do n't teach them taste . ( Traditionally , French women have many fewer pieces of clothing than American women . But they are more expensive , much finer , better made , and last longer . They are carefully selected -- one reason so many French women look fantastic . In many restaurants , we spend huge amounts of money on large portions of not very good food . Another reason to have a VAT is to encourage saving rather than spending . Americans are loaded down with debt . People are losing their homes in part because they bought more house than they could afford , or because they kept refinancing , tapping the equity in their home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other naive , ofen low-income home-buyers were simply hood-winked by dishonest real estate agents , mortgage brokers , mortgage bankers and appraisors who lied to them about the value of the home , the terms of the mortgage , and what they could afford . ) If we tax spending , people might spend less . Our " shop until you drop " economy has helped turn us into the world 's biggest debtor . But I digress . To go back to the VAT : in Europe , much healthcare is funded by a combination of income taxes , VAT and other taxes . Insurers pay a relatively small share of total healthcare costs . ( Even in the U.S. , private insurers now pay for less than half of all health care costs . ) I totally understand how a VAT works in the production chain . ( While at Barron 's for many years , I often wrote about taxes- flat tax , VAT , state income taxes , etc. etc . ) It 's actually much harder to evade a VAT than to evade income taxes -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the VAT has not proved an administrative nightmare in many other countries ( particularly France . ) In a recession , if people spend less , revenues from the VAT might drop ( though probably not sharply , unless we are in a serious depression like the Great Depression , that hits the rich . ) In that case , the cost of healthcare would drop too . Doctors would charge less ; hospitals would stop construction ; drug-makers would have to cut prices -- or find that they could n't sell their products . In terms of hardship for the poor , as I explained in my first response , the poor would receive healthcare at no cost -- that would more than make up for a ! 0% tax on household spending of $20,000 or $30,000 a year ( $2,000 to $3,000 ) . ( Tax credits could cover poor households that have no income . ) What most people do n't realize is that today , the uninsured ( who are usually poor ) pay a surprisingly large amount out-of-pocket for health care -- more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion out of pocket for health care -- and received $58 billion in uncompensated care . In other words , they paid for more than 1/3 of their health care expenses out of pocket -- far more than most Americans . Many paid more than the $2,000 to $3,000 they would pay in VAT taxes . And the VAT tax would buy the peace of mind of knowing that you , and your family , can get whatever care you need -- and the same qualify of care that wealthy families receive . This is priceless -- and also means that many people who are now disabled due to poor health would be able to work and earn an income . Finally , many in Washington agree that , eventually , we are going to have to have a VAT . We pay far less in total taxes than the citizens of other developed countries . If we want safety nets ( Medicare , Social Security ) good public education , clean cities , a cleaner environment , a defense system that might protect us against terrorism . . . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the citizens of other countries pay . President Obama has already mentioned a VAT . I would guess it will happen within the next 5 years . But it will be a progressive tax only if it is dedicated to something that everyone needs and wants . Only then will low-income and middle-income Ameircans receive something , in exchange for their taxes , that is worth far more than what they are paying . <p> Lou -- I 'm afraid we have to agree to disagree . If you have been reading Fuchs for years , then you know the arguments . I can say only that many consider him a brilliant economist , are persuaded that a VAT dedicated to healthcare would not be regressive , and that the vast majority of Americans ( most of the the 85% who have employer-sponsored program ) are n't ready to give it up for an unknown gov't plan . Down the road , I suspect we 'll have a public option . And over time , many Americans might choose that option , moving us closer to single-payer . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy ; they have to choose it . As Gawande explained in his New Yorker article , in Canada and the UK -- the only countries that have single-payer -- it arose , quite naturallly , from the system they already had . <p> ' If we want safety nets ( Medicare , Social Security ) good public education , clean cities , a cleaner environment , a defense system that might protect us against terrorism . . . we will have to begin paying taxes that are comparable to what the citizens of other countries pay . ' Sure Maggie , but if you want to do more like the other OECD nations you need to set up decent universal insurance . I really , really do n't see a healthcare sales/VAT tax as a realistic option . If you want to tax say wealthy older people you do so through their earnings/pensions . And running cash only businesses is precisely where huge amounts of VAT is lost -- you have to enforce VAT registration and I ca n't see that happening in the US . And people will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as I 'm aware , most US states already have a sales tax of about 4-6% . You should certainly have VAT of some sort but I would n't bet the healthcare farm on it . <p> The path-dependency concept is compelling ; however you lump Canada and the UK together : " As Gawande explained in his New Yorker article , in Canada and the UK -- the only countries that have single-payer -- it arose , quite naturallly , from the system they already had . " However , Gawande 's article refers only to the UK ; Canada having had a system similar to the US at the time , multiple competing private insurance companies and a big nonprofit BlueCross hospitalization presence . Gawande does , however , describe the French experience , whose beginnings were also somewhat similar to the US system : " So it built on what it had , expanding the existing payroll-tax-funded , private insurance system to cover all wage earners , their families , and retirees .... Today Securite Sociale provides payroll-tax-financed insurance to all French residents , primarily through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . " So it appears that , although path-dependence is undeniable , there is a large degree of convergent evolution in action . <p> GZuckier -- You 're right Gawande does n't mention Canada -- except to say that it reformed its health care system in 1966 . That 's a big difference . In 1965 , we were able to roll out Medicare for all seniors , pretty much from scratch , creating a brand new program . But our health care system was much , much much smaller then There were many fewer people involved . There was far less money involved . ( In 1965 doctors and hosptials just could n't do most of the things they can do today . ) The U.S. health care industry was tiny compared to what it is today . To try to roll out a new system , from scratch , even just for seniors , would be impossible today -- it would , as Gawande says , create chaos . We have to build on what we have . And that is exactly what Canada did -- even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1940s . Here is the history of how Canadian care developed : " the Canadian story begins in 1946 , when Tommy Douglas , the socialist premier of Saskatchewan , secured legislative approval of government-funded hospital insurance for all residents of the province . The federal government followed suit in 1957 , funding hospital insurance for the entire country . " Douglas led the way again in 1961 , when Saskatchewan became the first province to fund full medical insurance for all its residents . In response , some 700 doctors in Saskatchewan went on strike for 23 days , charging that the Douglas plan opened the door to government control of health care . Several thousand citizens joined them , staging an orderly protest against the new " medicare " scheme outside the legislative building in the provincial capital . " The protests eventually died down , and by 1966 , the Canadian government had passed legislation providing money to provinces that followed Saskatchewan 's lead . Two years later , they all had . " Proponents of the reforms touted them as a happy medium between the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the American system , where healthcare services were largely left to the private market . Canada 's federal government provided funding to the provinces , which the provinces used to deliver care . " This happy medium soon crumbled . With health care now effectively " free " -- that is , paid for by other taxpayers -- Canadians began visiting the doctor twice as much . Exploding demand drove up costs . To keep spending under control , the federal government simply reduced how much it sent to provinces to run the system . Provinces in turn cut payments to doctors and covered fewer services and cutting-edge treatments . " At first , doctors responded by billing patients directly for amounts greater than the government reimbursements . But in 1984 , the federal government outlawed such practices -- thereby banning private delivery of services covered under the Canada Health Act . At this point , the Canadian government effectively controlled health care in the country . " " In 1957 , Canada built on what had already happened in Saskatchewan in the 1940s . " Then in 1966 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Similarly , in the U.S , in the 50s and 60s we built on the employer-based system that began during WW II when employers couldnt ' raise wages , but were allowed to add benefits to the compensatoin package . The rise of employer-based insurance , much like the election of Douglas , a Socialist , in Saske was an " accident of history " that laid the groundwork for what followed . Everything proceeded quite logically from that point . In Canada the government , which was paying for care , began to control spending . Meanwhile , in the U.S. employer-based insurance spread , in large part through Blue-Cross Blue-Shield -- which did not do a very good job of controlling spending . It paid docs whatever they charged in a region ( this became " usual and customary " ) and they paid hospitals whatever hospitals said it cost them to care for patients -- even if hospitals were very inefficient . Blue Cost and Blue Shield then passed these costs onto customers , raising premiums and cutting benefits . In Canada , the government couldnt ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would not accept spiraling taxes . So the govt reined in costs . Meanwhile , in the U.S. , in the 1980s , for-profit health insurers got into the business . ( before than , almost all health insurance as non-profit . But Reagan cut back gov't help for non-profits in 1980 and meanwhile , so much money was flooding into healthcare that for-profits saw an opportunity . ) With the exception of 6 or 7 years in the 1990s , when they experimented with " managed care " for-profits insurers did little to try to rein in spending , but just passed higher costs on in the form of higher premiums or lower benefits . Medicare has tried , to some degree , to rein in spending , but Congress has ( up until now ) stood in its way . Lobbyists in the health care industry want to see spending continue to rise . Now , however , under the new legislation , HHS and Medicare can begin to limit waste , and reduce spending on ineffective and over-valued care while moving away from fee-for-service ( which encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since today 85% of americans under 65 have insurance , much of it employer-based care , we would meet huge resistance if we decided to do away with that insurance and tell everyone that they now must sign up for government insurance , which would follow the Canadian model , capping total spending , cutting payments to doctors , and refusing to cover experiemental ( i.e. " cutting edge " procedures and products . ) In Canada patients get far fewer angioplasties and by-passes than they do here . Americans like angioplasties which offer an instant ( though temporary ) answer to Angina . They prefer this to changing diet and exercise ( which offers a more permanent answer to angina . ) We like MRIs -- they do many fwer MRIs in Canada . Etc . Etc . Canadian healthcare is far more affordable because a ) doctors make far less . b ) hospitals charge far less and invest much less in building new wings , etc . They do n't have huge reserves . They do n't have nearly as much redundant equipment . c ) Canada refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not included in its formulary. d ) administrative costs are lower ( but this is not the main reason Canadian health care is so much less expenisve . The underlying cost of care is less . ) All in all , outcomes are about as good in Canada as in the U.S. And Canadians are accustomed to and generally like their system . ( Though some doctors lament not making nearly as much as U.S. physicians . ) Similarly , most Americans are accustomed to their employer-based , private-insurance system , and would be very upset if they were forced to switch , all at once , to a Canadian type government system which did n't cover some cutting edge treatments , paid their docs much less , did n't offer as many private rooms in hospitals , etc. etc . ( Even though , in truth , the medical care is about as good . For example , mortalities for people with heart disease are no higher -- despite much less aggressive care . ) This is why countries must build on what they have , and then refine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , as GAwande explains . It began with a system that was very , very different 
##3688951 <h> Photos <p> As a graphic design student at Fort Hays State University , the El Dorado native was able to tap into the relationship his school had with the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago and turn that into his first job . <p> " I was lucky enough to be a recipient of one of their ( Leo Burnett 's ) scholarships , " McClure , 34 , said . " I actually had a job before I walked across the stage . " <p> That job as art director for Leo Burnett was the start of a graphic design career that would later send McClure to Kansas City , where he helped develop and implement an in-house motion graphics department at Barkley Advertising , and on to Nashville , where he worked as lead designer and animator for CMT , the country music television network . <p> As he moved to each new job and new city , McClure said he was developing the skills and confidence to return to Kansas in 2008 with his wife , Shelly , and their four children , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The agency , at 575 W. Douglas , employs six people . It specializes in digital and new media and also offers branding and identity and interactive and mobile design . <p> McClure said his experiences at Burnett , Barkley and CMT were key to his business success . He said graphic design students who plan to work on their own right after graduating are in for a rude surprise , and that working for someone else the first few years out of college will give them the experience and the confidence that they will need to succeed . <p> " Once you 're decorated I think you can go out and experience those things , " McClure said . " I would recommend to anybody ... learn about what you are going to step into . I would n't be here had I not experienced the 10 years ( of working for someone else ) , " McClure said . <p> Last month , McClure was named the 2012 Rising Entrepreneur of the Year by the Mid-America Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame at Butler Community College . <p> What did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's largest ad agencies , teach you ? <p> I learned how the real world works . It was a big step into reality with timelines and budget constraints . And I think most of all I learned the creative process , who does what . There 's a system in place . As a kid coming out of college , there 's a rude awakening of how this actually works . I think the other thing was the experience to work with national clients , knowing I could work with clients at that level . <p> How did you know the time was right to start your own business ? <p> When I left CMT in 2008 , I knew I was ready to go out on my own . I freelanced probably five years before I actually walked away from it ( CMT ) . I actually had more work at home than I did at work . It got to be where we 've finally proven I can go out on my own , so it was a pretty easy decision . <p> Do you like country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get interested in television graphics ? <p> I fell in love with after-effects ...

##3689750 <h> Geek Ladies : Papers , Please <p> A word of advice to dudes preparing to weigh in on an issue of what you believe women should do or be : If at some point , you find yourself writing , preemptively , " Now hold your horses before you get all riled up , little ladies , " or any variations thereof , take a moment . Walk around the block . Meditate a little . And then go delete everything you wrote , empty your trash folder so you 're not tempted to bring it back , and write something else . This advice is an important first step in not being an asshole . Because , if you found yourself drawn to preemptively accusing your hypothetical critics of hysteria , you know both that what you wrote is sexist and that you resorted to sexism to justify your sexism -- and all before you hit " publish " ! Why would you want to do something like that ? <p> Why would you want to do it in a piece where your clear intention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be what Joe Peacock wants with this CNN piece where he decries the " booth babe " phenomenon . His article is really a classic in the genre of people stabbing near a good idea , but then missing the mark wildly , destroying what little good they actually had to say . The glimmer of a good idea is this quote : <p> As a guy , I find it repugnant that , due to my interests in comic books , sci-fi , fantasy and role playing games , video games and toys , I am supposed to feel honored that a pretty girl is in my presence . It 's insulting . <p> A piece written about this would be awesome , especially if he analyzed it honestly from a male perspective . After all , while he feels this way , clearly there 's a lot of men who do n't , or else there would n't be such angry defenses of the practice of hiring booth babes at gaming conventions . In fact , there really would n't be booth babes at gaming conventions , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money because ladies in skimpy clothes are pretending to like them for pay . These are all valuable things to talk about , and Peacock could have , man-t0-man , explained why dudes should find it insulting and , instead of supporting this practice , should denounce it . Then , instead of " hold your horses , ladies " language , he could have worked with women for a better understanding of how objectification of women only helps corporate profits , but is a disservice to fans both male and female . <p> Instead , his piece was basically a long screed dividing women into two categories " real geeks " and " conniving bitches " . The weirdest part was that he spent a long part of it accusing ordinary women of only pretending to be geeks so they could get attention . You know , since getting the attention of geeks when you 're not even remotely interested in geeks is just such a common thing : <p> San Diego Comic-Con is the largest vehicle , but it 's hardly the only convention populated with " hot chicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gawking geeks ' heads to turn , just to satisfy their hollow egos ...... <p> What I 'm talking about is the girls who have no interest or history in gaming taking nearly naked photos of themselves with game controllers draped all over their body just to play at being a " model . " I get sick of wannabes who could n't make it as car show eye candy slapping on a Batman shirt and strutting around comic book conventions instead . <p> I 'm talking about an attention addict trying to satisfy her ego and feel pretty by infiltrating a community to seek the attention of guys she would n't give the time of day on the street . <p> I call these girls " 6 of 9 ? . They have a superpower : In the real world , they 're beauty-obsessed , frustrated wannabe models who ca n't get work . <p> They decide to put on a " hot " costume , parade around a group of boys notorious for being outcasts that do n't get attention from girls , and feel like a celebrity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world " , but when they put on a Batman shirt and head to the local fandom convention du jour , they instantly become a " 9 ? . <p> But lest he think that he 's accusing every Slave Leia of this , he rushes to assure you he 's not : <p> And be it known that I am good friends with several stunningly beautiful women who cosplay as stunningly beautiful characters from comics , sci-fi , fantasy and other genres of fandom . They are , each of them , bone fide geeks . They belong with us . Being beautiful is not a crime . <p> So how can he tell from looking at strange women at cons that they are n't like his authentic friends ? How does he know that the women in costumes at San Diego Comic Con are just pretenders trying to get some of that hot , hot geek attention ? He does n't say . It seems that the difference between whether or not you get to be a girl in a skimpy outfit who is a Real Geek and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Peacock , though . I have an alternate theory of what 's going on here . Some women who cosplay at cons do n't pay attention to Peacock . Instead of being chill about it and understanding that not everyone is going to want to bone you immediately because she likes the same comic book as you , he instead retreats to accusing them of being cock teases who only do this for attention . <p> I 've noticed that embittered dudes like this way overrate how much women want to be seen as hot . I mean , yeah , it 's really important to a lot of women . I like to look good myself . But this fantasy that there 's legions of women who are so calculating about fulfilling this need that they buy or make a costume referencing something they have no interest in , go into spaces that are bewildering for outsiders , and preen around for guys that they have no interest in , for no other reason than to get a rise out of rejecting them ? That 's grade A paranoia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who ate up his article would be better served by repeating to themselves , " Not everyone has to want to fuck you just because they share your interests . " There 's no reason to construct an elaborate fantasy that the cosplaying woman who is n't into you deliberately set out to fuck with you . It 's okay if not everyone wants to fuck you or even be your friend . <p> Peacock does n't have an actual evidence of this phenomenon of women dressing like geek characters for no other reason than to rile the geeks up , so he conflates them with women who are paid to be sexy . <p> But then , you have these models-cum-geeks like Olivia Munn and practically every FragDoll . These chicks ? Not geeks . I think that their rise is due to the fact that corporations are figuring out that geeks have money , and they want it . But they ca n't abide putting a typically geeky face on camera , so they hire models to act quirky and sell this marketable geekdom . <p> You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conflating paid models and spokeswomen with these imaginary women who are n't " real " geeks but cosplay all the same. * But this is just garbled nonsense . First of all , the existence of sexy women who are paid to be sexy to get men to open up their wallets is hardly something marketers came up with to exploit poor , hapless geeks . Sadly , this is a widespread phenomenon . I mean , duh , sports . Sports fans are hit from many angles from skimpily dressed women who are being paid to be there . A lot of bars have beer girls that show up wearing hot pants and trying to get customers to try new products . I even saw this go on at a super-hip bar during SXSW . ( And yes , it worked on some dudes , killing the notion that this is about exploiting the unique hard-up-ness of geeks . ) Entire restaurant chains like Hooters have made this their entire business model . That 's why it 's especially weird to have women who are clearly being paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are there of their own accord , or women who are sexy but are there as expert spokesmen , like Aisha Tyler . We all have a lot of practice spotting the paid-to-be-sexy types . There 's not a lot of mystery there . <p> But Peacock uses the phenomenon to excuse men who are just frankly sexist assholes : <p> So , I can understand why someone completely ignorant could look at Felicia Day and see a pretty woman who is making one heck of a career starring in roles celebrating fandom , and mentally file them along with the fake geek G4 hostesses . <p> Nope . The fact of the matter is the guy who went on a rampage against Felicia Day is just a sexist who does n't accept that woman have anything to offer other than their bodies , full stop . No need to make excuses for him . Again , that type exists in all sorts of fandoms , and not just geek ones . Female sports fans can tell you all about men who will look for any reason to dismiss their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're women . As someone who spends a lot of time in the indie music world , I 've also met my fair share of dudes who were eager to assume that I was n't a real fan . There 's a lot of men out there who think because all they want from women is sex , then women no interests outside of getting male attention . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've heard men say that women only listen to music in order to be more appealing to male music fans . I honestly do n't know what guys like this think women do with all our spare time that we 're not working , fucking someone , or trying to get fucked . As Perez 's non-apology showed , dudes who believe this of women are usually impervious to the piles of evidence that exist that show we have internal lives and actual interests outside of being as fuckable as we can be . Gosh , some of us even have interests that our boyfriends do n't share , and we pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peacock puts pretty much all the blame on women for confusing men about who is there because she 's paid , who 's there because she 's a geek , and who 's there because she 's a conniving bitch who has no interests outside of creating elaborate , time-consuming scenarios where men give her attention and she has a reason to live . ( Hint : This last group does n't exist . ) Because of this , the inevitable conclusion you get from reading his piece is that he believes that geek culture is rightfully owned by men , but he thinks he 's a big hero because he 'll let women in on a case-by-case basis , and only if they prove themselves in ways that men are n't expected to do . Sorry , but cookie not granted . Women want in because they have a right to be there . They do n't have to prove themselves to you or anyone . <p> As for women hired to be hot and sell stuff , well , he does have an argument against that buried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's intelligence , and corporations need to stop the practice of hiring women for their looks instead of their expertise . Why ca n't we just leave it at that , instead of suggesting some male tribunal needs to be established to determine who is and is n't a " real " geek amongst the volunteers ? <p> *Seriously , I ca n't believe he thinks this . I have to imagine that non-geek women that are really vain and want a lot of sexual attention from men would avoid cosplay like it was battery acid . Why ? Because the guys they want -- non-geeks -- would think they 're geeks , duh . I do n't see why this is so hard to grasp . <p> Pandagon is the go-to zone for eye-rolling at conservative nonsense , feminist rants , election-watching , and obsessing over low-rated but critically acclaimed television .
