These are okay because they are not that harmful . <p> But I draw the line on some practices of the dark side . The appeal of this dangerous dark side is stronger for people who have moved away from the teachings of the Bible . Their gullible minds are easily impressed by dabbling in danger , and so they gravitate towards the grim , the horrible , and the gruesome . <p> As traditional Christianity seemed to have lost its appeal for many people , growing numbers have sought to fill that vacuum in their lives in other ways . Some turn to alternate religions popular in other parts of the world . Some turn to witchcraft and pre-Christian paganism . Some seek answers in the occult . A few even knowingly turn to Satanism and evil spirits . <p> These I don ? t subscribe to ! Dabbling in witchcraft or Satanism is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements based on it , such as Wicca , Santeria , voodoo , channeling ( consultation with mediums ) and evil possession . The apostle Paul tells us we should be wary of such practices , ? lest Satan should take advantage of us , for we are not ignorant of his devices ? ( 2 Corinthians 2:11 ) . <p> Some are simply curious ; others are very serious . But whether they recognize it or not , all are dabbling in dangers that likely are well beyond their limited comprehension . That ? s why these dangers are often referred to as the occult ? things that are secretive , mysterious and concealed . <p> Maybe you ? ve never seen Satan or his demons , but certainly those familiar with the Bible recognize the devil ? s influence in this rapidly degenerating world . His influence is not new , but its prevalence in modern society certainly is . What was once banned or very limited in dealing with the dark spirit realm is now mostly out in the open . <p> One of the fastest growing movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witchcraft . Part of its popularity is due to American TV programs and movies about vampires . Wicca is so popular that the United States , Great Britain and many other nations now recognize it as a legitimate religion with legal rights . <p> Wicca , from an old English word for ? witch , ? incorporates many of the trappings of ancient British witchcraft practices . The satanic pentagram is used as its symbol , and one of its main tenets is adoring nature through different rituals and deities . Wicca is an umbrella group or movement that gathers under its fold very different beliefs and practices ? but is at its core a thinly disguised type of old-fashioned witchcraft . <p> Santeria is a Caribbean religion based on mixing African witchcraft with Roman beliefs ? similar in many ways to voodoo or pure African witchcraft . Its followers practice animal sacrifices and perform feverish dancing that can lead to something similar to demonic possession . <p> All of these practices have this in common : Satan is their originator and they should be absolutely avoided . God , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warns us not to have anything to do with them . He tells us to not ? give the devil a foothold ? ( Ephesians 4:27 NIV . ) <p> And then there ? s channeling . Channeling has become increasingly popular on TV and radio , especially with the arrival of the ? New Age ? movement . This is a modern version of mysticism with roots in Hinduism , Buddhism and occultism . Some famous actors and actresses have promoted this new take on some very old religious practices . <p> Those who do the channeling claim they are receiving information or comments from a divine or unknown source . In effect , they say , they are like a radio receiving a signal from a transmitter . On TV and radio shows , the medium has one or more spirits enter his/her mind and then he/she becomes the ? mouthpiece. ? Through the medium , the spirit then offers information , advice or predictions on almost any subject imaginable , from the present condition of a departed loved one , to medical counsel , financial advice or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bible constantly warns us not to participate in any type of channeling that requires us to open our mind to these spirits . Instead of exposing our minds to foreign sources , we should keep the natural barriers of our minds well protected from any outside spirit influence . <p> Some use manual devices such as tarot cards or Ouija boards to consult directly with spirits . These objects should be avoided at all costs ? they are not innocent ? games ? but ancient ways of attracting evil spirits . <p> Think of these instruments as potential passports into your mind ? possibly opening an entry to the zone that should only be inhabited by your own thoughts and God ? s Holy Spirit . If you do not invite these evil spirits , they can not enter . Yet sometimes even an unsuspecting invitation through these devices can give demons a green light ! Sadly , many people have unknowingly invited evil spirits into their minds ? and they are never quite the same again . <p> We must simply say ? No ! ? when enticed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold under the pressure from friends , family or anyone else . Put God and His Word first ! Literally , your life and your mental welfare could depend on it ! <p> God , who knows exactly how Satan and his demons work , emphatically warns us not to have anything to do with them . We should not consult with people associated with these spirits in spite of any stated intentions to help us . <p> God ? s word is clear : ? Do not turn to mediums or seek out spirits , for you will be defiled by them . I 
##1091250 <h> Sec . Robredo in Bukidnon : " He took the side of the marginalized " <p> MALAYBALAY CITY ( Bukidnon News/21 August ) In his first and last official visit to Bukidnon on March 12 , 2010 , Sec . Jesse M. Robredo took time to talk to people in need , showing his sincerity to serve as a public servant . <p> Yoyong Merida , chairperson of the Panaw Sumilao Multi-purpose Cooperative , said Robredo " was a leader who took the side of the marginalized sectors " and " a person our country needed for it to progress . " <p> " There are only a few good leaders in government , and now it gets fewer , " Merida said via SMS hours after reports came out that Robredo 's body was found 800 meters from the shore at a depth of 180 feet at 7:45 a.m . Tuesday . <p> Merida was one of the Sumilao farmers , who hogged the headlines in 2007 when they marched from Sumilao town in Bukidnon to Manila to press their claim on a 144-hectare estate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the farmers received a total of 147 hectares . <p> He added that Robredo joined them in their walk back then . In his visit , he asked for their situation and also for updates about the case of slain farmer-leader Renato " Ka Rene " Peas . <p> The bodies of the pilots -- Captain Jessup Bahinting and Nepalese flight student Kshitiz Chand -- were also reported to be inside the plane 's cockpit . <p> The discovery of the bodies ended a three-day search that started when their Piper Seneca plane crashed into the waters off Masbate Saturday afternoon . <p> Robredo met with Sumilao farmers on March 12 to listen to their concerns after he visited the wake of a police officer slain in a New People 's Army attack in Malaybalay last year . <p> Inside the barangay San Vicente multi-purpose cooperative hall in Sumilao , members of farmers belonging to the group spoke to Robredo about the conversion of their need to reclassify the land that they received as industrial to agricultural . They also told Robredo about the lack of farm implements and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representatives from the San Vicente Landless Farmers ' Association and the Mapadayonong Panaghi-usa sa mga Lumad Alang sa Damlag were present in the meeting . <p> Robredo offered advises to the farmers including the need to follow up officials who pledged support to the farmers . <p> Earlier that day , Robredo visited the wake of PO3 Jomar Cahig , one of three police officers killed in an ambush on March 6 while they were on their way to investigate an ambush-killing of a former barangay captain two hours earlier , Police Supt. Erwin Bayani Meneses , Malaybalay police chief , said then . <p> Meneses blamed the New People 's Army ( NPA ) for the ambush on the teams of the Scene of the Crime Operatives ( SOCO ) of the Philippine National Police ( PNP ) in Bukidnon and the Malaybalay City Police Station ( MCPS ) between the villages of Mapayag and Bendolan , near the city 's boundary with Lantapan , Bukidnon . <p> Robredo came to talk to the family and handed some financial assistance , DILG provincial director Ronelo Alvarez told this reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##1095350 <p> " President Aquino 's unconscionable use of power is encouraged by the swan song that this is the way forward for the country . " <p> It can be inferred that swan song means that one big thing or achievement that Aquino will be remembered for even if he 's no longer president . It 's like a testament to how well he has run the country . However , the word swan song is not in the dictionary . I wonder why . <p> 3 . Am I right when I say that the past perfect tense can never be used alone in a sentence since it expresses an action completed before another action indicated by a simple past verb ? The past perfect tense should also be used sparingly . <p> I 'm surprised that " swan song " is n't listed in your dictionary . Mine , the Merriam-Webster 's 11th Collegiate Dictionary , defines it literally as " a song of great sweetness said to be sung by a dying swan " and figuratively as " a farewell appearance or final act or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that " swan song " was used by Ms. Pedrosa in its semantically correct sense in that sentence . She might have meant " mistaken idea " or " rationalization , " as in this rewrite of that sentence : " President Aquino 's unconscionable use of power is encouraged by the mistaken idea that this is the way forward for the country . " <p> Also , I think it 's incorrect to infer that by using " swan song , " Ms. Pedrosa wanted to convey the idea that the unconscionable use of power is " that one big thing or achievement that Aquino will be remembered for even if he 's no longer president . " My feeling is that she really meant to say that it 's neither the correct way to make the country go forward nor a desirable thing for a national leader to want to be remembered about . By the mistaken use of " swan song , " however , this sense was lost in the rendition . <p> As to the phrase " not that I know of , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean " I guess " either . What it means is " not that I 'm aware of , " as in this conversational exchange : " Did the senator really plagiarize those passages from the blogger 's website ? " " Not that I know of , for I have n't read the senator 's speech and the blog yet . " Of course , the sense would be downright wrong if the reply was " No , for I have n't read the senator 's speech and the blog yet . " <p> As to your last question , it 's not right to say that the past perfect tense can never be used alone in a sentence and it 's not right either to say that the past perfect tense should be used sparingly . <p> It 's true that the typical past perfect sentence consists of two separate actions in time , as in this sentence : " The ship had sunk when the rescue team arrived . " The earlier action takes the past perfect ( " had sunk " ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . However , the past perfect can also be used alone to denote an action that began and ended at some indefinite time in the past , as in this sentence : " The heavy floods had lasted two weeks . " <p> Clearly , there 's no point in prescribing that the past perfect be used sparingly . It will always be called for when the action had taken place and was completed at an indefinite time in the past . When the precise time is given , however , the simple past tense must be used : " We met at the park yesterday . " <p> Sir , I fairly do n't think ' ' The ship had sunk when the rescue team arrived , ' ' the sentence you 've supplied as an example to clarify on past perfect tenses , is pertinent one in that it is wrongly using the word ' ' when . ' ' My understanding of the subordinating conjuction ' ' when ' ' is that it 's an adverb of time joining two clauses that have their actions taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the arriving of the rescue team and that of the ship sinking occured at two separate times , the appropriate and correct subordinating conjuction should have been ' ' before , ' ' which , like ' ' when ' ' , is the adverb of time , but unlike it , serves to show that two actions in sentence clauses indeed have taken place not in the same time . Thus my reformed , legitimate past-perfect sentence would be ' ' The ship had sunk before the rescue team arrived . ' ' But if there had been an imperative need to incorporate ' ' when , ' ' then I would have introduced another time adverb to the sentence . The other reformed sentence would therefore read ' ' The ship had already sunk when the rescue team arrived ' ' <p> In the sentence " ' The ship had sunk when the rescue team arrived , " I 'm using the subordinating conjunction " when " in the relative sense of " at or just after the moment that " -- meaning that the rescue team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afloat but nevertheless arrived close to the time of its sinking . <p> In your version , " The ship had sunk before the rescue team arrived , " you are using the conjunction " before " in the sense of " earlier than the time that . " Your " before " version gives no indication in any way that the rescue team arrived at a time close to the sinking of the ship -- it could have been hours , days , or weeks before the sinking of the ship . <p> We must keep in mind that " when " could have any of the following relative senses : ( 1 ) " at what time , " ( 2 ) " at , during , or after the time that , " and ( 3 ) " at or just after the moment that . " In contrast , the conjunction " before " has the sense of " earlier than the time that , " with no indication whatsoever of the closeness of a later event to the occurrence or consummation of an earlier event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier event happened sometime before the later event but there 's no way of ascertaining relatively when . For all we know , the earlier event -- in this case the sinking of the ship 
##1096652 <p> Volcanoes are cone shaped hills or mountains that are formed near a vent that is connected to a reservoir of molten rock , or magma . The meaning of the word volcano is the vent that molten rock , gases , and solid objects are expelled from the earth .

During an eruption , magma , tephra , and other materials are forced out of the volcano . <p> Some eruptions are mild , but others are violent and dangerous .

##1106451 <h> Nadine X <h> There was a troll <p> There was a troll , who was often sitting near the river and fishing alone . One day the south wind planted a tree seed in the riverbank near the troll . It slowly grew and enjoyed the company of the troll sitting nearby . Maybe Troll 's blue locks attracted the tree or Troll 's fishing skills , no one will ever know . Tree , even though very shy but friendly creature , slowly started to talk with the troll , getting to know his story . <p> As the story of troll 's life unfolded , Tree became fond of Troll and even revealed this , which surprised but pleased Troll . Troll started to feel special . As the tree grew , more and more branches sprung out of it , providing shade and comfort over the fishing spot and the troll . After some time , Tree started to surprise the troll with small pleasantries such as little fruits and comforting night whispers . Troll was pleased with the tree and although they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troll started to water the tree and call it by a nickname . <p> Time passed fast for happy Tree . But the troll sometimes seemed more interested in fishing and often forgot about his new friend altogether , not watering or talking to the tree . But it was fine as long as Tree knew Troll would be fishing nearby . At times Tree got upset , but not for long , because in nature Tree was a very positive and trusting personality . Tree believed that together with Troll 's help , it would become much stronger with many more branches and maybe become a forest someday . <p> Page 1 <p> After some time , a new fish came to the river . Large and shiny , it attracted Troll 's attention immediately , but it was not swimming anywhere near the tree . Troll left for long periods of time forgetting to water the tree . Tree wrote to the troll asking to spend more time together , but Troll explained that fishing is momentarily more interesting for him . As troll was far away having fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . But when troll came back to his usual fishing spot , Tree was very glad to see the troll and loved more than ever . <p> As Tree 's love for the Troll grew , a small flower appeared on one of the branches . It was pink and delicate and needed a lot of care . Troll liked the flower at the beginning , sprinkling it with water during hot days . Tree was very happy and confided to Troll about growing love and desire for Troll 's care . But after some time caring for the flower , Troll started to get bored . He told the tree that it is too much hard work for one flower . Troll desired more flowers and brighter colors from the tree to make care taking worthwhile . This surprised and saddened Tree . Tree started to hate the flower for not being brighter and larger and the branch for not producing more . After a short time , the branch fell off . <p> Page 2 <p> After that , the tree stopped growing new branches and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less shade and the comforting night whispers became quieter . Troll stopped watering and talking to the tree as often as before . They did n't talk about the reason for this , but Tree knew that Troll blamed the Tree for loosing branches and leaves . <p> One day , the troll announced to the tree that there is a much better fishing spot at far end of the river and the tree 's shade would not be needed anymore . Without its leaves and branches , the tree no longer produced enough shade . Troll asked if the tree was fine with him leaving , and Tree did n't say no , because Tree was proud and did not know how to beg . And the troll left . <p> Tree was devastated with Troll 's abandonment and wanted to chase the troll but was too proud to do so . Tree could not believe that Troll could just leave loving friend to chase the fish . More branches and leaves fell , and Tree did everything to forget the troll . <p> Troll sent a letter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly blaming Tree for not providing enough shade and comfort . After some time , Tree realized that there is only small , fragile bit of life left , one remaining delicate sprout , and decided to send it to the troll .

And one day Troll realized there was something wrong . Troll did not feel special anymore . Troll missed the sensation of being loved and missed Tree 's shades and gifts and comforting night whispers . Most of all Troll missed Tree 's praising of Troll 's fishing skills and listening to Troll 's life stories . <p> And Troll went back to visit the tree . But there was nothing left of the tree at Troll 's old fishing spot . Maybe Tree was growing into a forest in some other place , where river brought its last sprout

##1107552 <h> An Inside Look at the Home-Office of a Virtual CEO ! ( Includes Video ) <p> About six months ago we moved house . It was something that had been on the cards for a while , and although we had looked at a lot of houses in the area where we wanted to live , here in Cebu , Philippines , we had n't been lucky enough to find something that was truly what we wanted . <p> One of the main contributing factors for buying a new house was that I needed a larger home office space . Since I 've become a Virtual CEO , I am now working from home more and more , and in the old house I was finding myself very constricted on a number of levels : <p> I did nt have a ' view ' , which was quite literally driving me nuts ! <p> The aircon was old and noisey , not condusive to business calls . <p> My desk area was small and very limited . <p> I had no full-time space for my video shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' family computer . <p> It was on the lower level of the house , where all the ' action ' is throughout the day . <p> Above you 'll see that , frankly put , I needed my own space , away from everything else . Somewhere quiet , and motivating . Not noisey and distracting . So , when we visited a one-year old house , designed and built entirely on Feng Shui principles , it was love at first site . Not only that , but the entire top level of the house was wide open and ready to be renovated into the home working facility I needed ! <p> You can see the new home office in the short video tour , at the top of this post . <p> Needless to say , the difference speaks for itself . I find myself being incredibly motivated and heavily productive in this new environment . The additional desk space is a major factor in this , as I like to spread things out in front of me when I work . Not only that , but the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , especially for mind-mapping . <p> What do you think of my new set-up ? Any suggested changes I could make ? <p> As we get ready for the New Year , what steps are you taking to make sure that 2012 is the best year ever for you and your businesses ? I 'd love to hear your comments below . <p> hey Chris , great office and equipement . It looks very tidy , did you make a final year end clean up , or does it always look like this ? Seems to be a paperless office . <p> I like the whiteboard , I got one a few month ago and my work got much more creative by using it . Even if I 'm sitting in front of my computer and feel like having a tunnel vision and I have no new ideas , a brainstorming mindmap at the whiteboard can help to spread the view . <p> A nice tour of the office . A litle crampped in the corner sharing with you wife but otherwise a neat setup . <p> I so agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amongst the rest of the house hold . <p> Whats with the " rock " to the left as you look out your widow ! curious . Looks like a very nice area you live in a " walled community " i guess . <p> I currently have 4-5 " offices " . Ive been determined since i started on this journey to never have an office again . Having people to work with is nice and great for a community spirit but i prefer the freedom of life on the cloud . <p> So i have an office spce wher i live , I work out of two seperate coffee shops ( starbucks and Cafe nero ) and also i work from a firends farm where i stay every few weeks to helpout with horses and other animals . <p> This means that I can literally packup my " office " in ten minutes to relocate . The only thing i do nt have with me at the coffee shop is a decent sized monitor ! <p> Lastly i plan to relocat ethe office out to asia again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge is going to be running the office from the road in last 2012 on a trip to the USA . <p> Thanks for sharing you tour and I to feel 2012 is going to be Epic . <p> Steve <p> p.s. whats with those funny mac computers after nearly 30 years being around " pc 's and macs " ive still not bought a apple computer although the air looked really cool <p> Thank you Chris for sharing this look into your home office . I listen to your podcasts and visit your site because you are always enthusiastic and I come away with creative inspiration . I was wondering what type of microphone you have mounted on your desk ? Thanks again . <p> You have a great post to start for 2012 . I myself also did some mind mapping like what I want to achieve for 2012 starting from January -- October 2012 . I also set up my own small-home-office on a rented space enough for extra desktop where my assistant can work on his tasks , cabinet to put some books , etc . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your door is situated . If you ask me , I prefer that my working area is facing the door so I could see who 's coming in and out ; and not to be distracted by surprise . Planning for one year is a good move for entrepreneurs . I 'm also setting up my consulting firm . Thanks for sharing your good vibes . <p> Working from home is such a double-edged sword . I love it but have to battle get caught up in house duties and spending too much time with my family . I actually want to spend time with my family of course , but I do have to get the work done too . <p> Happy New Year Chris ! Cool office and view . I am getting the back of my house redone with an addition . It will reconfigure my office a bit and take off the deck , but I will still be looking at a view of the harbor , my boat and 20 ? magnolia tree . Ca n't beat that , though I do n't know how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I do enjoy working from home sometimes , I really prefer coffee shops . Being at home , still brings the mental nudges of just quickly " doing laundry " or " snacking too much " , etc . <p> Something about having people around ( even though I 'm an introvert ) , subconsciously holds me accountable to playing around less while on the laptop and getting stuff done . <p> To make 2012 the best year yet , I 'm focusing on branding myself more , instead of trying to segment marketing efforts for several different online businesses . I figure , being seen as a real person with multiple interests and business is more interesting at the end of the day as a one man show . In the event some marketing messages are not 100% relevant to all audiences is OK , since hearing all too similar messages from someone can turn into a broken , one- sided record . <p> Best of luck in the New Year and with your new office , you have a nice view ! <p> I hear you on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about around town in various locations , too . Although I 'd say probably 60% of my time is spent working from home now . With the other 40% spread across coffee shops , resorts and the L2S Facility . <p> Happy New Year to you , and all the best for 2012 . I 'm sure you 're gon na rip it up this year ! <p> I love the new set up , especially the view I 'm quite with you on that . We have just moved house as well and I 've just completed setting up everything . Although its a bit smaller than previous home offices I 've had I chose the room because of the great view overlooking a park . A view makes an amazing amount of difference . I agree paperless is the way forward which Is why I have a scanner on my desk . <p> Due to the roof line I ca n't get my white board on the wall which is annoying , but at least it 's in the room ! <p> That was great . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said " The additional desk space is a major factor in this , as I like to spread things out in front of me when I work . Not only that , but the huge whiteboard is a game changer as far as I 'm concerned , especially for mind-mapping " . I hope more people discover your blog because you really know what you 're talking about . Ca n't wait to read more from you ! <p> Love your view , one of the first things I noticed while looking at homes in that area is that it 's so darn quiet . The normal day to day noise is virtually eliminated in that area , at least from what I 'm used to hearing every day here in Cebu . <p> Going to the same barbershop , some of your staff being my wife 's friends , and now you purchasing a house in the same area I 'm looking at is quite a coincidence . <p> I love peace and quiet -- anywhere . It 's one of the reasons why I liked the Singapore Botanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent in that place ... if I enjoyed camping , that is ( which I do nt ! ) . <p> I understand what it means to have a space that is set up for your needs . You mentioned that the house was built on feng shui principles . Are there any feng shui principles on the specific room that you chose for your home office ? <p> As far as I know there is n't any feng shui in the actual room itself -- I 'm not all that ' into ' feng shui , although I respect it and the beliefs behind it . The house was actually built from scratch by a very traditional Chinese family , hence the original roots . But , it would be interesting for me to look into it a little , in regards to the room -- to see if I lucked in to doing it by accident ! <p> Chris , the view from your office is amazing ! ! I know you 've worked really hard to get to where you are and I think it 's great you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day I 'll make have my own REAL office and would love to share it with others like you 've done . Awesome job , man . <p> Your home office is looking quite nice . I 've also considered getting a whiteboard as it 's nice to keep things all organized in one place . Another thing I 've used lately to manage my projects is Trello ... I 'd recommend it . <p> It 's nice to see other Internet marketers using Macs , as it 's getting easier these days to do Internet marketing with online based software . <p> A really cool post on the importance of having a good home office and yes feng-shui does help a lot . However I must say the video was not there when I checked up this page and hence unable to see and feel how the room looks . Do check it out . <p> Yes Chris , maybe the video is not loading in my browser . I checked up at Youtube and the video is cool . Great sharing .

##1108351 <p> Whether we admit it or not , we worked very hard to earn money . We worked hard to become financially independent . Buy the necessary things in life -basic necessities , and of course that includes a house , maybe a car , consumer items , and pay for things like insurances , healthcare , and school tuition . Moreover , as we want to be more comfortable in our lives , we want to be able to buy all the luxuries that we could afford -jewelries , another car , pay for travel , pay for our hobbies , and perhaps , a vacation house . <p> These are the reasons why people are working so hard . Lucky are those people who gets to have financial independence . But , sometimes , because of overspending or that people 's wants are never satisfied , they get to overshoot on their expenses . In the end they 're deluged with too many bills to pay . Their monthly earnings are not enough to cover mortgages and other due payments . They 're faced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not something people with huge debts can accede to . If there are more logical choice to do other than filing for one , people would prefer not to . But , to begin the process of restructuring loans and other obligations , which , by the way , people in debt can not avoid , it 's wisest to file bankruptcy . But to do this legal process , people must do it right . <p> Image from Google <p> There are highly specialized people like the bankruptcy attorneys at the Law Offices of John T Orcutt who could provide legal expertise on the matter regarding bankruptcy . Bankruptcy is a tedious process particularly for us ordinary citizens . There could be matters we may not fully understand . And , remember , it is our lives that are at stake here . Our income , our investments , our home and other real estate properties perhaps . Assets that we have worked hard to come into reality . For all these things , it merits a wise decision on our part . Because , one negligent act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers may act in our behalf . They will make sure we 're doing the right decisions and give expert advises on matters we may find incomprehensible . <p> Start the process right . After all , there 's more to life after the . <p> This is a sponsored post however , all the points and views are my own . <p> I know . I know . Painting project is not yet finished . It 's almost , by the way . And my thoughts are in the garden . Since when ? Yesterday . <p> As I tended my drying lawn ( it 's the dry season here ) , before dusk yesterday , my thoughts are running wild into revamping the little corner of our small garden into something like this ... <p> Image is from a small resto here in our place <p> It 's a simple project consisting of colored stones arranged artfully to make it more appealing to the eyes . Few plants are simply placed to create a more natural look . Water feature cascading very slowly from above ... looks refreshing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zen-like garden is it invites a lot of mosquitoes at night . Dengue beware . Better think of a remedy . <p> I 'm making a post about this so I would be inspire to start the project as soon as we 've finished with the current one . <p> I remember when we were planning on building our own house , the husband and me had to search out every available contractor in town that will surely understand our needs . A small but roomy and functional home like those we have seen at ReMax Kansas City that will be within our budget . I caught the contractor letting out a wry smile . Impossible he must thought . With prices of building materials and the cost of labor , how could we ever have our dream home be as roomy and functional on a tight budget . <p> Planning . <p> By the time our engagement was known to both our families , me and the husband ( boyfriend then ) had long been planning of what our lives be when we stepped into the married life . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have when we build our house ? <p> Citing all the elements necessary in building a family , we have drawn out our dream home . Taking into account all the necessary spaces should be allowed to manifest . What is home without its room for everyone to grow and have privacy . What is a home without a living room for family members to communicate during idle times and to welcome guests , too . What is a home without dining room that even so small , it can be a separate area for enjoying family mealtime . What is a home without a kitchen ? Cramp and tight as it is as long as it can serve its purpose . Very well . <p> Planning every nook and cranny as we envision our home to be as we hope to . That 's probably the most important aspect how we came to justify to the contractor our budget allocation . <p> Price . <p> As soon as we set on our plan , construction was set out accordingly as to the price agreed upon . Nothing less because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and durability . Cost of materials may vary from time to time , we need to be adjusted . And most of all , we could n't care to go overboard on our budget . Even if it means I could n't get the attic I ever dreamed about , it 's not likely going to happen . Stick to the plan . By doing so , we can get to stick to the price . <p> Building a home is not easy . With today 's rising cost of materials and labor , it 's no wonder there are couples or families who opt to rent out because they could n't afford purchasing or building their dream homes . I say , with proper planning and savings , the dream is not too . <p> This is a sponsored post however , all the points and views are my own . <p> I could n't take my eyes off this living room arrangement . Pale yellow walls with white paints in architectural cornices on the windows . Indeed , it was the idea why I turned our room into yellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the soft yellows , the orange couch with brightly colored throw pillows as accent was what kept this room warm yet lively . Moreover , I so love the boldly colored printed rug on the floor . <p> Geez ! Ca n't wait to start decorating our home . I could not afford the affluence in this image , but , I am sooo loving the orange accent . <p> A business operation does not end with organized and careful planning nor with having competent employees . For a business to run effectively and have sustainability to obtain its goals , all functions must be taken into consideration and make sure that all is working in synergy to maintain its operation . <p> Employees , even those highly skilled and competitive ones will likely become more productive in a working area where there is cleanliness and organization . A well-organized space invites a homey feeling and this addresses the employees to perform better with their respective duties and responsibilities . Moreover , a clean environment infuses positive vibes which result in an employee achieving maximum performance . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in an untidy office space ? Maintaining the working space neat and clean is one aspect that every business endeavor should give strict compliance to . As mentioned , a clean environment is akin to positive business results . To start gaining these positive results , businesses and other establishments should hire commercial janitorial services to make sure that their offices are well-maintained and organized . They will perform all cleaning solution and techniques -making sure that floors are clutter free and is safe to walk in , making sure that furniture and fixtures are in optimal cleanliness , taking into effect that garbage are disposed properly , and cleaning the windows , too . They have the best methods in cleaning technology . The reason why most businesses hire one . <p> These commercial janitorial services are the best in what they do . Ever wonder how the office cleaning Dallas does their job ? They are very professional and skilled in what they do . Every one had undergone proper cleaning training program and received hands-on training aside from the usual classroom lectures . They are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper cleanliness and disposal is maintained . <p> Before I get to buy davidoff cigars as a gift for my friend 's husband 's birthday , I had the free time today to put on few pieces of decor stuff on the newly constructed " faux fireplace " in our room . <p> I had to have more space for me to put on my candles , in different colors and that porcelain jar in the right corner . I 'm sure the husband will ever forgive me for " relocating " our wedding photo . <p> In lieu of our photo , I did placed in a cross stitch which I sewed years ago . I particularly loved that project which shows a lover sitting near a bonfire and their silhouettes make a great impact against the moonlight and the snow-capped peak from afar . It 's just so romantic . It 's one of my favorite DIY 's . <p> For now , I 'm happy with how the " mantle " turned out . But hey ! It 's Christmas ... I was hoping I could add in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally finding the green color that I prefer for our family/entertainment room . As again , sorry for the blurry iPod photo . In reality , both greens are deeper and rich . I believed the colors suit the tone/theme of the room . To make the room a little brighter , and more fresher <p> This room is ready for occupancy But since the painter 's not yet done on the living room , I decided not to move in the fixtures . Not until this weekend . Will be very busy by then . <p> Will have a peek tomorrow of the kitchen area specially the ceiling and the hanging cabinets . Could n't keep off my excitement . <p> Aside from achieving a warm and cozier bedroom , one of the things we have considered in planning the redo of the master 's bedroom is adding more and more storage units in the room . One is the addition of a shelving unit to accommodate the one we purchased at cheap auralex at Musicians friend . It will fill out one shelving unit where the flat screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed in one shelving unit . It shall be make the room more organize . <p> After a disastrous take on the yellow color I wanted for our room , I never wanted to try my luck again coming to a paint shop to ask for their mixing services . <p> Aside from not achieving the color tone I really wanted , the paint itself is " mediocre " in appearance . it lacks the gloss I ask . More importantly , it needs at least three coats of paint to cover the walls . Even if it is just a repaint . <p> Now , that is not too economical . <p> Whereas , when we hired a " real painter " , he recommends the best brand of paints to use . He may command a loftier professional fee than his competitors . Definitely , it is worth it . Considering his expertise in mixing 
##1110052 <h> other Information : <h> Dilophosaurus <p> The Dilophosaurus ( the two crested lizard ) is a curious dinosaur . Very little is known about it and its strange , but alluring , crests . Most people know this beast from the first Jurassic Park movie , where it was inaccurately depicted as a small scavanger which had a frill neck and venomous spit . In reality , it was a much larger beast , had no frill and there is no evidence to support that it spat venom . Due to these errors , I decided to take the official Jurassic Park model kit of the Dilophosaurus and modify it into something a little more ' accurate ' than most people realise . <p> I recently picked this kit up , used , off of eBay for next to nothing . It was ideal as I was after a cheap kit for for my first attempt at modifying a Dinosaur model kit ( did n't want to ruin an expensive kit if I could n't do it ! ) . <p> I began by reading up extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Rimmel 's excellent Dinosaur Model book which I also picked up from eBay ) . I decided to remove the frill and change the overall neck and head positions at the same time . Using some wire , I angled the neck the way I wanted then filled it up with styrene off-cuts . For the head , I repeated the same process but closed the mouth by removing the teeth and filling in under the jaw . I also changed the position of the arms and hands in a similar manner - wire was threaded through the arm and body then it was positioned , then fixed into place with some CA Glue . <p> The gaps were filled in with Milliput Epoxy putty and the texture of the skin returned with the aid of some texture stamps ( made from Super Sculpey ) and some wax carving tools . This was the most time consuming part of the build as it was very fine and detailed work . <p> Painting involved an inital layer of Desert Yellow , then a layer of Park Green on the top half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the feet , hands and around the edges of the green were done with Nato Black . This was all topped off with a wash of Burnt Umber and Burnt Sienna , and a dry brush of a custom light blue and Sky . It was all sealed in with a top coat and a final flat coat . <p> For the base , I used real twigs from a tree in my yard to make the trees . These were sprayed with Spray Adhesive and sprinkled with some herbs from the kitchen pantry . They were fixed in place by threading a small brass rod up into them ( via a hole made with my pin vise ) and fixed into the board via a hole filled with CA Glue . I made the ground of the base in a similar way to the one I made for the Raptor . Air clay was layed down , sprayed brown and green , coated with green Flock and topped with herbs to give it a ' Autumn ' look . <p> Overall , the modifications came out well and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit . There are a few more Dinosaurs to come - next one might even be a resin kit !

##1116552 <h> A Coward <h> BY GUY de MAUPASSANT <p> An orphan , and possessed of an adequate income , he cut a dash , as the saying is . He had a good figure and a good carriage , a sufficient flow of words to pass for wit , a certain natural grace , an air of nobility and pride , a gallant moustache and an eloquent eye , attributes which women like . <p> He was in demand in drawing-rooms , sought after for valses , and in men he inspired that smiling hostility which is reserved for vital and attractive rivals . He had been suspected of several love-affairs of a sort calculated to create a good opinion of a youngster . He lived a happy , care-free life , in the most complete well-being of body and mind . He was known to be a fine swordsman and a still finer shot with the pistol . <p> " When I come to fight a duel , " he would say , " I shall choose pistols . With that weapon , I 'm sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the theatre with two ladies , quite young , friends of his , whose husbands were also of the party , and after the performance he invited them to take ices at Tortoni 's . <p> They had been sitting there for a few minutes when he noticed a gentleman at a neighbouring table staring obstinately at one of the ladies of the party . She seemed embarrassed and ill at ease , and bent her head . At last she said to her husband : <p> " There 's a man staring at me . I do n't know him ; do you ? " <p> The husband , who had seen nothing , raised his eyes , but declared : <p> " No , not in the least . " <p> Half smiling , half in anger , she replied : <p> " It 's very annoying ; the creature 's spoiling my ice . " <p> Her husband shrugged his shoulders . <p> " Deuce take him , do n't appear to notice it . If we had to deal with all the discourteous people one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But the Viscount had risen abruptly . He could not permit this stranger to spoil an ice of his giving . It was to him that the insult was addressed , since it was at his invitation and on his account that his friends had come to the cafe . The affair was no business of anyone but himself . <p> He went up to the man and said : <p> " You have a way of looking at those ladies , sir , which I can not stomach . Please be so good as to set a limit to your persistence . " <p> " You hold your tongue , " replied the other . <p> " Take care , sir , " retorted the Viscount , clenching his teeth ; " you 'll force me to overstep the bounds of common politeness . " <p> The gentleman replied with a single word , a vile word which rang across the cafe from one end to the other , and , like the release of a spring , jerked every person present into an abrupt movement . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest raised their heads ; three waiters spun round on their heels like tops ; the two ladies behind the counter started , then the whole upper half of their bodies twisted round , as though they were a couple of automata worked by the same handle . <p> There was a profound silence . Then suddenly a sharp noise resounded in the air . The Viscount had boxed his adversary 's ears . Every one rose to intervene . Cards were exchanged . <p> Back in his home , the Viscount walked for several minutes up and down his room with long quick strides . He was too excited to think . A solitary idea dominated his mind : " a duel " ; but as yet the idea stirred in him no emotion of any kind . He had done what he was compelled to do ; he had shown himself to be what he ought to be . People would talk of it , would approve of him , congratulate him . He repeated aloud , speaking as a man speaks in severe mental distress : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he sat down and began to reflect . In the morning he must find seconds . Whom should he choose ? He searched his mind for the most important and celebrated names of his acquaintance . At last he decided on the Marquis de la Tour-Noire and Colonel Bourdin , an aristocrat and a soldier ; they would do excellently . Their names would look well in the papers . He realised that he was thirsty , and drank three glasses of water one after the other ; then he began to walk up and down again . He felt full of energy . If he played the gallant , showed himself determined , insisted on the most strict and dangerous arrangements , demanded a serious duel , a thoroughly serious duel , a positively terrible duel , his adversary would probably retire and apologist . <p> He took up once more the card which he had taken from his pocket and thrown down upon the table , and read it again as he had read it before , in the cafe , at a glance , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way home . <p> " Georges Lamil , 51 rue Moncey . " Nothing more . <p> He examined the grouped letters ; they seemed to him mysterious , full of confused meaning . Georges Lamil ? Who was this man ? What did he do ? Why had he looked at the woman in that way ? Was it not revolting that a stranger , an unknown man , could thus disturb a man 's life , without warning , just because he chose to fix his insolent eyes upon a woman ? Again the Viscount repeated aloud : <p> " What a hound ! " <p> Then he remained standing stock-still , lost in thought , his eyes still fixed upon the card . A fury against this scrap of paper awoke in him , a fury of hatred in which was mingled a queer sensation of uneasiness . This sort of thing was so stupid ! He took up an open knife which lay close at hand and thrust it through the middle of the printed name , as though he had stabbed a man . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols ? --for he regarded himself as the insulted party . With swords there would be less risk , but with pistols there was a chance that his adversary might withdraw . It is very rare that a duel with swords is fatal , for mutual prudence is apt to restrain combatants from engaging at sufficiently close quarters for a point to penetrate deeply . With pistols he ran a grave risk of death ; but he might also extricate himself from the affair with all the honours of the situation and without actually coming to a meeting . <p> " I must be firm , " he said . " He will take fright . " <p> The sound of his voice set him trembling , and he looked round . He felt very nervous . He drank another glass of water , then began to undress for bed . <p> As soon as he was in bed , he blew out the light and closed his eyes . <p> " I 've the whole of to-morrow , " he thought , " in which to set my affairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be quite calm . " <p> He was very warm in the blankets , but he could not manage to compose himself to sleep . He turned this way and that , lay for five minutes upon his back , turned on to his left side , then rolled over on to his right . <p> He was still thirsty . He got up to get a drink . A feeling of uneasiness crept over him : <p> " Is it possible that I 'm afraid ? " <p> Why did his heart beat madly at each familiar sound in his room ? When the clock was about to strike , the faint squeak of the rising spring made him start ; so shaken he was that for several seconds afterwards he had to open his mouth to get his breath . <p> He began to reason with himself on the possibility of his being afraid . <p> " Shall I be afraid ? " <p> No , of course he would not be afraid , since he was resolved to see the matter through , and had duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he felt so profoundly distressed that he wondered : <p> " Can a man be afraid in spite of himself ? " <p> He was attacked by this doubt , this uneasiness , this terror ; suppose a force more powerful than himself , masterful , irresistible , overcame him , what would happen ? Yes , what might not happen ? Assuredly he would go to the place of the meeting , since he was quite ready to go . But supposing he trembled ? Supposing he fainted ? He thought of the scene , of his reputation , his good name . <p> There came upon him a strange need to get up and look at himself in the mirror . He relit his candle . When he saw his face reflected in the polished glass , he scarcely recognised it , it seemed to him as though he had never yet seen himself . His eyes looked to him enormous ; and he was pale ; yes , without doubt he was pale , very pale . <p> He remained standing in front of the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain the state of his health , and abruptly the thought struck him like a bullet : <p> " The day after to-morrow , at this very hour , I may be dead . " <p> His heart began again its furious beating . <p> " The day after to-morrow , at this very hour , I may be dead . This person facing me , this me I see in the mirror , will be no more . Why , here I am , I look at myself , I feel myself alive , and in twenty-four hours I shall be lying in that bed , dead , my eyes closed , cold , inanimate , vanished . " <p> He turned back towards the bed , and distinctly saw himself lying on his back in the very sheets he had just left . He had the hollow face of a corpse , his hands had the slackness of hands that will never make another movement . <p> At that he was afraid of his bed , and , to get rid of the sight of it , went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit it , and began to walk up and down again . He was cold ; he went to the bell to wake his valet ; but he stopped , even as he raised his hand to the rope . <p> " He will see that I am afraid . " <p> He did not ring ; he lit the fire . His hands shook a little , with a nervous tremor , whenever they touched anything . His brain whirled , his troubled thoughts became elusive , transitory , and gloomy ; his mind suffered all the effects of intoxication , as though he were actually drunk . <p> Over and over again he thought : <p> " What shall I do ? What is to become of me ? " <p> His whole body trembled , seized with a jerky shuddering ; he got up and , going to the window , drew back the curtains . <p> Dawn was at hand , a summer dawn . The rosy sky touched the town , its roofs and walls , with its own hue . A broad descending ray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened world ; and with the light , hope--a gay , swift , fierce hope--filled the Viscount 's heart ! Was he mad , that he had allowed himself to be struck down by fear , before anything was settled even , before his seconds had seen those of this Georges Lamil , before he knew whether he was going to fight ? <p> He washed , dressed , and walked out with a firm step . <p> He repeated to himself , as he walked : <p> " I must be energetic , very energetic . I must prove that I am not afraid . " <p> His seconds , the Marquis and the Colonel , placed themselves at his disposal , and after hearty handshakes discussed the conditions . <p> " You are anxious for a serious duel ? " asked the Colonel . <p> " Yes , a very serious one , " replied the Viscount . <p> " You still insist on pistols ? " said the Marquis . <p> " Yes . " <p> " You will leave us free to arrange the rest ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " Twenty paces ; at the signal , raising the arm , and not lowering it . Exchange of shots till one is seriously wounded . " <p> " They are excellent conditions , " declared the Colonel in a tone of satisfaction . " You shoot well , you have every chance . " <p> They departed . The Viscount went home to wait for them . His agitation , momentarily quietened , was now growing minute by minute . He felt a strange shivering , a ceaseless vibration , down his arms , down his legs , in his chest ; he could not keep still in one place , neither seated nor standing . There was not the least moistening of saliva in his mouth , and at every instant he made a violent movement of his tongue , as though to prevent it sticking to his palate . <p> He was eager to have breakfast , but could not eat . Then the idea came to him to drink in order to give himself courage , and he sent for a decanter of rum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . <p> A burning warmth flooded through his body , followed immediately by a sudden dizziness of the mind and spirit . <p> " Now I know what to do , " he thought . " Now it is all right . " <p> But by the end of an hour he had emptied the decanter , and his state of agitation had once more become intolerable . He was conscious of a wild need to roll on the ground , to scream , to bite . Night was falling . <p> The ringing of a bell gave him such a shock that he had not strength to rise and welcome his seconds . <p> He did not even dare to speak to them , to say " Good evening " to them , to utter a single word , for fear they guessed the whole thing by the alteration in his voice . <p> " Everything is arranged in accordance with the conditions you fixed , " observed the Colonel . " At first your adversary claimed the privileges of the insulted party , but he yielded almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two military men . " <p> " Thank you , " said the Viscount . <p> " Pardon us , " interposed the Marquis , " if we merely come in and leave again immediately , but we have a thousand things to see to . We must have a good doctor , since the combat is not to end until a serious wound is inflicted , and you know that pistol bullets are no laughing-matter . We must appoint the ground , near a house to which we may carry the wounded man if necessary , etc . In fact , we shall be occupied for two or three hours arranging all that there is to arrange . " <p> " Thank you , " said the Viscount a second time . <p> " You are all right ? " asked the Colonel . " You are calm ? " <p> " Yes , quite calm , thank you . " <p> The two men retired . <p> When he realised that he was once more alone , he thought that he was going mad . His servant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to write letters . After tracing , at the head of a sheet : " This is my will , " he rose shivering and walked away , feeling incapable of connecting two ideas , of taking a resolution , of making any decision whatever . <p> So he was going to fight ! He could no longer avoid it . Then what was the matter with him ? He wished to fight , he had absolutely decided upon this plan of action and taken his resolve , and he now felt clearly , in spite of every effort of mind and forcing of will , that he could not retain even the strength necessary to get him to the place of meeting . He tried to picture the duel , his own attitude and the bearing of his adversary . <p> From time to time his teeth chattered in his mouth with a slight clicking noise . He tried to read , and took down Chateauvillard 's code of duelling . Then he wondered : <p> " Does my adversary go to shooting-galleries ? Is he well known ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He bethought himself of Baron Vaux 's book on marksmen with the pistol , and ran through it from end to end . Georges Lamil was not mentioned in it . Yet if the man were not a good shot , he would surely not have promptly agreed to that dangerous weapon and those fatal conditions ? <p> He opened , in passing , a case by Gastinne Renette standing on a small table , and took out one of the pistols , then placed himself as though to shoot and raised his arm . But he was trembling from head to foot and the barrel moved in every direction . <p> At that , he said to himself : <p> " It 's impossible . I can not fight in this state . " <p> He looked at the end of the barrel , at the little , black , deep hole that spits death ; he thought of the disgrace , of the whispers at the club , of the laughter in drawing-rooms , of the contempt of women , of the allusions in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He was still looking at the weapon , and , raising the hammer , caught a glimpse of a cap gleaming beneath it like a tiny red flame ; By good fortune or forgetfulness , the pistol had been left loaded . At the knowledge , he was filled with a confused inexplicable sense of joy . <p> If , when face to face with the other man , he did not show a proper gallantry and calm , he would be lost for ever . He would be sullied , branded with a mark of infamy , hounded out of society . And he would not be able to achieve that calm , that swaggering poise ; he knew it , he felt it . Yet he was brave , since he wanted to fight I ... He was brave , since .... <p> The thought which hovered in him did not even fulfil itself in his mind ; but , opening his mouth wide , he thrust in the barrel of his pistol with savage gesture until it reached his throat , and pressed on the trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the report , he found him lying dead upon his back .

##1124050 <p> Sloth is spiritual laziness , although it includes laziness of the body too . It is caused by a certain lack of trust in God and makes us indifferent in the use of the means necessary for our sanctification . It is an aversion to spiritual effort , which leads to the neglect of grace . Its worst effect is to make us put off our return to God after mortal sin . How many souls who have neglected their Easter duty , or have fallen away from the Church , go on , year after year , endangering their salvation because they can not break the bonds of sloth ! <p> Sloth resides in our mind and will and is the most dangerous of all vices because it makes us refuse to co-operate with grace . Sloth inclines us to habits of sin and leads us to despair of breaking away from their slavery . It may thus lead us to final impenitence and the loss of our soul . <p> Countless venial sins result from our lukewarmness , tepidity and indifference in God 's service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find ourselves caught in a net , which we have , no will to break . <p> We can recognize how sloth affects us by our faint-heartedness in spiritual matters ; by our sluggish will ; by our procrastination or putting things off until another time ; by our dissipation and useless work , which is a sort of feverish activity that distracts us and does not allow time to attend to the needs of our soul ; by our seeking bodily ease and comfort ; by our idleness , or doing no good at all . <p> Sloth leads us to neglect the duties of our state . It makes us give up trying to carry out our resolutions . It makes us low-spirited and sad , because we know we are not using our graces . It makes us do things with a grumbling , grudging spirit because we are not generous in giving ourselves . It inclines us to much talking , because we do not want to call ourselves to account , and so we dissipate our spiritual forces and put off our " conversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Our Lord in the Gospel of St. Matthew ( 25:14-30 ) , warns us of the dangers and sterility of sloth , and its end : Hell . <p> There are three chief forms of sloth : occupation with unnecessary things , which has been sufficiently touched upon above in explaining how we divert ourselves in this way so we have no time to listen to the voice of conscience ; distraction ; and spiritual melancholy . <p> Distraction destroys our recollection in prayer , leads us to fulfill our spiritual exercises without zeal and attention , and fills us with an overpowering weariness so that we postpone what we should do here and now . We see only an intolerable burden in our duties -- not the privilege of doing them for God and storing up eternal merit in Heaven . <p> Spiritual melancholy , or depression , is a secret anger with ourselves and a species of self-love . Because of it , we have no courage to break with our faults and imperfections , with our habits of sin , and we feel a sense of despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To get away from our inner conflict and anxiety , we turn to creatures and become preoccupied with unnecessary things , while we continue in our state of lukewarmess , procrastination and mediocrity or sin . <p> Our spiritual melancholy gives the devil power over our soul and is a condition of soul that easily leads to many grievous sins . It weakens and hinders the effects of the Sacraments . It makes the salutary means of the spiritual life act like poison . We can not find God , and our unhappiness increases , though we are not really so much concerned with finding God as with finding His consolations . His will and His honor do not matter to us so much as our desires and our reputation . Our goal is not God , but our own spiritual peace or progress ; that is , a spiritualized " self-seeking . " We have lost sight of our true end and the way to it . <p> Father Faber says of this condition of soul : " Sadness is a sort of spiritual disability . A melancholy man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . God has rather to wait upon him as his Infirmarian that he to wait on God as His Father and King ... There is no moral imbecility so great as that of querulousness and sentimentality . He who lies down at full length on life as if it were a sickbed -- poor , languishing soul , what will he ever do for God ? " <p> Today , sloth often goes by the name of " escapism . " The person who is the victim of sloth realizes he is in a spiritual fog and may try to blame it on spiritual dryness or some other cause , when it is an inaction of the will which destroys love . <p> We may flounder through a lifetime and never recognize that what is keeping us from spiritual advancement is sloth . No one will know how many are dept away from the Sacraments , or from daily Mass and Holy Communion , by sloth . No one can judge how much the spiritual and corporal works of mercy , upon which we are to be judged , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vice works havoc in countless ways . <p> Even the sloth of mind which makes us neglect to occupy our intellect with useful things or serious work is very dangerous , because a mind that is not so occupied tends to evil , and nothing stops its rapid descent . Our mind may be occupied with culpable thoughts even when our body is busy . On the other hand , sloth of body , or idleness and inactivity , may lead to a thousand temptations which we will be unable to resist because of the weakness and sluggishness of our will , sleeping in the inaction of sloth . <p> We must fly sloth because it prevents us from working out our salvation ; because it is the parent of many evils . If we sow nothing , we shall reap nothing . Life is short , and the years are few for meriting the eternal joys of Heaven . We must follow the example of Our Lord who won the glory of Heaven by toils and penances , by His Passion and Cross . To fail to store up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail to do penance for our sins is to prepare ourselves for a long Purgatory ; and to fail in attaining our eternal salvation is to fail utterly and reap the eternal woe of damnation . <p> Diligence or zeal in working for God and the good of souls is the virtue contrary to sloth . It brings ease and joy in fulfilling our religious duties . The light of faith is nourished with the oil of good works . It enables us to avoid many

##1125652 <h> About the artist behind All You Have To Do Tab : <p> Brothers Nic Cester and Chris Cester grew up in Dingley Village , Victoria listening to classic rock from the 1960s and 1970s such as The Who , AC/DC , The Easybeats , Faces , The Loved Ones and particularly The Rolling Stones and The Beatles ; these were their father 's records . <p> " It 's always interpreted that our father had a great record collection , but that 's not true . It was actually a really shit collection that Nic managed to find the gems in " , Chris said in an interview for the documentary " Take It Or Leave It " that was also recorded on the band 's Right ! Right ! Right ! live DVD . <p> They decided to form a band with Cameron Muncey , Nic 's friend from school and with whom he had been in a band , and with bassist Doug Armstrong whom Nic and Chris met whilst working together at their Dad 's spice factory . <p> During 2001 an old high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was at this time that the band took their current name from the song " Jet " from Wings ' 1973 album Band on the Run . " Radio Song " , from their album Get Born , was written about the troubles that the band had getting recognition at this time . <p> The new band met Mark Wilson one night in 2002 at a concert and , despite already having a bass player , asked him to play with them . Wilson was then the bassist in a band called The Ca$inos , so he initially declined . However , a few days later he called the band and said he would like to join them instead . <p> In 2002 the band , consisting of its current members , released the Dirty Sweet EP , which drew its name from the T.

Elektra Records offered the band a contract and re-released Dirty Sweet in 2003 . <p> Jet entered the Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles with Dave Sardy to produce their debut album Get Born . Sardy had previously produced records for Marilyn Manson and The Dandy Warhols . They also enlisted the services of keyboard maestro Billy Preston for two of the songs . The album derived its name from a line in the Bob Dylan song " Subterranean Homesick Blues " from Bringing It All Back Home . Halfway through recording , the band received a call from The Rolling Stones offering them a support slot on the Australian leg of their 2003 tour . <p> Their singles " Are You Gon na Be My Girl " and " Rollover DJ " were voted number one and number nineteen respectively on the 2003 Triple J Hottest 100 .

It was also part of two major worldwide advertising campaigns for Apple 's iPod and Vodafone . Get Born also includes the song " Timothy " , dedicated to vocalist/guitarist Cameron Muncey 's brother , who died before he was born . Due to the sensitive nature of the song , the band rarely plays " Timothy " live. citation needed <p> In early 2004 , Jet teamed up with The Vines and The Living End on " the Aussie invasion " tour of US cities . A new Jet song not included on Get Born , called " Hold On " , was featured on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack that year . TV/film producer J.J. Abrams - whose credits include Lost and Felicity - contacted Jet to record a song for the Season 4 premiere to his show Alias .

The song also appeared on NME ' s compilation CD , NME : The Essential Bands - Festival Edition . <p> Jet played at the MTV Europe Awards in Copenhagen .

This crack allows molten rock and other hot materials to be thrown out from the earth . <p> The rock inside the earth 's mantle is very hot , but solid because of the great pressure on it . When the pressure upon some of this solid rock is reduced or there is an escape route through a crack , the rock becomes a liquid called magma . <p> The magma is forced up and then spurts out of the crack . Gases , often poisonous is also forced out.When the magma come to the surface , it is called lava . <p> Volcanoes erupt differently . Some erupt quietly and the lava flows down the side of the volcano and some are more violent . <p> The opening in the top of the volcano is called a crater . Some craters are filled with water and become lakes such as the Crater Lake in Oregon . <p> Most volcanoes occur in the same area as two earthquake belts . @ @ @ @ @ @
