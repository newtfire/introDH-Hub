##1200950 <h> Search <p> Hassan Rilwan is a man who speaks very gently but , this does not hide the intelligence that comes to play once engaged in a discussion . Rilwan , group managing director of Focal Point Group and publisher of the popular Abuja-based magazine , Sardauna , spoke to Adedayo Odulaja recently about his life , ideals and business strategies . <p> You recently got married . How is married life like ? <p> It 's been quite interesting . I have a lot of friends who used to tell me I was missing so much being single but I never appreciated what they meant until I got married . It has been a wonderful experience and if this is what being married is all about , then it is worth the while . I am enjoying it . <p> How did you meet your wife ? <p> Practically , I went for her in the sense that I met her through my sister . They attended the same university and we used to tease my sister about her inability to introduce one of her numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a family joke but , going through her pictures on facebook one day , I saw this beautiful lady and asked to know her . We sorted it out there and got in touch through that sister of mine who is also a very good friend of her own elder sister . <p> We began to communicate ; I told her right there I was reaching out to her because I desired to marry her . Since she did n't know me , I urge her to open a channel through which we can get to know and see each other . Naturally , she found that quite strange and reacted to it negatively but since I was so sure of what I wanted , I made her understand the need for her to consider my proposal from a different perspective ; she did and we are married today . <p> Your profile has a striking fact : that you have never sought employment before . How true ? <p> Well , I have been into entrepreneurship from secondary school , I started managing businesses at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while at the university I co-founded a very big eatery confectionery in my home town in Zaria , Kaduna state . Then I started a student magazine which after graduation , I decided to continue with the leadership and development magazine and it was a hit project . I had the vision of what I wanted to be to the world . I also ventured into Dry Cleaning as a means of diversifying the business port folio and currently , we have one of the best dry cleaning outfits in the FCT . <p> What actually did you study in the university ? <p> I studied Mechanical Engineering at Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria . <p> Any correlation between Engineering and publishing ? <p> Yea , I think my venturing into a magazine is more of a passion , the magazine affords me the opportunity to express my opinions about leadership which I am very passionate about . It also offers me an avenue to create a platform for other people to be involved in our leadership and political issues . I am very happy about that platform which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone towards my engineering career . I actually studied the course because I needed to learn something while pursuing my real passion . <p> I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur because it aids one 's level of reasoning and analytical ability . Besides , engineering is about processes so I think it has come to bear on what I do . I am very analytical in my application to my businesses . Entrepreneurship is all about risk taking and if you do n't have that confidence you will always want to be in your comfort zone . As a young man , I got my hands burnt severally . But when one learns and fails , it affords one an opportunity to know how not to do that again and it makes one a better person . <p> There is a part of you that is into community and charity causes . How did that passion come about ? <p> Well , I think that also has to do with my growing up . I grew up in the midst of the Almajiris , ( lowlife in the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and a whole lot of people come from different places . Our neighbor attracted lots of students then from Sokoto , Niger and other States in the north . <p> Some of them used to stay in our garage overnight , eat and sleep . It afforded me the opportunity to be very close to them and I grew up with them , so to say . I found out that they were people who have n't been given the opportunity to try because of the failed leadership of the country . <p> The current head of my poultry unit was one of them . Through my interaction with them I have come to understand that when you look at the Almajiri system , it 's actually a noble concept of education but which , has been bastardized and heavily misunderstood within the Nigerian system . <p> This is a structure that operates perfectly in Indonesia and some other countries . It is similar to the boarding school system . <p> When one finishes primary school , you go into secondary to seek for knowledge and the way this should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of by society . That is the structure ; not having them beg on the streets for cash or alms . <p> Today , it has been bastardized by some mallams who use them for cheap labour . Today they do n't learn any longer but spend more time on the streets begging . <p> So it is something that requires serious proposition and in the context of the old western education ; which is somewhat alien to northern Nigeria . The north can not continue to operate this system today in the world where western education is an integral factor of sustainability . <p> Just like every other thing in life , the Almajiri system is supposed to have been developed into a scheme that combines Islamic and Western education This is where we missed it as a nation and in the northern part of the country particularly . It is imperative for government , private individuals like us to step in to correct the defect . <p> There is the need to merge the Islamic education with western education as a way of sanitizing the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just witnessed , is there any political dream ? <p> A lot of people have asked me that question especially against the background of the magazine I publish . People think once you go into the media business , you are trying to use it as a means to achieve something . I can not say no to politics but I can tell you categorically I am not doing what I 'm doing because I am preparing myself for politics . <p> All I want to do is , be a change leader and I have discovered two avenues to achieve that , one is entrepreneurship and through it , by the special grace of God , I am creating employments for people and I am determined to continue doing that . <p> Currently , I have close to about 50 people working in various enterprises and they earn a living as such . When you now look at the child destitution thing , I feel if you ask me what is my greatest assets on earth , I would say it is my child destitution school and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that these are kids I do n't have any lineage or blood relations with , children that were condemned to the streets , I thank God . <p> Today , we have the school and they live in that school , they eat their three square meals and attend their classes there . I am looking forward to a day when I am going to be able to produce governors and senators . So I have seen two channels through which I can impact on the society I do n't have to be a politician to impact on the society

##1204752 <h> What If There 's No Hell ? By Rudolf Ogoo Okonkwo <p> Chances are that every blessed day in Nigeria , a young girl accused of stealing a BlackBerry phone is accosted by a group of men . As it is often the case , these voyeurs surround the poor lady like famished vultures around a decaying corpse . They take delight in tearing off her dresses , starting from her breasts down to her waist area . They take turns to molest her , touching and twisting and tingling . She goes down on her knees , hands up in the air pleading for forgiveness . The men sigh uniformly and murmur something about ' showing her pepper today ' . It does not cross the mind of any of the men to allow God to punish the girl . Instead with their tongues hanging out , they flip open their phone cameras to record a video of the half-naked girl for their Facebook page . <p> On the same day , in another part of another town , a petty thief who overreaches , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of hyenas , they kick , punch and spit at him . With the same hand they use to receive the Holy Communion on Sundays , they pick up hefty stones by the roadside , throw them at him and smile as pieces of flesh spatter on red soil . Some grab broken legs of a wooden table and smash them on his head . Blood gushes out as another man goes for some tires and another for a gallon of petrol . With the same hand he uses to flip through the pages of the Bible , one man scratches a match and throws the fire on the thief 's body now drenched with petrol . As his flesh burns , the men surround the bonfire , eyes popping out , teeth clinching , and their Clifford Orji-like nostrils taking in the smell of his roasting flesh . It does not cross the mind of any of the men to allow God to punish the thief . <p> On the same day , in yet another part of another town , a big politician and his entourage pull into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police riders . Young men with fists up in the air and heads bowed surround the biggest of the cars in which the politician sits . " We 're loyal , " they yell by the window , as everyone waits for police escorts to come and open the back door for the politician to climb down . Only one older man notices the blood of a pedestrian on the tires of the politician 's Sport Utility Vehicle . The politician 's convoy knocked down an old woman crossing a road a few miles away and moved on . " God will punish him , " the older man says and walks away . <p> The other young men dance and chant the numerous titles of the politician as he climbs out . His protruding stomach comes out first . And then , his empty head emerges , titled cap fixed on top of the fast balding head . He steps out and begins to address the young men . He makes promises . The same promises he made the last election season , which was the time he came around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him can attest to . He does not mention the millions he gets paid for being in government neither does he mention the millions he gets in kickbacks for contracts that wo n't be executed . His millions in security votes , millions in constituency project allocations , millions in Et cetera allowances are all siphoned abroad . Meanwhile , all these young men , many unemployed , many dying in installment , suffer the consequences of poor infrastructures , lack of medical facilities , and general impunity inspired by men like him . But they dance and dance until loaves of bread , with naira notes embedded in the middle , get to their hands . <p> There must be a reason why young men molest girls accused of stealing BlackBerry phones and burn up petty thieves but hail the greatest thieves of them all- politicians . There must be something that our public officials know that we ordinary mortals do not know . It must be something very key to their survival . These men and women , supposedly religious people , know something very deep that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no hell . <p> What if there is no hell ? Maybe that is their secret . Maybe they know there is no hell while the rest of us do n't . So they let us go to church , mosques and shrines , where we are asked to look away , to focus on the pineapple in the sky and to give all we have . When we walk away , the pastors , imams and priests laugh their heads off . Mumu , they call us . <p> I am a long time observer of the Nigerian malady . But in recent time , it has been a lot difficult to retain my sanity . To hold on to what remains of my humanity , I find myself turning into a philosopher . <p> Since when I was a child , Hell has been marketed as a life transmitted disease that one catches for engaging in inappropriate behavior without any good cause . It is the prize of sin -the payment for stealing from public coffer -the compensation for inflating contracts -the gift for abandoning developmental projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remuneration for importing fake drugs and fake juice -the return for stealing a poor widow 's land -- the reimbursement for defying the mandate of the people . <p> If Nigerian politicians , raised as children to fear hell act this way , imagine how they will act if they know that there is no hell ? Ah ! There must not be hell . If there is hell the way there is STD , these men and women wo n't indulge in behaviors like these . <p> Think of it . What else could be the reason why your pastor is using the money you give each Sunday to send his children to top schools abroad while your children are stuck in that poor public school ? And your pastors are not even leading a march to force the government to fund and fix the schools where your children go to school . Why else would your pastors be buying new jets while deadly smoke is spurting out of your car 's gear box ? What other reasons would make your pastors to collect stolen money from corrupt politicians if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please consider my question again : what if there is no hell ? What if there is no STD ? What if there is no AIDS ? What if there is no gonorrhea ? What if there is no syphilis ? I bet it is the same thing . Some folks act as if there is no STD even when they see their consequences . Imagine if they can not see any sign of STD , how will they behave ? <p> The young men who molest girls accused of stealing BlackBerry , burn up petty thieves but hail the greatest thieves of them all -- the politicians , can not possibly see any sign of hell . Are you surprised at how they act ? Why do they think the politician is any different from the BlackBerry stealing girl or the petty thief ? Why do those who think otherwise leave the punishment of the politician to God ? <p> So , I ask you again ; what if there is no hell ? Would it be reason enough for our young men to hold our public servants accountable -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BlackBerry girl or the petty thief accountable ? <p> Hell is real ! People often wonder why Jesus Christ spent so much time warning us about " the fire ( hell ) that shall never be quenched " as well as " a horrible place of weeping and gnashing of teeth " ( Mark 9:48-49 ; Luke 16:19-31 , Revelation 20:11-15 , 21:8 ) . You often hear people querying why Jesus Christ talked more about the fires of hell than about the joys of heaven . The subject of hell is so sobering that many Christians and unbelievers are more comfortable ignoring it . Atheists , Agnostics , Satanists and New Agers do not want to hear any talk about hell . However , the subject of hell deserves to be taken very seriously because it is often absent in Sunday sermons . <p> As genuine Christians , we should not be reluctant to think seriously about the reality of future punishment for unbelievers and unrepentant sinners . We do not do unredeemed people a favour when we remain silent about the subject of hell . We should follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus Christ said that some people would rise from death in " the resurrection of condemnation " ( John 5:29 ) . Jesus Christ declared that those who go to hell enter the horrible place where " their worms do not die and the fire is not quenched " ( Mark 9:44-49 ) . He also depicted hell as a place of " outer darkness " , where there " will be weeping and gnashing of teeth " ( Matthew 8:12 ; 22:13 ; 25:30 ) . <p> If you are a genuinely born-again Christian , you should talk more about hell with unbelievers and unrepentant sinners . It does not make sense to say you believe in Jesus Christ while rejecting what He and His book ( Bible ) say about hell or an eternal " lake of fire " ( Mark 9:48-49 ; Luke 16:19-31 , Revelation 20:11-15 , 21:8 ) . Unredeemed people do not choose hell with a full understanding of what they are doing . They do not have a clear picture of the eternal happiness they will miss or the everlasting separation and darkness @ @

##1211652 <h> Nigeria releases Vitamin A maize to improve nutrition <p> The Nigerian Government has released two new maize hybrids that can provide more vitamin A in the diets of millions in the country , raising optimism about stemming the menace of vitamin A deficiency in the years ahead , especially among children , pregnant women , and mothers . The provitamin A is converted by the body into vitamin A when the maize is eaten . The hybrids , which are the first generation vitamin A-rich maize , were released on 4 July 2012 by the National Variety Release Committee of Nigeria as Ife maizehyb 3 and Ife maizehyb 4 . They are recognized as IITA hybrids A0905-28 and A0905-32 , respectively . " The hybrids are a product of nearly a decade of breeding for enhanced levels of pro-vitamin A , " says Dr. Abebe Menkir , maize breeder with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture ( IITA ) , who led the development of the new maize hybrids . The hybrids outperformed local checks with yields ranging from 6 to 9 tons per hectare compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vitamin A hybrids were developed by IITA in partnership with the Institute of Agricultural Research &; Training ( IAR &T); using conventional breeding in a project funded by the HarvestPlus -- a Challenge Program of the CGIAR as part of strategies to address the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency . Other collaborating partners include the Institute for Agricultural Research ( IAR ) , Zaria ; University of Maiduguri ; International Maize and Wheat Center ( CIMMYT ) , University of Illinois , and University of Wisconsin . In Nigeria , vitamin A deficiency afflicts about 30% of children below five years of age , almost 20% of pregnant women , and 13% of nursing mothers . Vitamin A deficiency lowers immunity and impairs vision , which can lead to blindness and even death . Researchers say the two hybrids can supply enhanced levels of vitamin A in the diets . Maize is consumed by millions of people throughout Nigeria , whether roasted and eaten off the cob or as a dish prepared from fermented maize flour . According to Menkir , maize is the most frequently consumed staple in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times within a week . " These hybrids will provide not only increased amounts of provitamin A but also improve productivity in farming communities , " he says . Farmers who participated in the on-farm trials indicated that they liked the varieties , so there is a high prospect for quick adoption . IITA and IAR &; T , in partnership with private seed companies , now plan to multiply these hybrids so they can begin distributing them to farmers by 2014 , and to continue to develop higher levels of vitamin A in maize by conventional breeding . " We plan to target to areas where maize consumption is high to help address the problem of vitamin A deficiency in Nigeria " says Dr. Samuel Olakojo , a maize breeder with IAR &T,; who worked on the varieties with Menkir . The release of vitamin A cassava in Nigeria last year should help pave the way for broad acceptance of the vitamin A maize . These new maize varieties are well suited to the tropical lowlands of many West African countries and are expected to spread beyond Nigeria 's borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat Research Center ( known by their Spanish acronym CIMMYT ) -- a sister CGIAR Center of IITA -- has been breeding mid-altitude vitamin A-rich varieties for Zambia in a project also funded by HarvestPlus , with release anticipated later this year . <p> Shortlink : <p> Posted by Administrator on July 
##1212651 <p> Part One : U.S. strategy in the 21st century : leadership through hegemony <p> Chapter IV : Funding for U.S. International Policy <p> Conclusion : Public Opinion on U.S. Foreign Policy <p> At one of the Round Tables , Mikhail Gorbachev made this pro-nouncement : " I have just returned from America .... The Americans themselves , their public opinion , tend to believe they do n't need this -- the world policeman role and world domination . They feel that they have enough of their own problems . Public opinion , though , is often ignored , same as in many other states . Public opinion remains just that -- an opinion , while real politics moves in a different direction . " 64 <p> This statement , characteristic of many Russian political leaders and scholars , is curious in two respects : First , Mr. Gorbachev deliberately uses the wrong term here . No one in the United States talks about being a " world policeman " and about U.S. domination of the world . The es-sence of these terms is conveyed through other phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , U.S. leadership , and be-nevolent hegemony of the United States . These words do n't change the essence of the phenomenon , but as propaganda tools they work effec-tively to win support for U.S. foreign policy . Second , what grounds does Mr. Gorbachev have for speaking on behalf of U.S. " public opin-ion " ? Did he take the trouble of talking to each individual American ? Some Russian politicians , though , aim even higher and presume to speak for " the entire humankind and all peoples " ; we 'll deal with this later in the chapter on Russian scholars . <p> Because I have never heard of public opinion polls on the scale of entire peoples and humankind as a whole , let us look into the matter of American public opinion about the role of the United States in the world and its relations with Russia and China . This is easy enough to do with access to the data from the polls conducted by the Chicago Committee on Foreign Policy . The committee has conducted these polls regularly once every four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted in 1998 ; its results were published in 1999. 65 <p> Polled individuals are separated into two categories : the public ( or-dinary folk , so to speak ) and the leadership ( people involved in one way or another in the U.S. foreign policy process ) . <p> The world in the twenty-first century . The majority of the public ( 53 percent ) believes that the twenty-first century will be bloodier and more violent than the twentieth century . Among leaders , this view is shared by only 40 percent of those polled . This means that the public has fewer illusions about the future than the leaders . This disagreement is quite natural because leaders in all countries attempt to embellish the future . One has only to recall the pie in the sky that Russia 's leaders used to promise to their people . <p> Role of the United States in the world . Sixty-one percent of the public and 96 percent of the leadership supported an active role for the United States in the world . Fifty percent of the public believes that America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader than it did ten years ago ; 79 percent of the public and 71 percent of the leadership are certain that in another ten years , this role will become even stronger . <p> Fifty-nine percent of the public and 58 percent of the leadership considered the superiority of U.S. military might in the world arena a " very important " goal . <p> Asked about the main factor in maintaining the country 's superior might and influence in the world , 63 percent of the public said economic might , and 28 percent said military might ; among the leaders , 89 percent chose economic might , and 8 percent chose military might . In other words , the proportion of those who rely on military might is much higher among the general public than among the leaders . The people turn out to be more belligerent than their politicians . <p> China . The " feelings thermometer " measures the attitude toward a particular country and its leaders ( neutral attitude equals 50 degrees Centigrade ) . On this scale , China rates 47 degrees . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 percent , respectively ) view China 's transformation into a world power as a " critical " threat to American vital interests . Despite this , 69 percent of the public and 97 percent of its leaders believe that in the next ten years , China will be playing a bigger role than now . At the same time , only 27 percent of the public , as opposed to 51 percent of its leaders , consider U.S. mili-tary intervention necessary in the event of China 's invasion of Taiwan . <p> Public support for economic aid to Russia remained low : 38 percent of the public wanted it decreased or stopped altogether , while 35 per-cent wanted Russia to solve its economic problems on its own . Only 17 percent of the leaders polled supported this latter position . At the same time , 44 percent of the leaders preferred that Russia rely on Europe rather than America in its attempts to emerge from its crisis . <p> On the list of major foreign policy problems , Russia occupies fifth place in the leadership 's view and eleventh place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public ( 77 percent ) and its leaders ( 93 percent ) still regard Russia from the perspective of U.S. vital interests , even though their concern about a potential Russian military threat is negli-gible . Only a third of the public continues to view Russia 's military might as a critical threat to the USA , and only 17 percent of leaders feel the same way . Among these latter , 46 percent of administration mem-bers do n't see Russia as an " important " threat at all . Still , 49 percent of the leaders do see Russia as a threat , but as an " important " one , not a " critical " one . <p> The majority of the leaders ( 54 percent ) believe that Russia 's role will become smaller in the next ten years ; 42 percent believe that it will become bigger . The general public 's opinion is evenly split on this is-sue ( 44 percent either way ) . <p> An interesting difference between the attitudes of the public and its leaders was revealed by their answers to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia in the event of its inva-sion of Poland ? Fifty-eight percent of leaders said " yes , " but only 28 percent of the public . It appears that the American public , unlike its leadership , is hardly concerned about the fates of other countries . <p> * * * <p> As these polls demonstrate , U.S. public opinion is at odds with the assessment voiced by Mr. Gorbachev . It is high time for him and for other Russian leaders to start revising their perspective by basing it not on their personal experience but on scientific analysis . Otherwise , they will continue coming up with foolish pronouncements that have tragic consequences for their country . <p> 65 John E.

##1214050 <h> Cataloging &; Classification Quarterly <h> Volume 30 , Number 4 2000 <p> ? Cooperative Cataloging ? <p> Cataloging &; Classification Quarterly has an international audience and by sharing through publication authors are doing their part in making cataloging cooperative . This issue begins with a four part look at the Serials Cataloging Cooperative Training Program ( SCCTP ) . Under the aegis of the CONSER program , now nearly three decades old , SCCTP is meeting many of the needs for the continuing education of serials catalogers . The goal of the four articles about SCCTP is to provide a look at this cooperative program through four diverse viewpoints . In a deliberately personal style authors present the perspectives of an administrator who requested the training for his staff , a trainer who provided training at another institution , and a trainee who attended an SCCTP training course . These experiences are complimented by an assessment of the program by an educator and member of the SCCTP ? s planning committee . <p> Continuing the cooperative cataloging theme an article written by Library of Congress staff describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PCC ) as it expands its international participation . The more original cataloging that is done to accepted standards means that more work will only have to be done once although it is used many times . Or , at least , modifications by users in a country other than the originator of the catalog record will be minimized . <p> The final article highlights the need for cooperation and standards . Through a focus on personal names , the article describes an Internet survey examining 38 different online public access catalogs ( OPACs ) for forms of personal names and their cross references . The author provides recommendations for improving retrieval and consistency . <p> Three book reviews and the Cataloging News conclude the issue . Topics of the books reviewed include serials cataloging , the principles and objectives of cataloging from an Italian viewpoint , and the collected writings of an Italian cataloging theorist and educator . <p> Cooperation in cataloging is not new to libraries . Although present in various guises during much of the 20 th century , the presence of shared machine readable catalog records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative programs over the next three decades . CONSER , NACO , and OCLC ? s Enhance program flourished in the last quarter of the 1900 ? s . Gradually they began to extend beyond the United States and Canada . Many national libraries around the world shared their cataloging data in this same period . The advent of the Internet accelerated the awareness and development of cooperative programs , often under , but not limited to , Library of Congress leadership . CONSER , long a stand-alone program for serials , eventually became part of the Program for Cooperative Cataloging ( PCC ) , a successor to the Cooperative Cataloging Council . Now , as evidenced in the article on the PCC in this issue , cataloging cooperation is very much an international activity . The International Federation for Library Institutions and Associations ( IFLA ) has long been responsible for the development of the International Standards for Bibliographic Description ( ISBDs ) . International cooperation in cataloging is now furthered by embracing the application of the standards in formal cooperative arrangements through the PCC and through enhancing international participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a subject near and dear to my heart and one in which I fervently believe . This includes being a contributor to the collective databases of cataloging and not just a taker . During my years in technical services at the University of Pittsburgh I had the privilege of participating in CONSER policy development and support the library ? s entry into NACO and Enhance . <p> On another semi-personal note , this issue represents a small milestone for me , volume 30 being the 25 th volume of Cataloging &; Classification Quarterly published under my editorship . There have been many excellent articles and theme issues among the 25 volumes published on my watch . Among them , vol. 17(3/4) , published in 1993 , was a theme issue on cooperative cataloging guest edited by Barry Baker . Readers interested in an historical perspective on cooperative cataloging can find it in Baker ? s compilation also published in book form as Cooperative Cataloging : Past , Present , and Future . We must never forget that we build on the past as we prepare for the future . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History is not , of course , a cookbook offering pretested recipes . It teaches by analogy , not by maxims. ? Each generation then must do its own critical thinking in order to move forward in improving society . Fortunately , the disciplines of cataloging and the organization of information are blessed with many strong leaders 
##1215651 <h> Thoughts on an Improvisation <p> On June 20 th , 2009 , late afternoon , I improvised with Joe Sorbara as part of " Lex Non Scripta , Ars Non Scripta : Law , Justice &; Improvisation , " a conference organised by the McGill Centre for Intellectual Property Policy as well as the Improvisation , Community , and Social Practice research project . The performance , entitled " Improvised Contemporary Movement and Sound Performance , " took place at Sala Rossa in Montreal . I was moving , using corporeal mime and other movement techniques , and Joe was making sound with various percussion objects . 1 Joe and I were improvising based on a score that we developed together . The score was spatially defined in the shape of a line that we followed as we improvised . The coordination of our movements and sounds was also defined . Joe was the musician and I was the mover , primarily , but sometimes the line was blurred between who was moving and who was producing sound . Our improvised performance lasted around seventeen minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring the improvisational structure of the performance and examining this structure as the " law " of our improvisation . I will also reflect on the broader relationship between law and improvisation . <p> The request to write this commentary came shortly after the performance . A few minutes after performing , still sweating and slightly disturbed by the emotional zone where this piece took us , Joe and I were asked whether we would be willing to have the video recording of the piece published in this special issue of Critical Studies in Improvisation/Etudes critiques en improvisation on Improvisation , Law , and Justice . We agreed , provided that we could see the video and confirm that we were happy with it in advance ( it 's always hard to say when you just performed ! ) . A few days later , we were asked whether we would be prepared to write a commentary on this piece that could be published alongside the recording . We agreed and , because of my previous work about performance and law 2 and Joe 's commitment to write on our duo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer for this commentary . <p> As I started thinking about writing this text , my first reaction was that it would probably be more interesting to have an audience member write a commentary on the piece rather than one of the performers . However , as I was a conference participant in addition to being a performer , I thought that perhaps this exercise would allow me to continue exploring some of the themes of the conference , including what improvisation feels like from the inside . More precisely , I thought I would ask myself whether our improvisation involved law and how we engaged with law as performers . So I accepted the challenge of exploring this question as an insider who has access to both a bodily memory of the performance as well as a recording of the event . The process of thinking back about a piece through watching its documentation is also , of course , an important part of developing the improvisational relationship , as well as new scores , which is part of our duo 's work . <p> Looking back on this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allowed for chaotic moments ( at least from a performer 's viewpoint ) . The grounding rule 4 which informed our improvisation and probably informs any improvisation was listening to one 's improvisational partner . For me , improvisation is about being in the moment and listening . This grounding rule allows for the law of the improvisation to reveal itself to the performer . It allows for improvising freely or building on an agreed structure . Being attentive and always ready to go implies a capacity to engage with the law of the performance but also potentially to interfere with and challenge it , sometimes intentionally , sometimes by mistake . These interferences lead improvisers to take into account whatever rule changes they provoke as creative material , a process that is also part of the improvisational normative framework . Improvisers also expect the audience to engage with their momentary constructions as audience members try to follow and make sense of them . When I improvised with Joe , I felt that these elements were in place , constituting our underlying agreement and challenge . <p> In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of a pre-established normative framework . Joe and I had agreed to perform an improvisational structure that we built together and had performed before . The structure involved moving and playing following a line that was clearly defined in space by Joe 's percussion instruments . We also planned starting and ending points at each extremity of the line . At these beginning and ending spaces , we would play with a different set of sounds and movements than in the main body of the improvisation . At the beginning and end , Joe would play simple and repetitive sounds while I would move instruments around and remove them from Joe 's reach . During the main body of the improvisation , Joe was allowed to play percussion instruments that happened to be vis--vis my body , as I moved in parallel to the line . That was our plan , our improvisational normative framework . <p> However , as we started improvising , perhaps predictably , unplanned events happened . These events became moments of transgression as well as , more importantly , moments of confusion concerning the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of transgression , at the beginning of the improvisation I was about to move or steal an instrument from Joe , and Joe decided to remove it from my reach . This led me to engage with him physically more than I thought I would at that point in time . What I refer to as " confusion , " though , was much more disruptive and occurred throughout the body of the improvisation . Although Joe and I agreed on an improvisational structure , we did n't discuss in advance the possibility of revising this structure that we had rehearsed without an audience . In the end , during our improvisation at Sala Rossa , it turned out that Joe and I had radically different variations on our improvisational structure in mind . Simultaneously , we each performed a different variation on the structure . In addition , we were convinced that we were performing the same variation and it was only after we finished the improvisation that we realised what had happened . <p> Variation one allowed Joe to play instruments that were vis--vis my body as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body was touching the ground . Variation two only allowed Joe to play instruments that were vis--vis parts of my body that were touching the floor . As I was moving in parallel to the line of percussion objects , I understood that we were doing variation one . Meanwhile , Joe was performing variation two and experiencing a much more constraining environment . This environment became even more constraining for him because ( thinking that we were doing variation one ) I did n't make explicit efforts to have more parts of my body touch the ground to give Joe more options . In other words , if I chose to have only the tip of my head as well as one foot on the ground , Joe did n't have many percussion objects to choose from . If I moved quickly , it was quite a challenge for him to keep up with the required change of instruments . Despite this variation confusion , Joe and I were still focused on listening and responding to each other , following our ground rule , and attempting to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would describe as frustrating constraints ( and sweating like me because it was very warm in the room that afternoon ) . I 'm not sure if I felt his frustration or if it was the precise and obsessive sounds he made , but this performance took me into unexpected emotional zones . It 's sometimes hard to know who provokes what during an improvisation , but the ongoing listening leaves room for transfers of each other 's emotions , and sometimes for the transferral of these emotions to the audience . During the improvisation , I was not aware of our dissonant variations . I focused on responding to the sounds that Joe was producing . Moreover , in response to the moment , I found myself exploring intensity and anxiety through rather tense and jerky movements . I was quite shaken after the improvisation . Our improvisation did not last as long as we expected it to , length often being related to what goes on in the moment and to attempts to find rather than force an ending , which brings us back to our grounding rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , I was n't sure how the audience had interpreted it . All I knew was that our improvisational structure took me to a very different place than last time we performed , which suggests that the structure was actually a good improvisational tool . <p> Joe and I only realised after we finished and talked about it that there had been some confusion about the details of the improvisation . Our overall structure had nevertheless been clear , and we had been able to " adjust " and " take liberties " which created this particular version of the piece . Although it is not necessarily interesting to identify precise and fixed causes and effects in improvisational work , I like to think that our confusion , our simultaneous performance of different variations of the structure , contributed to the uniqueness of that particular improvisation . On the other hand , I can not underestimate the importance of our stable ground rule , our clear overall structure , and our experience playing together . This leads me to ask whether the law of any improvisation must allow for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , if I summarize the law of this improvisation , it involved spatial , temporal , and relational elements . We knew where the improvisation would start , progress , and finish . We knew there would be a different quality of sound and movement at the beginning and end : simple repetitive sound and daily life movements , as opposed to the main body of the improvisation , which involved a higher complexity and formality of sound and movement . We thought we had agreed upon the relationship between my occupation of the space and Joe 's use of instruments . We had an approximate duration in mind . We knew that Joe was mostly making sound and that I was mostly producing movement . We allow accidental blurring of that line , which is what provides us access to each other 's discipline and creates the spirit of our duo . We knew that anything could happen . Because anything could happen , we were committed to the basic principle of listening to and responding to one another . <p> What we did n't know in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the improvisation . We did n't know that we might be operating with competing variations regarding the detailed relationship between movement and sound in the main body of the improvisation . This simultaneous performance of different variations on the basic structure complexified our relationship and pushed us to find new elements within the improvisational structure . The simultaneous performance of competing variations may have been the result of confusion , but confusion may also be an important aspect of improvisation , part of the risk involved when everything is not planned in advance . <p> In the end , Joe and I responded to the confusion by relying on our experience working with each other , our common memory , and on our listening skills . We were able to interpret and use each other 's improvisational gestures as material for this improvisation . Concentrating on the overall structure and working through the confusion , while experiencing the drama of each being convinced that we followed the same rule , ended up being our piece that day . We managed to finish the improvisation and therefore found a resolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension that we had been experiencing throughout . Our capacity to respond to the unexpected , engage with it , and tie it to the overall normative framework is probably what allows us to call ourselves improvisers . <h> Notes <p> 1 Julie Lassonde is a movement improviser and performance artist , as well as a lawyer .

See also Julie Lassonde 's essay " Performing Law . " <p> 4 As I 'm writing this text , I find myself struggling with whether to use the term " laws , " " norms , " or " rules . " I find the expression " grounding rule " appropriate to describe basic principles of improvisation like listening and responding to one 's fellow improviser . However , this expression reminds me of Hans Kelsen 's efforts at finding a grundnorm that would be the source of the validity of all other legal norms within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my goal in writing this article but is also ironic as Kelsen would most likely object to interdisciplinary projects involving law and art ( see , generally , Hans Kelsen 's Pure Theory of Law ) .

##1218251 <h> By Paul Mamza <p> The general philosophical framework to achieve national integration is vested in the revolutionary attitudes of the political players towards the logic of social and political setting . The achievement of a well-integrated political system which is anchored on ideas in planning , national ideals and orientation brings peace , progress and stability . In Nigeria , the failure of leadership had its history in self-egoism nepotism and greed . Even when new changes in leadership occur , it tends to hover around the perceived survival shadows of the predecessors based on the debasement factors . With the amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates , each region is being forced to map-out devices for its survival in the national stage . The maturity of the First Republic politicians was able to nip to bud the many flashpoints of threat against national survival and progress . Apart from the pockets of ethnic resentments like the Tiv riots and the ' wild Wild West ' of that era , the trend was a gradually process of persuasion and enlightenment based on a sense of maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalistic feelings but for the maturity of the military government under General Yakubu Gowon that emerged in 1967 after the overthrow of the first military ruler , Major General J.T.U Aguiyi-Ironsi , the nation would have been disintegrated and segmentalized . The military under Gowon managed a 30 months civil war with a high success of a rescued nation . When General Murtala Muhammed assumed power on July , 29 th , 1975 after General Yakubu Gowon was overthrown while attending O.A.U Summit In Kampala , Uganda it was just a matter of time that some aggrieved soldiers wrote a letter signed by one Major Abubakar Ahmed and others that the " country is gradually drifting to doomsday " and they gave some conditions if not met will result in " change of government either through assassination , normal tactical change or sabotage " and threatened that " Murtala and his group can not stop us " . <p> General Murtala was assassinated on February 13 , 1976 in a bloody coup led by Col. Bukar Suka Dimka . General Olusegun Obasanjo took over the mantle of leadership and handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the inauguration of Shagari , the political parties that participated in the election that brought about the Second Republic are National Party of Nigeria ( npn ) which succeeded the Northern People 's Congress ( npc ) of Ahmadu Bello and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa had Alhaji Shehu Shagari who as a former minister in the First Republic as its presidential candidate . The Unity Party of Nigeria ( upN ) had the Yoruba base of the old Action Group ( ag ) of the First Republic led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief Samuel Akintola with Chief Obafemi Awolowo as its party 's flag-bearer . The Nigerian People 's Party ( npp ) was an Igbo -- based replacement of National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroon ( NCNC ) of the First Republic , led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe with Dr. Azikiwe the presidential candidate . Amongst the political parties that participated in the 1979 presidential election only the Great Nigerian People 's Party ( gnpp ) had no clear and distin ct First Republic roots . The Peoples Redemption Party ( prp ) led by Malam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent of the old Northern Elements Progressive Union ( nepu ) coalition against the npc in the First Republic . The gnpp presidential candidate was Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim who had nurtured advocacy for politics without malice appealed for participation without the normal ' do or die ' or " make-it-or-break-it " mindsets of the political class . Though securing a limited base of Borno and few states winning 10% of the total votes with 43 houses of representatives members out of 449 and 8 senate members out of 95 , Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim had tendered a new dimension to approach towards politics as it is in any civilized society . An apostle of politics without bitterness and good governance in a remarkably pervasive schism that is normal in Nigerian politics . <p> Chief Obafemi Awolowo rekindled the ethnic rivalry that marred the First Republic even before the 1979 election and by 1983 round of election it was clear that the Second Republic is on a cusp of gunpowder . It exploded . The military under the General Muhammed Buhari that took over from Alhaji Shagari was certain about the uncertainties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his book " Not My Will " , Obasanjo said of Awolowo that " Awolowo 's failure and rejection at the polls in 1979 had star ted well before the elections itself . And he failed because he did not possess in sufficient quantum those commodities required to be a political success " . Obasanjo was here trying to echo Awolowo 's lack of integration and acceptability by all . Said Obasanjo " in the early life of own administration he was appointed as the Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria . A seasoned politician , well-groomed in the intricacies of Nigeria politics would have seen that as a time-honoured opportunity to mix and mingle freely with those who mattered in the North and to develop a sort of rapprochement that would lead to a better understanding of his political views and his person " he continued " . " infact , the first speech he made at the university did not seem to have gone down well with most of the northern elit e and seemed not to close the gap between him and the main stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude , disposition behavior and utterances did not help matters either " . Obasanjo was later to have squabbles within the mainstream Yoruba political and social elites for the onslaught on their hero and had for a long time not forgiven Obasanjo for handing-over to Shagari and not Awolowo . General Ibrahim Babangida that overthrew the General Buhari 's Government organized an inconclusive transition that was perceived in some quarters to deny a Yoruba , Chief M.K.O. Abiola , the supposed winner to be emerge as a President by the annulment of the June , 12 , 1993 presidential election . By the time the Fourth Republic emerged , the clouds were filled with hatred and fury , people only see progress as that of their kinsmen , brethren and friends . Only few Nigerians bother about the survival of the nation . Divide and rule become the order as reminiscent of the military rule , trivialities and arbitrariness had offered lawlessness and despairs . All organs including the fourth realms are engaged in a fight for self-survival at the expense of national survival . Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim message canvassing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsing , it would have arrested abortion of the Third Republic and it can resist the present threat to the survival order . This is the ample time to capture the Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim sermonizations with keen interest for Nigeria and Nigerians. &; nbsp ; Do we forget this great politician , former minister and the presidential candidate of the Great Nigerian Peoples Party ( GNPP ) because of what is he preaching against is what we are collectively

##1220750 <h> Nigeria <p> Entrepreneurial forces are relatively strong in this country , as the lack of jobs and a rise in poverty leave few other options for the Nigerian people . Although difficult due to a lack of resources , there are non-profit organizations such as the Fate Foundation in Nigeria that are dedicated to promote entrepreneurship . <p> Apart from the information about Nigeria that is so widespread and often negative , there appears to be a recognition of the critical role and place of technology in the development and advancement of the nation . In the past few years , there have been the startups of internet cafes , new Internet Service Providers , computers in some schools , and connectivity hubs that provide access to information at high speeds . The Nigerian government has created and adopted policies promoting the use of technology in education . The Nigerian Economic Policy 1999-2003 , is a comprehensive compendium of President Obasanjo 's policies and guiding principles for the nation . The policy states : " Government will provide affordable quality education for all Nigerians , the Universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest " and in particular , " Government will create incentives to expand access to information and communications technology which will facilitate leap-froging in order to short-circuit the longer span of development . " The policy even recommends partnerships with national and international agencies including the United Nations Transfer of Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals program or TOKTEN as it is commonly known . <p> However , an important distinction between developed and developing nations often lies in the wide disparity between policy pronouncements and policy implementation . Often , signs of this disparity are found in the extent that policies are clear and measurable and that application is consistent . Often developing nations adopt excellent policies and guidelines that could , if well implemented , change the futures of their citizens but alas , they are very often not followed through . If Nigeria follows-through with its new laws guiding education and technology with action and implementation , and the people of Nigeria attain their educational goals and professional potential with the tools available to the world today we will witness the transformation of what is presently a Third world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant . These are attainable goals . <p> Entrepreneurship activity in Nigeria is primarily based on necessity . <p> The majority of entrepreneurs in the country are operating in Lagos , the former capital of the country . <p> Nigeria 's economic decline since the 1980 's has created a hostile environment that is unfavorable to entrepreneurial success . <p> The Nigerian infrastructure limits entrepreneurial effectiveness and is a barrier to success . <p> The high cost of doing business in Nigeria , such as the lack of adequate electricity and basic needs by a large amount of the population stifle entrepreneurial activity . <p> Getting venture capital to finance entrepreneurial endeavor in Nigeria is very difficult because of the political and economic instability . <p> The policies of the Nigerian government are a barrier to the success of large-scale entrepreneurial success for many Nigerians . The government is plagued by corruption and greed . The government systematically ignores laws that are already in place to promote free enterprise . <p> The lack of enforcement of Nigerian patent laws discourages entrepreneurs from commercializing their ideas and inventions . <p> The constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be willing to provide resources for entrepreneurship in the country , which is very rich in natural resources . <p> Political and social movements strongly affect the level of entrepreneurial activity in Nigeria . Religious intolerance and ethnic warfare limit country progress in some areas of the country . <p> Female entrepreneurs in Nigeria are often underestimated and overlooked . <p> Female entrepreneurs in Nigeria are often hindered because of cultural barriers such as male/female role definitions that label women inherently inferior to men . <p> Nigeria has the 2nd largest GDP in Africa , South Africa has the largest . <p> The Ibo ethnic group in Nigeria is recognized internationally for its culture of entrepreneurship . <p> The majority of entrepreneurs in the country are operating in the capital city of Abuja . <p> Control own life , to be my own boss , freedom to adapt personal approach to work and attain family security are some of the reasons Nigerians engage in entrepreneurial activity . <p> The Nigerian government has a program in place that promotes exports from Nigeria to other countries , which can be helpful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . <p> Lower taxes and increased price ceilings have increased the incentives to entrepreneurs in the country . <p> Nigeria is progressively trying to incorporate modern technology into its country . <p> Nigeria is trying to actively promoting technology in its educational system with the use of the internet . <p> Although there are a lot of barriers , entrepreneurship in Nigeria is necessary for the country to become a developed nation . <h> Contribute <p> Anything to add ? <p> Contribute your own content to International Entrepreneurship .

##1228451 <h> Juventus Battle Chelsea For Europe 's Best 16 <p> Juventus 's hopes of challenging among Europe 's 16 best football teams could be decided by their penultimate Group H clash against Champions League holders Chelsea on Tuesday . After years of watching from the sidelines the former two-time winners have embraced their return to the competition after winning a 28th Serie A league title last season . <p> But so far , the Old Lady 's group campaign has gone off with more of a whimper than a bang . Antonio Conte 's side managed only three draws before finally hitting form with a 4-0 rout of Danish champions Nordsjaelland in Turin two weeks ago . That rather late surge , along with Chelsea 's late winner against Shakhtar , has left Juventus third in Group H one point behind the English giants and second placed Shakhtar . <p> Although both Chelsea and Shakhtar are delicately poised , Juventus , whose final group match is in the Ukraine , are in the unenvied position of hoping results elsewhere go their way . Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands : " The fact it all depends on us is a good sign . We 're at home to Chelsea and then away to Donetsk . <p> " We 're confident , and you ca n't always rely on other results . " Juventus suffered their first league defeat in over a year two weeks ago in a 3-1 defeat to Inter Milan and since then have been a mission to make amends . Juve hammered Pescara 6-1 last week and should have put several goals past Lazio on Saturday before the Biancocelesti held on for a scoreless draw . <p> It was a gutsy , attacking display from Juventus and defender Leonardo Bonucci brushed off suggestions Tuesday 's test had been preying on their minds . " It was a great Juventus performance , we were the only team in the game . Lazio did n't have a shot on goal and ( Lazio ' keeper , Federico ) Marchetti was the best player on the pitch , " he said . " Now we turn our attention to Chelsea , it 's a crucial fixture for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Defeat would prove a hammer blow to Chelsea 's title defence and while their record in Italy is far from illustrious it is arguably their current dip in form that is giving Juve most hope . Chelsea have only once before won in Italy in the Champions League -- a 4-0 group stage success over Lazio , a team for which Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo once played . And the Blues are in something of a mini-crisis . <p> On Saturday , Chelsea succumbed 2-1 to West Bromwich Albion , leaving the European champions with just two points from four games and prompting Di Matteo to hint they may soon start focusing more on defence than attack . " We have played differently this season , but we might have to go a little bit tighter to win games and make sure we do n't concede , " said Di Matteo . <p> " Maybe it is time to look at it , change it , and get a win . We have massive games coming up , but we have players with a lot of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set-up of the team and maybe sacrifice a little of the attacking options . " <p> Juventus ' big concern ahead of Tuesday is Montenegrin striker Mirko Vucinic , one of the first names on Conte 's team sheet this season but absent against Lazio due to flu-like symptoms .

##1228552 <h> Churches , Mosques Should Pay Tax -- Falana <p> Human Rights lawyer , Femi Falana ( SAN ) , has canvassed that churches and mosques should begin to pay tax in the country . <p> Falana , who expressed worry about the role of religious bodies in the fight against corruption , spoke against the backdrop of the acquisition of a jet by the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria , Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor , said to have been donated by the cleric 's church members . <p> He stated this while delivering a lecture , ' Asking the unasked questions : society , corruption and punishment in Nigeria ' in Lagos on Monday . <p> The SAN , who represented Prof. Wole Soyinka at a workshop entitled ' the dynamics of cashless economy and emerging methods in financial crimes , ' said both society and the government had failed in the fight against corruption . <p> He said , " Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor , the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria , someone who just acquired his own jet a couple of weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crave for jets and opulent life . He ( Oritsejafor ) said everything a pastor could get for evangelism should be acquired , not minding the economic situation of the people <p> " If this is the case then , the tax authorities must extend their dragnets to all religious centres where substantial income is generated on a regular basis in the name of God . The prosperity pastors , who are buying jets to preach the gospel to those who wallow in abject poverty should be assessed according to their wealth and be made to pay commensurate taxes . <p> " After all , they pay appropriate fees for parking their jets at local and international airports at home and abroad . " <p> Falana also noted that death penalty was logical but not necessary in curbing corruption . <p> According to him , death penalty for crimes such as robbery has not served as a deterrent and will not work in this regard . <p> He said , " Notwithstanding the horrendous effect of corruption in the society , we should not be frustrated to support the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Even in Nigeria , our experience with murder and armed robbery has proved that

##1228752 <p> In the last few days , the crash of the Cessna 208 , 5N-BMJ on a hill at the NNPC depot near the Yola International Airport in Adamawa state , involving Governor Danbaba Suntai of Taraba state and four of his aides has apparently triggered a nationwide alarm , and thrown up a plethora of questions even though many of his fellow governors too have private aircrafts which are of no economic value to Nigerians whose leaders can not even fix roads . <p> The Jalingo-Yola link road in Taraba state for instance is still deplorable . Basic amenities are also lacking in most north east states . Is Suntai a certified pilot ? If he is , what kind of license does he have ? Was he medically fit to fly a plane ? Who certified him ? <p> Governor Suntai was widely rumoured to have died in the crash until the Presidency and the Ministry of Aviation , in separate statements , said he did not . <p> There have been different versions of the story surrounding the survival of the victims . A statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister stated that the Ministry immediately began a search and rescue operation to locate Governor Suntai 's crash site , while in contrary , it was reported that the crash victims were presumed dead for several hours before any search team could reach them . In fact , some sources said that the rescue team did not reach the governor until around about 3 hours after the crash . <p> An official of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency ( NAMA ) who participated in the Search and Rescue operations confirmed that Governor Suntai was the last person rescued from the crashed Cessna 208 aircraft he piloted as the governor was stuck on the cockpit at the crash site and required extra carefulness to bring him out . <p> " Others , who sat behind him , were immediately evacuated , making him the last person to be rescued . He was stuck on the cockpit " , he said . <p> However , fresh facts emerged as to what might have caused the crash . According to a top official of the aviation ministry , the governor and his entourage allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , operates a sunrise to sunset arrangement , as it does not have night operations facilities . Consequently , the airport closes at about 6pm , but the governor and his team radioed Air Traffic Control in Yola that they would be arriving by 6.45pm . <p> This made the ATCs to await his arrival . Five minutes to the expected time of arrival , the ATCs lost contact with the Cessna airplane . The control tower people became worried and they alerted the Airport Fire department and immediately , a Search and Rescue operation was initiated using the coordinates of when he last contacted the tower <p> A source from the airport said : " He ought to have come in before 6pm but he radioed that he would arrive by 6.45pm ; so the tower was expecting him , but never got here . The airplane went down some minutes to 7pm . By right , the airport ought to have been closed but the officials had to wait for them , " the source said . Mr. Suntai had no co-pilot on board and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical hitch , though he never at any time said he was in distress . " <p> " The airplane took off from an unmanned airstrip in Jalingo , neither navigational equipment of NAMA nor its staffs were present at the place . So , it calls to question how he has been taking off from an unmanned airspace in Jalingo and landing in Yola . Who has been clearing him for takeoff from an airstrip without air traffic services ? " he queried . <p> According to our investigation , the crash of Cessna 208 piloted by Governor Suntai could have been prevented if he had followed the professional advice of his hired pilot not to fly to Yola airport at sunset . It was revealed that the hired pilot had earlier warned Suntai against flying to the airport when it was obvious that they could not meet with the visual flight mandatory for that type of aircraft which is not in the instrument flight category . Besides , Yola airport is not in the category of airports where flights can be operated for 24 hours because it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Harcourt . <p> It was learnt that this advice was allegedly dishonoured by His Excellency , Danbaba Suntai who was said to have immediately taken over the cockpit and embarked on the ill-fated journey with the said pilot refusing to join the flight because of the obvious risk . <p> Following the incidete , officials of the Accident Investigations Bureau ( AIB ) were reported to have taken over the investigation and cordoned off the crash site with the hope that the Bureau would reconstruct what might have probably happened and also study the black boxes . <p> It was gathered that Mr. Suntai is an aviation enthusiast who owns two aircraft and a helicopter . Aviation sources say he also owns an airstrip which he allegedly built with state funds in his village . A report noted that the Taraba state government spent N804.2 million in fighting poverty to reduce the number of people living below the poverty line in the state in 2007 , and yet Taraba is standing 29th out of 36 Nigerian states by GDP , meaning Taraba is one of the poorest states in Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states funds . <p> In response to the Governor Suntai 's mismanagement of the state 's treasury , a Consultant Psychiatrist at Federal Medical Centre Owo , Ondo state , Adesokan Adekunle Oladiipo said : " As for Taraba state , we now know where the flood intervention fund will go . Governor Dambaba Suntai of poverty ridden Taraba state purchased a personal helicopter just few months ago in addition to his two light aircrafts including Cessna 208 aircraft . He enjoys flying himself to private parties and events , he attended a crash programme at the Aviation College Zaria and then went to the United States for a 6-week flying programme , in addition to a two-week course in France . A pharmacist who became Governor under the ruling PDP Governor Suntai is one of the advocates of more oil revenue to poor states . " <p> A social crusader who did n't want to be named also said : " I would have sent my sympathy to him as a fellow human being , even though I do n't know him . However , I have chosen not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the poorest state in Nigeria be in possession of a private Jet ? The mayor of London ( One of the richest cities in the world with a GDP higher than that of Nigeria combined ) rides a bicycle to work , and only has maybe two houses and a car to his name . He earns just 400,000 annually . Bear in mind that he runs the affairs of a city with an estimated GDP of $600 billion . We then have this Governor owning a Private Jet , with the state 's money he has embezzled . " <p> " The Governor flies on an airplane sorry for my beloved country , people need to be awake , these things happen for a reason . Flying up in the sky while your masses are predominantly beggars on the streets , has any one visited Taraba state ? Ask people who served in the state . " <p> Mr. Suntai reportedly bought the plane , a Cessna Grand Caravan , from a member of the House of Representatives from Kebbi , Bala Ibn Na'Allah . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " following his purchase of an Embraer ERJ-145 jet . Na'Allah himself recently bought a Swiss-made Pilatus PC12 with tail number N689PE . <p> The technical competence of Mr. Suntai as a licensed pilot has been further questioned by many aviation experts . Investigation by journalists confirmed that Mr. Suntai allegedly got the admission at Aviation College through the back door , contrary to the age requirement of 18 to 25 years for any applicant . <p> In order to unravel this , a team of Accident Investigation Bureau ( AIB ) had stormed the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology ( NCAT ) in Zaria , Kaduna state , to probe Suntai 's academic and medical records during his training at the college . Indication emerged that the team may indict the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA ) for allegedly flouting due process in issuing Private Pilot Licence ( PPL ) to Suntai in 2010 . <p> A source , who did not want his name mentioned , said AIB would investigate Governor Suntai 's academic records both at the Aviation College and Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suntai got admission at the college during the administration of the former College 's Rector , Captain Adeboye Alaba in 2010 . To my knowledge , the governor passed through the process , but you know what our elite can do . When the incumbent rector , Captain Chinyere Kalu came in , she tried to reposition the college through series of reforms . " <p> " The normal age to study at the college is between 18 and 25 , if you are above that , you do n't have any business in the school except you are already in the Aviation sector , but Governor Suntai 's age was above the required age when he applied to the college . The governor is not a Captain , but he wears a Captain 's uniform . For you to be a Captain , you must be a commercial pilot , which he is not " , he said . <p> He said : " We only train here , we do n't issue license . We do n't know what happened between Suntai and NCAA in terms of pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deployed to the crash site near Yola Airport and others have arrived the college to probe Governor Suntai 's academic and medical records . Suntai 's blood sample has already been taken at Abuja National hospital to determine whether it contains alcohol at the time of flight . " <p> Contrary to the above , the former NCAT Rector , Capt . Alaba , replied in an interview that Suntai 's admission to the college was without any irregularities . He said that the Private Pilot License ( PPL ) issued Suntai in 2010 had no age restriction anywhere in the world . Alaba explained that PPL was open to any intending pilot , adding that learning how to fly for fun was quite different from learning for making a living out of it . <p> The former rector insisted that age limit only applied to Commercial Pilot License ( CPL ) category , which Suntai did not belong to . Araba said : " I can tell you authoritatively that the PPL given to Suntai has no age limit and the governor passed through the processes before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to fly under PPL even at age 90 . The PPL is open to all . But , for the CPL , there is age restriction of 18 to 22 years . That is all I can say . " <p> Private jets amidst endemic poverty <p> The rising quest for a personal aircrafts by the state governors is becoming rampant as recently , it was revealed that Rivers state Governor , Rotimi Amaechi recently acquired a brand new Bombardier Global 5000 ( N565RS ) in Canada for $45.7 million exclusively for his use . This came at a time when residents of the Garden City were displaced by the worst flood crisis in history . <p> A Port Harcourt-based human rights campaigner said : " This is an ungodly act . Why should Governor Amaechi 's priority be to acquire a jet at a time the state is experiencing the worst flooding in its history , leaving many Rivers indigenes homeless ? " he lamented . <p> The Rivers state Commissioner for Information , Mrs. Ibim Semenitari , in reaction to the allegation said : " It was paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new aircraft is a much safer one . " <p> It would seem also that , the attempt to observe safety from road accidents has led Governor Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa state to opt for a private aircraft after the death of his Personal Assistant , Mohammed Zaki Gambo and two others who were killed in an accident involving his convoy at Dogon Dutse , along Toto-Nasarawa road while the Governor was returning from Umaisha where he donated relief materials to victims of flood disaster in Toto Local Government . <p> A good number of serving governors are also proud owners of private jets even though their people can hardly feed three times daily . <p> Vacuum in Government House ? <p> As doctors at the Yola Specialist Hospital battled to save the life of Governor Suntai after the plane crash , a band of thugs were said to have invaded Government House , Jalingo and chased out his newly sworn-in Deputy , Alhaji Garba Umar . A report made it clear that the invasion , which is presently being probed by the State Security Service ( SSS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop Alhaji Umar from succeeding Governor Suntai in the event that the governor did not survive , but the state Commissioner for Information Mr. Emmanuel Bello , in an interview with Peoples Daily Weekend said there was no cause for alarm , adding " there is no vacuum in Government House in Taraba state . " <p> Umar , who was only sworn-in on October 5 , was forced out of the Government House by thugs allegedly acting on the orders of a serving Senator . It was established that the senator has been at loggerheads with the governor . The suspect was opposed to how the immediate past Deputy Governor , Alhaji Sani Abubakar , was impeached by the Taraba state House of Assembly based on ' cooked up ' allegations of gross misconduct leveled against him by the state lawmakers . <p> Questions are now being asked as to who will succeed their hospitalised governor since he is said to be incapacitated to serve the state further . <p> On this issue , an Abuja-based legal practitioner and the Founder/Chairman of the Board of Egalitarian Mission , Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that all people are , in principle , equal and should enjoy equal social , political , and economic rights and opportunities , Kayode Ajulo , in an interview with Peoples Daily Weekend , said " What is expected and what should happen is for the Deputy Governor to take over as acting governor . That is his duty that is why we have the deputy governor , when he was being sworn-in , he swore to uphold the constitution and the law of the land . One of the laws of the land is that whenever there is a vacuum , particularly when the governor is indisposed , he should take over as acting governor pending when the governor returns . " <p> On what the constitution says concerning duration of time that a deputy governor stays in the position of acting governor before a substantive governor is elected , Ajulo said , " The only time acting governor can transmit to the full fledge governor is when it is so clear by the constitution that the governor can not continue , is indisposed and there is presumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it as a temporal one , by the time it turns into permanent incapacitation , then the acting governor will take over as full governor , like what happened in the case of President Yar'Adua " . <p> From various investigations however , although no specific medical information regarding Mr. Suntai 's condition , it was reported that Governor Suntai was transferred from Yola to the National Hospital , Abuja wearing an oxygen mask heavily bandaged , and under tight security . An eye witness said : " He was driven into the hospital premises in a State House Medical Centre Ambulance with registration number SH 576 . He was bandaged from head to toe and had an oxygen mask on his face . He sat on a reclining chair in the ambulance . A total of seven vehicles were in the convoy , many of them occupied by security operatives . By then , reporters and photographers had positioned themselves at the entrance of the Accident and Emergency Unit . But as soon as the security operatives sighted the newsmen , they diverted the ambulance to the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sani Abubakar , was reportedly stopped from seeing the governor in the hospital by security agents . <p> The arrival of President Goodluck Jonathan at the hospital to personally assess the governor 's condition brought new hope , as he told reporters as he departed that the governor 's condition had stabilised . <p> He said : " First and foremost , we have to thank God for what has happened . Plane crash is not something you can just wave off . We are quite happy that the Governor is still stable and feeling well . The doctors are working very hard on him . I believe that by God 's will , he will soon come out of it . But he is still in the hospital . No doubt about that . The professor/ CMD is here . He can just say one or two things . Being a Governor , people are worried . They want to know his state of health . " <p> Similarly , as it should be expected , the Chief Medical Director of the National Hospital , Prof. Bala Shehu , replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . Obviously , in the first 24 hours of any injuries , there are worries . So , we will continue to observe him for the first 24 hours . There is no need to do any operation on him . He is very stable . Given what happened , we are actually satisfied with the situation at the moment . " <p> However , a source in the hospital said the governor had suffered neurological disorder from the crash . <p> It was gathered that there was heavy security presence at the National Hospital at the time of the governor 's evacuation , which prevented people from getting close to the ICU ; and the governor was stretchered into the Swiss Air ambulance , a Challenger 604 with registration number HB JRC ambulance . His body was covered with a white cloth while being conveyed from the International Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport , Abuja to Germany . This has resulted to the suspicion that Suntai may still be in a critical condition , contrary to reports that he had stabilized . Also , the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , further raised concerns about the state

##1229952 <p> Discussing time in a technical manual can be difficult because the word " time " in English refers to lots of different things . In this manual , we use a rigorous terminology to avoid confusion , and the only thing we use the simple word " time " for is to talk about the abstract concept . <p> A calendar time is a point in the time continuum , for example November 4 , 1990 at 18:02.5 UTC . Sometimes this is called " absolute time " . <p> We do n't speak of a " date " , because that is inherent in a calendar time . <p> An interval is a contiguous part of the time continuum between two calendar times , for example the hour between 9:00 and 10:00 on July 4 , 1980 . <p> An elapsed time is the length of an interval , for example , 35 minutes . People sometimes sloppily use the word " interval " to refer to the elapsed time of some interval . <p> An amount of time is a sum of elapsed times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the amount of time it takes to read a book might be 9 hours , independently of when and in how many sittings it is read . <p> A period is the elapsed time of an interval between two events , especially when they are part of a sequence of regularly repeating events . <p> CPU time is like calendar time , except that it is based on the subset of the time continuum when a particular process is actively using a CPU . CPU time is , therefore , relative to a process . <p> Processor time is an amount of time that a CPU is in use . In fact , it 's a basic system resource , since there 's a limit to how much can exist in any given interval ( that limit is the elapsed time of the interval times the number of CPUs in the processor ) . People often call this CPU time , but we reserve the latter term in this manual for the definition above . <p> One way to represent an elapsed time is with a simple arithmetic data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapsed time between two calendar times . This function is declared in time.h ' . <p> Function : double difftime ( timet time1 , timet time0 ) <p> The difftime function returns the number of seconds of elapsed time between calendar time time1 and calendar time time0 , as a value of type double . The difference ignores leap seconds unless leap second support is enabled . <p> In the GNU system , you can simply subtract timet values . But on other systems , the timet data type might use some other encoding where subtraction does n't work directly . <p> The GNU C library provides two data types specifically for representing an elapsed time . They are used by various GNU C library functions , and you can use them for your own purposes too . They 're exactly the same except that one has a resolution in microseconds , and the other , newer one , is in nanoseconds . <p> Data Type : struct timeval <p> The struct timeval structure represents an elapsed time . It is declared in sys/time.h ' and has the following members : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole seconds of elapsed time . <p> long int tvusec <p> This is the rest of the elapsed time ( a fraction of a second ) , represented as the number of microseconds . It is always less than one million . <p> Data Type : struct timespec <p> The struct timespec structure represents an elapsed time . It is declared in time.h ' and has the following members : <p> long int tvsec <p> This represents the number of whole seconds of elapsed time . <p> long int tvnsec <p> This is the rest of the elapsed time ( a fraction of a second ) , represented as the number of nanoseconds . It is always less than one billion . <p> It is often necessary to subtract two values of type struct timeval or struct timespec . Here is the best way to do this . It works even on some peculiar operating systems where the tvsec member has an unsigned type . <p> If you 're trying to optimize your program or measure its efficiency , it 's very useful to know how much processor time it uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless because a process may spend time waiting for I/O or for other processes to use the CPU . However , you can get the information with the functions in this section . <p> CPU time ( see section Time Basics ) is represented by the data type clockt , which is a number of clock ticks . It gives the total amount of time a process has actively used a CPU since some arbitrary event . On the GNU system , that event is the creation of the process . While arbitrary in general , the event is always the same event for any particular process , so you can always measure how much time on the CPU a particular computation takes by examinining the process ' CPU time before and after the computation . <p> In the GNU system , clockt is equivalent to long int and CLOCKSPERSEC is an integer value . But in other systems , both clockt and the macro CLOCKSPERSEC can be either integer or floating-point types . Casting CPU time values to double , as in the example above , makes sure that operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what the underlying representation is . <p> Note that the clock can wrap around . On a 32bit system with CLOCKSPERSEC set to one million this function will return the same value approximately every 72 minutes . <p> To get a process ' CPU time , you can use the clock function . This facility is declared in the header file time.h ' . <p> In typical usage , you call the clock function at the beginning and end of the interval you want to time , subtract the values , and then divide by CLOCKSPERSEC ( the number of clock ticks per second ) to get processor time , like this : <p> Do not use a single CPU time as an amount of time ; it does n't work that way . Either do a subtraction as shown above or query processor time directly . See section Processor Time Inquiry . <p> Different computers and operating systems vary wildly in how they keep track of CPU time . It 's common for the internal processor clock to have a resolution somewhere between a hundredth and millionth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this macro is the number of clock ticks per second measured by the clock function . POSIX requires that this value be one million independent of the actual resolution . <p> Macro : int CLKTCK <p> This is an obsolete name for CLOCKSPERSEC . <p> Data Type : clockt <p> This is the type of the value returned by the clock function . Values of type clockt are numbers of clock ticks . <p> Function : clockt clock ( void ) <p> This function returns the calling process ' current CPU time . If the CPU time is not available or can not be represented , clock returns the value ( clockt ) ( -1 ) . <p> The times function returns information about a process ' consumption of processor time in a struct tms object , in addition to the process ' CPU time . See section Time Basics . You should include the header file sys/times.h ' to use this facility . <p> Data Type : struct tms <p> The tms structure is used to return information about process times . It contains at least the following members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the calling process has used in executing the instructions of its program . <p> clockt tmsstime <p> This is the processor time the system has used on behalf of the calling process . <p> clockt tmscutime <p> This is the sum of the tmsutime values and the tmscutime values of all terminated child processes of the calling process , whose status has been reported to the parent process by wait or waitpid ; see section Process Completion . In other words , it represents the total processor time used in executing the instructions of all the terminated child processes of the calling process , excluding child processes which have not yet been reported by wait or waitpid . <p> clockt tmscstime <p> This is similar to tmscutime , but represents the total processor time system has used on behalf of all the terminated child processes of the calling process . <p> All of the times are given in numbers of clock ticks . Unlike CPU time , these are the actual amounts of time ; not relative to any event . See section Creating a Process . <p> Function : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times function stores the processor time information for the calling process in buffer . <p> The return value is the calling process ' CPU time ( the same value you get from clock() . times returns ( clockt ) ( -1 ) to indicate failure . <p> Portability Note : The clock function described in section CPU Time Inquiry is specified by the ISO C standard . The times function is a feature of POSIX.1 . In the GNU system , the CPU time is defined to be equivalent to the sum of the tmsutime and tmsstime fields returned by times . <p> Simple time ( the timet data type ) is a compact representation , typically giving the number of seconds of elapsed time since some implementation-specific base time . <p> There is also a " high-resolution time " representation . Like simple time , this represents a calendar time as an elapsed time since a base time , but instead of measuring in whole seconds , it uses a struct timeval data type , which includes fractions of a second . Use this time representation instead of simple time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken-down time ( the struct tm data type ) represents a calendar time as a set of components specifying the year , month , and so on in the Gregorian calendar , for a specific time zone . This calendar time representation is usually used only to communicate with people . <p> This section describes the timet data type for representing calendar time as simple time , and the functions which operate on simple time objects . These facilities are declared in the header file time.h ' . <p> Data Type : timet <p> This is the data type used to represent simple time . Sometimes , it also represents an elapsed time . When interpreted as a calendar time value , it represents the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 on January 1 , 1970 , Coordinated Universal Time . ( This calendar time is sometimes referred to as the epoch . ) POSIX requires that this count not include leap seconds , but on some systems this count includes leap seconds if you set TZ to certain values ( see section Specifying the Time Zone with TZ ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local time zone . Calendar Time T is the same instant in time regardless of where on the globe the computer is . <p> In the GNU C library , timet is equivalent to long int . In other systems , timet might be either an integer or floating-point type . <p> The function difftime tells you the elapsed time between two simple calendar times , which is not always as easy to compute as just subtracting . See section Elapsed Time . <p> Function : timet time ( timet * result ) <p> The time function returns the current calendar time as a value of type timet . If the argument result is not a null pointer , the calendar time value is also stored in * result . If the current calendar time is not available , the value ( timet ) ( -1 ) is returned . <p> Function : int stime ( timet * newtime ) <p> stime sets the system clock , i.e. it tells the system that the current calendar time is newtime , where newtime is interpreted as described in the above definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system clock to better than one second precision . settimeofday is generally a better choice than stime . See section High-Resolution Calendar . <p> Only the superuser can set the system clock . <p> If the function succeeds , the return value is zero . Otherwise , it is -1 and errno is set accordingly : <p> The timet data type used to represent simple times has a resolution of only one second . Some applications need more precision . <p> So , the GNU C library also contains functions which are capable of representing calendar times to a higher resolution than one second . The functions and the associated data types described in this section are declared in sys/time.h ' . <p> Data Type : struct timezone <p> The struct timezone structure is used to hold minimal information about the local time zone . It has the following members : <p> int tzminuteswest <p> This is the number of minutes west of UTC . <p> int tzdsttime <p> If nonzero , Daylight Saving Time applies during some part of the year . <p> The gettimeofday function returns the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struct timeval structure indicated by tp . ( see section Elapsed Time for a description of struct timespec ) . Information about the time zone is returned in the structure pointed at tzp . If the tzp argument is a null pointer , time zone information is ignored . <p> The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure . The following errno error condition is defined for this function : <p> ENOSYS <p> The operating system does not support getting time zone information , and tzp is not a null pointer . The GNU operating system does not support using struct timezone to represent time zone information ; that is an obsolete feature of 4.3 BSD . Instead , use the facilities described in section Functions and Variables for Time Zones . <p> The settimeofday function sets the current calendar time in the system clock according to the arguments . As for gettimeofday , the calendar time is represented as the elapsed time since the epoch . As for gettimeofday , time zone information is ignored if tzp is a null pointer . <p> You must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some kernels automatically set the system clock from some source such as a hardware clock when they start up . Others , including Linux , place the system clock in an " invalid " state ( in which attempts to read the clock fail ) . A call of stime removes the system clock from an invalid state , and system startup scripts typically run a program that calls stime . <p> settimeofday causes a sudden jump forwards or backwards , which can cause a variety of problems in a system . Use adjtime ( below ) to make a smooth transition from one time to another by temporarily speeding up or slowing down the clock . <p> With a Linux kernel , adjtimex does the same thing and can also make permanent changes to the speed of the system clock so it does n't need to be corrected as often . <p> The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure . The following errno error conditions are defined for this function : <p> EPERM <p> This process can not set the clock because it is not privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting time zone information , and tzp is not a null pointer . <p> This function speeds up or slows down the system clock in order to make a gradual adjustment . This ensures that the calendar time reported by the system clock is always monotonically increasing , which might not happen if you simply set the clock . <p> The delta argument specifies a relative adjustment to be made to the clock time . If negative , the system clock is slowed down for a while until it has lost this much elapsed time . If positive , the system clock is speeded up for a while . <p> If the olddelta argument is not a null pointer , the adjtime function returns information about any previous time adjustment that has not yet completed . <p> This function is typically used to synchronize the clocks of computers in a local network . You must be a privileged user to use it . <p> With a Linux kernel , you can use the adjtimex function to permanently change the clock speed . <p> The return value is 0 on success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined for this function : <p> Calendar time is represented by the usual GNU C library functions as an elapsed time since a fixed base calendar time . This is convenient for computation , but has no relation to the way people normally think of calendar time . By contrast , broken-down time is a binary representation of calendar time separated into year , month , day , and so on . Broken-down time values are not useful for calculations , but they are useful for printing human readable time information . <p> A broken-down time value is always relative to a choice of time zone , and it also indicates which time zone that is . <p> The symbols in this section are declared in the header file time.h ' . <p> Data Type : struct tm <p> This is the data type used to represent a broken-down time . The structure contains at least the following members , which can appear in any order . <p> int tmsec <p> This is the number of full seconds since the top of the minute ( normally in the range 0 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow for leap seconds if leap second support is available ) . <p> int tmmin <p> This is the number of full minutes since the top of the hour ( in the range 0 through 59 ) . <p> int tmhour <p> This is the number of full hours past midnight ( in the range 0 through 23 ) . <p> int tmmday <p> This is the ordinal day of the month ( in the range 1 through 31 ) . Watch out for this one ! As the only ordinal number in the structure , it is inconsistent with the rest of the structure . <p> int tmmon <p> This is the number of full calendar months since the beginning of the year ( in the range 0 through 11 ) . Watch out for this one ! People usually use ordinal numbers for month-of-year ( where January = 1 ) . <p> int tmyear <p> This is the number of full calendar years since 1900 . <p> int tmwday <p> This is the number of full days since Sunday ( in the range 0 through 6 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days since the beginning of the year ( in the range 0 through 365 ) . <p> int tmisdst <p> This is a flag that indicates whether Daylight Saving Time is ( or was , or will be ) in effect at the time described . The value is positive if Daylight Saving Time is in effect , zero if it is not , and negative if the information is not available . <p> long int tmgmtoff <p> This field describes the time zone that was used to compute this broken-down time value , including any adjustment for daylight saving ; it is the number of seconds that you must add to UTC to get local time . You can also think of this as the number of seconds east of UTC . For example , for U.S. Eastern Standard Time , the value is -5*60*60 . The tmgmtoff field is derived from BSD and is a GNU library extension ; it is not visible in a strict ISO C environment . <p> const char *tmzone <p> This field is the name for the time zone that was used to compute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a BSD and GNU extension , and is not visible in a strict ISO C environment . <p> Function : struct tm * localtime ( const timet * time ) <p> The localtime function converts the simple time pointed to by time to broken-down time representation , expressed relative to the user 's specified time zone . <p> The return value is a pointer to a static broken-down time structure , which might be overwritten by subsequent calls to ctime , gmtime , or localtime . ( But no other library function overwrites the contents of this object . ) <p> The return value is the null pointer if time can not be represented as a broken-down time ; typically this is because the year can not fit into an int . <p> The localtimer function works just like the localtime function . It takes a pointer to a variable containing a simple time and converts it to the broken-down time format . <p> But the result is not placed in a static buffer . Instead it is placed in the object of type struct tm to which the parameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function returns a pointer to the object the result was written into , i.e. , it returns resultp . <p> Function : struct tm * gmtime ( const timet * time ) <p> This function is similar to localtime , except that the broken-down time is expressed as Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) ( formerly called Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) ) rather than relative to a local time zone . <p> As for the localtime function we have the problem that the result is placed in a static variable . POSIX.1c also provides a replacement for gmtime . <p> This function is similar to localtimer , except that it converts just like gmtime the given time as Coordinated Universal Time . <p> If the conversion is successful the function returns a pointer to the object the result was written into , i.e. , it returns resultp . <p> Function : timet mktime ( struct tm * brokentime ) <p> The mktime function is used to convert a broken-down time structure to a simple time representation . It also " normalizes " the contents of the broken-down time structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year based on the other date and time components . <p> The mktime function ignores the specified contents of the tmwday and tmyday members of the broken-down time structure . It uses the values of the other components to determine the calendar time ; it 's permissible for these components to have unnormalized values outside their normal ranges . The last thing that mktime does is adjust the components of the brokentime structure ( including the tmwday and tmyday ) . <p> If the specified broken-down time can not be represented as a simple time , mktime returns a value of ( timet ) ( -1 ) and does not modify the contents of brokentime . <p> timegm is functionally identical to mktime except it always takes the input values to be Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) regardless of any local time zone setting . <p> Note that timegm is the inverse of gmtime . <p> Portability note : mktime is essentially universally available . timegm is rather rare . For the most portable conversion from a UTC broken-down time to a simple time , set the TZ environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . <p> The ntpgettime and ntpadjtime functions provide an interface to monitor and manipulate the system clock to maintain high accuracy time . For example , you can fine tune the speed of the clock or synchronize it with another time source . <p> A typical use of these functions is by a server implementing the Network Time Protocol to synchronize the clocks of multiple systems and high precision clocks . <p> These functions are declared in sys/timex.h ' . <p> Data Type : struct ntptimeval <p> This structure is used for information about the system clock . It contains the following members : <p> struct timeval time <p> This is the current calendar time , expressed as the elapsed time since the epoch . The struct timeval data type is described in section Elapsed Time . <p> long int maxerror <p> This is the maximum error , measured in microseconds . Unless updated via ntpadjtime periodically , this value will reach some platform-specific maximum value . <p> long int esterror <p> This is the estimated error , measured in microseconds . This value can be set by ntpadjtime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true calendar time . <p> Function : int ntpgettime ( struct ntptimeval * tptr ) <p> The ntpgettime function sets the structure pointed to by tptr to current values . The elements of the structure afterwards contain the values the timer implementation in the kernel assumes . They might or might not be correct . If they are not a ntpadjtime call is necessary . <p> The return value is 0 on success and other values on failure . The following errno error conditions are defined for this function : <p> TIMEERROR <p> The precision clock model is not properly set up at the moment , thus the clock must be considered unsynchronized , and the values should be treated with care . <p> Data Type : struct timex <p> This structure is used to control and monitor the system clock . It contains the following members : <p> unsigned int modes <p> This variable controls whether and which values are set . Several symbolic constants have to be combined with binary or to specify the effective mode . These constants start with MOD . <p> long int offset <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true calendar time . The value is given in microseconds . If bit MODOFFSET is set in modes , the offset ( and possibly other dependent values ) can be set . The offset 's absolute value must not exceed MAXPHASE . <p> long int frequency <p> This value indicates the difference in frequency between the true calendar time and the system clock . The value is expressed as scaled PPM ( parts per million , 0.0001% ) . The scaling is 1 &lt;&lt; SHIFTUSEC . The value can be set with bit MODFREQUENCY , but the absolute value must not exceed MAXFREQ . <p> long int maxerror <p> This is the maximum error , measured in microseconds . A new value can be set using bit MODMAXERROR . Unless updated via ntpadjtime periodically , this value will increase steadily and reach some platform-specific maximum value . <p> long int esterror <p> This is the estimated error , measured in microseconds . This value can be set using bit MODESTERROR . <p> int status <p> This variable reflects the various states of the clock machinery . There are symbolic constants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these flags can be updated using the MODSTATUS bit . <p> long int constant <p> This value represents the bandwidth or stiffness of the PLL ( phase locked loop ) implemented in the kernel . The value can be changed using bit MODTIMECONST . <p> long int precision <p> This value represents the accuracy or the maximum error when reading the system clock . The value is expressed in microseconds . <p> long int tolerance <p> This value represents the maximum frequency error of the system clock in scaled PPM . This value is used to increase the maxerror every second . <p> struct timeval time <p> The current calendar time . <p> long int tick <p> The elapsed time between clock ticks in microseconds . A clock tick is a periodic timer interrupt on which the system clock is based . <p> long int ppsfreq <p> This is the first of a few optional variables that are present only if the system clock can use a PPS ( pulse per second ) signal to discipline the system clock . The value is expressed in scaled PPM and it denotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPS signal . <p> long int jitter <p> This value expresses a median filtered average of the PPS signal 's dispersion in microseconds . <p> int shift <p> This value is a binary exponent for the duration of the PPS calibration interval , ranging from PPSSHIFT to PPSSHIFTMAX . <p> long int stabil <p> This value represents the median filtered dispersion of the PPS frequency in scaled PPM . <p> long int jitcnt <p> This counter represents the number of pulses where the jitter exceeded the allowed maximum MAXTIME . <p> long int calcnt <p> This counter reflects the number of successful calibration intervals . <p> long int errcnt <p> This counter represents the number of calibration errors ( caused by large offsets or jitter ) . <p> long int stbcnt <p> This counter denotes the number of of calibrations where the stability exceeded the threshold . <p> Function : int ntpadjtime ( struct timex * tptr ) <p> The ntpadjtime function sets the structure specified by tptr to current values . <p> In addition , ntpadjtime updates some settings to match what you pass to it in * tptr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings to update . You can set offset , freq , maxerror , esterror , status , constant , and tick . <p> modes = zero means set nothing . <p> Only the superuser can update settings . <p> The return value is 0 on success and other values on failure . The following errno error conditions are defined for this function : <p> TIMEERROR <p> The high accuracy clock model is not properly set up at the moment , thus the clock must be considered unsynchronized , and the values should be treated with care . Another reason could be that the specified new values are not allowed . <p> EPERM <p> The process specified a settings update , but is not superuser . <p> For more details see RFC1305 ( Network Time Protocol , Version 3 ) and related documents . <p> Portability note : Early versions of the GNU C library did not have this function but did have the synonymous adjtimex . <p> This function is similar to asctime but instead of placing the result in a static buffer it writes the string in the buffer pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for at least 26 bytes , including the terminating null . <p> If no error occurred the function returns a pointer to the string the result was written into , i.e. , it returns buffer . Otherwise return NULL . <p> Function : char * ctime ( const timet * time ) <p> The ctime function is similar to asctime , except that you specify the calendar time argument as a timet simple time value rather than in broken-down local time format . It is equivalent to <p> This function is similar to ctime , but places the result in the string pointed to by buffer . It is equivalent to ( written using gcc extensions , see section Statement Exprs ' in Porting and Using gcc ) : <p> ( struct tm tm ; asctimer ( localtimer ( time , &tm),; buf ) ; ) <p> If no error occurred the function returns a pointer to the string the result was written into , i.e. , it returns buffer . Otherwise return NULL . <p> This function is similar to the sprintf function ( see section Formatted Input ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format template template are specialized for printing components of the date and time brokentime according to the locale currently specified for time conversion ( see section Locales and Internationalization ) . <p> Ordinary characters appearing in the template are copied to the output string s ; this can include multibyte character sequences . Conversion specifiers are introduced by a % ' character , followed by an optional flag which can be one of the following . These flags are all GNU extensions . The first three affect only the output of numbers : <p> <p> The number is padded with spaces . <p> - <p> The number is not padded at all . <p> 0 <p> The number is padded with zeros even if the format specifies padding with spaces . <p> <p> The output uses uppercase characters , but only if this is possible ( see section Case Conversion ) . <p> The default action is to pad the number with zeros to keep it a constant width . Numbers that do not have a range indicated below are never padded , since there is no natural width for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width is possible . This is specified in decimal notation . If the natural size of the output is of the field has less than the specified number of characters , the result is written right adjusted and space padded to the given size . <p> An optional modifier can follow the optional flag and width specification . The modifiers , which were first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 , are : <p> E <p> Use the locale 's alternate representation for date and time . This modifier applies to the %c , %C , %x , %X , %y and %Y format specifiers . In a Japanese locale , for example , %Ex might yield a date format based on the Japanese Emperors ' reigns . <p> O <p> Use the locale 's alternate numeric symbols for numbers . This modifier applies only to numeric format specifiers . <p> If the format supports the modifier but no alternate representation is available , it is ignored . <p> The conversion specifier ends with a format specifier taken from the following list . The whole % ' sequence is replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale . <p> %A <p> The full weekday name according to the current locale . <p> %b <p> The abbreviated month name according to the current locale . <p> %B <p> The full month name according to the current locale . <p> %c <p> The preferred calendar time representation for the current locale . <p> %C <p> The century of the year . This is equivalent to the greatest integer not greater than the year divided by 100 . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %d <p> The day of the month as a decimal number ( range 01 through 31 ) . <p> %D <p> The date using the format %m/%d/%y . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %e <p> The day of the month like with %d , but padded with blank ( range 1 through 31 ) . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %F <p> The date using the format %Y-%m-%d . This is the form specified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all uses . This format was first standardized by ISO C99 and by POSIX.1-2001 . <p> %g <p> The year corresponding to the ISO week number , but without the century ( range 00 through 99 ) . This has the same format and value as %y , except that if the ISO week number ( see %V ) belongs to the previous or next year , that year is used instead . This format was first standardized by ISO C99 and by POSIX.1-2001 . <p> %G <p> The year corresponding to the ISO week number . This has the same format and value as %Y , except that if the ISO week number ( see %V ) belongs to the previous or next year , that year is used instead . This format was first standardized by ISO C99 and by POSIX.1-2001 but was previously available as a GNU extension . <p> %h <p> The abbreviated month name according to the current locale . The action is the same as for %b . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %H <p> The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range 00 through 23 ) . <p> %I <p> The hour as a decimal number , using a 12-hour clock ( range 01 through 12 ) . <p> %j <p> The day of the year as a decimal number ( range 001 through 366 ) . <p> %k <p> The hour as a decimal number , using a 24-hour clock like %H , but padded with blank ( range 0 through 23 ) . This format is a GNU extension . <p> %l <p> The hour as a decimal number , using a 12-hour clock like %I , but padded with blank ( range 1 through 12 ) . This format is a GNU extension . <p> %m <p> The month as a decimal number ( range 01 through 12 ) . <p> %M <p> The minute as a decimal number ( range 00 through 59 ) . <p> %n <p> A single n ' ( newline ) character . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %p <p> Either AM ' or PM ' , according to the given time value ; or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as PM ' and midnight as AM ' . In most locales AM ' / PM ' format is not supported , in such cases " %p " yields an empty string . <p> %P <p> Either am ' or pm ' , according to the given time value ; or the corresponding strings for the current locale , printed in lowercase characters . Noon is treated as pm ' and midnight as am ' . In most locales AM ' / PM ' format is not supported , in such cases " %P " yields an empty string . This format is a GNU extension . <p> %r <p> The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . In the POSIX locale , this format is equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p . <p> %R <p> The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format %H : %M . This format was first standardized by ISO C99 and by POSIX.1-2001 but was previously available as a GNU extension . <p> %s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC . Leap seconds are not counted unless leap second support is available . This format is a GNU extension . <p> %S <p> The seconds as a decimal number ( range 00 through 60 ) . <p> %t <p> A single t ' ( tabulator ) character . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %T <p> The time of day using decimal numbers using the format %H : %M : %S . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %u <p> The day of the week as a decimal number ( range 1 through 7 ) , Monday being 1 . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %U <p> The week number of the current year as a decimal number ( range 00 through 53 ) , starting with the first Sunday as the first day of the first week . Days preceding the first Sunday in the year are considered to be in week 00 . <p> %V <p> The ISO 8601:1988 week number as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISO weeks start with Monday and end with Sunday . Week 01 of a year is the first week which has the majority of its days in that year ; this is equivalent to the week containing the year 's first Thursday , and it is also equivalent to the week containing January 4 . Week 01 of a year can contain days from the previous year . The week before week 01 of a year is the last week ( 52 or 53 ) of the previous year even if it contains days from the new year . This format was first standardized by POSIX.2-1992 and by ISO C99 . <p> %w <p> The day of the week as a decimal number ( range 0 through 6 ) , Sunday being 0 . <p> %W <p> The week number of the current year as a decimal number ( range 00 through 53 ) , starting with the first Monday as the first day of the first week . All days preceding the first Monday in the year are considered to be in week 00 . <p> %x <p> The preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The preferred time of day representation for the current locale . <p> %y <p> The year without a century as a decimal number ( range 00 through 99 ) . This is equivalent to the year modulo 100 . <p> %Y <p> The year as a decimal number , using the Gregorian calendar . Years before the year 1 are numbered 0 , -1 , and so on . <p> %z <p> RFC 822/ISO 8601:1988 style numeric time zone ( e.g. , -0600 or +0100 ) , or nothing if no time zone is determinable . This format was first standardized by ISO C99 and by POSIX.1-2001 but was previously available as a GNU extension . In the POSIX locale , a full RFC 822 timestamp is generated by the format " %a , %d %b %Y %H : %M : %S %z " ' ( or the equivalent " %a , %d %b %Y %T %z " ' ) . <p> %Z <p> The time zone abbreviation ( empty if the time zone ca n't be determined ) . <p> %% <p> A literal % ' character . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of characters to be stored in the array s , including the terminating null character . If the formatted time requires more than size characters , strftime returns zero and the contents of the array s are undefined . Otherwise the return value indicates the number of characters placed in the array s , not including the terminating null character . <p> Warning : This convention for the return value which is prescribed in ISO C can lead to problems in some situations . For certain format strings and certain locales the output really can be the empty string and this can not be discovered by testing the return value only . E.g. , in most locales the AM/PM time format is not supported ( most of the world uses the 24 hour time representation ) . In such locales " %p " will return the empty string , i.e. , the return value is zero . To detect situations like this something similar to the following code should be used : <p> The wcsftime function is equivalent to the strftime function with the difference that it operates on wide character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to by s , must be an array of wide characters . The parameter size which specifies the size of the output buffer gives the number of wide character , not the number of bytes . <p> Also the format string template is a wide character string . Since all characters needed to specify the format string are in the basic character set it is portably possible to write format strings in the C source code using the L " ... " notation . The parameter brokentime has the same meaning as in the strftime call . <p> The wcsftime function supports the same flags , modifiers , and format specifiers as the strftime function . <p> The return value of wcsftime is the number of wide characters stored in s . When more characters would have to be written than can be placed in the buffer s the return value is zero , with the same problems indicated in the strftime documentation . <p> The ISO C standard does not specify any functions which can convert the output of the strftime function back into a binary format . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfaces over the years . Then the Unix standard was extended by the addition of two functions : strptime and getdate . Both have strange interfaces but at least they are widely available . <p> he first function is rather low-level . It is nevertheless frequently used in software since it is better known . Its interface and implementation are heavily influenced by the getdate function , which is defined and implemented in terms of calls to strptime . <p> The strptime function parses the input string s according to the format string fmt and stores its results in the structure tp . <p> The input string could be generated by a strftime call or obtained any other way . It does not need to be in a human-recognizable format ; e.g. a date passed as " 02:1999:9 " is acceptable , even though it is ambiguous without context . As long as the format string fmt matches the input string the function will succeed . <p> The user has to make sure , though , that the input can be parsed in a unambiguous way . The string " 1999112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1999-1-12 , 1999-11-2 , or even 19991-1-2 . It is necessary to add appropriate separators to reliably get results . <p> The format string consists of the same components as the format string of the strftime function . The only difference is that the flags , - , 0 , and are not allowed . Several of the distinct formats of strftime do the same work in strptime since differences like case of the input do not matter . For reasons of symmetry all formats are supported , though . <p> The modifiers E and O are also allowed everywhere the strftime function allows them . <p> The formats are : <p> %a <p> %A <p> The weekday name according to the current locale , in abbreviated form or the full name . <p> %b <p> %B <p> %h <p> The month name according to the current locale , in abbreviated form or the full name . <p> %c <p> The date and time representation for the current locale . <p> %Ec <p> Like %c but the locale 's alternative date and time format is used . <p> %C <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this format only if the format string also contains the %y format . <p> %EC <p> The locale 's representation of the period . Unlike %C it sometimes makes sense to use this format since some cultures represent years relative to the beginning of eras instead of using the Gregorian years . <p> %d <p> %e <p> The day of the month as a decimal number ( range 1 through 31 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . <p> %Od <p> %Oe <p> Same as %d but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . <p> %D <p> Equivalent to %m/%d/%y . <p> %F <p> Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d , which is the ISO 8601 date format . This is a GNU extension following an ISO C99 extension to strftime . <p> %g <p> The year corresponding to the ISO week number , but without the century ( range 00 through 99 ) . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strftime . <p> %G <p> The year corresponding to the ISO week number . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . This format is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of strftime . <p> %H <p> %k <p> The hour as a decimal number , using a 24-hour clock ( range 00 through 23 ) . %k is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of strftime . <p> %OH <p> Same as %H but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %I <p> %l <p> The hour as a decimal number , using a 12-hour clock ( range 01 through 12 ) . %l is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of strftime . <p> %OI <p> Same as %I but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %j <p> The day of the year as a decimal number ( range 1 through 366 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . <p> %m <p> The month as a decimal number ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not required . <p> %Om <p> Same as %m but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %M <p> The minute as a decimal number ( range 0 through 59 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . <p> %OM <p> Same as %M but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %n <p> %t <p> Matches any white space . <p> %p <p> %P <p> The locale-dependent equivalent to AM ' or PM ' . This format is not useful unless %I or %l is also used . Another complication is that the locale might not define these values at all and therefore the conversion fails . %P is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to strftime . <p> %r <p> The complete time using the AM/PM format of the current locale . A complication is that the locale might not define this format at all and therefore the conversion fails . <p> %R <p> The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format %H : %M . %R is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to strftime . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC . Leap seconds are not counted unless leap second support is available . %s is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to strftime . <p> %S <p> The seconds as a decimal number ( range 0 through 60 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note : The Unix specification says the upper bound on this value is 61 , a result of a decision to allow double leap seconds . You will not see the value 61 because no minute has more than one leap second , but the myth persists . <p> %OS <p> Same as %S but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %T <p> Equivalent to the use of %H : %M : %S in this place . <p> %u <p> The day of the week as a decimal number ( range 1 through 7 ) , Monday being 1 . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as a decimal number ( range 0 through 53 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . <p> %OU <p> Same as %U but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %V <p> The ISO 8601:1988 week number as a decimal number ( range 1 through 53 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . <p> %w <p> The day of the week as a decimal number ( range 0 through 6 ) , Sunday being 0 . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . <p> %Ow <p> Same as %w but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %W <p> The week number of the current year as a decimal number ( range 0 through 53 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . <p> %OW <p> Same as %W but using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %x <p> The date using the locale 's date format . <p> %Ex <p> Like %x but the locale 's alternative data representation is used . <p> %X <p> The time using the locale 's time format . <p> %EX <p> Like %X but the locale 's alternative time representation is used . <p> %y <p> The year without a century as a decimal number ( range 0 through 99 ) . Leading zeroes are permitted but not required . Note that it is questionable to use this format without the %C format . The strptime function does regard input values in the range 68 to 99 as the years 1969 to 1999 and the values 0 to 68 as the years 2000 to 2068 . But maybe this heuristic fails for some input data . Therefore it is best to avoid %y completely and use %Y instead . <p> %Ey <p> The offset from %EC in the locale 's alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from %C ) using the locale 's alternative numeric symbols . <p> %Y <p> The year as a decimal number , using the Gregorian calendar . <p> %EY <p> The full alternative year representation . <p> %z <p> The offset from GMT in ISO 8601/RFC822 format . <p> %Z <p> The timezone name . Note : Currently , this is not fully implemented . The format is recognized , input is consumed but no field in tm is set . <p> %% <p> A literal % ' character . <p> All other characters in the format string must have a matching character in the input string . Exceptions are white spaces in the input string which can match zero or more whitespace characters in the format string . <p> Portability Note : The XPG standard advises applications to use at least one whitespace character ( as specified by isspace ) or other non-alphanumeric characters between any two conversion specifications . The GNU C Library does not have this limitation but other libraries might have trouble parsing formats like " %d%m%Y%H%M%S " . <p> The strptime function processes the input string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input elements ( white space , literal , or format ) are handled one after the other . If the input can not be matched to the format string the function stops . The remainder of the format and input strings are not processed . <p> The function returns a pointer to the first character it was unable to process . If the input string contains more characters than required by the format string the return value points right after the last consumed input character . If the whole input string is consumed the return value points to the NULL byte at the end of the string . If an error occurs , i.e. strptime fails to match all of the format string , the function returns NULL . <p> The specification of the function in the XPG standard is rather vague , leaving out a few important pieces of information . Most importantly , it does not specify what happens to those elements of tm which are not directly initialized by the different formats . The implementations on different Unix systems vary here . <p> The GNU libc implementation does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exceptions are the tmwday and tmyday elements , which are recomputed if any of the year , month , or date elements changed . This has two implications : <p> Before calling the strptime function for a new input string , you should prepare the tm structure you pass . Normally this will mean initializing all values are to zero . Alternatively , you can set all fields to values like INTMAX , allowing you to determine which elements were set by the function call . Zero does not work here since it is a valid value for many of the fields . Careful initialization is necessary if you want to find out whether a certain field in tm was initialized by the function call . <p> You can construct a struct tm value with several consecutive strptime calls . A useful application of this is e.g. the parsing of two separate strings , one containing date information and the other time information . By parsing one after the other without clearing the structure in-between , you can construct a complete broken-down time . <p> The following example shows a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either US style or ISO 8601 form : <p> The Unix standard defines another function for parsing date strings . The interface is weird , but if the function happens to suit your application it is just fine . It is problematic to use this function in multi-threaded programs or libraries , since it returns a pointer to a static variable , and uses a global variable and global state ( an environment variable ) . <p> Variable : getdateerr <p> This variable of type int contains the error code of the last unsuccessful call to getdate . Defined values are : <p> 1 <p> The environment variable DATEMSK is not defined or null . <p> 2 <p> The template file denoted by the DATEMSK environment variable can not be opened . <p> 3 <p> Information about the template file can not retrieved . <p> 4 <p> The template file is not a regular file . <p> 5 <p> An I/O error occurred while reading the template file . <p> 6 <p> Not enough memory available to execute the function . <p> 7 <p> The template file contains no matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would match a template otherwise . This includes dates like February 31st , and dates which can not be represented in a timet variable . <p> Function : struct tm * getdate ( const char * string ) <p> The interface to getdate is the simplest possible for a function to parse a string and return the value . string is the input string and the result is returned in a statically-allocated variable . <p> The details about how the string is processed are hidden from the user . In fact , they can be outside the control of the program . Which formats are recognized is controlled by the file named by the environment variable DATEMSK . This file should contain lines of valid format strings which could be passed to strptime . <p> The getdate function reads these format strings one after the other and tries to match the input string . The first line which completely matches the input string is used . <p> Elements not initialized through the format string retain the values present at the time of the getdate function call . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See above for an explanation . There are only a few extensions to the strptime behavior : <p> If the %Z format is given the broken-down time is based on the current time of the timezone matched , not of the current timezone of the runtime environment . Note : This is not implemented ( currently ) . The problem is that timezone names are not unique . If a fixed timezone is assumed for a given string ( say EST meaning US East Coast time ) , then uses for countries other than the USA will fail . So far we have found no good solution to this . <p> If only the weekday is specified the selected day depends on the current date . If the current weekday is greater or equal to the tmwday value the current week 's day is chosen , otherwise the day next week is chosen . <p> A similar heuristic is used when only the month is given and not the year . If the month is greater than or equal to the current month , then the current year is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the month is assumed if one is not explicitly specified . <p> The current hour , minute , and second are used if the appropriate value is not set through the format . <p> If no date is given tomorrow 's date is used if the time is smaller than the current time . Otherwise today 's date is taken . <p> It should be noted that the format in the template file need not only contain format elements . The following is a list of possible format strings ( taken from the Unix standard ) : <p> As you can see , the template list can contain very specific strings like run job at %I %p , %B %dnd . Using the above list of templates and assuming the current time is Mon Sep 22 12:19:47 EDT 1986 we can obtain the following results for the given input . <p> Input @tab Match @tab Result <p> Mon @tab %a @tab Mon Sep 22 12:19:47 EDT 1986 <p> Sun @tab %a @tab Sun Sep 28 12:19:47 EDT 1986 <p> Fri @tab %a @tab Fri Sep 26 12:19:47 EDT 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 <p> January @tab %B @tab Thu Jan 1 12:19:47 EST 1987 <p> December @tab %B @tab Mon Dec 1 12:19:47 EST 1986 <p> Sep Mon @tab %b %a @tab Mon Sep 1 12:19:47 EDT 1986 <p> Jan Fri @tab %b %a @tab Fri Jan 2 12:19:47 EST 1987 <p> Dec Mon @tab %b %a @tab Mon Dec 1 12:19:47 EST 1986 <p> Jan Wed 1989 @tab %b %a %Y @tab Wed Jan 4 12:19:47 EST 1989 <p> Fri 9 @tab %a %H @tab Fri Sep 26 09:00:00 EDT 1986 <p> Feb 10:30 @tab %b %H : %S @tab Sun Feb 1 10:00:30 EST 1987 <p> 10:30 @tab %H : %M @tab Tue Sep 23 10:30:00 EDT 1986 <p> 13:30 @tab %H : %M @tab Mon Sep 22 13:30:00 EDT 1986 The return value of the function is a pointer to a static variable of type struct tm , or a null pointer if an error occurred . The result is only valid until the next getdate call , making this function unusable in multi-threaded applications . The errno variable is not changed . Error conditions are stored in the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possible error values . Warning : The getdate function should never be used in SUID-programs . The reason is obvious : using the DATEMSK environment variable you can get the function to open any arbitrary file and chances are high that with some bogus input ( such as a binary file ) the program will crash . <p> Function : int getdater ( const char * string , struct tm * tp ) <p> The getdater function is the reentrant counterpart of getdate . It does not use the global variable getdateerr to signal an error , but instead returns an error code . The same error codes as described in the getdateerr documentation above are used , with 0 meaning success . Moreover , getdater stores the broken-down time in the variable of type struct tm pointed to by the second argument , rather than in a static variable . This function is not defined in the Unix standard . Nevertheless it is available on some other Unix systems as well . The warning against using getdate in SUID-programs applies to getdater as well . <p> In POSIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of the TZ environment variable . For information about how to set environment variables , see section Environment Variables . The functions for accessing the time zone are declared in time.h ' . <p> You should not normally need to set TZ . If the system is configured properly , the default time zone will be correct . You might set TZ if you are using a computer over a network from a different time zone , and would like times reported to you in the time zone local to you , rather than what is local to the computer . <p> In POSIX.1 systems the value of the TZ variable can be in one of three formats . With the GNU C library , the most common format is the last one , which can specify a selection from a large database of time zone information for many regions of the world . The first two formats are used to describe the time zone information directly , which is both more cumbersome and less precise . But the POSIX.1 standard only specifies the details of the first two formats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case you come across a POSIX.1 system that does n't support a time zone information database . <p> The first format is used when there is no Daylight Saving Time ( or summer time ) in the local time zone : <p> std offset <p> The std string specifies the name of the time zone . It must be three or more characters long and must not contain a leading colon , embedded digits , commas , nor plus and minus signs . There is no space character separating the time zone name from the offset , so these restrictions are necessary to parse the specification correctly . <p> The offset specifies the time value you must add to the local time to get a Coordinated Universal Time value . It has syntax like + - hh : mm : ss . This is positive if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and negative if it is east . The hour must be between 0 and 23 , and the minute and seconds between 0 and 59 . <p> For example , here is how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saving Time alternative : <p> EST+5 <p> The second format is used when there is Daylight Saving Time : <p> std offset dst offset , start / time , end / time <p> The initial std and offset specify the standard time zone , as described above . The dst string and offset specify the name and offset for the corresponding Daylight Saving Time zone ; if the offset is omitted , it defaults to one hour ahead of standard time . <p> The remainder of the specification describes when Daylight Saving Time is in effect . The start field is when Daylight Saving Time goes into effect and the end field is when the change is made back to standard time . The following formats are recognized for these fields : <p> J n <p> This specifies the Julian day , with n between 1 and 365 . February 29 is never counted , even in leap years . <p> n <p> This specifies the Julian day , with n between 0 and 365 . February 29 is counted in leap years . <p> M m . w . d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m . The day d must be between 0 ( Sunday ) and 6 . The week w must be between 1 and 5 ; week 1 is the first week in which day d occurs , and week 5 specifies the last d day in the month . The month m should be between 1 and 12 . <p> The time fields specify when , in the local time currently in effect , the change to the other time occurs . If omitted , the default is 02:00:00 . <p> For example , here is how you would specify the Eastern time zone in the United States , including the appropriate Daylight Saving Time and its dates of applicability . The normal offset from UTC is 5 hours ; since this is west of the prime meridian , the sign is positive . Summer time begins on the first Sunday in April at 2:00am , and ends on the last Sunday in October at 2:00am . <p> EST+5EDT , M4.1.0/2 , M10.5.0/2 <p> The schedule of Daylight Saving Time in any particular jurisdiction has changed over the years . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past should be based on the schedule that was in effect then . However , this format has no facilities to let you specify how the schedule has changed from year to year . The most you can do is specify one particular schedule--usually the present day schedule--and this is used to convert any date , no matter when . For precise time zone specifications , it is best to use the time zone information database ( see below ) . <p> The third format looks like this : <p> : characters <p> Each operating system interprets this format differently ; in the GNU C library , characters is the name of a file which describes the time zone . <p> If the TZ environment variable does not have a value , the operation chooses a time zone by default . In the GNU C library , the default time zone is like the specification TZ= : /etc/localtime ' ( or TZ= : /usr/local/etc/localtime ' , depending on how GNU C library was configured ; see section Installing the GNU C Library ) . Other C libraries use their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little we can say about them . <p> If characters begins with a slash , it is an absolute file name ; otherwise the library looks for the file /share/lib/zoneinfo/ characters ' . The zoneinfo ' directory contains data files describing local time zones in many different parts of the world . The names represent major cities , with subdirectories for geographical areas ; for example , America/NewYork ' , Europe/London ' , Asia/HongKong ' . These data files are installed by the system administrator , who also sets /etc/localtime ' to point to the data file for the local time zone . The GNU C library comes with a large database of time zone information for most regions of the world , which is maintained by a community of volunteers and put in the public domain . <p> The array tzname contains two strings , which are the standard names of the pair of time zones ( standard and Daylight Saving ) that the user has selected . tzname0 is the name of the standard time zone ( for example , " EST " ) , and tzname1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time is in use ( for example , " EDT " ) . These correspond to the std and dst strings ( respectively ) from the TZ environment variable . If Daylight Saving Time is never used , tzname1 is the empty string . <p> The tzname array is initialized from the TZ environment variable whenever tzset , ctime , strftime , mktime , or localtime is called . If multiple abbreviations have been used ( e.g. " EWT " and " EDT " for U.S. Eastern War Time and Eastern Daylight Time ) , the array contains the most recent abbreviation . <p> The tzname array is required for POSIX.1 compatibility , but in GNU programs it is better to use the tmzone member of the broken-down time structure , since tmzone reports the correct abbreviation even when it is not the latest one . <p> Though the strings are declared as char * the user must refrain from modifying these strings . Modifying the strings will almost certainly lead to trouble . <p> Function : void tzset ( void ) <p> The tzset function initializes the tzname variable from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not usually necessary for your program to call this function , because it is called automatically when you use the other time conversion functions that depend on the time zone . <p> The following variables are defined for compatibility with System V Unix . Like tzname , these variables are set by calling tzset or the other time conversion functions . <p> Variable : long int timezone <p> This contains the difference between UTC and the latest local standard time , in seconds west of UTC . For example , in the U.S. Eastern time zone , the value is 5*60*60 . Unlike the tmgmtoff member of the broken-down time structure , this value is not adjusted for daylight saving , and its sign is reversed . In GNU programs it is better to use tmgmtoff , since it contains the correct offset even when it is not the latest one . <p> Variable : int daylight <p> This variable has a nonzero value if Daylight Saving Time rules apply . A nonzero value does not necessarily mean that Daylight Saving Time is now in effect ; it means only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm and setitimer functions provide a mechanism for a process to interrupt itself in the future . They do this by setting a timer ; when the timer expires , the process receives a signal . <p> Each process has three independent interval timers available : <p> A real-time timer that counts elapsed time . This timer sends a SIGALRM signal to the process when it expires . <p> A virtual timer that counts processor time used by the process . This timer sends a SIGVTALRM signal to the process when it expires . <p> A profiling timer that counts both processor time used by the process , and processor time spent in system calls on behalf of the process . This timer sends a SIGPROF signal to the process when it expires . This timer is useful for profiling in interpreters . The interval timer mechanism does not have the fine granularity necessary for profiling native code . <p> You can only have one timer of each kind set at any given time . If you set a timer that has not yet expired , that timer is simply reset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handler for the appropriate alarm signal using signal or sigaction before issuing a call to setitimer or alarm . Otherwise , an unusual chain of events could cause the timer to expire before your program establishes the handler . In this case it would be terminated , since termination is the default action for the alarm signals . See section Signal Handling . <p> To be able to use the alarm function to interrupt a system call which might block otherwise indefinitely it is important to not set the SARESTART flag when registering the signal handler using sigaction . When not using sigaction things get even uglier : the signal function has to fixed semantics with respect to restarts . The BSD semantics for this function is to set the flag . Therefore , if sigaction for whatever reason can not be used , it is necessary to use sysvsignal and not signal . <p> The setitimer function is the primary means for setting an alarm . This facility is declared in the header file sys/time.h ' . The alarm function , declared in unistd.h ' , provides a somewhat simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : struct itimerval <p> This structure is used to specify when a timer should expire . It contains the following members : <p> struct timeval itinterval <p> This is the period between successive timer interrupts . If zero , the alarm will only be sent once . <p> struct timeval itvalue <p> This is the period between now and the first timer interrupt . If zero , the alarm is disabled . <p> If you simply want your process to wait for a given number of seconds , you should use the sleep function . See section Sleeping . <p> You should n't count on the signal arriving precisely when the timer expires . In a multiprocessing environment there is typically some amount of delay involved . <p> Portability Note : The setitimer and getitimer functions are derived from BSD Unix , while the alarm function is specified by the POSIX.1 standard . setitimer is more powerful than alarm , but alarm is more widely used . <p> The function sleep gives a simple way to make the program wait for a short interval . If your program does n't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect sleep to wait reliably throughout the specified interval . Otherwise , sleep can return sooner if a signal arrives ; if you want to wait for a given interval regardless of signals , use select ( see section Waiting for Input or Output ) and do n't specify any descriptors to wait for . <p> Function : unsigned int sleep ( unsigned int seconds ) <p> The sleep function waits for seconds or until a signal is delivered , whichever happens first . <p> If sleep function returns because the requested interval is over , it returns a value of zero . If it returns because of delivery of a signal , its return value is the remaining time in the sleep interval . <p> The sleep function is declared in unistd.h ' . <p> Resist the temptation to implement a sleep for a fixed amount of time by using the return value of sleep , when nonzero , to call sleep again . This will work with a certain amount of accuracy as long as signals arrive infrequently . But each signal can cause the eventual wakeup time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few signals happen to arrive in rapid succession by bad luck--there is no limit on how much this could shorten or lengthen the wait . <p> Instead , compute the calendar time at which the program should stop waiting , and keep trying to wait until that calendar time . This wo n't be off by more than a second . With just a little more work , you can use select and make the waiting period quite accurate . ( Of course , heavy system load can cause additional unavoidable delays--unless the machine is dedicated to one application , there is no way you can avoid this . ) <p> On some systems , sleep can do strange things if your program uses SIGALRM explicitly . Even if SIGALRM signals are being ignored or blocked when sleep is called , sleep might return prematurely on delivery of a SIGALRM signal . If you have established a handler for SIGALRM signals and a SIGALRM signal is delivered while the process is sleeping , the action taken might be just to cause sleep to return instead of invoking your handler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal whose handler requests an alarm or alters the handling of SIGALRM , this handler and sleep will interfere . <p> On the GNU system , it is safe to use sleep and SIGALRM in the same program , because sleep does not work by means of SIGALRM . <p> If resolution to seconds is not enough the nanosleep function can be used . As the name suggests the sleep interval can be specified in nanoseconds . The actual elapsed time of the sleep interval might be longer since the system rounds the elapsed time you request up to the next integer multiple of the actual resolution the system can deliver . <p> * requestedtime is the elapsed time of the interval you want to sleep . <p> The function returns as * remaining the elapsed time left in the interval for which you requested to sleep . If the interval completed without getting interrupted by a signal , this is zero . <p> If the function returns because the interval is over the return value is zero . If the function returns -1 the global variable errno is set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted because a signal was delivered to the thread . If the remaining parameter is not the null pointer the structure pointed to by remaining is updated to contain the remaining elapsed time . <p> EINVAL <p> The nanosecond value in the requestedtime parameter contains an illegal value . Either the value is negative or greater than or equal to 1000 million . <p> This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs . This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources ( like memory , file descriptors , semaphores or whatever ) at the time nanosleep is called . If the thread gets canceled these resources stay allocated until the program ends . To avoid this 
##1231651 <h> Embassies Are Broke , Ca n't Shore Up Nigeria 's Image -- Ashiru <p> ABUJA , November 26 , ( THEWILL ) - The Minister of Foreign Affairs , Mr. Gbenga Ashiru on Monday said that Nigerian embassies are broke , handicapped and unable to shore up the nation 's image . <p> The Minister told Senators that the poor image of the country abroad would not improve as a result of inadequate funding . <p> Ashiru who stated this while defending the 2013 budget of the ministry before the Senate committee on Foreign Affairs , disagreed with the committee over suggestions that some embassies should be closed for want of funds to sustain them . <p> He argued that the move to close down Nigerian embassies would accrue cost , could be reversed by future governments and would send a wrong signal to the host nation . <p> He nonetheless advanced that a cut down in staff size would serve as a way out . <p> He said the Ministry expected to receive N134 billion in 2012 but got only N46 billion for the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You have to design ways you can help us so that we can adjust those challenges . There is a template in the budget , which is for assisting Nigerians , the figures are not enough . That is where we can make a difference . Ambassadors can not do it if they do n't have funding . Even to visit our prisons . It takes time . Most missions do n't get allocation for assistance . No funds are allocated . We have to have more realistic figures to be able to improve the image of the country . We are handicapped . The envelopes
