Have I ever mentioned how bad he is at replying to phone calls ? Or the fact that his appointment book is usually full up to 2 months in advance ? So maybe I 'm making excuses , I know but I really , really , really want to avoid him at all costs . It 's not that I dislike him , once you get used to him he 's actually really nice , but I prefer communicating with him as little as possible because it acts as a reminder that there 's something wrong . <p> At the beginning of this all , I 'd be at the neuro ( Dr B and not Dr G that I 'm seeing now ) almost every two months because things just were n't right . Eventually , after a year , Dr B decided to hand me over to Dr G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after playing with a new type of medication , we finally got it right . Visits became once every three months , then six and on my last visit in March he declared that he saw no point in me seeing me more than once a year . You can just imagine how happy I was to hear this because it meant that three years down the line , we eventually managed to get things right . <p> Just the thought of telling him that things are n't as rosy as we thought they were us sending shivers down my spine . It was hopefully a once off thing yet my brain is still in overdrive . Is he going to order more tests ? What if he decides that we should do the brain biopsy that he mentioned all those moons ago ? Is he going to up the meds ? Would he think it 's better to try something completely new to see how I respond ? <p> That being said , all the bloggers have insisted that I call the neuro to see what he has to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a gun to my head to force me to do it but it certainly felt like that ) , I called his rooms this morning . In fact , I called five times before the receptionist answered . Did I mention how my heart went into overdrive each time the phone started ringing ? My hand is still trembling at the moment as well . See how bad I am when it comes to calling him ? <p> So , What did I get out of the phone call ? Well , I found out that the neuro is away on some conference thing for two weeks and I got myself an appointment for 7 December ... <h> 4 responses to The call <p> I 'm very strange because 99% of the time I will expect the worst , which means that 99% of the time things are better than expected ... You 're right though , I ca n't just expect bad news all the time . Fingers crossed <p> Aaargh , how frustrating after you plucked up the courage to call . But at least you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully they wo n't and this was just a once-off ) , you have an appointment coming up . <p> Frustrated is a bit of an understatement , I always seem to have such bad timing . Now I just wait and see if he calls when he gets back . If he does n't return the call , I 'll just

Another set herself on fire because her brothers would not let her marry , preferring that she remain their servant at home . Yet another told her mother before she died that her husband beat her daily . <p> Testimony gathered by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission documents how life for many Afghan women remains so bleak that some choose a horrific and painful death instead . <p> The group interviewed about 800 Afghans whose sisters , daughters and daughters-in-law have killed themselves by self-immolation to escape domestic abuse , forced marriage and other misogynistic social customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street marching against this vial ideology ? hichefheidi , if you are going to accuse me of doing something , I suggest that you back up the accusation . " Note that the women are killing themselves to get away from conservative men . " <p> Authoritarian and conservative are not the same thing . <p> They only care about protesting for their own personal rights and entitlements -- and getting their liberal cronies voted into office . <p> Ahh ! Because the Bush administration already have enough protest to deal with . The Bush administration was suppose to change Afghanistan remember . One more failed policy for Bush and company . References : <p> There are plenty of groups ( including NOW , BTW ) who have active programs trying to help women like this . <p> And not not are " liberal . " But none of them are sponsored by the so-called " religious right .

References : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are n't you doing something about it ? Or are you condoning it ? I do n't get it . Perhaps if you stopped attacking american women 's rights , some time could be freed up to deal with some real issues , no ? <p> EDIT : UNIVERSAL you , not YOU you . Unless of course , you are also one of these right wingers who attack people 's rights . If you are pro choice and fight for the cause , I stand corrected . But I have a pretty good idea that my accusation DOES apply to you . Let me know . Are you pro choice or anti choice ? Do you support the abuses in Gitmo ? How about the PATRIOT act ? And on and on ... BTW , since you like proof so much , can you give me some regarding the LIBERAL mafia ? I 'll be waiting ...

That is their agenda References : <p> Are you against women having the vote or something .

##3596652 <h> 7 myths about HIV/AIDS <p> It 's been about 30 years by which acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus are covered by many myths . In many places , HIV infected people are tabooed from the society because of these myths . Let 's take a look at the top 7 of these myths . <p> HIV <p> HIV/AIDS will lead to death of the patient <p> This is the biggest among all the myths regarding HIV . Many people have a serious misconception that once they are diagnosed with the disease , they will die . This is not true . Medical science today has advanced to a greater level . Proper treatment and medications have made it possible for the HIV+ people to live longer and happier . <p> HIV/AIDS can spread by coming in contact with the infected person <p> Many people think that HIV spreads by touch , sweat , tears or saliva which fortunately is not true . Research shows that HIV does not spread by breathing same air with an infected person , touching the same objects touched by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hugging , sharing the same food . HIV only gets contaminated by infected semen , blood or vaginal fluid . <p> HIV can be transmitted through mosquito <p> Many people think that since HIV can be transmitted through infected blood , mosquito can be a carrier of it . This is not true . Researches in areas with HIV cases and mosquitoes show that no cases were there caused by mosquito bite , mosquitoes do not transmit blood when they sting a person . Besides , the HIV virus does not stay long in a mosquito . <p> HIV/AIDS is a curable disease <p> This is a high misconception and has led to much medical fraud . Many people are there who have claimed to be cured from STDs . However , although medications are there for further prevention of the disease , still no cure is there for HIV/AIDS . People are advised to be aware of medical frauds and stay away from clinics or therapists who claim to cure HIV . <p> HIV/AIDS patients can not have children <p> This myth is found mainly among the women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV/AIDS , they have no chance of carrying a child . These women however are suffering from false misconception . Although they need to take certain steps and precautions , still , they can live a perfect family life with their own children . <p> There is no difference between HIV and AIDS <p> One of the biggest misconceptions which unfortunately like all other myths is wrong . AIDS is a collection of illnesses related to sexually transmitted diseases , whereas HIV is the name of a virus transmitted mainly through unprotected sexual contacts and responsible for causing STDs . It is very important to know the difference between the two in order to understand both of them . <p> If a person is receiving treatment , it is impossible for him to spread the virus <p> As spoken before , HIV can not be permanently cured . When a person is receiving treatments , it reduces the amount of virus but does not eliminate it . So there is a greater chance of 
##3596850 <p> And so it begins -- this year 's battering , bruising round of international Autumn tests lurched into action with a thrilling opening weekend . There were resounding victories for England and the All Blacks , while Wales and Australia found themselves chastened at the hands of their opponents . BlogSpotRugby takes a look at the action . <p> Scotland 22 New Zealand 51 <p> Whatever conclusions are drawn from this opening weekend , one remains indisputable -- the crown of international rugby remains firmly in the unshakeable grasp of the All Blacks . Scotland faced an uphill struggle on home turf , as New Zealand , unbeaten since 2011 , arrived eager to secure their 18 th consecutive test win . And nobody looked hungrier for victory than iconic fly half Dan Carter . <p> Iconic , but not flawless . The first try of the match came courtesy of the Scots after a short Carter pass was intercepted by the home side , allowing Dutch-born winger Tim Visser to breeze over the line . Unphased , the All Blacks came back with a volley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . <p> The fly half powered through the Scottish defence with masterful footwork to set up Israel Dagg for his side 's opening try . A beautifully judged crossfield kick gifted Julian Savea with his second try of the match in the final half hour , while an outstanding combination of steps and dummies saw him put Ben Smith over for the final try of the game . A flawless conversion record was merely the icing on the proverbial cake . <p> Scotland simply could n't shut down the surging power of this New Zealand side . As one newspaper put it , ' offering Carter and the All Black midfield extra room is the rugby equivalent of giving Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid a few extra sticks of dynamite ' . It was an explosive performance from the world champions , to which this plucky Scotland side could offer no answers . <p> England 54 Fiji 12 <p> The All Blacks were n't the only side to give their rivals an uncharitably hard beating -- England were at it as well . They welcomed their Fijian opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-try defeat upon the visitors . <p> The hosts creaked into a slow start , rarely venturing into the Fijian half in the game 's opening stages and seeing mercurial scrum half Danny Care sin binned for a high tackle . Toby Flood drew the first blood with a successful penalty kick on the quarter hour mark , before Care rejoined his teammates to pick up the tempo . <p> Wingers Ugo Monye and Charlie Sharples ran in England 's first tries , Sharples shining in particular as he dragged himself over the line despite being weighed down by Fijian defenders . Smart hands from fullback Alex Goode and captain Chris Robshaw then set up Tom Johnson for five points , Flood adding the extras . <p> A flash of brilliance followed from Nikola Matawalu , in a move which saw the Fijian scrumhalf chip and chase , kick forward and dive over for his side 's first points . England 's powerhouse Manu Tuilagi wanted in on the action in the second half , bulldozing over for two tries of his own , with Fiji grasping a second consolation try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an enjoyable performance with uncharacteristic flair on display from this young England side , but there 's no doubt that they face far stiffer competition in the next few weeks.Fiji are a second tier side and lacked some of their most talismanic players , many of whom are tied up in domestic French leagues . They also had just days to pull their team together , while England prepared in comfort over a full fortnight . Moreover , the Fijian kicking game suffers from the lack of an international standard fly half , with one journalist claiming Metuisela Talebula kicked with ' all the power of an arthritic , geriatric donkey ' ' . <p> Manager Stuart Lancaster can be encouraged by the energy shown by his emerging side , but will be conscious of the mightier foes his team now face . The Wallabies and the All Blacks will prove far harder to vanquish . <p> Wales 12 Argentina 26 <p> For the Welsh , the glory of their remarkable Six Nations Grand Slam earlier this year now seems a distant memory , as they found themselves outclassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a lacklustre performance , the Welsh failed to cross the whitewash and relied entirely upon fullback Leigh Halfpenny to kick all 12 of their points . Meanwhile Argentina looked hungry for points , with successful penalty kicks from Felipe Contepomi , drop goals from Nicolas Sanchez and two tries courtesy of wingers Gonzalo Camacho and Juan Imhoff . <p> The hosts were also hurt by having to withdraw two of their strongest players within the first half . Gigantic centre Jamie Roberts was felled by a gruesome head collision which left him concussed while lock Alun Wyn Jones was also forced to come off before half time . This in a period when Wales are also feeling the absence of Six Nations stars Adam Jones , Dan Lydiate , Jonathan Davies and Ryan Jones . <p> Interim head coach Rob Howley gave credit to a much-improved Argentina side for their classy performance , which marked Wales ' fourth defeat in a row . <p> " When you play Argentina , tempo , pace and intensity are important but there is no doubt their experience and exposure to the Rugby Championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " They played the All Blacks , South Africa and Australia over a six-week period and they have certainly learned from that and we were exposed to it today and we very much came second . " <p> Ireland 12 South Africa 16 <p> It was a day to forget for the Irish too . Clad unusually in black , Ireland followed their Welsh counterparts in mustering just 12 points , all penalties kicked byLeinster 's Jonathan Sexton . South Africa were hardly playing champagne rugby either , scrum half Ruan Pienaar scoring the only try of the game in what was a grinding eighty minutes of sparkle-free toil . <p> Drawing up the team list can hardly have been much fun forIreland 's coaching team , who were selecting from a dramatically reduced pool of players in a squad crippled by injuries . The Irish had to make do without talismanic centre Brian O'Driscoll , with former Lions Captain Paul O'Connell also sidelined with a back injury . European player of the year Rob Kearney was also absent , while Ulster forwards Rory Best and Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springboks were also out -- Bryan Habana , Frans Steyn and Juan Smith among the biggest names to be hit by injury . <p> A forlorn final O'Gara kick over the South African defence in the dying seconds , ostensibly a last ditch attempt to set up a match-winning try , trickled straight into Springbok hands to bring the game to a miserable close . As one journalist put it , ' a game of go-slow no-flow ended with a clunk ' . <p> France 33 Australia 6 <p> It was the Europeans who came out on top in the battle between France and Australia , with an imperious and utterly dominant performance from les Bleus . The French were looking to wreak revenge after suffering a 59-16 humiliation last time they faced the Wallabies in Paris back in 2010 . <p> A mere two penalty kicks from fullback Mike Harris kept Australia from the embarrassment of a blank score card , as the French ran riot at their home ground . There was a try apiece for Clermont winger Wesley Fofana and towering eight man Louis Picamoles , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . <p> Frederic Michalak ensured fly half rival Francois Trinh-Duc was kept well in the shadows by putting in a fine kicking performance and notching up fifteen points . The Montpellier substitute had to settle for just six minutes on the pitch at the end of the match . <p> A fine day for Michalak and his team , a nightmarish one for their Australian visitors , who were left licking their wounds and looking 
##3596852 <p> And so to the final . After months of big hits , blazing tries and highly watchable games , the final of the Super 15 rugby season is finally upon us . After a weekend of fantastic rugby , it 's the Chiefs and the Sharks who go through to fight it out for the title . We take a look at the two semi-finals which got them there . <p> First up , it was the Canterbury Crusaders and the Waikato Chiefs who took to the pitch to fight it out for a place in the final . With eleven and twelve victories under their respective belts over the course of the season , both sides could boast equally impressive performances over the season . The Crusaders came into the match with an impressive history behind them -- they were champions in five of the ten Super 12 competitions and have reached at least the semi-finals of every single Super 14/15 competition in history . Their opposition , meanwhile , have nowhere near as impressive a record , their only Super Rugby highlights being a semi-final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nevertheless , it was New Zealand Champions the Chiefs who drew first blood in the semi-final . Fly-half Aaron Cruden kicked the first points with a penalty in the second minute , establishing a lead which his side clung to for the entirety of the match . Talismanic Dan Carter put two penalties through for the Crusaders but the Chiefs managed the first try of the match , the mighty Sona Taumalolo going over for five points . Not to be outdone , Liam Messam also crossed the line seven minutes later to push his side into an eleven point lead at 17-6 . The Crusaders propelled themselves back into the game though , a late try in the first half from centre Ryan Crotty ensuring the match remained anyone 's for the taking . <p> Another penalty from Carter after half-time saw the Chiefs ' lead slimmed to just three points at 17 -14 , as the fly half pushed his total for the season over the 100 mark in the process . Both number tens exchanged penalties to leave the score at a tantalising 20-17 with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock , the Chiefs conceded a penalty and looked to have spoiled their chances of victory as Carter lined up for the kick . But the 45m distance proved too much for the All Black , whose effort could n't make it over the posts . That was the Crusaders ' last chance to draw level , as the Chiefs held steady until full time to secure a place in what will be just their second final in Super Rugby history . <p> Saturday 's semi-final proved equally tense , as the Sharks clinched a well-deserved victory over the Stormers to make it through . The Sharks certainly had something to prove , after they got knocked out resoundingly of the play-offs last year by fellow semi-finalists the Crusaders . Their opposition were also looking to improve on the 2011 competition , having been beaten soundly by the Crusaders in last year 's semis . It was all about the kicking for the first quarter of the match , as a penalty and a drop goal from Sharks fly-half Frederic Michalak put his side in the lead 6-3 after ninenteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludik , with Michalak adding the extras to push the Sharks into a more convincing lead . Grant took the pressure off slightly with another penalty just before half time to keep his side in the match at 13-6 . <p> After a further exchange of penalties in the beginning of the second half , a second Sharks try strengthened their lead as Springbok JP Pietersen dodged his way over the line for five points , Michalak adding the conversion . Undeterred , the Stormers went over for their first try in the 67th minute , when Gio Aplon finished off an impressive move with style to bring his team back into the game at 23-16 after the conversion . Another penalty from Grant then moved them to within four points of the Sharks with seven minutes to go . But it was to be the Sharks ' night of glory , as Michalak 's second drop goal of the match pushed them into a seven point lead , which they duly maintained to secure their place in the final . <p> After the match , Sharks captain Keegan Daniel paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies on the line and it was tough coming to Newlands having spent last week in Australia . But the boys showed resilience . The front row and the tight five really put their hands up . " <p> The Sharks will play the Chiefs in the Super Rugby 2012 Final on 4 August at

##3843152 <h> Newsroom/Press Releases/ <h> Simelane : The next step <p> The DA will this week ask the Justice Portfolio Committee to set time aside to discuss changes we have previously proposed to the Constitution 's Presidential appointment mechanism for the National Director of Public Prosecutions , as well as amendments to the NPA Act . The Constitutional Court 's confirmation of the Supreme Court of Appeal 's order of invalidity of the appointment of Adv . Menzi Simelane lends impetus if not outright urgency to our proposal . <p> It was the " means employed " by the President to make the appointment that the Constitutional Court found irrational . A new process is necessary to prevent a President again taking the view that the choice of a National Director of Public Prosecutions is his subjective choice . ( " I am the person , as the President of the Republic " , President Zuma told the Supreme Court of Appeal in ringing , almost royal terms , " to be satisfied that the person is fit and proper " . ) <p> By contrast , then-President Kgalema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would follow his caretaker Presidency and the sacking of NDPP Vusi Pikoli ) expressed the view in 2008 that a body like the Judicial Service Commission should conduct a transparent process and recommend the NDPP to the President for appointment . <p> Like then-President Mothlanthe , the DA believes that a transparent process conducted by a body beyond the Presidency is called for . We believe that a multi-party committee of Parliament should select the NDPP in the same way that Chapter Nine bodies are selected , with the President performing only the formal act of appointment . It was the proposal also of former Justice Minister Enver Surty ( who served under then-President Mothlanthe ) that Parliament should look at its role ; while all the MPs who served on the multi-party ad hoc committee that confirmed the dismissal of Vusi Pikoli ( by majority ) took the view that it is an anomaly that Parliament plays no role in appointing the NDPP , but has the final say in his or her removal . <p> The DA has been arguing for such change in the National Assembly since 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guidance given by both the SCA and the ConCourt to the effect that fitness and propriety must be measured against jurisdictional facts capable of objective ascertainment indicate that section 9 of the NPA Act should be expanded beyond the bald statement of appropriate qualification and fitness and propriety . Amendments to both the Constitution and the Act should ideally emanate from that committee , under Rule 260 in the case of Constitutional amendment and by leave of the National Assembly to expand the scope of NPA Act amendments currently being drafted by the Justice Department . <p> We hope that President Zuma will not proceed overhastily and contemplate the permanent appointment of the Acting NDPP , Adv . Nomgcobo Jiba . Earlier this year she reversed the restructuring that had been the subject of a running battle between the DA and Adv . Simelane , and she unequivocally reinstated the heads of the specialist units , including the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit ( SCCU ) .
